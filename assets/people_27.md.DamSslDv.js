Nicely written, but plot was too pat, altogether too predictable. Neither Patty nor her friends and family seemed real to me. I can certainly empathize with Patty, being childless myself, but this novel was much too simplistic. Berg can usually nail a feeling or sentiment exactly, what happened this time?"},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I have been a great Elizabeth Berg fan for a long time. Her novels have the ability to reduce me to tears with their wisdom, and I look with much eagerness for each new one. But this one was a terrible disappointment. How many times has this story been done already? Dozens. A 36 year old single woman, whose biological clock is running, wise cracks her way through bad dates and life while wasting her time being in love with a gorgeous gay man. The first three pages contained the beautifully wise writing of a Berg novel, but it was downhill from there. This novel made me wonder if Berg wrote it solely for a quick dollar."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"A stellar follow up to the mediocre &quot;What we Keep&quot;! How many of us out there can relate to Patty's predicament--the perpetual runner-up to life? Elizabeth Berg speaks so well what many of us have experienced, her books are always a joy to read!"},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I LOVE E. Berg, however, in this novel I thought the story was a little dragged a little and the ending was rushed. it was as if she realized this story needs to end. though Funny at times I just wished all the action didn't happen at the few last chapters."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"_Until the Real Thing Comes Along_ is a very fascinating book. The subject matter is one that I think many single women in the earlier thirties or even later has \\"entertained\\" at one time or another. I know that the subject matter really piqued my interested, as it relates to things that I had hoped to have one day - a family and a husband. At like the title implies, the main character felt that she had to compensate somehow until, you know, \\"the real thing did come along.\\"The main character, Patty, desperately wants a baby. However, she doesn't have a husband and the biological clock is ticking. She is a great character, and I loved reading about her as she developed throughout the novel. She was humorous, she had feelings, and she had problems with her family, her friends, her work, and her love life of course. She has this best friend, Ethan, who happens to be a gay man. He seemed pretty secure to me in the fact he was gay. Knowing many gay men, who too also seemed to be secure in their homosexuality, it seemed peculiar to me that Ethan went along with Patty's plan. Perhaps there are more gay men out there like Ethan that I am completely unaware of. I think this was my major hang-up with the book, which prevented me from completely enjoying it altogether.On the whole, for an enjoyable read, and as something you will get through in the matter of a few days, I found this book to be quite satisfying and also interesting and fun too. To be entertained by a book, and to be satisfied is all that I ask, and this book accomplished both tasks. For it to draw out emotions in me, or to make me \\"think\\" about life, I would have to say it failed. But it was still not a waste by any means."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"Patty is in love with a gay man and wants a child -- dilemmas one might not be able to relate to, but such is Elizabeth Berg's magic that she draws readers into this particular story as strongly as if it were reality. She makes the difficult and complex choices of Patty and the object of her affection, Ethan, seem natural -- the initial decision to conceive a baby, then a move to Minneapolis where Ethan feels he might better simulate heterosexuality, Patty's everyday irritation with the tumults of pregnancy, and finally, welcoming a child against the backdrop of Patty's mother's recent diagnosis of Alzheimer's. One life is ushered in as another is slowly but surely escorted out; the smooth ebb and flow of being continues, and Berg, as always, renders every moment lyric and wonderful."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"This book was highly enjoyable. I picked this one up on the bookstore shelf, took it home and read it in one evening. It was a wonderful read and I'm eager to buy more of Berg's books."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"Stupid Patty. Thinks in cliches. *Feels* in cliches. So wrapped up in herself and her fixation with babies and Ethan that she can't see what's going on around her, let alone try to make something of her life.I really enjoyed _Joy School_ and _Talk Before Sleep_, and that made this book even more disappointing. Don't waste time reading this book. Don't even borrow it from the library."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I have read four other books by this author. While this title treats some very serious topics in a light hearted manner, I still found many chances to soul-search and laugh simultaneously."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"Once I tried to read TALK BEFORE SLEEP and could not enjoy it. Recently I tried Berg again, this book, and thought her &quot;voice&quot; was so wonderful. I KNEW this character from the inside out. It was like having a good friend chatting me up. After this read, I went back and read a couple of her others, particularly JOY SCHOOL, and found that Berg is excellent with her &quot;voice.&quot; Maybe I'll try TALK BEFORE SLEEP again."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"This was a great book both light and enchanting. Not Berg's best, if you compare this with her other works; nonetheless well written and highly entertaining.

I rooted for her all the way through the story...she felt like a sister. Elizabeth Berg possesses an unequaled talent for bringing the reader into the lives of her characters.

This book is an absolute treasure!"},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I must defend this delightful book. If you are a fan of Berg's clever writing style, you won't be disappointed. The story is light, quick and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I enjoyed all of the characters and the story line. This page turner was exactly what I was looking for: something light, fun and easy to read. Patty, the 30 something central character would be a psychologists dream---why was she in love with the gay guy that could only love her in a limited way? It was a compelling story line and simply fun. I cannot wait to read other books by this talented author."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"A story about taking charge of your life and going after the things you want. It's not about success in a career or &quot;making it big.&quot; It's the story of a woman, Patty Ann Murphy, who longs to have a baby--has longed for it since early childhood. But she's had trouble finding the right man to be her husband. She wants to do it the &quot;right&quot; way: have a child with her husband, the love of her life. She is so close, engaged to her best friend. But the total dream ends when Ethan Allen Gaines announces he's gay.Patty decides to compromise her dream. Convinced that Ethan is the perfect father candidate (if not the perfect husband candidate), she talks him into sleeping with her just one more time. Sure enough--it works and she is on the way to her dream.This is a very poignant tale--emotional for anyone who has longed for a baby. You may not agree with her methods, but you will understand her motivation."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"A usually adore Elizabeth Berg's books - her TALK BEFORE SLEEP and RANGE OF MOTION are on my keeper shelf - so it was with great anticipation that I read UNTIL THE REAL THING COMES ALONG. I found it contrived and in a word - disappointing. That said, I haven't given up on Berg -- quite the contrary -- am looking foward to reading OPEN HOUSE and some of her earlier novels."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"My first Elizabeth Berg novel and I really enjoyed it. I felt that I could really connect with the main characters and thought Bergs developments were great. Its a fun book!"},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"Patty Murphy is a thirty-six year old real estate agent who goes home to an empty apartment and listens to her biological clock tick. Patty wants a husband and a baby, but the problem is she has only loved one man since sixth grade, her best friend Ethan---and he is undeniably gay. UNTIL THE REAL THING COMES ALONG is a funny, yet poignant story of how Patty and Ethan try to have it all, but beyond that, it is an examination of the search for love and true intimacy. Berg has given us a very funny, engaging and compelling novel with characters whose humaity touches the reader. This is a highly enjoyable novel---don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I thought the main character, Patty, wasn't going to draw me in. Her feelings of mediocrity were initially annoying. Suddenly I was sailing through the book, hoping for happiness for her and for Ethan. I felt very satisfied with the entire read. Berg again manages to make me laugh out loud and be touched. She capsulizes little things about life in these hilarious little bundles that I want to copy down straight away and read often. Ethan, for example, on housework: I feel like Sysiphus in an apron. Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"Don't get me wrong-- I've been a fan of Elizabeth Berg's for quite some time now. I bought this one the day it came out-- began reading it right away...and was sorely disappointed. The main character, Patty, is just...blech. Like another reviewer said-- no back bone. She had no respect for herself and decided to have a child with a man who would never love her the way she wanted to be loved. She settled. I can't respect a woman like that-- who will fawn all over a man who will never want to be in a real loving relationship. Patty could have found a great man to love her and make a life with, but instead she kept going after Ethan. Blech..."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. The characters were believable and interesting, and the plot was truly original. Parts of it were like reading my own life story! There was so much to this book--more than expected. This is a great read!"},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I have looked forward to Elizabeth Berg's books and have not been disappointed with her latest. She writes with such clairity, bringing her characters to life. Her observations of daily life and human nature are right on the money. I will remain a loyal fan."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I was travelling and had purchased a People Magazine for the plane trip, just enough for the 1 hour flight. My flight was delayed for six hours so after reading the synopsis in People, stopped in the bookstore to buy, my first Berg novel. I loved it!! It's not too deep, and yes, there are some predicable and unrealistic moments, but that's why I read. If fiction was like life, I wouldn't need to read... I will read Berg again and again."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I was so excited to learn that Elizabeth Berg had a new book out this summer and couldn't wait to get my hands on it, since I have read all her other works of fiction. However, I was truly disappointed in this book. I found Patty Ann, the main character, to be highly immature for a 36-year-old. However, I could identify with her need for wanting a baby. I felt that the road she took to achieving her dream was unrealistic and not in character at all with Berg's past fabulous female creations. For a woman who did not seem to make enough real estate sales to support herself for even a month, I wondered throughout the novel how she was financially taking care of herself, and if she had given thought as to how she was going to take care of an infant, with the never ending demands an infant makes. I also felt it extremely difficult to believe that once Patty reached her destination, that this too was simply implausable. Please, if you are just starting out reading Elizabeth Berg's wonderful novels, do not start with this one or you may not discover her wonderful way of weaving the threads of relationships between women and their families. Ms. Berg is truly a gem of a writer, but this particular book is not a star in her crown."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I haunt libraries and book stores for new arrivals and imagine my reaction when I spotted my favorite author's new book, just last night. Elizabeth Berg never disappoints me and I stopped what I was currently reading to start this fantastic book. Read it in one sitting, slowly, today, what a day. She is the only author guaranteed to make me cry. Always. I love this book, have read all of Ms. Berg's books and this is one of the best. The angelic touch at the end was beautiful. Glad I bought it, I can add it to my other Berg first additions that I share with friends who don't know what to read and don't have time to be disappointed. &quot;Pull of the Moon&quot; and &quot;What We Keep&quot; are my other Berg favorites. Unfortunately, now I have to wait for her next!"},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I agree with the other reviewer that said the dialogue was not realistic. I too found myself thinking the same thing, who talks like this? I listened to this on audiobook and the reader made it even worse. She makes Patty sound really stupid (she is, but the reader made it worse) I really couldn't wait for it to be over and I hope I forget it soon."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"The idea of this book is good, but alot of it was very unrealistic. I think if this were a real situation there would have been alot more emotion and not tied up so quickly at the end. These characters just did not act like someone in this situation should act. Getting pregnant on the first try and just moving on the way the story did just did not seem real to life to me. They also seemed very immature. I just think it could have been alot more emotional and really captured the idea of the book better."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"As my title says...fun. It's a quick read. I enjoyed it, read it in one day. I was hooked. I love Berg's writing. Purely for women. I've read all of hers, Open House was probably my favorite. I'd recommend her."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I was appalled to read such wretched reviews of this book! Without having written a review before, I had to set the record straight and stand up for this book, which I thought to be quite enjoyable. The comment was made that this book was a little out of touch. How could a woman cling on so incessantly to her gay best friend??.... However, just because you've never experienced it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. I think this book is a very relaxing read; it is funny, upfront, and has a flow that prevented me from putting it down.... but until then, take this book for what it's worth - an excellent escape from reality into a world that is crazy and adventurous, yet at the same time, simple and real. Berg's frankness as she delves into the everyday thoughts of women is great comic relief."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"You are 36, single and want a baby more than anything, but you've got no prospects in sight. What's a woman to do? If you're real estate agent Patty Anne Murphy, narrator of Elizabeth Berg's (Talk Before Sleep) latest novel, you beg, plead and somehow convince your gay best friend to play daddy.A tough premise for any writer to pull off, but Berg is up to the challenge. Patty lives in the small town of Crystal Cove, Mass., and remains close to her parents, who seem to have the very life that eludes her: a happy marriage and loving family.Having grown weary of the dating circuit, Patty convinces herself and soulmate Ethan Allen Gaines to give parenthood a shot. Together. After all, Ethan, who has also struck out trying to find a partner, shares Patty's desire to raise a child, even if he doesn't return her feelings for him. Predictably, there's plenty of head-scratching when Patty announces that not only is she pregnant with Ethan's baby but they also plan to move to Minnesota for a fresh start.Described with great humor, Berg's Patty is endearing and real. Though the story of a woman's race against the biological clock has been told many times before, Berg renders her version with subtlety and insight. For example, Patty's unabashedly romantic feelings for a fundamentally uninterested man at first seem outlandish, but in Berg's telling they become a compelling hook. Readers can't help but root for Patty and her unconventional solution."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"Warning for those who haven't read the book: spoilers.I have been a huge fan of Elizabeth Berg's for years, ever since reading her novel &quot;Durable Goods&quot;. She has an incredible ability to turn ordinary people into extraordinary ones through the gorgeous language and imagery she uses. There is no lack of that in &quot;Until the Real Thing Comes Along.&quot; However, I must admit that I was disappointed with this book. I found Patty to be whiny rather than sympathetic. The plot seemed a little too convenient in too many places. How nice that Ethan, Patty's gay true love, eventually decides to get Patty pregnant. How nice that Patty's best friend Elaine and her former lover Mark get married and (almost) begin a family of their own and all three remained close. And how sad that Patty has another worry in her life with her mother getting Alzheimer's disease. All of these things are fine in and of themselves, but there was not explanation for them. They just sort of happened with too little warning to make the story really work, and often seemed almost clich&eacute;d as a result. Now, don't get me wrong. I love Elizabeth Berg's work, and I will anxiously await her next novel (and perhaps reread some of the old ones in the meantime). This was just not her best, and for an author with such a gift for stunning language, that's really disappointing."},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I've not read any of Elizabeth Berg's other books, although I want to - her writing draws you in to the characters, her descriptions and dialogues are excellent. This story was well written, mildly entertaining (I read it all the way through), but unfulfilling.A few chapters into the book, though I still wanted to keep on reading, I wondered if this was the book the latest Madonna movie was based on - girl wants baby, girl has baby by gay best friend, everyone lives happily ever after.This book isn't that story - there's a bit more. Patty's clock may be ticking, but not necessarily for a baby. She thinks it might be for Ethan, but she seems to be searching for some meaning in her life, without knowing where to start. She isn't the only one who is lost, for somehow the message the author was attempting to relay doesn't quite get to the reader.In the beginning, Patty tells of her 'house game.' An unsuccessful real estate agent, she's been playing this game since she was a child. When driving around, she looks at houses, then picks one she pretends is hers. The only rule is that after she picks it, she can't change her mind if something better comes along. She claims she never feels regret. Here is the big clue about Patty, and what she's doing with her life.Patty is so preoccupied with her own lack of a love life, she misses clues her parents scatter around that something is not quite right. She throws away, without even trying him out, the ideal guy for her, fixating on someone she can never have, settling for less than she needs to - but in the end, she's moderately contented.It isn't until the end of the book that the hollowness of Patty Anne Murphy's life comes to light. She has found meaning through her baby - but she's the fifth wheel in a warm dinner in her new home. She claims that's OK - but it sounds a bit like her acceptance of the old game rules for 'house'-- hard to believe. If you really peek closely, you can see hints that she's finding out the real thing she was waiting for wasn't the unattainable guy, nor necessarily the lovely new addition to her life - but is perhaps her acceptance of just being herself.There seems to be a chapter missing towards the end; readers have to struggle harder than Patty to find some clues. Somehow the connection between writer and reader doesn't quite make it (as other reviewers of this book seem to agree).It wasn't until I read the interview with Berg after the end of the story that I understood some of her deeper intents for the book. The book was OK - but in my pleasure reading I want something better to come along!"},{"Title":"Until the Real Thing Comes Along:","review":"I am a huge Berg fan, but this book did not cut it with me. The main character, Patty, is approaching mid-life and desperately wants a child. Ethan was her first love and continues to be \\"the love of her life.\\" He also loves Patty dearly, so what is the problem? Ethan is gay and his love for Patty is that of a cherised, long-time friend; they feel comfortable together. Patty asks Ethan to impregnate her so they can raise a child but, of course, marriage is out of the question. We are not talking in-vitro fertilization here or anything that might be plausible, but a pregnancy developed by a good old-fashioned \\"romp in the hay\\"...or in the case, the bed! Patty gets her wish, she has a baby girl. In the end, Ethan also gets his wish, he finds \\"the love of his life\\" in another man. As for the baby, well, we can only hope everything worked out well for her, too, but we will never know because that is where the story ended.The problem with the book has nothing to do with sexual orientation but the fact the plot and events were just too inconceivably far-fetched. For the past 20 years, two of my very best friends (men) have been in a committed gay relationship. They are literary scholars and avid readers. When I ran the scenario of this book by them to see what their reaction would be, they thought either the book was nuts, I was nuts for reading it...or possibly both. On top of that, the book has a juvenile writing style that makes one wonder where Berg's thought process was when she wrote it. Like Picasso, she must have been going through her \\"blue period!\\" Ms. Berg, you missed the mark on this one."},{"Title":"Teenagers: An American History","review":"The story of how the unique culture of teenagers came to rise in the 20th century. Teenagers, the most gossiped-about, the most storied, envied, disliked, discriminated against, and misunderstood group of all modern western humans, finally have a book of their own that is sympathetic to their cause. (Although I doubt few will ever read it.) Palladino cites the social injustices teens face, reminds us how short a time the word \\"teenager\\" has been in our cultural lexicon, and studies the way teens have thought, spoken, acted, and influenced popular society throughout time. This is an unexpectedly scholarly yet interesting book that takes the time to go out on a limb and side with the rebellious youth among us, and also to speculate on how the teen years are changing and how they might ultimately be in the near future. I liked Teenagers: An American History well enough to buy a copy after I'd finished the one I happened to get from the local library."},{"Title":"Teenagers: An American History","review":"I am teaching a course on the history of youth this semester. I read Palladino's entertaining book when considering adopting it for my course. In the end, I passed on the book because of some sloppy research in the first chapter. For example, Palladino begins her book by telling the story of Alfred Fondler (age 23) a man who slapped \\"a teenage girl\\" at a movie theater. Palladino uses this narrative to stake out major themes of her book: the changing cultural meaning of \\"teenager\\" and youth culture and resistance. Yet, the facts are fudged in her opening anecdote. The woman in question who was slapped--Margaret Schultz--was 24 years old, a year older than her assailant. The newspaper articles that describe Schultz as a \\"girl\\" do so because adult women were often infantalized. Violence against Schultz, moreover, was sanctioned not because Schultz was young but because she was female.Because a casual fact checking of Palladino's first footnote reveal this kind of error, I worried about what a more careful analysis would find. In the end, I used a series of articles.I hope a second edition of this book will have more careful fact checking because this text has a lot of promise and will be a valuable resource for students."},{"Title":"From Every People and Nation: A Biblical Theology of Race (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"I praise God for Hayes' work! As an African American Pastor it is difficult to adequately express how breath taking I found Hayes' book. From Every People and Nation is a work that speaks powerfully and eloquently on what I judge to be the most important ecclesiastical issue of our generation! Is that an overstatemenet? I would argue that to have that reaction is to prove that it isn't. The evangelical Church on American soil will never amaze anyone and will hardly rise to the level of a city set on a hill, unless it confronts its racism on both sides of the black white divide.From Every People and Nation is todate the finest work I've encountered on the subject. It is well written, evincing compelling exegesis of the relevant biblical texts and moves along redemptive historical lines. The conclusions Hayes draws are sober, sane, and sagacious. From Every People and Nation will long stand as in invaluable resource to any preacher, missionary, or Christian worker struggling for ways to formulate a thoughtful, relevant, theology of race in the postmodern era. It is a shot in the arm and invaluable suppliment to the many woefully inadequate biblical anthropologies and ecclesiologies of our day.Oh, how I wish that this book would come to enjoy a wide circulation. It should be required reading in every seminary and bible college in the country!"},{"Title":"From Every People and Nation: A Biblical Theology of Race (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"This book will make you think. It may make some people angry, but when reading it, it is worth asking yourself if it is disturbing because the author is challenging the message of the bible, or challenging the way you have always understood what the bible says about race.Some people may not like it because they want the bible to be racist.Hays writes from personal expeirence of race issues, and has carefully researched the biblical corpus on this topic.The New Studies in Biblical Theology series, edited by Don Carson, contains many terrific books, of which this is one of the most interesting that I have read, though I eagerly await the opportunity to delve into more of them.At the tiem of writing there are 21 in the series, including several beauties from fair dinkum Aussie authors.Another book that complements this one is Yamauchi's Africa and the Bible."},{"Title":"From Every People and Nation: A Biblical Theology of Race (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"Hay's From Every People and Nation is a great introductory text on race and ethnicity in the Bible. His exposition on the Genesis chapters are great, useful, and relevant for today.However in reading through it, I realized that Hays' focus is a quite limited in that he seems to be working from a primarily an American point of view, more specifically regarding racial tensions between Blacks and Whites. Many of his chapters thus focus on the Black African race in the Bible e.g. Cushites, Ethiopians, Nigerians. But soon it left me wondering if there's more to a \\"theology of race\\" than a biblical commentary on Blacks-Whites history in America.That racial tension is very important; I don't want to downplay that. But there's much more to racial theology than blacks or whites.How about theological implications for...Latinos? or Asians? How about the Sudanese civil war? Or ethnocentrism? Ethnic issues to stage a book on a theology of race extend far beyond black/whites. Starting with a base of more global concerns would seem to be a better (by better, I mean broader) context to talk about race as they are as much players in global Christianity today and in the future as Whites or Blacks.Sure, covering these issues might have ranged beyond a foundational text on race, or at least the author's intention on it... I just think it's limiting to read a book on theology of race being primarily focused on Black-White tensions.An appropriate subtitle should have been \\"A biblical theology of American racial tensions\\". And for a reader interested in racial tensions and issues that affect the Global Church and not just the American church (because race is not just our concern), this book was less than satisfying."},{"Title":"From Every People and Nation: A Biblical Theology of Race (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"This is a book about race and racism in the Church, particularly the American Church. Hayes finds that churches in the USA are racist and finds it a problem that churches are so segregated. I agree this should trouble us. I pastor a church in Georgia and we have no black people who attend our church. I once preached a sermon stating that all races will be worshiping together around God's throne and was, to my suprise, rebuked by a man (one who considers himself a Christian) who said that we do not want to get this race stuff started and that he did not want his white grand daughters marrying or dating any black guys who might come to the church.The author primarily focuses on the black race and shows how they are mentioned and have a part in Biblical history. This study focuses on three words that we need so see as black people and they are Ethopians, Nubians, and Cushites. Hays clearly shows Cushites having a role in Scripture that is not often recognized. The point of this work is to show that a blended church that worships together should be our goal, because this is the worship of God's future."},{"Title":"From Every People and Nation: A Biblical Theology of Race (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"Finally, someone has written a book that is unbiased about race. As Hays points out, as a white person, its not uncommon to hear the belief that there is not a race problem. Ask a black person that same question and he will say there is a problem. Well, if one side says there isn't a problem and the other side says there is a problem...then there is a problem in fact. Hay presents a clear biblical, archeological, and historical proof of blacks role in the Bible--which is bigger than some want to know which is sad. This is a must read for all people, black or white (or any other color). This book will encourage you and help you to move past seeing people's colors and to start seeing them as God sees them."},{"Title":"Pistolwhip Presents: Mephisto and the Empty Box","review":"It's been several years since I last read this one-shot by Jason Hall, but I feel compelled to say something since there are no other reviews. \\"Mephisto...\\" is the story of a man who loses his wife to slight-of-hand magic, and spends his life trying to find her again. I don't want to say too much because I really don't want to give away anything: the surprises (though maybe it's actually predictable, and I'm just not that astute of a reader) are part of its depressing charm.There are zero words in this comic, therefore the art must tell the whole story, and it does--brilliantly, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Picture Me with My Grandma","review":"My daughter is 19mos and this book has been her #1 favorite for many months.

The house that the body was found in had been rented by James Humphreys, and the police, naturally, assume that the body is that of Humphreys; except that when Humphreys' wife turns up, she categorically denies that the body is that of her husband's. So if the body isn't James Humphreys', what was the dead man doing in the house that Humphreys rented? And why was he wearing Humphreys' clothes? And when the autopsy shows that the dead man was murdered in the house (the cellar actually), and then left there, Coroner Martha Gunn discovers the this particular case has captured her interest in a way that few others have. And she cannot help but want to be part of the investigation. And so, even though she shouldn't, Martha finds herself taking a hand in the investigation...I had high expectations of &quot;River Deep,&quot; unfortunately, my hopes were not met. The plot was a very intriguing one, unfortunately the pacing was really off -- the flow was uneven and the story unfolded in fits and starts. And there was a scarcity of clues and suspects (red herrings or otherwise) -- this really frustrated me! Also halfway through the book, the novel's heroine, Martha Gunn, seems to have figured out what was going on before the police. Now how she was able to do this really stumped me -- perhaps I'm not as intelligent as I think I am! -- but I began to feel really sympathetic towards the blundering in the dark police officers. The other thing that frustrated me was that the authour had tagged on a small stalking subplot to the novel. This was NOT resolved at all, and Martha, the victim of this stalking simply shrugs it off!! I must be the only person to have found this development baffling and disturbing since neither the authour nor her editors were too worried about this. Ultimately however it was the poor and uneven pacing together with the scarcity of clues and suspects that made this a 2 star read for me."},{"Title":"River Deep (A & B Crime)","review":"River Deep is a simmering mystery, set in a seemingly peaceful town in England. But a terrible murder has committed, of a man who cannot be positively identified - and with another man gone missing. A female coroner must question her instincts concerning the death, before more crime is unleashed upon the defenseless village in this tense page-turner."},{"Title":"River Deep (A & B Crime)","review":"I also thought this book started off well with a corpse discovered in a flooded cottage in the hitherto peaceful town of Shrewsbury. Coroner Martha Gunn is notified and the whole process of the Coroner's Inquest begins. As the author points out the Coroner is to make a determination as to the identity of the deceased and by what manner they died. While she can order forensic examination of the body she is not part of the police. Some Coroners have taken public stands on certain issues they think are important, but Martha has not done so in the past. (The Inquest on Princess Diana's death is one where a Coroner gained some notoriety in the exercise of his power.)Martha is a physician rather than a lawyer, but her ten year deceased spouse was a lawyer so she can always remember something he said or they discussed when she needs to bring in some legal knowledge not supplied by the investigating police officer. She also has two children, twins, and a Scandinavian au pair to help with the child care while she performs her official and unofficial duties.I was really going along ok with the story. The author introduces some plot strands that were obviously not going to be resolved in the current book: mysterious phone calls to Martha's residence, etc., and an odd sort of antique dealer who has opened up shop in Shrewsbury just in time to get flooded. Her refusal to take the stalking incidents to the police is frustrating to say the least.I started to get impatient as I figured the heart of the mystery out much faster than Martha did. When she decided to disguise herself with heavier than usual make up, sun glasses and flashy clothes and go poking around like a private detective I nearly gave up. At this point the action slowed down and nearly ground to a halt.However, I soldiered on to the end. The conclusion was what I expected after the first 3rd of the book. The whole book wasn't horribly written, but it also had quite a few things that made it a mediocre read.I should note I listened to it rather than read it. It's available on Audible. The narrator is Patricia Gallimore who has a dreadful time with voicing children. She reads them consistently (and I mean as in every child in every book I have listened to her narrate) in a voice that sounds whiny and what I can only describe as pinched. Luckily she is better with adults although not one of my favorites by any mean. The unabridged version is 9 1/2 hours long.First in the series, followed bySlip Knot."},{"Title":"River Deep (A & B Crime)","review":"First Line: Nature is a free spirit.The River Severn is in full flood, and sections of the ancient city of Shrewsbury-- home of the venerable fictional sleuth Brother Cadfael-- are cut off from the rest of the world. When the rising waters flood the basement of a riverside cottage causing a corpse to be discovered, Coroner Martha Gunn is among the first to be called to the scene.When the post mortem proves that Gunn was correct in thinking the man's death was a homicide, the next hurdle is identifying him-- which proves much trickier than anyone anticipated.Widow Martha Gunn often feels like an outsider when faced with the bond her twins, Sam and Sukey, share. As coroner, her hours can fluctuate, so she has a Swedish au pair to help her keep their home and routines running smoothly.Coroners are not supposed to investigate a case, but this one is so baffling that Martha can't help but do some very surreptitious sleuthing. I liked watching Martha uncover information and then subtly work the police and the pathologist to look at the case from a different perspective in order for them to stumble over the clues, too.Masters packs strength after strength into this book. From the atmospheric city of Shrewsbury battling a raging river, to a plot that twists and turns around a dead man's identity, to a strong-willed main character. The only flaw that bothered me was the fact that Martha Gunn is the Empress of All Characters-- all the rest paled into insignificance around her-- with the amusing exception of her daughter Sukey and Agnetha the Swedish au pair who had an obsession with the rock group ABBA.After such a strong start to a series, I'm looking forward to reading more of Martha Gunn's investigations."},{"Title":"River Deep (A & B Crime)","review":"I began this book with high hopes: the cover blurb sounded interesting, the premise of a female coroner-investigator was intriguing, and the book didn't seem to have been a \\"best-seller\\" anywhere (the words \\"best-seller\\" being a tip-off to mainstream blandness and predictability). Plus, I was really in the market for a good, new voice on the British police-procedural scene. I've read all the books by my current faves, so until they start writing faster, I'm always on the lookout for fresh meat. Thus I was primed to like Priscilla Masters.Alas. My first Priscilla Masters novel will probably be my last. I heard alarm bells on the opening page, when the narrator seemed to like one ponderous, trite line so well (\\"You cannot tame nature\\") that she followed it almost immediately with another (\\"You cannot contain nature\\"). But I tried not to listen to the alarms because, as I said, I wanted to find a compelling new writer, and besides, it's not fair to dismiss a story based on a couple of cliches. So I pressed on, keeping up my optimism even while picking a few more nits (such as a police surgeon in her 50s being described as \\"elderly\\").By the middle of the book, though, I had reluctantly given up hope. If style is not Masters' strength, neither is plot. This one is as leaky, debris-filled, and over-the-top as the flooding river Severn with which the novel opens. I was willing to accept (sort of) that the cops would let the coroner muscle into their investigations the way our heroine Martha does, since what do I know from coroners? Maybe they *do* call up senior detectives and offer suggestions on how to investigate a major case. Maybe they *do* carry on their own undercover operations without telling anyone or without worrying whether their actions might eventually compromise a trial. For all I know, the cops might even allow the coroner to watch them interrogate suspects, the way they do here.But would the cops really let the coroner *conduct* the interrogations of major suspects in a case where guilt (let alone conviction) is by no means assured -- and where the cops haven't even had a chance to investigate the coroner's seemingly off-the-wall murder theory? Wouldn't a defense attorney go to town over this sort of irregularity?Well, maybe the legal system works this way in Shrewsbury. And even if it doesn't, no one ever said that a detective novel had to be totally factually accurate to be good. But it does have to be psychologically accurate to be good, and this book isn't. Like a previous Amazon reviewer, I was baffled by Martha's non-response to being stalked (she has only a few fleeting moments of concern, despite living alone with her two pre-teens in a significantly isolated house). And as for the solution to the murders. . .I suppose it's possible that people might think and act in this way, but before I can be convinced, I need a lot more psychological exploration of character than this book provides (or at least more of the authorial legerdemain that allows a writer to pull off an implausible premise.) Paging Patricia Highsmith. . ."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A teenager named Alex, the main character and narrator of A Clockwork Orange, tells a story that reveals his brutal and vicious lifestyle. The theme that dominates the story is one of good and evil, a question of personal freedom and morality. How Burgess attempts to convey to the reader the book's messages is truly creative and unique.The imaginative feature of Burgess's writing technique in A Clockwork Orange is the use of an inventive and seemingly futuristic language. The reader may find that this language, some of whose words seem to have Russian roots, may be overwhelming and overused. The \\"slang\\" can be difficult to understand, which makes reading the work annoying and rather slow. Of course, one could read the book with the aid of some sort of dictionary, but that would just be completely ridiculous and should not have to be done to get the most from a novel. This language takes away some essence from the book in that it disengages the reader from it. Somewhat blank thoughts and empty feelings may dominate the reader's mind after reading foreign, that is, incomprehensive, phrases. The novel would be truly excellent if the language didn't impede the reading experience; it can be difficult to become truly involved in Alex's tale if his unique speech wasn't used so often. It is simply used too much.At the same time, however, the language can be a highlight of the book. The slang makes it seem as if a teenager really is telling the story. Eventually, the reader will probably be able to translate some of the terms, such as goloss (bellow). The flow of the book, however, may suffer at times because its unique tongue is used more often than expected.A Clockwork Orange can be compared to some gang-related, futuristic, or corruption-oriented novels. One title that comes to mind is Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451. Both tales involve futuristic circumstances and possibilities, corruption in the government and lifestyle of that society's citizens, morality, and quest for personal reform. Another title that can be compared to Burgess's novel is Trainspotting, by Irvine Welsh. Both Burgess and Welsh, in their novels, depict the lifestyles of the youth in terms of drugs and hopelessness of the future.I recommend this book to those readers who can withstand the acts that Alex and his \\"droogs\\" commit. They participate in rape, murder, drugs, and violence. I also suggest that readers who want something innovative, creative, and imaginative should go out and read this book. It is a challenging and thought-provoking book - a great read for those who believe they could comprehend and adapt to its funny language, since the story line is excellent."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A coming of age novel about a boy with no moral center. I found the main character's weakness for music a bit unplausible, as was his 'rehabilitation', which seems to me to be discordant with the whole Pavlovian conditioning concept. Today, the shock value the book provides feels more like someone yelling guttural slurs rather than singing in a twisted melody, like Portishead, as I'm sure it seemed in the early '60 (please excuse the imprecise and very subjective simile). Lastly, the really cool lexicon used by the main characters also seems too academically rendered, since slang usually evolves to decrease syllables and increase ease of speaking, while the language here was a bit laborious, you viddy?All in all, these are minor annoyances. The story offers a piercing glimpse into our own psyches, where we push down many taboo impulses in hopes of maintaining civility around us. The character ends the novel (in the non-american version) not necessarily learning anything (in my opinion) but realizing how tiring it is to be rebellious. Now that is a realistic."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This was a purchase for my son and he was delighted with service and quality of product."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I was at the book fair when I bought this book.

They seem to put it in the same category as 1984 and brave new world and books like that. Fro me this book was closer to The catcher in the ryre or lor dof the flies than it was to those books. I actually dont see this as a political novel at all so much as a novel about youth and growing older and how adults will want to change you when your a teenager. Thats what it was about to me. Aside from that, this book has alot of symbolism i think the entire novel could also be seen as a metaphor for how christian missionaries used to convert indians to christianity and then send them back to theyre country,changed forever. It is a very good, provocative read.

Nadsat, live on! Real horrorshow and savage!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Although I agree that this work is certainly deserving of the term \\"enduring\\", having read the re-published \\"British\\" edition I feel that it falls short of deserving the categorization of \\"masterpiece\\". In the introduction, Burgess himself claims that he is unhappy with the fact that Clockwork is his best-known work and insists that the original \\"American\\" and Kubrick movie versions were incomplete. Those versions end with the 20th chapter, instead of the 21st that the British and most other editions were published with. To not risk giving out spoilers, I will simply say that personally, I disagree with Burgess and feel that the book would have been more of a masterpiece if all versions ended with the 20th chapter.The dialect that the narrator uses is at first hard to understand. Thankfully, I quickly got used to it, but the first few chapters were rough and I honestly think the book would have been just as good if Burgess had used proper English and not the made-up slang he actually used. Also, it was admittedly a bit difficult to read through the extreme amount of violence written into the story, although of course the novel would not have had the same impact without that. In the end, although I think this book raises interesting questions and was a great story, because of the aforementioned things I simply can't rate it at more than 3 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Criticising control of rebellious youth.The novel looks at one young man in particular, leader of a violent gang, and what he does, and what is done to him by a rather fascist government to rein him in.Also would seem to be about the usual fears of the old people of the powerless in general youth of the time, in whatever time.Unfortunately, a little dull to go along with that, an comes across as contrived at times."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I know it's incredibly popular and I have a handful of friends who loved this book.

After the first several pages laden with unintelligible, invented slang, the novel contains enough English to be understandable, but the writing style remains unengaging and flecked with that neologic nonsense. The English language can be precise and beautiful, as proven by authors ranging from Edgar Allan Poe to William F. Buckley Jr; however, Anthony Burgess chooses to masscre it. Alright, I'm a purist, but, diction aside, the story still does nothing to engross the reader--at least not the reader pythia. Not wanting to reveal too much to those who do want to read this (fine, try it, but don't expect the thought-provoking masterpiece this novel is often reckoned!), I will simply say that the narrator/protagonist is a kid with a penchant for gang violence and classical music. Tasteless. Oh, in case you're wondering, no, I am not the type of person who prefers warm, fuzzy, feel-good novels. Currently, my two favorite novels are Orwell's 1984 and Levin's This Perfect Day--would you believe that this drossy Clockwork Orange is sometimes catagorized with these? It doesn't belong there.

Beating helpless people, raping women, and drinking some kind of spiked milk should not be something that is glamorized, but it should be something hidden with the rest of the works such as this trash. If a woman is raped and purposefully hurt now in a work of literature, it is seen as some kind of foul scene, but here, because the youths in the book seem to have no sense of right and wrong it is seen as alright.

The 21st chapter also adds a hint of self-worth to the book that the original left out.

Most of the horror out there is just a mix of gore and violence - but A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is something else. The horror I found in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is the subtle, disturbing thought that humans can be programmed to the point where all free will is lost.

The issue of free will has been a intriguing issue since Christianity--Jesus wants to have you love him out of choice and the ability to choose makes one human. So, Burgess presents this question in a colorful futuristic scenario. Although this is a confrontational topic, Burgess does an excellent job of presenting this issue, developing both sides of the argument without bias.Break-down:\\"The pro-free will argument\\":The ability to make decisions and feel emotions and development of abstract thoughts is what defines the human race from our sans-opposable thumb cousins...you guessed it, the monkey and ape classification. Once you remove these characteristics from our catalog, we fail to be humans. Burgess presents this side of the dispute by showing the vulnerability of Alex while under the institutionalized processing. Furthermore, he goes back to his family, only to be turned away. It is nearly impossible to sympathize with this still impressionable teenager.\\"The pro-processing argument\\":Burgess does not directly show the implications of this argument, but he tactfully subconsciously places vivid memories to exaggerate the violence induced chaos of Alex and his gang. We would not have such specific and painful accounts of the attacks of Alex and his gang if Burgess were trying to weigh the issue. We get every gory detail of rapes and fights; we also experience their lack of remorse and moral vacancy.Finally,Because Burgess puts Alex back in his original state avoids the stereotypical \\"clean ending\\"."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This novel is well known, owing mostly to Kubrick's masterwork with the same title that is a filmic translation from it. What is less identifiable through the movie is that these young men speak using a lot of Russian words, intermingled in the English ones, and written using an unorthodox spelling that, however, allows the English-speaking reader to read them correctly without knowing their real pronunciation. This technique creates a strange form of slang that was the subject of articles, books and also a dictionary. It envisions an (impossible) context in which a hooligan can be well educated. I think that this is the feature that mostly distinguishes this very interesting novel. Not all the readers can, however, understands all the ins and outs of it."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"this, perhaps, is the best voice in english literature. its vernacular is truly astounding and wonderfully crafted. never have i read a book with such pleasure. the rhythm and pace mr. burgess developed is flawless. the language simply glides and bounces and itties and tolchocks and...i have issues with it philosophically. and there seem to be some contradicions in ole tony's notion of freewill. and the last chapter included in this edition (it wasn't included in the original publication in the u.s.) is atrocious. it is completely unwarranted and unjustified. it's out of the blue, it's out of left field, it's, it's... it almost ruined the book for me. but, ah, his language, brothers, real horrorshow indeed, lays to rest any qualms i might have had with the infamous chapter 21. our humble narrator is our finest and never has a story been better told. read this book!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Despite the nadsat language, I felt this novel flowed from beginning to end. This tale of violence, tragedy, and atonement is a true right of passage novel. Told through the eyes of a teenanger it is both humerous and gut-wrentchingly honest. Very similar to catcher in the rye, you find the central character endearing, despite his violent tendencies. It is refreshing to read true literature again after some of the modern day garbage I have been exposed to recently. I'll read this again and again. I can't wait to see the movie."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange is a book that is sure to draw interest and suck the reader in within the first chapter. The main character, Alex is a very intriguing character, he's a propper boy by day and a violent madman by night. It's perfect for readers who are looking for a little bit of a challenge, with most of the script in the Nadsat (teenage) language. This book will have you guessing what extreme thing will happen next, it's good to the very last page."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange is a very entertaining novel. At first I found it very difficult to read through the first few pages, but, well- I can't read slang or pronounce Russian. I managed pushing myself to read harder and capture every piece of information presented through the novel. I can't really tell you to much because that will ruin the story but, their is a good and a bad for everything and A Clock work Orange though difficult to comprehend and understand is a brilliant read for everybody. The main character in this novel is Alex who is a young trouble making delinquent who like to commit crimes and breaks rules well because his gang doesn't have any. His gang friends are also known as droogs. He really enjoys his life, which is: raping woman, robbing innocent victims, and brutally assaulting an individual. This is normal gang behavior. But one day every thing had gone wrong and caved in on him. While robbing an old lady Alex had murdered her, his friend's fled the seen leaving Alex to take all of the blame. At the age of sixteen Alex is sent to prison and he stayed there for many years to come until he gets a second chance, an opportunity to do right. The government is giving him the opportunity to involve himself in a program-one in which he can only do well because the thought of doing evil will make him suicidal. Anthony Burgess has written a classic novel of good and evil in the prologue an authors not one might say. Burgess gives the reader input on his book and how he feels about it and his additional ending which was removed from the American version- Chapter 21. He also mentions something about 21 being the age it takes one to mature and the number of words he chose to end the book with. Supposedly this is not Anthony Burgess's best novel and it was written in a much earlier time in his life when he hadn't quite matured but it is without a doubt the one book that everybody will remember because of its originality and unique concept. There is also because they based a movie on this book-Cheater."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Using an immensely innovative way with words Anthony Burgess writes a stunning novella of grit of shock and brutal truth's. \\"A Clockwork orange,\\" working from a point in the future of \\"ultraviolence,\\" portrays the life of a modern day gangster in all his glories. Following him through the streets, ilstening to his street slang, it makes a world truly unlike our own. Developing a new culture, a new language, and unimaginable violence.Told by \\"your humble narrator,\\" a boy named Alex with a quick eye for victim's and a smooth mouth for covering, it's honestly fascinating. The book is highlited by scenes dripping with blood. The entire read is just a trip because of the heinous crimes. The innovative happenings in this book are nothing short of terrible, either. Without going overboard, the author captures fear and disgust and loathing, using the spit fire mouth of Alex and the reactions of the people around him.The middle of the book throws you for a loop, digressing into the death's he's caused and the way the government plans on helping him to redeem himself. It's so farfetched that you can't help but being enthrolled with it.In the end, the book is serene, and you realize that he's come to a point of being an adult. In a way it's heartbreaking to realize that he's become one of the ones around him. THe one's he used to pick on and beat near to death. But it's all a circle, one that Alex may or may not realize."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I have to admit, I had a hard time starting this book, mostly because of the Nadsat words. It seemed like every other sentence contained a word that I didn't for the life of me know, so I would be flipping back and forth between the book and the glossary of Nadsat words that a friend was kind enough to send me, making an attempt to figure out the translations.Once I got past that, though, reading A Clockwork Orange was a piece of cake. Written by novelist Anthony Burgess, A clockwork Orange tells the story of Alex deLarge, a young delinquent who, in the company of his three friends, gets his kicks by assaulting, robbing, and raping anyone that crosses his path, and who enjoys getting wasted at the Korova Milk Bar, an establishment in the boys' neighborhood.Things go wrong, however, when one of their victims is killed in the course of an assault. Panicking, Alex's \\"droogs\\" flee the scene, leaving Alex to face the music all by himself. Convicted of the charges against him, Alex faces a rather lengthy prison sentence until he is offered the chance to participate in an experimental aversion therapy program which strips him of any ability to enjoy the things he did before.Thrown out by his mum and dad, being chased by hordes of his victims, and very nearly beaten to a pulp by two of his former droogs, Alex seeks shelter at a house that belongs to one of his victims, but the old man doesn't recognize who Alex is until Alex starts humming an old refrain from his delinquent days while talking a bath. When the old man finally catches on, he begins to harass Alex with a piece of music that was once a favorite, but that Alex can't listen to anymore without getting sick. Tormented by the old man, Alex jumps out the window of the guest bedroom in a vain effort to end it all.When he recovers consciousness, Alex finds himself in a hospital bed, with his parents looking worriedly at him. After a tearful reunion with them, Alex is next visited by a doctor who advises Alex that the aversion program has been shut down, and that he can bring Alex back to something approximating his \\"old self\\". It is an offer which Alex happily accepts.One of the things I liked about this book is the fact that this particular release was published with the 21st chapter which, for reasons unknown, was previously left out of the original US release and was never portrayed in the movie. This chapter chronicles a visit between Alex and one of his droogs, and it provides a rather nice ending to the story because Alex suddenly realizes he's no longer the delinquent he used to be, thanks to his own conscious decision to abandon his former life. I don't have a clue why the original US edition was missing this final chapter, but it does wrap up the story very well.All in all, A Clockwork Orange is a very good book, once you get past the polyglot mixture of Nadsat Russian and various made-up words that are a staple of Alex and his droogs. Read on!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"'A Clockwork Orange' deserves its place right up there at the top of dystopian fiction, a superb and thought-provoking piece that is amply cynical about government, media, the police and the prison service while remaining pleasingly sceptical of the alternatives (the damning indictment of the opposition towards the end), but without getting overly preachy, usually operating by suggestion rather than overt political statement. More broadly it sets up the philosophical dilemma over free will and its moral ramifications, coming down on the side of liberty but thoughtfully maintaining that no solution is perfect. For me the ending (not in the original) is a tad odd and seems to be an attempt at justifying Alex's choices, rather unsuccessfully. The book is more nihilistic where no solution works - Alex returning to his original state is endlessly depressing, for instance, however much we may have opposed the state's action against him.The really brilliant thing about Clockwork Orange, however, is the language use. Not only is the language of nadsat an inventive device which is deployed brilliantly, but the whole style of prose is searing, incredibly original and frequently humorous. The book has the capability to be vivid, shocking and simultaneously worryingly amusing in its attitude. Overall, combined with the power of its nihilistic force, it makes a huge impression on the reader."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I'd like to start off by saying I throughly enjoyed this novel. Anthony Burgess's masterpiece of a novel is deeply intriguing, insightful, and enlightening on matters of free will and human rights. Through the first person view and acts of violence on behalf of the central character, Alex, we gain insights into the moral issues of what the persuit of happiness can begin to mean; at what point does your pursuit of happiness begin to violate somone elses rights as a human? And at what point does somone have the right to tell you that you cannot act a certain way?"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange is a brilliant novel written by a British author by the name of Anthony Burgess in 1962. The main character Alex narrates the book that is divided into three parts with seven chapters each. This book takes place in the future of Alex's hometown during the beginning and the end... There is a lot of crime in this futuristic world and not very much law...You may find that while you are reading this book there is a lot of vocabulary you've never seen or heard of before. If you try to look these words up you will never find them in a dictionary. This is because Burgess made up most of the language in this novel. Some books are equipped with a handy glossary in the back. Mine did not have one. It is hard to understand at first but after a while you get used to it. The new vocabulary is based on the Russian language. It really offers a feeling of being in the future and knowing what it feels like to be there since it seems that you are reading the lingo of the future. You should try not to use the glossary because it fun to figure it out on your own."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I found Anthony Burgess's book to be very strange. The complex Russian slang (Nasdat) that was used in the book was very annoying at some parts but was also a very interesting technique used by the author to keep you very interested and locked in to what you are reading. Alex, the main character, and his droog friends were wreaking havoc during the night, also drinking milk that was spiked with hallucinogenic drugs. Eventually the cops caught up with the boy and he was the focus in an experimental punishment used by the government. He was sat down and forced to watch many horrible things in history. The hope was that after seeing all this horror, Alex would be so incredibly sickened that his crime days would be put to an end and he would be a much better citizen. Burgess really keeps you interested through out the entire book with some very clever language.There is an extremely high level of violence used through out the book. In my mind the violence is used for an extremely important reason. The way Burgess pounds the violence in to you, describing every detail, you begin to get a great idea of what this book exactly means. All of his ideas and points in the story are bashed into you when you hear about these nasty minor things that many other authors would leave out. The more you read, the more intrigued you are to find out why these boys could do such sick and disgusting things and just what punishment will be laid on them if any punishment will. All in all I was extremely pleased with what I got out of A Clockwork Orange. I would highly recommend the book to anyone with an interest in sci-fi."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Honestly, I have to say this before I begin my review. I wish people would STOP COMPLAINING about the Nadsat. I mean, I read this book as a junior in high school and a page into it I understood it completely.Anyway, after venting, here I go. Burgess is a genius and this book is definetly on my list of everything I must read twenty times before I die. Alex and his desire to destroy and corrupt is so perfectly like what every teenager, whether they admit it or not, feels like. The government, which has gone to the ultimate extreme to stop crime, is so real, I could picture the Minister and the Doctors myself.The transformation, which even I must admit, gets a little difficult to believe, is the perfect ending, which the Introduction explains so well, I can't even do justice to it or the book. It's well worth every second you spend on it, and generally I'm not a fan of science ficton.Item: as a photography student I'm obliged to mention the brilliant movie by Kubrick-- one of the gods of directing. It ends without the 21st, but it is so nearly as amazing as the book itself."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange is one of those books that forces you to think about the message that is sending. Much like the character, Alex, we are forced to see things and think of things that we would rather not. Alex starts out as a gangster with no morals. After he is arrested, he becomes the subject of a new government program that's policies asks the reader if morals can be forced upon someone. And if they are forced, is their any point. This story never slows down and is a great quick and very direct reading that will stay with you for a long time."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Anthony Burgess' A Clockwork Orange is a true classic of modern English letters and one of the twentieth century's greatest works. In a nighmarish future society every bit as scary as 1984 (and far more plausible, it now seems), Burgess thrusts us into the world of Alex and his three \\"droogs\\": a world of ultra-violence, shockingly base treachery, and pure sadism. However, as anyone who cares to dig deeper knows, what appears to be a mere feathers-ruffling shocker poses forcefully insightful philosophical questions. The notion of crime and punishment - as well as more practical side issues such as prison overcrowding - has been perenially debated, but what about some of some of Burgess's more troubling points: if we can somehow condition criminals to refrain from violent acts by quite literally depriving them of free will, are we in the right? Do we now have a harmless, perfectly good citizen or a mindless stooge who cannot even defend himself? If we take away a persons's choice, even the choice to do evil, are we left with something less than human? And, even more thought-provoking, is a person who does not do evil only because of being physically unable any better than a person who does do it freely? Burgess tackles these and other issues with sheer abandon, brilliant writing, and truly original vernacular. As ground-breaking as the movie was and is, the book is even better. A must-read."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"If you are a sci-fi fan, love social commentary or think Kubrick's translation of this book was stunning but have never read the book . . . read it.I've never come across anything else like it.

I would like to thank my English professor for having us read this book!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange is the ultimate psychotic mystery. Does society have the right to overpower evil for the sake of good by taking away one's right to choose? The book explores the difficulties of reconciling the conflict between individual freedom and social order.Alex, the story's protagonist is a child of the corrupt totalitarian society. He acts out the evil crimes against society without thought of retribution. Are there limits to which society should go in maintaining law and order? Should society do the wrong thing for the right reason, even though it frequently does the right thing for the wrong reason? The state's attempt to eliminate evil is an assault of the self because goodness is no virtue if it has not been chosen.The fundamental reasoning of the book is that free will defines humanity and represents the curtailment of choices as intrinsically wrong. A Clockwork Orange reprehends behaviorist conditioning for its infringement of free will. The story is a very thought provoking read. It not only addresses issues of good and evil but what is good without evil. One needs to look beyond the sex and violence to grasp the intense meaning of the story."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Wow, this book goes after some truly weighty subjects in a short time frame. Burgess tells the story of his narrator, Alex, who is a clearly intelligent young man who has focused his youthful talents on setting out each night to terrorize the innocent citizens of a futuristic London.The book is famous for Burgess' heavy use of a made-up slang that a committed reader will pick up quickly using context clues. It actually serves to focus your attention on the book rather than as a distraction. Further, Burgess uses the slang to differentiate groups of characters within the book and, in some of the book's most interesting moments, one side of a character from another side within himself. The dichotomies created are very clear without being ham-fisted. Very well done.Burgess really creates a gritty, enveloping sense of place and mood as Alex and his pals meander through the city. As the reader, you simultaneously feel their sense of power (empty though it may be) and the victim's sense of fear and helplessness. Another great exploration of the duality of character within each of us, and yet this is still just a warm up for the main event!The story hits its peak once Alex is sold out by his pals and captured by the police (who aren't really good guys). Alex volunteers/is chosen for a new procedure which will \\"cure\\" him of his evil tendencies. The scenes of brainwashing that follow are wonderfully crafted and this whole segment of the book artfully asks whether it is better to have a choice between good and evil when only a portion of us will choose good, or whether it is better for all of us to be good even at the cost of our free will. It's a tremendous look at freedom vs. authoritarianism in all its forms.As Alex is released back into the world, we see the flip side of his original self, someone incapable of any form of evil. The string of events that follows brings up as many penetrating questions for the reader as any other portion of the book. Alex finishes (if you get a book with the 21st chapter - make sure you do) slightly older, with more perspective on his situation.A book about the two sides (at least) we all have within us and the freedom some of us have and some of us lack to let the two sides out. Highly recommended, you can see why this one has stood the test of time."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"While I enjoyed the story and the point the author makes, the book was rough going because of the nonsensical slang. Although it is an integral part of the tale, it makes it very difficult to read and understand clearly.The commentary provided on the moral and ethical questions regarding punishment and social justice is very insightful, made even more so by the ending which was excluded from the original release here in America and as a corollary Kubrick's film."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Great book written all in the gang-slang of the futuristic day. This book is a classic and a must-read for those who liked the (also excellent) movie. But the book has a lot of neat things missing from the movie and one is able to enjoy more detail of the language Burgess created out of a hodge-podge of disjointed Russian (for the most part.) Like in the movie, you will soon be rooting for young Alex no matter that he is a rapist and murderer. This is part of the genius of the work."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Even though I knew this was supposed to be one of those \\"must be read in your lifetime\\" kind of books, I was always hesitant to pick it up due to the violence I knew lurked between the covers. Not because I feared it, but because I could never quite find the right \\"mood\\" to tolerate it (especially with the newspaper, Kiterunner and such one picks up these days!) However, the book came highly recommended (mostly by men, including the 30-something librarian who I checked it out from: \\"oh, you're going to love it!\\" I don't know how he knew, but he was right). I finally cracked the cover.Lo and behold, what indiscernible argo did I discover on the first page! For such a short book, I told myself, this would be a long read. After two or three pages of the futuristic, Russian-based slang I found that, like reading Shakespeare, the reader adjusts to the rhythm of the language. It did not prevent the story from absorbing me, and I didn't need to know the definition of every word to grasp the meaning.Alex, the charming teenage sociopath narrator, spends the first third of the book inciting nightly acts of \\"ultraviolence\\" with his hooligan friends. In the second part, he is caught, punished, and rehabilitated. In the third, he must deal with the consequences of his violent past, and his present as a man who can no longer defend himself from them. Although written in the 60's, it's hard not picture a 1980's London backdrop complete with the punks and hooligans bringing anarchy in an alternate socialist dystopia.A quick word on the violence. Although the narrator gleefully partakes in some terrible actions, his use of slang to describe it actually keeps it rather slapstick and prevents it from becoming overly graphic (like Fightclub, for instance). What I didn't expect at all was the humor. Some of Alex's observations are riotously funny. I even got a few strange looks while reading in public, either because I laughed too loudly, or reacted to Alex's deepening predicament with an \\"aah!\\"--a pretty good sign that I'm captivated. This says something about the skill of the writer, that he had me empathizing with (if not exactly rooting for) a depraved character who I had no business liking under normal circumstances.The only thing that didn't quite sit with me was the inconsistent (yet original) 21st chapter. Some say this ends the novel on a lighter, more hopeful note. I don't think it needed to. Without giving too much away, what Alex hints at maturing into was, to me, far more terrifying than his old hooligan self. Especially seeing how the other adults in this book, including his parents, have turned out in this fictional future. Give me the other, albeit more sinister, end."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I've been on a little reading binge lately, and I found this book to be quite exilerating.

In any case, they weren't impossible to decipher on my own. The character of Alex was also fascinating because I never found myself disliking him for his inhumane actions better yet nursing a hatred towards him. A Clockwork Orange flowed wonderfully and I had a hard time putting it down. Reflecting back on it, the reader may find that it is indeed, a rather amusing book. I've always admired writers who can make the reader connect with their characters and Burgess is no exception.Cons: The last, original 21st chapter. I'm a bit of a cynic so the negative, evil-will-always-prevail complex is rather appealing and more realistic than the we-will-all-eventually-settle-down complex, oddly enough. I finished the 20th chapter with a satisfied smirk whereas I finished the 21st chapter with furrowed eyebrows and a dissapointed sigh. I felt that Alex's struggle throughout one half of the story was for nothing, and his character itself faded away as the pangs of responsiblity corrupted his rebellious mind."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange, written by Anthony Burgess is a one-of-a-kind fictional novel. It is a story of an ultra-violent gang who roam around doing whatever they please. The structure of the novel has multiple parallels within the text. These parallels can be hard to find, but add to the overall effectiveness of the work. This novel can be seen as a difficult read due to the unique diction that the author chooses. However, this obstacle is easy to overcome after the first few chapters.Throughout the novel, the author replaces everyday words with unique slang. The author chose to create this unique language to accentuate the qualities of the characters in the ultra-violent gang. For example, the author wrote \\"There it was again, all the old ultra-violence and vecks with their gullivers smashed and torn krovvy-dripping ptitsas creeching for mercy\\"(118). This unique language becomes easy to understand within the context. The diction that Anthony Burgess chose is the most creative aspect of the novel.The novel is split into three parts, each containing seven chapters. During the first part, the ultra-violent gang roams around doing as they please. They beat innocent people and break into homes. \\"What is it? Who are you? How dare you enter my house without permission\\"(21). This part of the novel sets the scene and creates the opening drama. During the second part, the government tries to control this violence using bizarre techniques. \\"After every meal... we shall be giving you a shot in the arm. That should help\\"(98). This treatment brainwashes the main character, Alex, which takes away the pleasures in life that he enjoyed. The third part of the novel returns Alex to his old self. He is once again able to enjoy his old passions.A Clockwork Orange is an enjoyable read. The diction that the author chooses is unique in style. The author achieves his overall goal in this well planned novel. He creates many parallels and keeps the reader on their feet. The novel has an overall theme of free will. Anthony Burgess captures this theme by testing the will of the main character, Alex. He is conformed by the State, but eventually returns to his normal self. \\"It was like as though to get better I had had to get worse\\"(174). The novel is exciting and convincing. It is well organized and a great read.The complexities in A Clockwork Orange entice the reader to think outside the box. The unique diction that Burgess uses keeps the reader on their feet. Overall, A Clockwork Orange is a one-of-a-kind fictional novel that should not be left on the bookshelf to collect dust."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange is a science fiction novel that takes place in the near future. The main character, Alex, and his \\"droogs,\\" or friends, go out at night committing crimes. Alex, who is fifteen, knows what he is doing and seems to be enjoying all the wrong doings he does. Most of these acts include violence and rape. Finally after beating and raping a woman police finally arrests Alex. He is given a fourteen year sentence but after killing a cellmate Alex is chosen to be the first candidate for a new test called Ludovico's Technique. This process basically makes Alex not want to commit violent acts. In two years Alex cleans up his act and is released from prison. Now although Alex is technically free person he is unable to do what he wants and basically doesn't have the power to make decisions anymore. Alex then encounters the husband of a victim he had raped and beaten. When this man learns it was Alex who did it to his wife he makes a plan to force Alex to suicide. But will Alex give in?One of the most interesting and unique things that Anthony Burgess does in A Clockwork Orange is that he creates a whole slang vocabulary. At first it can be frustrating on trying to figure out what some of these slang terms mean but after a while you are able to pick up on what these words mean. A Clockwork Orange is often disturbing and really violent. Those aspects of the novel made it hard for me to put down because it made it so interesting to read. The thing that I disliked about this novel was that some parts were hard to read. This caused me to go back and reread the same parts a couple times. This mainly occurred in the beginning of the novel though."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"If you read the subject of this you're bound to be turned off, BUT before you completely cast this book aside look into the inspiration for the story.The dialogue alone makes this book great! find yourself a nadsat glossary online (http://soomka.com/nadsat.html)I think this is a book that just grows on you, and you really need to give it a chance."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book is not an easy book to read, it's use of a futurist slang and vividly descriptions of violence makes it hard going in places.Don't be fooled, however, into thinking that this book is violent for shock value only. Hidden within the richness of the language and violent images there is a deep and hard hitting message in which Burgess tells us that the possession of free will is ultimately more important than what we use it to accomplish.The book is a modern classic and which everyone must read. It may be harrowing and disturbing but it is ultimately rewarding."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Great use of language, social critique, political awareness, stunning presentation, color images, this text has it all.

Viddy well!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Burgess created a brillant rollercoaster classic in A Clockwork Orange. It took me about a month to finish this book, which is longer than i expected. The russian slang is fantastic and adds color to the murky tale of A Clockwork Orange. I had to take breaks because reading this was difficult in more ways than one. Alex isn't one of those reporters on the tv, telling us stories about crime and rape and the corrupt government. He isn't a journalist writing a 4-paragraphed sumary of a recent crime. He lives the crime through his own hands, fists, feet, etc. Alex takes you on the ride that is his life, into the tunnel of his mind and hole of his heart. His antics and frame of mind are both very intruiging and disgusting. I felt somewhat of a softspot for him when his large love for music was ruined due to his role as a guinea pig after jail. Imagine wanting to vomit when witnessing/hearing something you previously absolutely adored and lived for. A Clockwork Orange isn't for everyone. If you are easily offended or closeminded, don't bother because this book will mess with your head somewhat (at least, it did with me). Your Humble Narrator probably wouldn't reccomend it to everyone either."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I thought that the nasdat slang made this book more fun to read.

And it does have some good points, but I just couldn't get into the book. Nor did I think it was absolutely brilliant. It was good, but not to my taste.Alex is in a gang that roams the streets at night, causing mischief and mayhem. They strike terror into those who meet up with them and are capable of causing great violence. But when Alex gets caught his life changes drastically. And after a few years in prison he is offered the chance to go free again, but only if he submits to a new experiment the government wants to try out. Not realizing what he'd be giving up, he goes for it, and discovers what its like to have choice taken away from you.I personally didn't think Alex suffered enough. Actually I think he gets off pretty easy throughout the book. So the message involving Alex and free will and such didn't really get through to me. Although I don't really think I'm for a souped up government for thinking that way. Alex just isn't a compassionate character, its part of his design. And since I would never think like the majority of the characters in this book, I just can't connect to any of them. I can't even muster compassion for the victims because of the way it's written. Alex's friends are second to him so we don't really get to know them too well, aside from being partners in his mayhem.The writing is absolutely off the wall. I was so frustrated within the first few chapters that I almost decided to set it down and leave it alone for awhile. But then I came across a certain word, \\"okno\\" and something clicked in my brain. And I realized that a lot of the \\"slang\\" was actually Russian. And after I discovered that I found reading it a lot easier. There's still unknown slang, but at least I was able to translate some of the words to make for easier reading and wasn't hopelessly lost trying to figure out what on earth the characters were saying. Because not even context helped some of the slang be recognizable. Even so, I wasn't a big fan of the way this book read because of it. I think it enforced too much on the reader if you really wanted to drive a lesson home.And the lessons in this book are unusual. Themes of good vs. bad vs. free will vs. control are predominant. And the author makes you question what is best. But there's also a lot of violence in this book that can be so gruesome and \\"horrorshow\\" that the lessons could be lost while the reader is focused on the horrible things that happen. It's definitely not a book for those who don't like to read about violence, rape, murder, and other various terrible things. Although most of it is only recognizable if you can get past the slang.Not a book for me. I know people love it but apparently it just didn't speak to me. I'm not sure if I'll watch the movie as a result of not really caring for this book. It may have some great themes, but I just couldn't get past the writing.A Clockwork OrangeCopyright 1962192 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2012"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I first read Anthony Burgess's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE at the age of seventeen, several years before Stanley Kubrick's movie made the book famous. I even wrote a book report on it for my English class, though I cannot recall any details. When I started to reread the book recently, I at first put it aside as I had no stomach for reading about sadistic beatings, rape, and murder. However, since it had once made rather a strong impression upon not only me but a large segment of America's youth - I know of men who rave about A CLOCKWORK ORGANGE as the greatest movie ever made - I decided to read on to see if I could thereby visit my younger self. It is an ugly truth that the average man, more so younger men than those over forty, is fascinated and even excited by rape. This is probably even true of women. Ayn Rand's heroines typically drive the men they love into raping them; it is not only men who read and reread those passages. Men are often earnestly attracted to women who sneer at them, to which revenge fantasies are an almost reflexive response. (Whether a man is repulsed by such fantasies or enjoys them surely seems to be a matter of personal disposition rather than choice). Although both men and women, the normal ones anyway, are repulsed by the violence of real rape, the popularity of Burgess's novel rests upon its readers' fascination with fantasy rape. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is little more than a glorification of violent rape.In Burgess's Playboy interview, shortly after Kubrik's movie came out, he stated that his wife had been violently gang-raped and left physically crippled. Apparently this was the event that triggered the writing of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Burgess emphasized that such violence is an act of free will, which is his religious conviction as a Catholic. This was also the conviction of Alex, the narrator of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Alex scoffs as he listens to a media report that tries to blame youthful violence on the deteriorated moral values of the city, saying it would make just as much sense to blame the more prevalent human kindness on the conditions of the city. This is the free will doctrine, that evil is always entirely personal choice completely irrespective of one's culture. This is a very odd idea that is negated by even the simplest consideration of evidence. It is simply an observation that violent cultures produce more people who are prone to violence than nonviolent ones. After breaking into a couple's home, gang-raping a woman and beating her husband half to death, Alex and his droogs indulge in a rampage of destruction because they are full of, like, hate. So Alex presumably believes that he freely chose to be full of hate, and that other people choose to feel love, and it is entirely up to each individual to choose whichever way one likes. This might well be, but being the sort of person who likes to be full of hate is not a free will choice. People who routinely engage in violence because they have been nourished on violence, and not because they are violent by nature, sometimes reform when their empathy for their victims finally wins through. Alex narrates acts of disgusting brutality with such relish that he seems to be evil by nature, a psychopath completely lacking any sense of empathy.As the story goes, Alex is arrested and by a combination of drugs and Pavlovian conditioning, his violent nature is forcibly reformed, so that even daydreaming about rape makes him violently ill. Of course, he has not really reformed because he still wants to be evil. He is still full of the juices of life but has been reduced to an automaton a clockwork orange. The prison chaplain opposes this treatment on the grounds that a person who chooses brutality freely is somehow more moral than a person who wants to be brutal but cannot because his free will has been taken from him. Apparently the movie audiences agreed; when Alex's treatment is reversed and he gets his free will back so he is once again capable of brutal rape, people cheered, and not merely the men. At the very least, if it were possible to artificially condition a human to non-violence, it is certainly just as possible that one could be naturally conditioned to violence by haphazard cultural conditioning.It is certainly grotesque that Burgess's response to an attack on his wife was to write a novel glorifying violence. That was not his intention, though it is hard to ascertain just what his intention was. I get the impression that he wanted to mock the modern tendency to accredit violence to cultural conditioning rather than free will. If this is the case, he does not succeed. At the very least, if it were possible to artificially condition a human to non-violence, it is certainly just as possible that one could be naturally conditioned to violence by haphazard cultural conditioning. The behaviorist school of psychology denies a human has any nature except that which has been conditioned by the interplay of one's genes and the circumstances one's life, hence free will is a mere delusion. However, we can believe in man's capacity for free will and still recognize that few people have developed this capacity to any significant extent. Few people have sufficient insight to question the familial and cultural-conditional that has shaped them. We are even discouraged from such questioning on the grounds that it amounts to disloyalty to our family, religion, and country. An analogy that I sometimes use is that everyone has the capacity to do calculus, but few people develop the actual ability. The difference is that people who do not know how to do calculus know that they cannot do calculus; nearly everyone takes it for granted even hysterically so, as Alex does - that they act according to their own will.The novel is in no way realistic, and that was apparently Burgess's intent. It is replete with the sort of wildly improbable coincidences that were standard in nineteenth century literature. Though this is a convention that I do not appreciate, it is not necessarily a flaw. What is a flaw is that Alex is not a believable character. The last chapter, in which Alex reforms, was omitted from the American version of the book that I read in 1967, as it was from the movie. I gather that Burgess feels that including this chapter in which Alex reforms somehow redeems his novel from being a mere glorification of violence. Alex was fifteen when he went into prison for murder, and he is eighteen when he reforms. Though he does observe that young people are like wind-up toys who behave as they do without thinking, which suggests that he now believes that his violence was conditioned rather than willed, he experiences no epiphany of insight. Alex experiences no remorse, no urge to atone for the pain that he has caused; he simply grows out of his violence and starts carrying pictures of babies around with him. Even if this had happened at the age of fifty it would not be convincing."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I can honestly say that this book is unlike any other I have read. The style of narration told through the eyes of the main character--an invented slang derived as a mix of english and slavic language--keeps the reader's attention on the events of the story. It creates a reaction time effect, wherein the reader will pause for a moment before the shocking reality of the story unfolding finally takes hold. And their is plenty of shock: Burgess spares no detail while dictating the horrible reality of urban violence.Burgess suggests that some are inherently given to violence and innocent in their desire for it. He ponders the subject of choice: is it better to choose evil than be forced into good?--does a man cease to be a man when that choice is taken from him?Overall these questions are compelling and the frankness of the storyline gives the message a powerful effect. But the reader gets the sense that some aspects of violence and adolescence are left wanting something more. Burgess suggests that the innocent inclination to violence fades with age, but why is this characteristic limited to adolescence? Why in adolescence to begin with?\\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is compelling, but much of the plot is left underdeveloped. Interesting and hard to put down, but it's effect, like the violence of adolescence...fades with time."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Anthony Burgess' modern classic A CLOCKWORK ORANGE revolves around a central ethical conundrum: is it better to let a violent criminal continue to be disposed to crime than to remove that which essentially makes him human, his free will?The narrator, a teenager named Alex, is a hoodlum in a near-future where gangs roam the streets and society is decaying. After a string of crimes, Alex is betrayed by his companions and winds up sentenced to over a decade in prison. After two years behind bars, he is given the opportunity to be the subject of a new experimental theraphy, \\"Ludovico's treatment\\", which would have him cured and a free man in a mere two weeks. Alex loses his criminal tendencies, but Burgess asks, \\"At what cost\\"? After this setup, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE goes on to examine what stripping a person of his free will would mean for him and society.A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is also the reaction of a Briton against communist governments, this book was obviously written in the early 1960's. The administration which seeks to tame Alex seems benevolent, but there are signs of growing despotism. In foreboding one passage, a prison official expresses his hope that Alex will leave the prison, as the space will soon be needed for political prisoners. The dialect that Alex's generation speaks, Nadsat, is a mixture of Russian and English words, and shows a Soviet influence on this future England. This makes the book feel somewhat dated, my reason for giving it four stars.A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is written in Alex's dialect, and nearly every sentence has Russian words written as they sound to English ears. However, this is rarely a problem, as Burgess gives sufficient context to quickly understand such common words as \\"glazzies,\\" \\"pletchoes\\", \\"tolchock\\", and \\"devotchka\\". The Russian words are nearly all extremely common anotomical terms, so for those who want to be certain about every word of Nadsat, any small Russian dictionary will do.Stanley Kubrick's 1972 film of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE went on to become popular, buut be aware that the book is a very different story. Kubrick based his film off the original American edition of the book, which lacks the crucial final chapter in which Burgess reveals a suprising plot turn, which reverses much of what came before. Thus, the book and the movie have totally opposite messages. The book is also more graphic than the movie. While the movie has Alex in a tryst with two teenage girls, the original scene from the book has him molest two ten-year olds after shooting heroin. Thus, for those sensitive to explicit content, the book may be more objectionable than the movie, although the book's thick dialect and sparse detail does not have the force of actually seeing such things in a movie.A CLOCKWORK ORANGE may appeal to those intrigued by the moral dilemma it presents. It is also suprisingly entertaining for new students of Russian, as this reviewer found. If you enjoy A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, I'd recommend going on to Burgess' work 1985, in which he examines George Orwell's work 1984 from a viewpoint closer to that year, this book is somewhat of a continuation of several themes of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book is a genuinely unique literary experience. Having read some of Burgess other novels, I can only fathom what sort of talent he must have had to completely step outside his own norm in order to adopt a completely unorthodox presentation; focusing strongly on language, humanism, and plot. His other works, Such As \\"The Doctor Is Sick\\" showcase his style of using alternate spelling of words to make them sound phoenetically like a certain dialect, where he even \\"spelled\\" out lisps in characters who spoke with them, almost as otomotopeia. In \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" this device is altered and taken to an extreme; here the words are all new, all unique derivatives of Russian and English syllables combined to form an intuitive language that the reader comes to understand while moving through the novella.Burgess rationalizes the slang in his introduction of this book, stating that it was meant to make the almost overly-shocking or pornographic nature of it's content seem more acceptable, if that were possible. The slang is very hard to explain and very abstract at first, but once you settle in and get used to Alex's use of it, his words become second nature. That if nothing else is true testament to Burgess' skill in crafting this \\"nasty little shocker.\\"To summarize the plot in a few sentences, The story focuses on Alex, a teenager who lives in the near future where the streets are ravaged at night by violence and deviant teenagers. Alex, the main character of the book, is such a teenager, and routinely commits acts of \\"ultraviolence,\\" including beatings, rapings, burglary, you get the picture. He finally pushes his luck too far and commits an act, and then is incarcerated.This is just the beginning few events in the novella, and I don't want to ruin the experience should you decide to read it.This book brings several issues to the reader's attention in terms of how we percieve our own inalienable rights as humans. One of the most important questions this book asks whether we cease to be human when we are stripped of free choice. I'll go no further than this, though I'm only grazing the surface here. Like I said I don't want to ruin the experience for you.I treasure this book; it is by far one of my favorite three pieces of literature simply because it is daring, psychological, and completely unique in that it teaches a lesson in the most unlikely way imaginable. If you aren't faint of heart, give this one a try, and you may be impressed.And once you get about 3 quarters of the way through the book, ask yourself if you feel sorry for poor old Alex. You may be surprised at yourself...."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This is a simply superb American novel, as disturbing as it is riveting.The novel follows Alex and his troupe of marauding friends as they happily go about murdering, stealing and terrorizing in their superviolent world of the not-too-distant future. Burgess tells the story from Alex's point of view, giving the reader tremendous insight into the sadistic and troubling inner-workings of the \\"protagonist's\\" mind. This choice of narrative point of view has an interesting effect: while the reader can't help but be disturbed by the senseless violence perpetrated by Alex and his posse, readers will find themselves actually caring for and understanding Alex (most of us have at least a little bit of Alex in us).When Alex is finally arrested for his horrible crimes, the government seeks to inflict its own version of violence upon him, trying to reprogram his perversely violent mind into the mind of a peaceful, law-abiding citizen. The moral implications are obvious and troubling: can society violate someone's free will to make them peaceful and good?The novel is perhaps most famous for the futuristic slang language (\\"Nadsat\\") that Burgess interweaves throughout the dialogue. The use of this language may be a bit confusing at the very beginning of the novel, but Burgess eases the reader into it, making it easy to understand quite quickly. Some readers may need to read sections a few times initially to get comfortable with the vocabulary. Despite this smattering of peculiar words, the book reads surprisingly fast.Many people are more familiar with Stanley Kubrick's famous on-screen adaptation of this novel but it is important to note that this edition of the book contains Burgess' original 21st chapter which was omitted from the first US editions and from Kubrick's movie version.All in all, this is a fantastic novel that will present readers with multitude of emotions. At times the book can be horrifying, at other times, heart wrenching, and at other times, downright funny. The novel's plot is certainly strong enough to stand on its own, but what makes the book a classic is its thought-provoking attempt to examine the role of free will and the role of society in promoting good, regardless of the costs."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"That means real good in Nadsat - the vernacular that's based on Russian taken up by the English teens in this futuristic dystopian masterpiece. You must viddy(see) clockworkorange.com for its Nadsat-English dictionary for the first 30 pages so that you can fully comprehend everything that's going on. After that, you're homefree and it's smooth sailing!The use of the language adds another dimension to this ingenious work that is unlike any other book you will ever read. This book is so amazing, I don't want to give anything away. It's Lord of the Flies, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, 1984, and American Psycho all mixed up into one. Anthony Burgess creates an original, intense, and enlightening work that separates itself from the mundane formula-laden novels of today."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This edition of 'A Clockwork Orange' begins with a scathing criticism of the publisher by Burgess that I applaude. In the Author's note, Burgess describes how the original Novella as published in the UK consisted of 21 chapters. When Burgess attempted to publish the book in the US, the publisher felt it was within his providence to omit the 21st chapter, calling it a \\"sell-out\\". He continues to explain that not only did the 21st chapter provide a certain degree of numerical resonance, but that the concluding chapter contained his vision of the book's ultimate lesson. A lesson of change that is completely rendered impotent by the 20th chapter if left alone. Clearly riding on the book's success (and of course the Kubrick film that truly popularized his work - and was based only on the American '20-chapter' version), Anthony Burgess finally laughs loudest at the end of this disagreement. His attack on the publisher (who clearly still has rights to the book and is compelled by money to continue to market it) is so harsh that the publisher feels compelled to place a tiny little \\"Publisher's Note\\" after the \\"Author's Note\\" that basically says \\"I'm sorry\\" in a watered down and spineless way. It's easily the best introduction to a book I have ever experienced.The story's heart is dark and disturbing. Centered around a troubled 15 year old named Alex who narrates the book from the first person, is an account of violence and pleasure. 'A Clockwork Orange' raises serious questions about the anatomy of evil in an extreme depiction of the 'Nature versus Nurture'argument. By default, Burgess compells the reader to question what is the anatomy of good as well - a phrase that doesn't roll off the tounge as easily because it is never used.But the real genius of this novella is the imaginary cockney dialect that Burgess creates to convey his message. It took me three chapters of slow, difficult reading. But by the fourth, I had adapted to the new vocabulary, understood the new language, and could read as smoothly as if I was reading my own words. A subtle and powerful lesson that makes Burgess' point about nurture all that more profound.The violence is what keeps you reading when the language is difficult, the going is slow, and the images are at times nauseating. Why?"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange is a dramatic story tracing the footsteps of a young misguided product of social disaster. From the first page, the reader is overcome by Burgess' unique &quot;Nadsat&quot;, meaning teenager, talk. Once you begin to pick up the new words, the book opens into a cruel yet strangley familiar world. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to ask questions and look for deeper meaning. Yet, this was not a book for the weak hearted, because there is violence."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"There are tired, predictable books, and then there is A Clockwork Orange. In what should have been a sickening foray into the dark underbelly of the surreal crime world, Burgess leads his readers to find the essentiality of choice and the importance of living life for the good and bad. Although many graphic images can have a stomach-turning effect on the reader, the overall motive of the book remains intact through the clever use of language and subtle humor. What is unique to this book is the way in which the reader may choose how he would like it to end by simply ignoring the addendum of the last chapter or reading on. Depending on this choice, the book can mean very different things, and that is a feature not found in many other works. There are books that are worth reading for their social commentary, others for their wit, and still others for their surrealism; A Clockwork Orange is truly all of these and more. It is a must-read for anyone who loves true literature."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"For the most part, there is wildly violent entertainment and then there is remarkably provocative art and seldom do the two overlap. One of those rare occasions is Anthony Burgress&#65533; 1962 transgressive classic, A Clockwork Orange. At first, the tale of Alex, a malicious, young degenerate of the future, seems like a warped, little shocker, full of madcap language, malevolent intentions and stomach-turning violence. As the novel progresses, though, it is soon evident that Mr. Burgess is carefully surveying an important subject matter: juvenile delinquency. Through portrayals of Alex&#65533;s parents, he comments on Dr. Spock-style principles. Through portrayals of the government and prison system, he comments on what type of society produces these baby-faced killers (One as amoral and creative as the delinquents themselves). And through the main character&#65533;s vivid naration he explores the surprisingly human thoughts and motives behind this appalling behavior. Most often when one walks into a theater, turns on the TV or opens a novel and squeems, the said media&#65533;s creators are attempting to vend cheap thrills. But not always. Mr. Burgess&#65533; brilliant and alarming book and the stunning Stanley Kubrick film based upon it are instances when true artists looked the seedier side of human nature in the face and produced poignant works of art from their observations."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Frist of all, if there was ever a book that needed a R rateing this would be it. However, dispite the disturbing amount of voilence, and the at times incomprehesable slang the book is a must read. It's thrilling and creepy veiw of the future leads one to question the morality of punishment and the roll of society to \\"cure\\" our criminals of there nature to kill. In the end the book asks the pressing question, when does the cure become worse then the deises?On the down side, the book uses a strange varity of slang that takes a while to get used too, and at times one wonders if they'll ever get through parts. Never the less, it is still a wonderful adventure into the mind of a psycho who, by the end to the book, is much more sane, then the rest of his society."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange is a genius piece composed by none other than the linguistic mastermind Anthony Burgess. From the beginning to the end of this horrific and, at the same time, humorous tale, Burgess recounts the adolescent happenings of a young nadsat named Alex. Using the first-person, Alex tells his teenage story of being institutionalized, and the accounts that follow his early release. The language in this book is incredible; no other author holds rank with Burgess."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"After reading all of the other reviews, I'll probably sound redundant if I were to write my own. So with that said, all I have to say is that, this is a must read for everyone!!! This has to be the greatest book I've ever read. I have just recently finished this book for the second time. That in itself should tell you how good this book is. On a side note, the movie is also excellent as well."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Picture Nighthawks, the painting by Edward Hopper. Dim the lights. Cobble and dirty the streets. Roughen the clientele, and ascribe raucous thuggery. Such is the ambience of A Clockwork Orange. Exit into the crisp night air with caution; this is not a place for the faint of heart. This is the rough and desolate world of post-modern existentialism.His name is Alex, and he leads a gang of thugs. Dressed in the height of fashion, their minds are filled with drugged drink, solipsism, and \\"ultra-violence\\". Sometimes they are the Nighthawks; sometimes they are those they prey upon them. They are, at minimum, a terror that menaces this hollow society.Anthony Burgess brings together the graphic violence of Quentin Tarantino, the inky ambience of Joseph Conrad, and (bear with me here), the understated and even farcical humor of Damon Runyon. Unlike Tarantino, however, Burgess has thinly veiled the disturbingly violent escapades of Alex and his cohorts under a narrative written in a fictional slang. The slang itself is part of what creates an otherworldly ambience, seasons the text with whimsical humor, and brings the reader into an unsettling relationship with the graphic imposition of suffering which Alex and his gang have embraced as their daily bread-and-butter:~~So that was old Dim's cue and he went grinning and going er er and a a a for this veck's dithering rot, crack crack, first left fistie then right, so that our dear old droog the red - red vino on tap and the same in all places, like it's put out by the same big firm - started to pour and spot the nice clean carpet and the bits of his book that I was still ripping away at, razrez razrez.~~\\"What's it going to be then, eh?\\" is a question which, by my count, appears three times in the text. The question implies that Alex is indeed capable of choice, of becoming more than a victim himself of a habitual cycle of violence. Once at the beginning of the book, once in prison, and once at the end of the book among a new troop of gang member, the question surfaces, as if inviting Alex to value something more than the temporal. It is not until the element of choice is taken from Alex that he begins to change, at first assuming a passing interest in God while in prison, and then after being subjected to a government-imposed scheme to rid prisoners of violence through chemically- and visually-induced brainwashing.Although I struggle with valuing any book so intently focused on violence, I find A Clockwork Orange a quirky piece of brilliance. The humor is subtle but well-placed in revealing Alex's adolescent qualities. Once incarcerated, he wisecracks about being \\"dressed in the height of prison fashion\\" and extols the value of reading the Bible, but mainly the part where the Jews beat each other up, drink plenty of wine, and sleep with each other's wives . . .Yet despite his penchant for violence, it is hard to not humanize Alex. His smirking, if not comedic outlook on life is somewhat contagious, and he is not immune to the full range of human emotion. Once faced with the prospect of a government reform program which would eliminate his power of choice forever, he seems to encounter real fear, a nascent conceptualization of sin, and the prospect, according to the prison chaplain of being \\"beyond the reach of the power of prayer\\". Having come through the program and endured various measures of victimization and reform afterwards, however, he still carries a comforting resemblance to his original, whimsical self. Recovering in a hospital, he asks about his condition in his typical, humorous fashion, \\"But has anyone been doing anything with my gulliver? What I mean is, have they been playing around with inside like my brain?\\"It is unlikely that many readers would naturally identify with Alex. But this is perhaps part of Burgess' brilliance. Despite Alex's immersion in the dregs of life (drugs, crime, violence, gangs, etc.), we begin to value his humanity as manifested in the freedom to make moral choices. Once stripped of this, we begin to see Alex as stripped of an inalienable right, as stripped of his own humanity. Perhaps then, the enduring value of A Clockwork Orange is its affirmation of moral choice as an inextricable component of humanity in us all. To be deprived of choice is to be deprived of being human, even if we remain physically alive."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Anthony Burgess rips open our minds, throws in an entire imaginary universe and sews it back together, leaving the universe with us forever in his style-driven novel, \\"A Clockwork Orange.\\"Burgess weaves the English language with Russian slang to create a fictional teenage dialect for our protagonist, Alex and his gang of \\"droogs.\\" These characters shock us with their extracurricular activities of raping women, beating up bums and exploring hallucinogenic drugs at the age of 15.The crimes catch up to this villain that we want to hate, but can't.

A Clockwork Orange is the story of a fictitious (but not all around improbable) society in which the protagonist, Alex, is a young heathen and criminal. He enjoys wretched activities such as vandalizing, stealing, and raping.Life begins to turn sour for him when the police finally catch him. He is taken to a prison, and chosen to be an experimental guinea pig in a new brainwashing or \\"curing\\" process. Upon finally being considered \\"cured\\" some questions of the ethics of the process arise. Caught in the middle of a heated controversy, Alex, now the victim instead of the benefactor of this society, is left to fend for himself and try to live with his will virtually sucked out of his being. This is where the term \\"a clockwork orange\\" becomes relevant to his life.Overall, the theme the author conveys in this book is rather thought provoking, which I found to be the most enjoyable part of the book. I finished the relatively short novel feeling eager to ruminate on this question of morality. Is it right to making a being safer to society at the expense of his soul? It is a puzzling and unanswerable question that the author well represented in this novel of potential quandary."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Having never saw the movie, I didn't exactly know what to expect from the original book, but I was not disappointed. Suitibly creepy, the world this takes place in is not that implausible. A semi-totalitarian government rules the day, adolescent street gangs rule the night, the cops are recruited from the street gangs, so as redirect their violence into \\"constructive\\" activities, and the prisons are so overflowing with political prisoners that there is barely any room for actual criminals. The central plot centers on a governemnt experiment to eliminate crime through mind control, and leaves the reader asking, \\"Is it better to be evil by one's own choice than to be good without a choice?\\""},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange is the rare book that combines ingenious writing with an important theme, neither being sacrificed to the other. The teenage Alex and his band of \\"droogs\\" or friends roam around a futuristic, dystopian city, beating and robbing people with no remorse. When Alex is imprisoned he is chosen for an experimental procedure that will \\"cure\\" him of his violence, but also of his passion and creativity.I like this book because no one is spared--both authoritarianism and anarchy are skewered. Burgess clearly believes it is a \\"sin\\" to force man to be good, but he does not think man is incapable of being redeemed. In an odd way, this book turns out to show a rather old-fashioned morality.The book is 21 chapters long, but the original American edition left off the last chapter. This edition adds the final chapter, which changes the meaning and lessons of the book RADICALLY. If you have only seen the movie, which is adapted from the original American edition, you have not learned Alex's whole story! I am not sure if I prefer the book with the added chapter or without; you can decide for yourself which is more realistic.Although much of Alex's speech is invented slang, adapted from Russian, we learn the meaning of the words quickly. However, despite the excitement and relative brevity of the book I had to take several breaks in reading, simply because pausing to decipher all the slang words gave me a headache. So don't expect to finish the book all in one sitting even if you are really enraptured by it. Definitely read it, though."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I was pretty excited when I first picked up A Clockwork Orange a little over a month ago; I had heard how this book had changed the way people thought and lived, and now I'd see for myself how this tale of a bleak future could do that. It took some time to adjust to the garbled Russian-English slang called Nadsat, and seeing as the paperback that I purchased didn't have a glossary of the lingo in the back, I spent less time following the story and more time making an effort to translate. After you figure it out, you'll definitely appreciate some of the dialogue.The book follows a young no-good-nik, Alex, and his cohorts. The book begins with Alex and his \`droogs' at a bar, where liquor isn't served, but milk, because the milk is laced with a plentiful variety of opiates and hallucinogens. Alex spends every night having fun, which, for him, means raping wives in front of their husbands, beating the daylights out of old vagabonds on the street, killing random people, and theft. He is morally a disgrace, but I really liked how honest he was as he narrated the story. When he is thrown in the slammer for two years, he learns about an experimental Government program for turning homicidal delinquents, like himself, into reformed, productive members of society. He tries it, since it'll get him out of jail in a fortnight, but he didn't know it involved a forced, VERY long viewing of different films of rape and violence, while being injected with nausea and pain-inducing drugs. The Government, arrogant in it's certainty of success of the experiment, thinks this will change his patterns of thought and that Alex will associate rape and murder with pain and vomiting, rather than thrill and ecstasy. Nonetheless, it seemed to cure him, and he was sent back out into the world, which more or less turned on him, driving Alex to attempted suicide.A Clockwork Orange isn't a light read. The book provokes questions of whether or not a person should go through such a horrific process to become an upstanding citizen, or if he should be able to choose his path in life, being a lowlife or a decent person. Anthony Burgess writes with fantastic intensity, and the reader won't want to put the book down. The language in the book is imaginative and colorful, but I won't spoil it in the review. This is definitely one of the century's great novels, and whether you like it or not, it'll at least give you something to think about for a while."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Anthony Burgess rips open our minds, throws in an entire imaginary universe and sews it back together, leaving the universe with us forever in his style-driven novel, \\"A Clockwork Orange.\\" Burgess weaves the English language with Russian slang to create a fictional teenage dialect for our protagonist, Alex and his gang of \\"droogs.\\" These characters shock us with their extracurricular activities of raping women, beating up bums and exploring hallucinogenic drugs at the age of 15.

I found it disturbing, yet darkly funny, thought-provoking and brilliant. Burgess' use of 'Nadsat' is facinating. Its amazing how well you adapt to the very inventive slang of 'Alex and his Droogs'. The first chapter of the book is full of bizarre words such as droogs, deng, viddy etc. But through the course of the book, you find it easy to get to terms with and can enjoy the book a whole lot more the second time you read it. I urge you to read it, no other book has kept me glued to its pages like 'A Clockwork Orange'. Anthony Burgess has achieved non other than a masterpiece, a classic of our time. 'Viddy Well, all who read it'."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Nearly forty years after it's first publication, Anthony Burgess' controversial novel &quot;A Clockwork Orange &quot; still stamds as a masterpiece. The book concerns Alex, a teenage thug in a futuristic Britain, who is obssessed with &quot;ultra-violence&quot; and Classical music, particularly Beethoven. After he is betrayed by his friends, Alex is arrested and, after prison fails to reform him, he is subjected to a sadistic form of brainwashing to cure him of his violent impulses. The story is written from Alex's point of view and is told in a bizzare form of slang called &quot;nadsat&quot;, an mixture of English and Russian invented by Burgess, this is confusing at first but readable enough once you get used to it. The book's principal theme seems to be the importance of free choice, even if it means some will choose evil. This theme is sometimes stressed to heavily in the book. However that aside, the book is thought-provoking, shocking and sometimes very funny. Definitely reccommended."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book is absolutely fabulous! Simply fantastic. Reading this book, one cannot but be totally embedded in the sadistic mind of Alex, a trouble teen who'd like nothing more than to kick you in the teeth for doing absolutely nothing, like minding your own business on a street corner. But this is anything but a mindless read. On the contrary. After being arrested, Alex is embarked on a Reclamation Program where the Government attempts to brainwash criminials by conditioning them to do good. The story veers into a serious exploration of the morality of free will: is it better to be evil and free; or good and without choice?For the first part of the book though, expect very brutal and gruesome scenes of the crimes committed by Alex's gang (what he terms droogs). These scenes would be very grim to read, if not for the inventiveness of the author who cleverly pens in a self-invented slang known as nadsat. Queer words like viddy (see), slooshy (hear), horrorshow (good, fantastic), metso (place) and veshch (stuff) abound, so much so that the scenes become somewhat alien and bearable. I suppose, nadsat is a really a double-edged sword. Readers may be put off instantly after reading the first 2 pages. I guarantee you that most would come out scratching their heads, comprehending 20% at most. Take heart, push on - you won't regret it. A glossary would come in handy for sure, but that would rob the fun of deciphering the pecularities of the lingo. By the third chapter, the prose becomes much more fluid as readers grow accustomed to Alex's street talk. In fact, nadsat is so fundamental to the book - that's where we find Alex's voice and establish a connection to his character.I would like to say that the book is funny (because it FELT funny) if not for the gravity of the crimes committed and the degree of suffering decked out by our hero's careless actions. In Alex's voice, the wanton acts of violence seem \\"muted\\" - and thus, charming. One is not confronted with the carnage of the his brand of violence because everything is seen from his eyes and in time, you'll empathize with his pitiable state. It is little wonder that 'A Clockwork Orange' remains shrouded in controversy. Nonetheless, this is a superb read, by any standard - short and sweet, morally substantial and totally out of this world. Go and buy this book!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"After reading the many reviews that have been posted here, I'm afraid mine will not be as eloquent, nor will it be a long and detailed description of the book. However, I might be able to express the importance of this book, and perhaps you'll even want to read it when you've finished my review.I may have started out reading A Clockwork Orange because my friend told me how good it was. And then I continued to read it because it was engaging, disturbing, and thought provoking. Even though the book was written over 30 years ago, I believe it is still as powerful today as it was back then; perhaps even more so. Alex, the protagonist, is almost innocently committing violent crimes with his friends; for he isn't -trying- to be bad, he just is. He likes violence, and that's the way he is.When Alex's friends gang up on him and leave him to be arrested by the police, Alex is sentenced to 14 years in prison. But then the opportunity to change presents itself to Alex, and he can't help but take the offer. Without ruining the story as so many previous reviewers have already done, I can say that when everything is said and done, important questions arise: is being good truly good if it is not by choice? Is it good to be bad, if that is what one chooses?The book first came out in the 60s, and the American version lacked the last and 21st chapter from the original story. When it was republished, the book had the 21st chapter. Depending on which copy you read, with the last chapter or without it, the book will have an entirely different feel to it. The old copy represents the horrible realization that bad minds are always bad; the newer version leaves the reader with hope. Hope for Alex, and hope for oneself. Change is possible, the book says, no matter what sort of person you are.A Clockwork Orange is truly a great work, one that will appeal to people for different reasons; and affect them in completely different ways. But it will affect them."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange is the story of good and evil and the value of choice.

Only then does he being to suffer the consequences of his crash and burn lifestyle.A Clockwork Orange is what I believe to be a fabulous novel. It may confuse a reader at the start because of the language, but its not that hard to understand the slang dialect if you have a firm grasp on English and are a few pages into the book. Also, one must be patient when reading it because the main ideas aren't revealed until later in the novel. There is a lot of building up the characters before hand, which is valuable information but may bore those who are already have a distaste for the book's violent nature. I also highly recommend that you read the British version because the last or 21st chapter is quite important.Anyways, the book is more oriented those who can see past the gore and sex and can grasp the main ideas the author is trying to convey through a clockwork orange."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I have tried to write a review of this book at least ten times, but I can never seem to find the right way to describe it. This is mainly because I consider A Clockwork Orange to be one of the most painful, brilliant, and disturbing stories ever to be put down on paper. The invented slang used by Alex and his \\"droogs\\" is one of the best parts of the book. You'd think that the slang would make it confusing to read, but it doesn't! In fact, it's strangely catchy. They call it \\"nadsat\\" and it's a kind of Russified English. And I don't even speak Russian. (Burgess later invented \\"caveman speak\\" in Quest For Fire.)The basic plot follows Alex and his gang of sadistic young punks as they run amok, beating, raping, and murdering with gleeful abandon in the London of the near-future. They then retire to a bar to drink drug-enhanced milk and plot their next crime. Eventually, Alex gets caught and is subjected to the will of the State. He's forcibly deprogrammed with the \\"Ludovico Technique\\" in which he's strapped to a chair, his eyelids held open by metal clamps, and forced to watch a long movie of non-stop murder, rape, torture, and other horrible violence until he gets physically ill at the mere thought of such acts. Then he is thrown back on the streets, a declawed kitten at the mercy of his former victims. The American re-edition is published with the controversial twenty-first chapter not included in Kubrick's film, plus an introduction by the author called \\"A Clockwork Orange Resucked.\\"Unfortunately, it's a sad reflection on society in that Alex was shunned because of his violence, and when caught, had violence inflicted on him in order to make him stop. This extremely graphic novel received mixed reactions, either hailed as genius or dismissed as violent pornography. I would recommend the movie as well; it's visually inventive and a must-see from one of the world's greatest directors."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Fans of Ayn Rand's ATLAS SHRUGGED will no doubt disagree with me here, but _A Clockwork Orange_ may be the most remarkable man-against-the-State story ever published. Anthony Burgess's approach is in one significant sense the opposite of Rand's: where she tried to project a hero (and in my opinion failed; John Galt seems to be little more than a one-dimensional abstraction), Burgess projects a thoroughly depraved teenager and forces us to root for him anyway. It's not every author who can make you watch a bunch of gratuitous sex'n'violence and _then_ conclude that even great moral depravity trumps behavioristic psychology and mechanistic determinism.What \\"protagonist\\" (or Your Humble Narrator, at any rate) Alex does in the first half of the novel will make you ill. But what the State does to him to \\"cure\\" him makes his nadsat gang violence seem almost . . . well, \\"innocent\\" isn't quite the right word, but the fact that I'm even thinking of that word is an indication of Anthony Burgess's power.For Burgess, the important thing is moral choice, and the possibility of choice entails the possibility of evil. Once Alex has been \\"reformed\\" by the very latest techniques of behavioristic science, it's no longer even _possible_ for him to be moral -- and that's somehow more horrible than any of his own horrible acts.But Burgess stops short of making volition an object of idolatry. In the first place, he doesn't make any argument that Alex's actions were somehow \\"good\\" merely because he had _chosen_ them; quite the contrary. In the second place, even though Alex bears the full blame for all his depraved actions, there are hints scattered throughout the book that if he weren't living in a \\"socialist paradise,\\" he just wouldn't have been acting this way in the first place. (For example, both his parents are required by law to work full-time. They also seem curiously unwilling to discipline their son, or even inquire what it is he does when he goes out at night.)I read this book twenty years ago in an edition that had something this one lacked: a glossary. I thought I was going to miss it, but I didn't; Burgess is a fine writer and anticipates his readers' needs very nicely. If the meaning of one of his Russian-import slang terms isn't obvious from context, he works in a definition. (And there are a few glossaries available online anyway.)The earlier edition also lacked something this one has: a twenty-first chapter. I hadn't read this before -- it was left out of the American edition of the book and therefore out of Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation as well -- but to my mind it makes a better ending for the book.Sure, as Burgess himself admits, it's a little crude; we never actually _see_ Alex develop into an adult, we just suddenly learn at the end that he's growing up and becoming ashamed of his past actions. But the novel wouldn't be complete if Burgess hadn't introduced that final bit of irony: after all the State's torturous efforts to \\"reform\\" the poor misguided youth, in the end he just sort of, well, gets over it.Other readers may have different opinions -- and according to Burgess's delightfully snarky introduction of 1986, that's okay with him. And he almost sounds resigned to the fact (for it probably is a fact) that of all his thirty-two novels -- not to mention his nonfiction (including a fine exposition of James Joyce released in the UK as _Here Comes Everybody_ and in the US as _Re Joyce_) and a whole bunch of music -- in the end it's this book for which he will be universally remembered.He may be right that it isn't his best work, and he's undoubtedly right that it's a bit preachy. But it's undoubtedly the book for which I myself will remember him. And I'll make no appy polly loggies for that, O my brothers, for it's a horrorshow book with the impact of an oozy across the glazzies, and no mistake. This malchick and his droogs deserve a place in literary history."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange is by far the best book i have ever read. even if you have seen the movie, read the book. It takes place in london in the not-so-distant future. The main character, Alex, is the leader of a gang of four teenagers, who run a muck, breaking into people's houses, beating people up, etc. alex runs into trouble, and is thrown in jail, where the government gives him horrific punishment.... anyway, enough of the plot. alex and his &quot;droogs&quot; speak a kind of Russified english, which they called &quot;Nadsat&quot; (russian for &quot;teen&quot;). The novel has no glossary, although nadsat is laced thickly throughout the entire book. this was not a problem for me because i speak russian, but i imagine that this book would be a very difficult read for someone who does not. but hey, if you cant, you can download a &quot;nadsat translator&quot;. overall, a clockwork orange is a visciously bizzarre, violent, hilarious, intruiging book that asks the reader &quot;is a person who does not have the option of evil really good?&quot;. a clockwork orange is the best book ever written because it breaks free of ordinary book structure. the main character is not very heroic, and is actually very dispicable. the book has very unexpected twists in it, so reader never knows what to expect. anyway, read it- it is not something you will soon forget."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This novel is great in that it portrays a classic anti-hero within a futuristic, bizarre world. The society that Burgess creates is both intriguing and sadly believable, and there are many questions that the reader is left asking about agency, violence, and humanity in general. Alex, the main character, goes through a maturing process, which makes this a good example of a coming-of-age novel. For that reason, I would recommend this book to both teenagers and adults that are interested in the sci-fi genre and want to have a brain-twisting, creepy experience. However, Alex speaks in a language called Nadsat, which is a mix of English and Slavic-based slang. It can be difficult to understand, especially at first, so I would not recommend it to people who are not willing to put a little effort into the novel to get something out of it. It is also extremely violent, so the faint of heart might want to find another book with butterflies, rainbows, and the like."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"+++++This book (first published in 1962) has three parts. The first part introduces us to the teenager named Alex who is the narrator of the book. He is the leader of a small gang in futuristic England until he gets caught for doing the ultimate crime. The second part has Alex or rather prisoner 6655321 in jail. In prison, he undergoes an experimental procedure that cures him of his violence. Part three details what happens to the cured Alex after he gets out of prison.A streak of grotesque surrealism runs through this book especially in part one. For example, as the gang of hoodlums drive to their \\"surprise visit,\\" they run over a big, snarling toothy thing that screams and squelches, and as they drive back they run over \\"odd squealing things\\" all the way.The most fascinating aspect of this book is the invented vocabulary or futuristic, teenage slang -- it has the effect of putting you in another world. Alex thinks and talks in this slang. A doctor in this book explains it: \\"Odd bits of old rhyming slang. A bit of gypsy talk, too. But most of the roots are Slav [or Russian] propaganda.\\"Alex as he narrates translates some of this slang. I found that it is best to compile a running glossary so as to make later reading easier.At first the vocabulary seems incomprehensible: \\"you could peet it with vellocet or synthemesc or drencrom or one or two other veshches.\\" Then, the reader discovers that some of the meaning is clear from context: \\"to tolchock some old veck in an alley and viddy him swim in his own blood\\" or \\"I kicked the chelloveck in the yarbles and he began to platch.\\" The meaning of other words become known after a second context. For example, when Alex kicks someone in the \\"gulliver\\" it might be any part of the body, but when a glass of beer is served with a gulliver, we then can deduce this word's meaning. The meaning of other words becomes obvious as the reader progresses through the book.Another fascinating thing about this book is its contrasts. For example, violence is connected with symphonic music especially the music of \\"Ludwig van.\\"This book is packed with various themes. The prison charlie or chaplain exposes the central theme of the book in a series of questions to prestoopnick or prisoner 6655321: \\"What does God want? Does God want goodness or choice of goodness? Is the man who chooses the bad perhaps in some way better than the man who has the good imposed on him?\\"Stanley Kubrick's movie of the same name catches the book's essence. However, the movie does not entirely get across the futuristic, nadsat or teenage slang so evident in the book.In conclusion, this is a new kind of book. I can't say I've read another like it. But I can say that this book contains *** a zammechat razkazz that works for me!! (For a translation, refer to the title of this review.)+++++"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I knew about this book way before I actually went out and bought it (of course there was a gap between buying it and reading it, but that's another, utterly irrelevant, story), being aware of most of the basic facts about it, the general plot and so forth. I've never seen the movie, although I've heard it's rather ultraviolent, which seems to be appropriate. The thing that both attracted me and made me shy away from the novel though was the prose itself . . . for those who aren't already aware, Burgess sprinkles the novel liberally with a made-up slang that the main character uses. I had seen a few pages at my local library and thought, \\"Crap, this isn't going to make any sense to me at all\\". But it does, somehow. There might actually be some editions floating out there with a glossary of sorts, giving you a clue as to what the more obscure slang terms might mean but you don't really need it. Reading the novel, it's very easy to figure out what's going on and the text isn't impenetrable at all. Most of the slang you can figure out via context and for the linguistically agile among you, I believe most of it is derived from Russian, mixed with some Britishisms and other stuff that I'm not smart enough to figure out. The end result of this is that it gives the book a weird sort of driving rhythm, half the words seem made up but it flows anyway and I never had any trouble figuring out what was going on at any given point (not that you don't have to read carefully, but it's not Finnegans Wake or anything). So that's that. But what is it about? The story is narrated by Alex, a teenager who inhabits a future Britain that has fallen into dingy decay, gangs walk the streets at night committing all sorts of violent acts, there hardly seems to be any hope and the government has become rather oppressive. But Alex doesn't care because he's quite enjoying himself. The book is a lot funnier than you might think and the violence (it's ample but not graphic) is almost slapstick. Alex and his pals spend the first third of the book (it details a typical night) basically walking around and beating up everyone they see, the narration makes it clear that Alex is intelligent enough to know what he's doing but he likes it and would like to keep doing it. One incident lands him in prison and while there and serving a long sentence, he's given a chance to get out early. All he has to do is submit to a new procedure that will make him nonviolent and he can go back into society. That procedure and its consequences drive the rest of the book, showing how things can seem to get better while actually getting worse. It's a testament to Burgess' skill that he manages to make Alex a nearly sympathetic character, to the point where I started to feel bad for him, especially in the scenes where he's denied the joy of his beloved classical music. The moral dilemma he poses is an interesting one, questioning whether society really becomes better if you take away free will. The edition I have (and most recent editions, I'm sure) restores the previously \\"lost\\" final chapter . . . it was cut from the American edition for various reasons and it and the actual final chapter end the story on two utterly different notes. I prefer the real final chapter, I think it closes the book on a reflective note, rather than the implied middle finger of the prior chapter, and I think it's more faithful to Burgess' intent. But your milage may vary and if you really disagree just stop before you get to the end. I don't know if it's the best Burgess book but it's certainly the most famous and quite the reading experience for those who prefer more experimental prose styles. It was published forty years ago but still feels contemporary and it certainly worth reading even today, in a future that Burgress might not have imagined but may be closer to his than we suspect."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Unlike most dystopian novels, which tend to focus on what may happen to government in the future, \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" focuses on the nature of the individual in the future. Our protagonist is Alex, only 15 years old but already a habitual criminal, roving the streets with his band of friends, taking advantage of every opportunity to wreak havoc on the world around him. The boys have no qualms about attacking the helpless. In fact, the more helpless the victim, it seems, the more pleasure the boys take in the act. The most interesting and disturbing aspect is that the boys manage to maintain a strange sort of innocence even as they commit the most heinous and violent crimes. They aren't doing any of this out of malice toward their targets; in fact, it seems to matter very little who they pick as a victim. They are creating mayhem just because it's fun for them.Everything changes, however, when one particular break-in goes horribly awry and Alex finds himself sentenced to 14 years in prison for murder. There, though he manages to create an illusion of good behavior, we see that the experience has no real impression on his sense of morality. Then, after two years, he is chosen for a new, experimental rehabilitation program, designed to rid him of any desire to indulge in, or even contemplate, any acts of violence. As we see, however, this \\"treatment\\" also leaves him without any choice in the matter of being good or not. He HAS to be good because he is programmed to be. This, of course, raises the question central to the book: Does good behavior actually mean you are a good person if you have no freedom of choice?The book can be a little difficult to get in to at first, predominantly because of Burgess's unique style. The story is narrated by Alex and thus, is written in the complex slang language, invented by Burgess for this book, that the youth of this society engage in. For example, a sentence taken from the opening chapter: \\"He looked a malenky bit poogly when he viddied the four of us like that\\" (pg. 5). There is no glossary, but if you stick with it, you will start to develop a feel for what most of the words mean after a couple chapters. However, if you find yourself having difficulty, a nice, comprehensive lexicon can be found on Wikipedia if you search for \\"English to Nadsat\\" (due to review guidelines I am not allowed to include a direct link). Unfortunately, it is alphabetized by the English equivalents, not by the slang terms, so looking up a word can be a little difficult.One final note of interest: The original British publication of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" had 21 chapters, as does the current American edition. However, when the book was first published in the United States, the last chapter was dropped. As Burgess explains in his introduction to the restored version, publishers considered this 21st chapter a sellout. Whether it is or isn't is up to you to decide, but I can tell you that the presence or absence of the last chapter makes a huge difference in the overall feel and message of the book. Without the final part of the story in place, the book offers a bleak message, implying that human nature cannot really change. On the other hand, reading the book with the final chapter in place gives us a little more hope. Beyond that, Burgess tells us in his introduction, interpretation is up to you.This review refers to the restored, 1986 Norton & Company edition."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Anthony Burgess originally wrote this novel when he was told by a doctor that he had a year to live. After this was found to be false he re-edited his manuscript. Perhaps though, the urgency and pace of his writing reflects his own brushes with mortality. The book is incredibly rich right from the start. Burgess writes using a patois slang called 'nadsat' which is the books voice of youth. The first person narrator Alex (Russian for Outside-the-Law) is an uncontrollable delinquent, but don't write him off yet as he has a refined taste in classical music, a large vocabulary, an ironic sense of humour and dollops of charm. When he steps over the line once too often the state reform him, but in doing so turn him into a 'clockwork orange' a fruit that has lost it's goodness and beauty because it is simply a mechanical object. The heart of the book is the classic moral dilemma- is it better for someone to choose to be bad or be forced to be good. Burgess clearly chooses the former. The end chapter of the book, which was omitted from Stanley Kubricks masterful film shows Alex reforming himself, and from this perspective the book can be seen as a rites of passage, we all learn by our badly intended mistakes after all. The book is less than 250 pages but contains enough for a book twice that length. Burgess has created a fascinating dystopia and a warmly moral tale, once you get used to the graphic descriptions of ultraviolence. Although not on a par with some of his other work, including the brilliant 'earthly powers' this is still an essential novel."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Great book if you can follow the english slang..loved it.I saw the movie when i was about 8 while a babysitter watched with me."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"The best part of this book was the \\"nadsat\\" speech that the author created, mostly from Russian, for the book. Learning all the words as they were carefully placed so they could be understood first from context was pretty entertaining. Overall, a real horrorshow raskazz."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"No complaining here. The book was beautiful, it looked like it was hot off the press when I got it. Not to mention that it made my girlfriend's Christmas."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Author has played so much with the language, it is really a unique piece of writing. It is a must read for all lovers of english literature."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I have to admit that I've been a longtime fan of the Kubrick movie but I had never read the book. I decided to change that as one of my 2013 New Year's Resolutions. I have to admit that I'm very glad I did. The book definitely grabs your attention and makes it hard to think about other things until you're finished it. Not that you don't continue thinking about it after you're done, but it's like an obsession while you're still in the middle of it. Well at least it was for me. Your mileage may vary, but I was hooked. My only complaint about the book is a trivial one that has nothing to do with the author or the story. This has to be the ugliest cover of any book that I own, and I own hundreds of books. Art is very subjective, but I hated looking at the front cover when I put the book down. It bothered me so much that I didn't want to look at it. I don't mean any disrespect to the artist or publisher, but I just thought I'd mention it because had I not already been a longtime fan of the movie, I would never have bought a book with that cover, not that I would be judging the inside based on the cover, but that I would not want something like that in my house where I'd have to look at it. In the end I wound up putting a brown paper grocery store bag cover over it like it was a school textbook, and it solved the problem for me. Anyway as I said, this complaint is trivial as it has nothing to do with the quality of the story, and that is what is important. Besides that, I'm sure there are people who like the cover. Art is subjective, and my little opinion is subjective too. Anyway it's a great book."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Classic. Great read, intense book. Not made for the faint-at-heart. Interesting psychological study. Movie is great as well, but you'll never forget the graphic images imprinted on you by the book's descriptions."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange was a very interesting read at times the made up language was hard to follow, but once I figured out what they were talking about it became a quick read. Beware of the graphic scenes of violence in the book they are needed to get the point of the story accross."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Good story,but the confusing language and words got in the way of enjoying the reading. Future editions should have a glossary so we understand what's happening."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"If you have seen the movie you may as well have read the book. I do not mean to say that it is a bad book by any means, but don't expect anything more. The only thing you get more from the book is the last chapter, which was not included in the movie"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I enjoyed reading this book so much that I am sure it will not be long before I read it again. It's a thought provoking novel about good and evil and about choices each one of us has to make in life."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This is without a doubt one of my all time favorite books. The story is written in first-person and follows the adventures of a teenager named Alex. Alex and his gang of 'droogs' are one of the many gangs that take over London after the sun has gone down, doing whatever they feel like whether that is beating, robbing, violating, or occasionally killing. Eventually, Alex is betrayed when some of his 'droogs' feel he is too harsh of a leader. In prison, he voulenteers to be the test subject for a new treatment that would make him incapable of evil by turning him into a clockwork orange. (A person trained so that they can do only good or evil; they lose the ability to choose) He voulenters, saying he wants to do good, but really only wanting to reduce his sentence. When he is realeased he discovers that he is powerless to stop his former victims from harming him! The unique language invented by Burgess in the book is facinatating and really adds to the enjoyment. But, perhapes the most amazing thing that Anthony Burgess did in the book was make Alex a likeable character, you can't help but pity him but you realize that you really shouldn't. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, the last chapter is what pulls the book together. I first read a version with twenty chapters and then read the twenty-first; the book is great even with the absence of the final chapter, but that is what really makes it work. Possibly my favorite book ever, \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is hard to put down."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I found this book to be one of my most favorites yet. Though for the some the English slang used will be a bit hard to understand, they will grow to love it. The main picture is something a bit dememented, but interesting nonetheless. It could very well change your views on what society today will label the &quot;good&quot; and the &quot;bad.&quot; The movie doesn't compare to the book, so I suggest you read it now."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Before reading this novel I saw the movie, and I do not reccondmend doing so. By watching the movie I was unable to capture the imagery in this wonderful, wonderful book. The nadast language that is used throughout the novel was easy to pick up on after about the second chapter. At first I thought the book was just all fun and games but after Alex got sent jail I started noticing deep insite. The book is talking about choice, and how if you cannot choose what you want, then you are nothing. Sure, Alex was &quot;cured alright&quot; but he was still as sick and demented as he was before getting treated. I'm sure you have all heard this before but why not say it again, eh?"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"If you no longer are able to make a moral choice for yourself then you stop being human. To be saved, change must come from within, it can't be forced upon you. You have to grow up on your own. If you lose your free will, then you are no longer human and thus can not love or dream. You become in a way a living mechanical thing, or, \\"A Clockwork Orange\\".Anthony Burgess' novel is wonderful, and touches upon several issues with the criminal justice system which still exist today. Should prisons be used to punish, or to reform? If they are used to punish then does the prisoner become a victim? What about the victims? Should they be allowed to have their revenge? Also, what can be done about overcrowding?The book was also full of lots of irony. In having the main character facing many of his old victims in the later chapters, I thought it seemed very much like a Frank Capra type of movie. However, instead of seeing how much worse life would have been like for all his friends and family if he had not been born, (like it was in \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\"), you get to see how badly the main character had affected all of his victims by coming into their lives.This particular novel contains a controversial last chapter which differs from the version which Stanley Kubrick used to base his movie upon. It seems that the last chapter was originally cut out of the United States version of the novel, and only the British novels had the last one. Now it has been added back in. I can't picture the movie having been any better by having added this extra chapter back into it, but it was good to read the novel the way the author had intended, and it works well in the book form.After seeing the movie I was surprised to see how short the novel was (less than two hundred pages), but it was packed with excitement. One of the best books I ever read."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Please read this version as it has the oft-omitted 21st chapter which gives the book a different tone,in other words it doesn't condone violence as much as the movie seemed too(at least on the surface) Also,don't be put off by the \\"Nadsat\\" slang used by Alex and his peers: there's a very good website that has translations. Just read this book, whether you love it or hate it,you'll probably never forget it.."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Ahhhh our humble narrator poor little Alex. I first came across this book in a box filled with musty old books like it, and as soon as i opened it's pages, i could not put it down. I have since read it approximatley 20 times. This is my favorite book of all time! Burgess takes you on the horrorshow journey of Alex and his four droogs (friends) and all thier violence, rape, and total sadisim. When double crossed, Alex (who is 15 in the book, 12 in the movie, if i'm not mistaken) is eventually is used as the first test subject in an experimental reform process, in which he cannot even think about violent acts without getting terribly ill. He is then thrown out into the real world where he must face all of his victims, who still haven't forgotten, or forgiven, who he was. Burgesses' story of inborn goodness vs forced goodness in one's own personality is a tale you soon won't forget. While some people found it tiresome, if you love a challenge, this book is filled with new foreign words, and do not be surprised if you must read lines over and over again to get their full comprehension. Read the book over the movie, b/c the movie is based on the american version without the last chapter, a crucial part of the story."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess was a very good book. It is about a 15 year-old boy and his very violent life. The story takes place in a futuristic city. Alex and his friends go around the city and act like terrors. The story starts to get exciting when he goes to jail and is the test subject for a new method of state reform. I liked this book because it shows that actions have reactions. The bad part about the book is the dialect. I think Anthony Burgess over does the dialect and makes the book hard to understand."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Here I sit, a 16 year old girl, having just finished &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; for the second time. I always have been fascinated with books that are written in a way that many people wouldn't understand. This particular book is written in a rather strange language, specifically the way Alex and his droogs talk, is quite interesting and surprisingly clever to me. Occasionally I'll find myself telling my mom that the mac and cheese is &quot;real horrorshow&quot; or asking my friends if they want a cup of &quot;chai&quot;.&quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; raises an important question that is more valid now, perhaps, than it has ever been before. Is a man who chooses to do bad things any worse than a man who hasn't the ability to do nasty things. In a time when technology is altering lives, and medications can be taken to change your feelings and perceptions of reality, maybe we aren't that far from real &quot;Clockwork Oranges&quot;. In the story, Alex is only a teenager, but he commits horrific acts of violence that are still shocking, even in our day and age. Alex is then arrested, and goes through treatment to make sure that he never commits an act of violence again. After Alex finds that he's not able to function properly in society, something has to be done.This is an amazing book, and a must read for anyone and everyone. The added last chapter in this book makes it much, much better and completes the story the way it should've been in the first edition. A book to read for the real and dedicated readers out there."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange is a story of the life of a gangster, Alex, and his three droogs (friends), Peter, George, and Dim. What the book reveals about Alex and human nature is startling and must not be taken for a tale of pure madness and ultra-violence. Unfortunately, movie-watchers were only naturally entertained, without understanding the philosophical message behind it. The theme is mixed with Burgess's 'Nadsat language' derived from various languages, mostly Russian. This is the 'lingo' of the gang. One misunderstanding is that the word 'orange' in the title does not mean an orange, it means man derived from Malay. In the preface to this book it becomes all too clear that Burgess is talking about a man who can be wound up like a clock by God or the Devil and has no free will to choose what to be. The priest in the Staja jail also says something like &quot;A man who cannot choose ceases to be a man.&quot; What lies beneath Burgess's tale of rape and ultra-violence and undergoing a dangerous treatment for it is a notion of how human nature is never all good nor all evil and to make a clockwork orange of a person is to dehumanize him."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This is one of my favorites. A linguistic classic, brilliantly written. I recommend this copy for, while it has no glossary, it does have the final chapter. American publishers who forced the 20 chapter copy of this book, did the world an injustice. The book, and subsequently, the movie is incomplete, and dare I say void of something. This is the something: Alex, our protagonist, is just that, and any understanding reader knows this but may not know why. How can we know when a novel and a film start and end in the same place? The final chapter fulfills this need for closure, thus transforming Alex into a round character, rather than a flat one, incapable of change. My only critiscism with this novel (including the final chapter) is that, at the end, like at the end of Tim Burton's Beetlejuice, we see conformity, for, in my view, no reason. Not to give it away, I will just discuss the part in question. Before Alex becomes a &quot;Clockwork Orange,&quot; he tells the reader that he loathes what is, in their society, pop music, and prefers &quot;Ludwig Van&quot; (Beethoven). The changes in the last chapter, has him abandon his earlier passion, in place of &quot;tamer&quot; music. This bothers me; perhaps i have misinterpreted this, but to me it makes a comment about civility and music.Anyway, this is one of my favorite novels. It is a brilliant Pavlovian study of psychology (why we do what we do and what can control that) and the philosophy of free will, as well as the conflict between the proponents of free will and law enforcement and psychiatry. You will not read this book without having a lot to think about well after you close the pages of this book."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"The tale of teenage angst intertwined with youthful redemtion really makes this book an alltime classic. To watch a character like Alex grow from a boy into a man catches the spirit of the human soul like no other novella can."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Upon first glance at this book you may be shocked by the seemingly senseless acts of violence commits. Alex and his droogs perform beatings, rape, and even murder. Most of this is covered up using a type of Russian slang known as Nadsat. It takes a little bit of the bite out of the horrific scenes taking place. But once you get past all of that violence and look at the message of the novel you can realize what a master Burgess is. He is describing the dangers of conforming. He asks thought provoking questions like, &quot;What price are we willing to pay for a quieter life?&quot; Is it worth sacrificing the humanity of the perpetrators to keep the world at peace? As Alex is under going &quot;Ludivico's Technique&quot; is he not really just losing his humanity? Is it better to allow man to freely make a choice to do evil deeds or to force him to do what is socially considered &quot;good&quot;? All in all this is an excellent read. Especially if you are into dystopian novels designed to question the society we live in today."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Which is the greater evil? Choosing to do wrong, or being forced to do right?"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange certainly ranks as one of the last great literary works. The style is incredibly unique, the language is wonderful, and best of all, it shows no age. I would imagine that this book exists outside of time. Even after all these years, there is not even a hint of it being outdated. The most contemporary reference is Beethoven. Burgess has created his own world, with his own language as well. The book, like the movie is graphic, but unlike the movie, it is not explicit, because Nadsat prevents that. And the last chapter? Let it stand. Burgess had his reasons. He was a traditionalist writer, and the numerology had significance. Twenty-one is a number that represents maturity, and as an old-school British writer, Alex was to mature in that final chapter. And besides, what is written cannot be unwritten, and as Burgess has explained, take it or spit it out. He had written twenty one chapters, you will read twenty one chapters, but you don't have to agree with it. The whole point was to show that men are not predestined to be evil. How could you argue about Alex's character? I'd have to assume that Burgess knew Alex's personality far better than any reader, and after all, the story was inspired through his own tragedies. Five stars all the way. And all that cal."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book has almost as many reader reviews as The Satanic Bible by Anton LaVey. There is something about the Dark Side that attracts and tempts us with promises of escape (real or imaginary) from the boredom in everyday life. Burgess, in his introduction to ACO, attributes this attraction to \\"Original Sin\\" and says he enjoyed ripping and raping by proxy through his protagonist, Alex. But there was a moral point: \\"If one can only perform good or only perform evil, then he is a clockwork orange - meaning that he has the appearance of an organism lovely with colour and juice but is in fact only a clockwork toy to be wound up by God or the Devil or (since this is increasingly replacing both) the Almighty State.\\" He continues: \\"It is as inhuman to be totally good as it is to be totally evil. The important thing is moral choice. Evil has to exist along with good, in order that moral choice may operate.\\"From the 1st to the 20th chapter, one is (although vaguely) under the assumption that Alex is free to choose good or evil but gets more pleasure out of evil. Alex says he does evil because he likes it just as some people do good because they like it. Alex assumes his own freedom and uses it (and Burgess through him) to mock those who think that evil is not freely chosen but the result of a bad environment, a bad government, or the devil. Then one comes to the 21st chapter. Here, quite abruptly, is an older Alex who associates his youth with a wind-up toy (the opposite of moral freedom)! One is also left wondering if Burgess actually believed at the time he wrote this novel that one INEVITABLY grows out of evil through some maturation process. If he did, then this contradicts the moral idea he presents in his introduction that one is free to choose evil and, I might add, stay evil.Apart from what I perceive to be a contradictory 21st chapter, the book is excellent for its creative language and emotional presentation on the moral issue of whether conditioning, not just incarceration, can remove moral freedom. Put yourself in the victim's shoes. Would you want Alex to lose his moral freedom to torture, rape or even murder if it meant a safer society, a safer YOU? If you answer \\"yes,\\" then you are in effect saying that you want your own moral freedom to choose evil removed. This raises the question of why evil (or our moral perception of evil) exists in the first place. A lot to think about here."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Anthony Burgess is my new favorite British author. I picked this book because I wanted to read it before I saw the movie, and I enjoyed it more than any other book whick I've read recently. Once you get used to it, the slang which Burgess concocted out of Russian and English makes A Clockwork Orange an infinitely more enjoyable read.One thing which I found somewhat disturbing is that when this novel was published in the early 60's, the ultra-violence which was depicted in it was beyond anything that existed in society at the time. But if you make the setting the inner-city ghettos of the mid nineteen-ninteys, you're not all that far off. The last sentence of Part One, &quot;And me still only fifteen,&quot; doesen't have as much of an impact on readers today as it was originally meant to.

Stanley Kubrick did a very good job on the movie, but i would have to say that i enjoyed the book more.The book goes into more detail on Alex's life and the crimes. I thing it was amazing how Anthony BUrgess set the book in 3 main parts. The first part is being set in his hometown with the victims of his crimes, the second part is in a new setting with completely different characters, and the third part is back at his hometown with all of the same charactesr as the first part but they switch roles in the victimizing.There are only a few things that i made me less into the story. The fact that Alex is only 15 years old in the book is hard to comprehend especially with some of the things he does. Another thing that is wierd about the book is the language. Alot of the words are english slang terms for that time such as &quot;slooshied&quot; and &quot;viddied&quot;, but you get used to it.Even if you have no desire to read this book because you saw the movie, at least read it for the original ending (which the movie does not include)this book is well deserving of 5 stars, and it is one of the best books i have ever read."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"It's to Burgess' credit that he makes the protaganist of Clockwork Orange an unsympathetic character and the state's attempt to &quot;adjust&quot; him an almost worthwhile achievement. Burgess makes the typical black and white judgements more difficult for us.But Clockwork Orange's genius is more than this. Burgess injects Russian words into his gang of toughs creating a lower class dialect . Knowing Russian makes the book much easier to read yet defeats the authors purpose- he wants the reader to determine the word meanings by context.Clockwork Orange is a darkly comic work that stands as one of the best books of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Quiet a bizzare and at times, complicated book. But its classic. Anthony Burgess uses language like no other. Its a true work of art."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Long story why I originally read this book, but I wasn't sure what I was going to think about it. The main character (Alex) reminded me a lot of a guy I know, which is extremely scary.Other than that, this book was amazing. A little hard to understand at first, I admit, but once you learn the language, the book is awesome.Four boys, out to wreak havoc in any way possible, including violence, theft, and rape. In some ways, this is a very disturbing book, but you cannot put it down, either. The boys live in a world all their own (including their own language, \\"radsat\\", which is mostly just russian-based words), and when Alex finally gets caught and booked, there is a huge turn in the book. He is taken to rehabilitation, but then the horrors go on.Amazing and insightful book, I recommend it to anyone who can stomach it. (note: \\"horrorshow\\", as used in my title, means great...in radsat)"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book typifies the struggling angst of the lost generations of the 50s and 60s come of age.It does for 70s literature what Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath did for music."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book is crazy. Its the written version of the greatest film ever made, and looking at it on paper is quite a thing. The language is quite interesting, and you get in a real droog mindset through reading it, I've read very few things where I've felt like i was in the story, this one of them."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"The book is excellent. However, at the time that I am writing this, Amazon lists it as a hardcover. I purchased the book. It is NOT a hardcover book. Click on the closeup view of the front-cover and you can see that it ever SAYS that it's a paperback! You've been forewarned!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This story is tells the story of Alex, the main character and narrator of the story. Alex and his three droogs, friends, Pete, Dim, and Georgie were a horror for the town that they lived in with their ultraviolent ways. They go around stealing, beating, and raping whomever and whenever they please. One day on a regular night Alex and his droogs broke into a house and beat a women to death. As the four were about to make their getaway, Dim, Pete, and Georgie turn on him and knock him down cold. The police took him in and sent him to a state jail for murder. While he was there he made some changes for the better and was picked to be in an experiment to rehabilitate convicts. They give him medicine and make him watch horrifying movies of crimes of all sorts. Whenever he has an urge for violence, he receives an excruciating sickness to his stomach. When this experiment was through, they send Alex into the world. How will the young man last in a harsh world when he can't fight back? The results are all too shocking.A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess is a spectacular piece of fiction. This well thought out piece of work is one of a kind. It is one of the most interesting books of it's time for the author, Burgess, writes this book in the teenage language of the future, nadsat as they call it. In this futuristic tale, the main conflict is between good and evil and the freedom of choice. Alex must choose to continue his life of evil or to switch to the side of good. Saw the movie? Think you know the story? Think again because this version contains the lost twenty-first chapter that was never before published in the United States. This ending changes the meaning of the whole book."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A teenage thug and his &quot;droogs&quot; wreak havoc on the streets. Using a street language that is easy to decipher, Burgess tells a tale of the not to distant future or is it the present?Alex the leader is captured by the police and is sent to prison where he is offered a controversial treatment. The tratment is a sort of brainwashing that makes Alex ill everytime he encounters violence.Alex is let out of prison and finds it very difficult to find his way in the world. He is cast out by his parents and brutalized by one of his droogs who has become a policeman.Finally the brainwashing wears off and Alex turns back into a street thug and he finally tires of his brutal life."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange is undoubtedly my favorite book/movie of all time. Clockwork Orange is not only a story to me but a lifestyle. Not only does it tell stories of the old \\"ultra-violence,\\" but it teaches many moral lessons. Some of the greatest bands have also followed the lead of A Clockwork Orange. This is the greatest Anthony Burgess creation. Grab some moloko plus and put on the lovely lovely Ludwig van and read this classic Anthony Burgess novel."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"i do not understand how people can call this \\"frustrating\\" after page three it all makes sense. and as for \\"glorifies violence\\" i suppose you did not read the last and final chapter, wich is all about young alex changing his ways and chosingly stopping all his violent acts so he may start a new life and have a son. even though i knew certain parts in advance (the films alex is forced to watch) it was still very interesting to hear the way it was described. and as for \\"if anyone else had written this it would be considered pornography\\" Burgess was actually not that famous when the book was published, it was this book that made him famous. I hope one day someone will make a film more like the book than stanley kubricks version (all the main charactors in the film look 30 as opposed to 14) all in all this is a great book and i believe that everyone should read this at least once in their lives."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I've heard from many people that after the first chapter or so of &quot;A Clockwork Orange,&quot; they gave up because of the NADSAT. Nadsat is a slang invented by Burgess, that is a mixture of Russian and, well, nonsense. There are resources available to define these nadsat words, but in most cases it is not even necessary. Many of the words, in context, are self-explanatory, and those which are not can often be passed by without tainting the reader's experience.If you can get past the brilliant but difficult slang, this book is definitely a good read. Burgess also wrote symphonies, and this is apparent in his works. This book is no exception. The book serves almost as a mirror: the first section is a slow build, the second section is the middle ground--and also where much of the action takes place, and the third section is a slow decline to the end: much like a reversal of the first section.&quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; is incredibly thought-provoking--it really makes you look to yourself, check your own values and beliefs. What is right? Is free will more important than a safe society? This book is great, and I would recommend it for both classroom reading as well as reading for pleasure."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"don't make the mistake of becomming too hung up about language in this book... it's really the least of your worries. yes there are three phases the main character alex goes through, but plot isn't as important here as internal exposition and dialogue. the point of a clockwork orange is anti-establishmentism. the point is youth culture. the point is... we all grow up, but we're not all going to be drones. if you want to find out about the plot, read someone else's review... if you want to read something of the modern canon, something anti-establishment in the very utmost manner, and if you can handle ultraviolence (if you voted for bush, you should be all set, hah!), you NEED to read this book... it's one of the most important books of the 20th century."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This novel, which I recently finished has touched me in a way no other novel has. After completing the book I was catching myself saying all the phrases Alex says in the story myself. This is a novel which should be read by any type of reader. My little droogs this razoodox is a real Horrorshow viddy! You will understand after you read the book! Trust me!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"\\"A Clockwork Orange\\" by Anthony Burgess is in that special class of 20th century literature that effectively and powerfully exists both in its own world of (science?) ficition and the very real world of the the reader.The film, also a powerful work of art, should not dissuade anyone from reading this book. In fact, if you've seen the film, you owe it to yourself to read the book and explore the themes and arguments further. Additionally, the book contains a final chapter, not originally available to american readers, that, by its very dissonance with the film, should make anyone interested in either the film or the subject of criminal justice rush to finish the novel.Finally, the nadsat - the mixture of russian and british slang that Alex speaks in - is almost reason enough to read the book for purely aesthetic reasons. Through nadsat and the careful use of language Burgess creates one of the most affecting, troubling and tangible worlds in 20th century fiction."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I love A Clockwork Orange. I'm so glad i read it. It really isnt like anything ive ever read before. Totally in a class by itself. It is a terrifying book that shows how horrible the world could be. The vulgarity and blatant violence only add to the appeal. The message of independence, choice, and maturity hit hard and make the book one of the best. Shocking at times, for some it may be a little hard to take, but give it a try. The slang used and they way you have to figure it out as you read make you feel an attachment to the book and it feels like your own. read this book!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Well hello my brothers,Heed my soviet as I recommend a real horrorshow novel called ACLOCKWORK ORANGE by Anthony Burgess.

Their world is one focused on ultra-violence; outrageously low performances of betrayal, as well as brutally untainted sadism. If one were to look deeper into this novel, beyond the despicable acts of violence, you would find that Burgess has posed several questions worth considering. Some of these points are especially disturbing. Alex, being the criminal he is, was brainwashed. He was supposed to be morphed into a person that would chose to behave morally in his society. This made me question whether or not a man who was restricted from his own free will could be considered moral and ethical, or if it has just made him a brainless sack of idiot. If one is rendered incapable of evil, would that make him better than a man who is evil because he chooses to be? Even more unsettling is to question if it is moral, in a sense of punishment, to confine a human being's free will to the point where he is a zombie? Furthermore, after this point of zombie-like moral restraint, are the remains a man, or something less than that? Burgess will have the reader fantastically engaged in all of the problems that lead one to contemplate these disturbing questions. Although this book is a complete horror show, all these issues are entirely worth considering. I liked it very much."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"1984, A Brave New World, and The Clockwork Orange make up the structure of what we call Satire on Society. I have read this book twice and I still haven't picked up all the details that its pages hold. The gruesom and horrific acts within its covers make the mind run and hide from the idea of its possible truth. Alex, the protagonist and his droogs commit rape, theft, assult, and even murder for the pure pleasure in it. Most of this is covered up using a type of slang known as Nadsat. Although the slang is sometimes hard to understand, it can be picked up quickly. After being caught and forced to reform to society's standards of living(\\"Ludivico's Technique\\"), he tells the readers at the end his dreams to start a family as a younger man.Like in Orwell's 1984, this book brings up the question, \\"Do we want a society where the price of prosperity is the loss of our cherished rights; freedom of speach, press, religion, and even thought?\\" Read \\"The Clockwork Orange\\" and feel the terror, the mind provoking feeling of a world that could be."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange was a book like none of its kind. Since none of the characters are easy to relate with, we have look to the themes for it to make the most sense to us. The ideas of free will and revenge is what leads to the conclusion of A Clockwork Orange, a conclusion that might have been a surprise to most who have read it. I enjoyed reading it, yet would only want people with open minds to read such a novel. If you can see through all the violence and rape, you will understand the main idea that Burgess is trying to get across to those that dare to read it."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"People told me about this book for a long time, and so I finally borrowed it from one of my droogs (hahahaha, get it? Droog? word they used in the book to describe a friend), and I was pretty blown away by it. I loved how the author created an entirely different terminology for the book...This book, though an entire work of fiction, is proof that people can change their ways and repent from their diabolic behvavior. The movie was pretty whacked out too, though the book was probably better. The video had too many bright colours to reflect upon the darkness of the story, and the rather grey pictures I illustrated in my head while reading this. An undisputed classic, and should be read by anyone who wants to read a good book."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"&quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; is not the book it seems to be. People often speak of it and the Kubric film in a way that makes it a blatant disregard for human emotion; a chance to tantalize the senses and fill our minds with senseless violence, rape, and murder. The antagonists of Mr. Burgess' classic tale fail to discover the meaning of this horrific novel, much the same as those who find the &quot;relations&quot; offending in &quot;Brave New World,&quot; and those who banned &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; for its language.Censors miss true meanings of great literature because they are too busy dabbling over trite matters, while the big picture passes them by. Fortunately for Alex, in 1986 Anthony Burgess was able to reissue the book with its 21st chapter, left out of the original American version and out of Stanley Kubric's film. But even without Alex's remorse spelled out for the reader, one who pays attention can see that the novel is based strongly on the forces of good and evil and our glorious ability to choose. When Alex's free-agency is taken away from him and he is reformed to be a law-abiding man, the novel asks boldly, &quot;Yes, but at what cost?&quot; The brilliant language (nadsat) used by Alex and his droogies hints at the possibilites of his scenerios materializing in the future; in 30 years or tommorrow or 1,000 years. Frankly, it doesn't matter. The novel warns that any time a human's agency is stolen from them, it is the beginning of the downfall of governments, nations, and humanity. Think &quot;Brave New World&quot; and soma, or the thought police in &quot;1984.&quot; Had Alex's fate reached the masses, the same rejection of the treatment would have occured, leaving us with thankfulness for the way life is, and warning us about the way life could be. Burgess captured brilliantly what the charlie tells the prison authorities, &quot;When a man looses his ability to choose, his ceases to be a man.&quot;Very highly recommended..."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I just finished reading this dark masterpiece by Burgess and I have to say it was pretty good and I'm probably gonna read it again.Alex is one of the most confused charachters ever printed(like De Niro in Taxi Driver)and I hated it when he beat people and raped women but I felt sorry when everyone beat the carp out of him later. Anyway this is a pretty good book and highly reccomended!(I'm really 14!)"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Some books begin to fade from the memory within seconds of finishing the last sentence. Others stick in your mind for the rest of your life.A Clockwork Orange is one of the latter."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"If you've seen any of my other reviews, youve noticed that I'm always discussing symbolism or political allegories. That's right, this is such a book. Even if all the symbolism and hype was removed from this book and it's name, it would still be an excellent book. It moves with action and makes you sympathize with the anti-hero. I can't think of any other book where I found myself rooting for the salvation of a rumbling, raping, vicious thug. On a deeper level,(uh-oh, here comes the philosophy), this book represents a myriad of things. In example, the tendency of human nature to be violent and unruly until age makes it's effect and gives knowledge and understanding; or an overall mellowing out. Furthermore, the book is representative of cold war tactics used by both superpowers. This book makes it onto my list as one of my highest recommended books"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Personally, This Is One Of My Favorite Books. I Think That Many People Are Turned Away From This Book Due To The Extremely Violent Content And Horrific Crimes Described Herein, But, Beneath The Violence And Crime Is A Masterpiece That Gives A Terrifying Vision Of A Possible Future and Poses An Important Moral Question. The Book Has Some Connections To Christianity That Are Represented Mainly Through The Prison Chaplain. The Big Moral Dilemma Of The Book Is Expressed Through The Title. Alex(The Narrator), Is Subjected To A Treatment In Prison In Which He Is Shown Films Of Violence And Sex, While Strapped To A Chair With His Eyes Forced Open And While Feeling Extreme Nausea, Fear, Discomfort, And Feelings Of Paralysis. After Alex Gets The Treatment In Prison, He Becomes A &quot;Clockwork Orange,&quot; Something That Appears To Be Alive But Is In Fact Mechanical. The Treatment Forces Alex To Be A Non-Violent, Non-Sexual person. Just The Thought Of Sex Or Violence Causes Him To Become Incapacitaded By Feelings Of Extreme Nausea And Severe Discomfort. Alex No Longer Has The Freedom To Choose How To Behave And He Becomes A Slave To Fear, The Fear Of The Effects Of The Treatment. Consequently, These Feelings Also Appear When Alex Hears His One True Love In Life, The Music Of Beethoven. This Is Due to The Fact That One Of The Treatment Films Had A Piece By Beethoven Playing In The Background. The Chaplain Sums Up The Main Theme Of The Book In One Statement: Is A Person Truly Good If They Have No Choice Betwwen Good Or Bad Behavior, And Are Forced To Do No Wrong. Basically, The Theme Is The Connection Between Living And Freedom. It Seems To Me That What Burgess Is Trying To Say Is That People Are Not Truly Alive If They Do Not Have The Freedom To Choose How To Live Their Lives, And Without This Choice, Are Nothing But Machines That Have The Characteristics Of Human Beings. I Couldn't Agree More."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This great book follows the life of young Alex and his &quot;droogs&quot;, from their nightly &quot;ultraviolence&quot; to Alex's prison days. This book has great use of its dark futuristic (of the time that it was written) setting. I liked how burgess showed who Alex was right in the beginning by use of showing Alex and his friends prowling the streets, looking for trouble. At first I didn't like the words that Alex used, but once I got used to them, they added alot to the book. The book was written very well and Burgess used very good character development.I like the ideas of the book alot, also. I like that Burgess seemed to be against the doctors messing with Alex's head. I think that he was because of the political writers he used to bring the doctors and the government people that funded them down. I also like how he showed how some people would do any thing to get what they want done. He did this when He showed Alex lay down in the bed and the people that were supposed to be helping him played the music that made him jump out of the window.I am glad that I read the version with the final chapter that was omitted from the book the first time it came to America from Britain. I'm not quite sure why it was left out, but it pretty much changes the whole scope of the book. It shows that even someone as bad as Alex can change.Over all, it is a great book and I highly recommend it to you."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"In one word: Coolness. Anthony Burgess has won my devotion with this one. Almost the most disturbing thing I've ever read, this book is satisfying all the way. There is no bad part. It never gets boring. And it is so creative in it's language concepts that... well it's creative! Read this book, or you are doing an injustice to yourself. Oh, and watch the movie too."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Real horrorshow if you ask me. This is the most intriguing, fantastic and exhilerating book I've ever read. What I find most interesting is the use of a new language which really adds some spice to the story itself. When you first start to read, you find it quite difficult to understand exactly what Alex and his droogs are saying in their nadsat goloss, but after a chapter or two, you start to get the hang of it ! It's as if you were plunged into Burgess' world and I personnally couldn't put the book down until I reached the last chapter! Speaking of the last chapter, it was left out in the movie by Stanley Kubrick ( which I found remarquably well done). I feel that it's a bit out of place because it's too &quot;nice&quot; and &quot;happy ending&quot; like compared to the rest of the novel...But when you think of it, the whole book is about human ethics in a way. If Alex remained as vicious and violent as he was, all hope of keeping a moral feelings would be lost. So this actually gives more depth to the whole plot. Anyway, this is definitely as much a classic as Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Yipe!! This is not what I expected. I'm a little afraid to see the movie now. But it was a good book!! 'What's it going to be then, eh?' It is so well thought out and one of the best Negative Utopia books I have read. I particulary liked Burgess' style of writing. You won't see it in every book. Some parts at the end are very surprising, so don't think a book is over just because you only have a couple more pages to read. The Nadsat language is very interesting and I swear I almost said &quot;horrorshow&quot; instead of &quot;good&quot; when I was talking to somebody. It is immensely helpful to have either a copy of meanings with you or to buy the hardcover copy with the meanings in the back. I had the paperback edition and had to print the dictionary from the Internet and carry it with me wherever I took my book. But don't worry about that too much, after awhile you start to get the hang of it. Anyway, it's a wonderful book. Anthony Burgess is a genius and I can't wait to see the movie!!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A wonderful, though-provoking novel, possibly the best I've ever read. Burgess imaginative use of nadsat vocab is used as a powerful distancing tool between the reader and the events unfolding, so you feel an outsider to the violence and Alex's gang of 'droogs'It is also interesting that Russian is used, as if Burgess' future world is a world of communism. Burgess paints a bleak but believable view of the future where the government conditions people to behave how they want them to. Therefore stripping people of choice, freedom, and ultimately, their humanity. A Clockwork Orange is much, much, more than a debate about mind-control though. The novel is also about adolescence, Alex is cured in the end by natural maturity,not by any artificial techniques forced upon him. It is a crying shame that Kubrick missed the crucial last chapter out of the film (excellent though it is). It always amazes me how the reader ends up feeling sorry for Alex, considering the crimes he commits. However, this is why the novel is so powerful, the crimes Alex commits are vicous and brutal, but they are no worse than the crimes the state commit on him. The novel is also satirical. We see how Alex becomes a pawn in a political struggle, we recognise the political parties that go to extreme lengths to secure votes in todays society. Overall the novel is a masterpiece and is a lot, lot better than the film. In the novel, we really get a sense of a society out of control, gangs of youths running riot, overcrowded prisons, etc. The film makes it look like it is only Alex and his droogs who are commiting crimes. Also, the words 'a clockwork orange' don't appear in the film. This, to me, was the weirdest thing in the book. The fact that Alex sees that the novel by F.Alexander is called 'A Clockwork Orange' and carries this title in his head with him, whilst he is actually becoming a clockwork orange. A brilliant book, definitely recommended. If you are appalled by the violence, you should be, thats the whole point, Burgess is painting a picture of a violent society out of control."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I loved A Clockwork Orange. I couldn't put it down! I definately reccomend doing the way I did. If you want to see the movie, read the book first. You kind of have to have your own ideas set before a movie visualizes it for you. This book is pretty relevant to society today. There's all this violence, and everyone wants to do anything to stop it. This book really explores that. What would we be willing to do? Would we be willing to change the way a person thinks, and change their basic nature? What would that actually do? I really reccomend this book."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange is an original and thought evoking novel. Burgess presents you with the scary possibility of moral oppression and a difficult question: Is it better to choose evil or to be forced to choose good? He offers the opinion that &quot;a man who cannot choose ceases to be man.&quot; He becomes a &quot;clockwork orange,&quot; which Burgess describes in the introduction as &quot;a living organism oozing with juice and sweetness&quot; yet with a &quot;mechanistic morality.&quot; The novel is very well written. Burgess raises an important question and actually manages to elicit the reader's sympathy for the wicked, but charming Alex, all the while entertaining with the invented slang. The nadsat and the cheerful attitude of Alex throughtout the terrifying sequence of events creates a mood that is amusing, in a morbid way."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I wish I could give it a million stars! The book delivers the idea that a person must change through their own will, lest they be a Clockwork Orange, with awhallop. The Nadsat language, composed of American and British slang, along with actual Russian words, improves the story's effect. And Alex is the perfect model for the term, &quot;A Clockwork Orange.&quot;. I love how consistent Burgess is in this book. While in Staja, only prisoners call him Alex. Everyone else refers to him as 6655321. What an excellent book!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Talk about a book that sticks with you, I find myself wanting to slip some nadstat into my converstaions inadvertantly! This is, like many before me have said, an excellant book. Probably thee most original piece of literature I've read thus far. Burgess is a literary genius creating such a story with a completely made-up language. How can you top that? Definently a must read-don't see the movie first, even though it is good too."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange... Visionary masterpiece is an understatement. It is a premonition of a horrific future. Bands of vicious teens coupled with greed, mind-numbing drugs, and a total disregard for human life lead to gangs who would kill you for the selfish thrill of it. In this story, the leader of one such gang, Alex, lives a life of crime where in order to attain anything, all he has to do is take it. He is desensitized to violence and enjoys it quite well. His principle interest are rape, Beethoven, and ultra-violence. After his lifestyle becomes intolerable by his peers, his droogs violently secede. This leaves Alex alone against the judicial system with a rap sheet of murder. While in jail, with the help of his charm, he is chosen to undergo a new treatment. This treatment, named the Ludovico Treatment, teaches the sub-conscious to respond to violence with fear and nausea. Unable to even kill a fly, he is sent into the world again, only to find himself at the shear mercy of all whom he abused.This novel reflects the time period in which it was written, with just a little hint of communist metaphor. This book shows that a body forced to act a certain way, ceases to be real. The body displays itself like a normal healthy delicious orange, but has nothing but meaningless gears inside. Its dialect and writing style are truly unique. If you don't enjoy this book, you probably read it upside-down.I have enjoyed the whole sub-culture of A Clockwork Orange, and you will too."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"&quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; is the most amazing book i've ever read! Nadsat (the slang language of Alex and his &quot;droogs&quot;) perfecty conveys ideas where English might not suffice... The core question of the novel is one that should be thought over very well: &quot;At what cost redemption?&quot; Burgess was a true genius in creating this book."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book is one of my personal favourites. I enjoyed the whole idea of the novel: that you can't program people perfectly. That's what I got out of it. If you read it, you'll know what I'm talking about. This book is better than the movie because the movie leaves out the end of the book. Great book that I suggest you read if you're interested in the way society wants people to conform to their ideas of bad and good."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I must have read this book five times, and I've seen the movie about 10, and I never tire of them! The book is well written, and though the &quot;Nadsat&quot; (the Anglo-Russian slang spoken by Alex throughout the book) is a bit difficult to understand, you get the hang of it quickly! The book deserves every one of those stars!!!!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I saw the movie before reading the book, and I'm a big kubrick fan, so I of course loved it. Them I decided to read the book. I just couldn't stop reading it, i finished it in two days, and I also loved it. Both the book and the movie are really good, but the movie doesn't have the last chapter, so now after reading the book I'll feel like there's something missing. But it's still a very good movie, and a real horrorshow book."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I have just finished this book and absolutely love it! I haven't read a book as good as &quot;Trainspotting&quot; for a long time, but &quot;Clockwork&quot; is right up there with it. The language is hard to get through at first (as it was with Trainspotting), but I stuck with and was really rewarded in the end. I even knew basically how it finished because of the (very helpful) introduction, but the ending was still one of the best ones I have ever read. It leaves you satisfied, but still intrigued as to what happens to our Alex afterwards. If you are looking for something really original, have a sense of humour, and aren't very squeamish about violence, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Although the book is hard to just pick up and read, it tells a great story of the reformation of the main character Alex and what lengths he will go to to return to his normal habitat. Once you read through about two or three chapters, the language is a little easier to understand and the story becomes easier to read. I loved it and thought that Kubrick made a fine interpretation of it (even though he did leave out the last chapter.)"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"For those who have not seen Stanley Kubrick's screen adaptation of this book, I highly recommend reading the book, then renting the movie after the fact. Both are excellent, but as usual, many things in the movie seem sensationalized rather than understood according to Burgess' brilliantly way of communicating on paper. It's language style and first person account has a unique way of communicating a drifting conscience, of hooligan Alex. The style Burgess uses intesifies awareness while softening the shock, despite the horrendous acts of Alex. One of the challenges that movies and books of this type normally fail at doing."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Although somewhat disturbing, this novel invoked thoughts that I didn't think I could have. The realism behind the situation was shocking, considering the violence of today's youth. In addition, the tactful questions of morality that were brought up really made me reconsider something I take for granted: the freedom to choose. Once you get past the dialect of the youth, this novel is thought-provking and thoroughly enjoyable. The violence is indeed graphic, but the sarcastic humor of the protagonist takes the edge off and adds some humor as well. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is looking for something extraordinary."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Having seen the movie several years ago I was anxious to read the book. I was quite impressed with the author's use of language. The slang used by Alex and others his age is described by the author as 'a mixture of English and Russian.' It may confuse you at first but it becomes second nature once you get all the words down.This book is nothing short of incredible. You truly identify with the character and find yourself rooting for him in the end, even though he is a brutally violent delinquent. The movie sort of left you hanging, but the book (with the 21st chapter) gives us some resolution, and an understanding of how the character has evolved throughout the course of the book. I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys a well-written story which truly makes you think about the way we view &quot;progress.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"it is a compelling book.

Despite what he does, I felt pity for him, and by the end, (because of the first person narration and the personal addressings to the reader), I felt like a good friend to him. I was there, feeling for him and even sharing in his pain. I think it takes an extremely talented writer to make us like a protagonist. Not since Hannibal Lector in The Silence of the Lambs, have I liked a protagonist so much. But besides this, of course this book is very original and thought-provoking. It raises many points such as playing God, free will (to do good or bad), and so on.

Thank God for the glossary.I read the book in three days, obviously taking breaks to eat etcetera, but I found that in those three days it was the only thing I could think of.I pondered ever nuance of the masterpiece, pining over it until I finally finished it.It is exactly as I said: A masterpiece.Having seen the movie, it was a great deal easier to envision events, people, etc., which is both a blessing and a curse if you think about the fact that Alex's hobbies are ultra-violence and rape. Not a pleasant group of things to do in one's spare time. But it certainly was interesting to an outsider.But a warning to all: Weak stomach?

Once you get further into the book, it becomes easier to get use to. I believe this on purpose by the author to make us consider if we, ourselves, are clockwork oranges as well. This is a good discussion book for a book club, as it lends to a lot of good discussion and critical thinking. It's pretty interesting that Alex, the main character, is written so that you feel sorry for him at times. It would be rare, I think, if someone read the book and didn't care for him a bit. Again, this calls for asking the question on just how clockwork orange we are. I have to say, if you're going to read the book, find a version with the original ending chapter. It may change your perspective on what happened if you've only seen the movie. The book is a fun read and once you get over the language that is purposefully used for a reason, can lead to some critical thinking that shows this book is a classic for a reason. Final Grade - B"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I haven't read this book in over 20 years but decided to read it again after catching the movie lately.

The first three chapters were hard due to the new language the author uses. (recommendation: get the dictionary from the web and print it so you can look up the new words). After a while you can read with no trouble. At the beginning I was astound by the violence and couldn't understand how this book got good reviews. But as I got to the middle part it changed pace and the depth a in which the author goes to show us how society deals with violence or differences was mind blowing. I just hope my daughter can understand what was able to appreciate at her age. It is written well. The violent parts are really strong you feel like you are there. The other sections really make you think about life, society, laws and our behavior. I really recommend the book"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"i have read this book many times and as always it is a gut wrenching sadistic coming of age tale that takes place in a society that breeds awfulness, I love this book and I would recommend reading it, I would also recommend never watching the movie because it just completely missed the bus on capturing the essence and the moral of this grim tale.A Clockwork Orange"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I have both read and listened to this book and seen the movie more times than I can count and I can't think of any literary property that is so consistently good across all the media it inhabits as Anthony Burgess' \\"A Clockwork Orange.\\" Burgess was a master of language. He understood it and embraced it and in this case actually created it. It is really the language used by the vicious teenage narrator, Alex, wihich sets this book apart from...well...really...anything else ever published. It is not an easy read as the reader is required to work at this book while the characters go about their business not caring whether you understand them or not. The language Burgess creates is sort of a hybrid Russian/British/thug slang. For example, whenever the maniacal Alex wants to say something is good he uses a derivative of the Russian word \\"&#1093;&#1086;&#1088;&#1086;&#1096;&#1086;\\" (pronounced roughly kh-ho-ra-shaw) which when used by Alex and his deranged \\"droogs\\" is pronounced \\"horror show.\\" This has a layered meaning which is both chilling and totally cool. It takes a couple of chapters to get into the flow of the dialogue and it doesn't hurt to have a glossary available, as well. In the version I originally read there was a glossary published in the back of the book. I'm not sure if that is still the case with the printed version, but there are plenty available on the internet if not.The most amazing aspect of this book is how masterfully it was translated into a film by Stanley Kubrick. If you've never seen or read either of them, I would suggest seeing the movie first so you can at least get a visual idea of what is going on. Although this will help you in understanding the book, those who prefer to let their imaginations run wild will be disappointed because after seeing the movie you will never be able to picture Alex as anyone else but Malcolm McDowell.Herein lies the fantastic thing about the audio version of the book which I recently purchased from Audible.com. Narrator Tom Hollander, without any variation, completely channels Malcolm McDowell. It may as well have been done by McDowell himself so good is Hollander's uncanny impersonation. I admire a professional who is able to do this with such skill over the length of an entire novel. It makes the audio version an excellent listen, especially if you are a fan of the film and love McDowell.Highly recommended. Real horror show."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book was way ahead of it's time. A story of Alex and his gang who was set forth on a mission of ultraviolence. The book painted a picture of what could happen to kids in a world where violence is toned down to the point where it becomes \\"daily activity\\". It also gives descent insight into the mind of an Antisocial. Using a conglomeration of Russian, German, and made up words, Burgess even created a slang talk that enhances the uniquness of this story. Very cool book, one must pick it up, quick and easy read."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"i picked this book up yesterday. and upon initial viewing i was, to say the least, feeling like i might have wasted my money. i viddied the first couple of pages and thought i could never cut through all the nadsat slang, and get to any understanding of the story. this fear quickly disappeared as i found myself finishing it in one night. the language used in this book is both easy to pick up and gives the book a fun, fast driven sort of rhythm. it also serves as a funny inside joke when later in the book, characters comment about how funny alex talks and how they cant understand what hes saying, cause you can. also after reading the real final chapter left out of both the original american release and the stanley kubrik adaption of the book the story comes full circle and give the novel a completely different and much deeper and complete feel. without it, in my opinion, it is a different story. i wont go into it for fear of ruining it for those of you who haven't laid your glazzies on it yet, but i will say that if you have an extra $13.95 laying around (and if you dont, grab some of your closest droogs and steal it) go directly to a bookstore and pick it up. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Imagine a new solution for gang violence, where young hoodlums are \\"treated\\" in such a way that they are physically incapable of violence, for even a mere evil thought triggers pain and nausea. With this new Ludovico's Technique, the streets will be safe again and the overcrowded prisons will be cleared. Is this a panacea to street crime, or a coy government plot to impose its will on its people?Anthony Burgess's \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is a compelling novel whose central conflict is between the human choice of doing good or evil and a mechanical imposition of doing good. The novel begins in a dystopic world where young thugs rule the streets at night - thieving, raping, and mugging at will. Although this may been a frightening idea for readers back in 1963, this sounds strikingly familiar for any major city today. The proliferation of gang violence, insipid pop music, prostitots, and addiction to TV are mere facts of life today, so it may lose some of its edge for the modern reader.However, Ludovico's Technique deserves a much closer examination. It is this technique that forces Alex to be good, for any evil thought within him will trigger extreme nausea. Although this renders Alex impotent and harmless, there is a much darker side to this, for it has robbed him of his free will. Although he chooses evil, there is at least hope for him to reform, until he is programmed, like a robot, to do only good. Indeed, this experiment has literally put the \\"Thought Police\\" inside Alex's mind, for at the first inkling of evil his body turns on him, overcoming him with pain and nausea. Although the State claims to be doing this for the common good, this could obviously be used for more sinister purposes in an attempt to \\"condition\\" all citizens and punish them for subversive thoughts against the State. Although this never happens in the novel, the chilling possibilities remain.Although this is a compelling novel, it is also quite gimmicky. This book makes extensive use of an invented teenage slang - \\"nadsat.\\" This no doubt is confusing at first, but it enriches the novel overall. If this is too much, make use of the \\"nadsat\\" glossary. This novel also inspired a campy 1972 British film.Overall, this is a superb novel and presents a compelling moral question on free will. Although the repressive government is a mere peripheral subject, its frightening possibilities of using Ludovico's Technique for mind control make this a thought-provoking, dystopic novel."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"\\"Dad, have you ever heard of the book, \`A Clockwork Orange'?\\" I asked my father when I received the book, A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess, in the mail as my family and I sat down for dinner. \\"Kinda,\\" he responded, \\"I remembering hearing that the movie was really violent.\\" That was what persuaded me to read to book: the violence. It may sound sick and weird, but I enjoy reading books with plenty of action and some violence. But for the first time, the violence in the book actually prevented me from enjoying this book as much as I thought that I would.The book is separated into three parts. The first part immediately opens up with the narration of the main character, Alex. Alex is 15 years old and is apparently the \\"leader\\" of a gang that consists of his friends. I couldn't really figure out why Alex was the leader because each one of his friends appeared capable of being able to bring harm upon a person as much as the other. I suppose he stood out mainly because his attitude was cooler, calm, and collected than the others when he made small talk with his soon-to-be-victims. The description of how Alex and his friends commit the crimes that they do and who they do it to is the main focus in the first part, which after a few chapters, can become quite repetitive, but doesn't lose it's shock factor.The second and third parts of the book are probably what give the book it's strength because even though they contain as much violence as the first part, they're more \\"random\\" and different as oppose to the usual find an innocent person, beat or rape them, and rob them for all they're worth. Readers also witness Alex's road to recovery from being a sick menace who lives to cause to pain to someone who gets terribly sick at the smallest thought of violence.The book has its strong points and weak points. Since there are more weak than strong, I'll start with the weak points. For a book that was said as really easy to get into, I found it terribly difficult to read past the first ten pages. I feel that it was because of the weird Russian slang that was constantly used. Sometimes I could read through it because I had a basic idea of what Alex was describing, but then no more than seven words later, an even more foreign word would cross my path and I'd have to stop reading, flip to the back of the book to the dictionary section, look up the word, then flip back to where I was, and then try to get back into the plot. I feel that many readers will find this incredibly frustrating at first, until they eventually get a feel for the book and won't have to look in the back as much as they used to. I also mentioned that the amount of violence in the book kept me from fully enjoying the innovative plot. There's just too much of it! It kind of takes away from the book because either it's too much for the squeamish readers or too unnecessary or repetitive for the hardcore ones. It's a good thing that Mr. Burgess didn't rely on the violence alone for the entire plot of the book, although it is one of the main factors.This brings me to discuss one of the best parts about the book, which is the plot. As an avid reader, the plot of a book can either make it or break it for me. Never before in my entire life have I ever read a plot so vivid and detailed and I suppose, eccentric is the word for it. This book left me thinking, \\"What the Hell just happened here?\\" after every chapter. I also enjoyed how the book was separated into three parts, which is another way of separating the three main personalities and stages of Alex and his life. Another idea that I enjoyed about the book was how Alex associated classical music with violence. Classical music is often perceived as being a way for those of high society to relax and find peace. But Alex on the other hand, finds it as sort of a spark to violence and doesn't see how one can exist without the other.All in all, I recommend this book for anyone who feels that reading is boring and a waste of time. This plot will open up the minds of those with the emptiest imagination and show them a world of darkness and in a sense, confusion. One should read this when they have plenty of free time and won't be distracted easily, that way they won't be confused as much about what is happening and won't be easily aggravated by the common use of all the Russian slang words."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"...it's hard to get into, i'll admit that. it took me 3 years to get into it, to be honest.

Up there with '1984', 'The Catcher in the Rye' and 'Catch 22', its not-so-subtle jabs at authority seem to propell in into the arena of timeless college favourites. And this is not undeserved. Burgess has come up with an undeniably entertaining book that I would encourage all to read at some point, sooner rather than later. But, unfortunately, much of the criticism that has accompanied this book throughout its lifetime has been disproportionately positive.That's not to say that there aren't many positives to praise. The story is told by our \\"humble narrator\\" Alex. The 15-17 year old speaks in an initially confusing mix of English/Slavic slang (or so I'm led to believe). While the common use of words like \\"viddy\\" (to see), \\"gulliver\\" (head) or \\"cancer\\" (cigarette) may seem challenging for the first few chapters, the style will grow on you quickly, and its quirky intelligence becomes a joy to read, somehow creating a refreshingly surreal atmosphere throughout the book. And the book does boast a decent plot, veiling (albeit lightly) an important philosophy: it is better to choose evil than to be forced to do good. Individual freedoms, and \\"all that cal\\".But here is where the problem begins. The books major strengths combine, in a strange way, to leave some weaknesses. Burgess' informal and downright weird writing style do not make for the most convincing character development or philosophical power. I felt that the plot of the book would have been better served with a novel 2 or 3 times its length, in the style of a Dostoevsky or a Steinbeck. But, then again, that would mean losing its unique charm. The problem is that (and I will do my best to avoid any spoilers here, but be warned in any case) the major character development in the last chapter seems a bit hollow without any powerful/emotional scenes before it. There just doesn't seem to be a believable reason for what happens. And it's not as though there were no opportunities throughout the text to provide the basis for this revelation. The attempted suicide scene, the police beating - they were crying out for more serious undertones. Similarly, Burgess (as his American publishers did in the earlier days) could have left out the last chapter, leaving the novel relatively consistent. But that would have left its philosophy largely unproven.All this leaves a slight aftertaste of an opportunity lost for an author who never seemed to reach his prime, and it is a shame. Burgess could have written 2 separate books, each of a different style instead of trying to amalgamate them into this effort, or he could have worked a little more on consitency. In any case, I feel something lacking in here. But, despite its flaws, 'A Clockwork Orange' is an immensely enjoyable - sometimes thrilling - read which holds, without question, a rare charm and intelligence. It should be read, if nothing else, for its ideas and its originality. Above all, it should be read - but don't get caught up in the hype.Finally, for anyone it concerns, any scenes of violence or sex are a lot milder than I was expecting - so there's no real need to worry about that."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"First off, for all those looking for a clearly stated rating, or opinion, this novel was enjoyable. The characters were a bit shallow, but I contribute this to Alex's narration--because he describes the events through his perspective, he, naturally, does not see the other character's depth/thoughts, etc. His own character began as a simple character as well, but he grew (subtle actions and words hinted at a depth). Anyways, the book is a violent one, not as terribly graphic or explicit as some have said, but nevertheless, violent. Not for the kids (the immature ones, at least). I have not seen the movie myself, but from what I have heard and read (I own a version of the novel that has an introduction by Blake Morrison which speaks of the movie), the movie is a great deal more violent and explicit (so much so othat Burgess himself found it gratuitous). So. Onto my review which will discuss the book's various themes and such.Anthony Burgess tries to convey several themes, particularly the maturation of youth, the importance of freewill, and the relationship of high art with refinement. Alex's character in the beginning of the novel was a petulant and selfish adolescent whose fun included rape and drugs. The government and society tried severely to discipline and control the wild youth. All of their attempts, including incarceration and post-corrective advisers, were in vain and Alex returned to his old ways. Despite Alex's troublemaking, he established early in the novel his desire to learn from his elders, \\"to slooshy what some of these starry decreps had to say about life and the world\\" (Lee, p.12). This shows that rebellious teen actually hears the preaching and \\"nagging\\" that is told to him by adults, and that there is hope that may reform.At the end of A Clockwork Orange (after the Ludovico technique and its failure), subtle changes had emerged in his character-he felt bored and hopeless and didn't participate as much in committing the actual violence. After some other changes, it is revealed that Alex keeps a photograph of a baby with him, now clearly showing his transformation. Then his meeting with Pete and Georgina show Alex that it was time to mature and leave his youth. **Nadsat (the slang terms he uses), I have found are used to represent the \\"wildness of youth\\". Note that Dim, who despite growing up (physically) continues to partake in violence as a police officer, and still uses nadsat. Vis-a-vis, Pete no longer does, and has in fact settled down and has become a father.** Alex had grown up, and in the process, fully left his violent ways. Youth is meant to be wild, admitting that Alex's youth is an exaggeration, and the only cure is age. In the words of Blake Morrison, \\"Youth...must have its fling, however wild.\\"The second theme within A Clockwork Orange is the importance of freewill. The government and society attempted to solve the growing problem of teenager related crimes by suppressing their freewill (Ludovico's technique). This however, as shown in the book, was no solution. Alex (the technique's first subject) still had violent thoughts and wanted to do bad things, he just couldn't physically act out. So then, was he a good person? No. The actual act is not what makes something immoral, it is the intent (as with a young child who unknowingly injures someone).Finally, often those who enjoy classical music, are affluent or are intellectual are thought to be better. There is a general notion that high art civilizes. However the men that ran Auschwitz read Shakespeare and appreciated Beethoven and Bach (A Clockwork Orange, introduction by Blake Morrison, xiii). There is a stereotype that enjoying the arts makes one better morally and socially, and as displayed in A Clockwork Orange, this is not true."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange has to be one of the best books I have ever read in my life. I am the type of reader that will pick up a book and if it's good, it will become my new favorite. I can honestly say that A Clockwork Orange hasn't been topped since I read it earlier this year. I originally started the book last year, but with my busy schedule, I didn't have time to finish it. This year was a different story, I could not put the book down. Burgess' use of the NADSAT language filled with the vile images leaves you with a life long memory of it all. I don't have one problem with this book, I can't say that about many things. I have reread it now a couple of times and is falling apart with all the notes I have taken in it. It has such a deep meaning that can be topped by very few books. I give this book my ultimate rating."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Anthony Burgess has committed a great act of selfishness, which has in turn become a masterpeice. There is no box for Anthony Burgess.Burgess has taken the English language and made it his own. In difference from other authors, Burgess has used English as a basis, rather than a guideline, to create a new art. Using his own words and style, he has become something special that is deserving of praise.The Novel Itself. All in all, A Clockwork Orange is an amazing work. The story of a troubled nadsat (teenager) who is caught in the act and sentenced to punishment. Yet, Alex (the main character) gets more than he ever bargained for. He is subjected to a new form of correction used by the government only to be released to a changed world that rejects him real skorry (quickly). Alex soon finds himself back he began (in a sense, that is), only to be enlightened by part of his beginning. The story proves to be very circular, yet un-repetitive in a very masterful way.Philosophy. Burgess quietly challenges the world within his story. Is it fair to force someone to do the right thing, rather than to let them choose? Which is better: a world of forced good or a world of independence? You'll see both the author, protagonist, and main other characters challenge these questions.The Human Brain AND A Clockwork Orange. Due to Burgess wonderfully unique style of writing, this novel allows the reader to tap into him- or herself. As Burgess uses many of his new, invented words (such as: veck, droog, itty, viddy, etc.) we can see ourselves becoming accustomed to them and understanding what they mean. It excites the brain on the thought that we are learning a new language, and thus brings back childhood illusions. Burgess knows precisely how to use his new words and when an explanation is needed. Remarkable.A Clockwork Orange should be read by all intellectuals at one point or another. It does not take long, but we must read it with an open mind realizing that we will have to do some thinking ourselves, as well as some accepting. Make sure (if you're planning on reading A Clockwork Orange) that you have the original British version that includes a Seventh Chapter in the last section of the book. Originally, when this book was brought to America, the last chapter was omitted (also was it omitted in the film adaptation of the book). The Norton Paperback Edition includes this last chapter."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This is Burgess's most famous novel, largely to the controversial treatment of it by Kubrick. As with most famous novels, there is the danger of disappointment because they are so hyped up. This was the case with me, until I was about halfway through. Then, because it was sufficiently different from the movie, I realised that it was good beyond the hype. And overall, it is the fact that Burgess has condensed quite a lot of ideas onto about 150 easy pages that makes this book a great read. If it was much longer (like so many other thematic books of novels-of-ideas) it would lose its tolchok...Speaking of tolchoks, this would be the most challenging part of the novel - nadsat. The narrator is Alex, a juvenile delinquent living in a somewhat not-too-distant-and-certainly-dystopian future, where Britain is quite close to being a police state and where crime is such that the &quot;delinquencies&quot; of little Alex involve rape, murder and other examples of ultra-violence. Furthermore, the teens in this future speak nadsat, a slang peppered with Russian expressions. The first page should be quite a shock to those who don't know Russian (and if like me you do know it, there's the feature of figuring out what Russian word the Anglicised string of letters is meant to symbolise). Anyhow, you can think of it as a cloze passage and in a few pages, you should be fluent. If not, there are excellent resources on the internet, such as Wikipedia's nadsat entry. As for the purpose of this deliberate difficulty, it's actually worthwhile in highlighting the superficial and brutal subculture Alex lives in.The novel is divided into three parts. Part 1 is Alex and his friends running amok and basically doing what they like. Part 2 is Alex in prison, and the famous Ludovico's &quot;rehabilitation&quot; technique. Part 3 is Alex back in the world, with a difference.The book is seen to explore free-will and the choice to do good and evil. As such, we climb into the head of someone who would most likely be described as a sociopath in conventional terms. He commits acts of violence simply because this is what he genuinely enjoys. And to go against the stereotype of the low-IQ bum, Alex is considerably intelligent and has a true passion for classical music. This sets up the background of a world-gone-mad. Then, Alex is treated with a technique that physically conditions him to be unable to do harm to anyone. Of course, the prison chaplain is against this but according to the Minister of the Interior, at least it will help in the seemingly-hopeless fight against violence.Alex immediately becomes front-page material and a political pawn from all sides of the spectrum. Burgess examines the nature of our society, where politics and public perception are at the heart of every issue, and where both sides can become involved in dirty and partisan tactics. Also, the inconsistencies of the way society brings people up, incarcerates, punishes and attempts to rehabilitate criminals is a major idea.The good thing is that it is unclear to me what moral lesson Burgess was actually attempting to espouse. He really lets the reader draw their own conclusions, more so than most writers. Finally, some of the early editions cut the last chapter, making the novel more edgy and dark (this is the case in the film). The last chapter (part 3, chapter 7) is an actual resolution. People have argued whether it makes the novel better or not. I think it does make it better because it casts irony on the tortuous attempts to rehabilitate Alex. But try to get an edition with the last chapter so you can see what Burgess intended originally.Because it seems that somehow, violence is still with us *just a bit*, and the Clockwork opens up the recesses of evil and not-so-evil and its such a concise read makes it a great novel of the 20th century, and more original than many other dystopias."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I loved it. It's strange and often times grotesque but so fascinating it's difficult to put down...even when you're done.

Everyone says without it the book it &quot;bastardized&quot;.

The main character, Alex, is a violent teenager who enjoys bringing pain to other humans. He is not scared by the law or threat of jail time. The only action that has any affect on Alex also takes away his free will. Through the treatment Alex is turned into a zombie and can no longer think for himself nor can he act on his thoughts. Eventhough the treatment turns Alex into a non-violent human he is no longer his own person. The question that came to my mind while reading the book was, is it better to be forced into being a good person, or be yourself?"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange is a good book in many ways, but it falls short of being an enduring masterpiece. Anthony Burgess himself was chagrined that this book became his best known novel, its fame assured by Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation. The book has an imaginative first-person writing style that is replete with a slang built mostly from Russian words. This edition contains a twenty-first chapter that had been removed from the first American edition of the book. In his introduction, Burgess rails bitterly against this omission, but I have to say that I agree with the American editor. Chapter 21 transforms the book from a disturbing vision of the future into an overly simplistic allegory on human nature. Burgess' message? That the urge to violence and destruction is natural and unavoidable among the youth of a decaying society, but they'll grow out of it and become productive, nurturing adults (I guess Burgess forgot about such grownups as Hitler and Stalin). It is an oddly weak note on which to end one of the most forceful and disturbing novellas of the 20th century."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Burgess, like Camus, has the ability to take a subject, like youth, and push it to its logical extreme. All kids, and especially the children of today, are faced with choices about sex, drugs and violence. Burgess shows both the danger of the presence of these choices as well as the danger of their absence, all in the same novel. Like Golding, Burgess is intelligent enough to know that by making children the protagonists of his work, he forces the reader to consider man's underlying nature. If all you have to say about this book is, IT WAS VIOLENT, or, I GAVE UP AFTER A FEW CHAPTERS, then do everyone else a favor and spare us your review."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"After following a few violent days in the life of Alex, the anti-hero of Anthony Burgess' A Clockwork Orange, and his friends (his \`droogs' in the slang of the time), we're obviously supposed to be shocked when we he declares, after murdering an elderly woman, \\"And me still only fifteen..\\"Yawn.Maybe when written in 1962 this was shocking. Post-Columbine High School, most people have become numb to violent acts committed by children. The fact that Alex and his gang's favorite pastimes are spreading terror, theft, and rape, may even seem tame by today's standards. Yet we should be appalled, none the less. Not at his age, but with the cavalier attitude towards death and the destruction of the lives of others.It is a well known fact that Burgess was dismayed at the success of A Clockwork Orange. In the introduction to the 1986 reprint, which included the \\"missing\\" 21st chapter, never published in the United States before (more on that later), Burgess says he would \\"be glad to disown it for various reasons, but that is not permitted.\\" While ACO survives, other works of his that he values more, \\"bite the dust.\\" Such is the life of an artist. Our humble narrator is a 15-year old leader of a small gang of droogs. The four spend their after-school hours wreaking as much havoc as they can muster. Of course, boys being boys, someone has to lead the pack.As the result of a power struggle within the little group, during a bungled robbery attack, Alex takes one across the glazlids, and is left blinded for the police to pick him up.Though sentenced to spend 15 years in prison, a stroke of luck gives Alex the opportunity to participate in a new experimental aversion treatment for violent criminals. He emerges from prison a changed, if not particularly new, man. The violent impulses are still there, but he is overwhelmed by nausea whenever they rear their ugly head.Enter Politics.Now a \\"victim\\" of the state, the opposition political party that is fighting the government's recent crackdown on violent crime seizes upon Alex's plight. He becomes their poster child for overthrowing the oppressive regime in the next elections. Tormented by his present condition, Alex attempts suicide by leaping from a window. His failure only draws attention to the issue (the opposition is delighted) but prods the government into righting its previous &quot;wrong&quot; by changing Alex back to his old self.\\"I was cured all right,\\" the original American version ended. So now our little droog is back to the way he was; violent, chaotic free will and hormones raging. Ready to prey on society once again, only now with a good paying government job from his new friends.The new version or, perhaps I should say, the original version (now available in the U.S.) has an entirely different ending. In the final chapter, our \\"young thuggish protagonist grows up. He feels bored with violence and recognises that human energy is better expended on creation rather than destruction.\\" This version, Burgess believes, is a true novel as it is founded on the principle that human beings change. The old American version was a fable as are all fictional works that fail to show change in human character.The prison chaplain, who befriends Alex, puts it succinctly when he says, \\"When a man ceases to choose, he ceases to be a man... It may be horrible to be good.\\"He warns the pre-treatment Alex, \\"You are passing now to a region where you will be beyond the reach of the power of prayer. A terrible terrible thing to consider. And yet, in a sense, in choosing to be deprived of the ability to make an ethical choice, you have in a sense really chosen the good. So I shall like to think.&quot;Burgess, like his jailhouse preacher, is a strong believer in free will. They are appalled that government could decide to take away one's ability to make decisions between right and wrong. If that happens, a person is no longer a person and the fact that they will no longer harm anyone else is secondary to the fact they have been harmed themselves. Then what is the point of punishing criminal behavior?Which brings us to the final, omitted (dare I say censored?) chapter. In the original novella, and the revised American version, Burgess' character has a sort of realization that maybe the life of violence he has lead is not the right way. Maybe he should even get married and have kids - not that he would be able to control them any more than his parents did him, but just maybe... Is this a true conversion in Alex? Or is it the idle prattle of a common street thug? Burgess intends for us to believe that it's the beginnings of a true change.Suppose it is. That's not a hard thesis to support. Alex himself recognizes that something is changing. \\"There is something happening inside me,\\" he says, \\"and I wondered if it was like some disease or if it was what they had done to me...\\" But Burgess fails to take the cue from his own character.Perhaps out of resentment for the original omission of his last chapter, Burgess refuses to even recognize that maybe it was the punishment he received that has lead to the new Alex. Instead, he gives all the credit to Alex's free will. Perhaps. After all, as he says, \\"The important thing is moral choice. Evil has to exist along with good, in order that moral choice may operate.\\"And so it must."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Favorite book of all time. It's so dark and morbid yet so light and human. It is the perfect metaphor for life, humanity, civilization, love and just about everything else you can think of. The slang is strange but you'll pick it up after a while. Most people probably won't get it. It doesn't have action or romance at all. It's hard to explain. Just get the book, and if you don't like it, blame me."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I really liked this book although it was probably the most obscure writing that I have ever read. It was very entertaining though and I would read it again without question."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Although this is a cult classic, despite how popular it has become, I can't believe it will ever be mainstream. I saw the film numerous times in my less-literate punk-rock influenced youth, which does follow the book closely enough--up to a certain point. However, as is usually the case with books subsequently made into films, \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" far exceeds Kubrick's interpretation (of whom I am a fan, but \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is certainly not his best film). Enough about Kubrick--going forward, I studied Russian for 2 years, so I understand the most common words of simple Russian that Burgess converted into his slang speak. So I'm glad I read the book after having studied Russian, instead of before. Which is not to say that I would have been lost with knowing any Russian. Despite the unique ambiance created by the \\"Nadsatsprache\\", the overarching theme of the author's disillusioned view of humanity takes precedence. Alex is more precocious that any 15 year old I've ever known. However, since he inhabits a vaguely futuristic dystopic society, I'll assume that the youth of that world grow up even faster than in our current time. A 15 year old with violent tendencies who listens to classical music also seems oxymoronic--especially in the context of the present day, when the notion of the \\"classical arts\\" is fading into oblivion more quickly than ever. Nonetheless, in the case of Burgess's fully fleshed out and credible pseudo-fascistic-fantasma-fantasy world, suspension of disbelief becomes that much easier. And Alex is a classic anti-hero, a leader with a fierce, aggressive intellect, ironically probably the same kind of person that becomes a CEO, which would involve taming the wild animal (IE Alex) with the proper indoctrination so that he grows up to become a powerful, albeit mainstream, and savage corporate beast. After all, nature rewards aggression, provided that impulse can be correctly channeled--ultimately, \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" ponders the possibility of finding that balance. The final chapter does hint that the previously anti-social characters of this world will be absorbed into mainstream society.Stephen C. Bird, author of \\"Hideous Exuberance: A Satire\\""},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Anthony Burgess is one of my favorite writers. He is an extraordinary novelist, essayist, and a very interesting (though overly pompous at times) person. He wrote over 40 novels during his lifetime, which is remarkable considering he didn't start until his late 30's. This is (obviously) his most famous novel, which he found somewhat annoying, as there were other books he was most proud of, but it's still a great novel, worthy of all its praise. I especially like this new edition, which eliminated the Nadsat glossary (which was included in the initial American version of the book), and it reinstates the 21st chapter, which Kubrick didn't know about until filming was well under way. The final chapter works very well. It makes perfect sense that Alex would indeed grow weary of his punk/violent teenage days. Occasionally, people refuse to grow up, but more often than not, they do mature and decide that things they did as youths were ridiculous and naive. Youth, in my opinion, has always been terribly overrated (something Burgess agrees with), and that as one grows in experience and time, wisdom comes (for most, anyway), and that the silliness of youth can be set aside for a more intelligent, thoughtful, and open minded stance on life. I feel the older you get, the more liberal and open minded you become, because you see more things and feel more things. I really do like that final chapter quite a bit.Ironically, when the novel was released in Britain, the reviews were brutal, especially over the Nadsat language. The reviewers felt that Burgess was committing sacrelige on the English language (which was ridiculous). The American critics, however, loved the work, praising it for its vision and its inventions in language. The American publisher did insist on adding the glossary (against Burgess's wishes), and cutting off the final chapter, which they felt softened Burgess's argument. The final chapter makes it more of a fable (something Burgess talks about in his new intro \\"A Clockwork Orange Resucked\\"), but without the final chapter, the ending is creepier and more ambiguous. Usually it's the opposite with editing for an American audiences. Publishers/distributors dumb down for American audiences (when I don't think they should), but here, dropping the final chapter did make the ending darker.The book and the film should be read and seen as often as possible. Kubrick wouldn't have been able to make such a great film without such strong source material. And the differences between the film and the book are quite minor compared to most other adaptations. Read the book, see the film, and repeat."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"fantastic once you get the hang of the language and slang. Suggestion--watch the movie first to put a face with the characters. The movie is but a fraction of the book, so it won't spoil anything. LOVE IT!!!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book raises an eternal and crucial problem of ethical philosophy - the problem of free will, of free human choice between Good and Evil. Can a person be forced to be virtuous? Vladimir Solovyev, a great Russian philosopher of the nineteenth century, wrote that an intent of the law is not to transform a human being into an angel but to prevent their transmutation into a devilish beast. The government officials in Anthony Burgess' distopia conducted a forced metamorphosis of a morally brute protagonist into some celestial critter incapable of doing any harm. The result is deplorable: produced Clockwork Orange, whom nobody needs except some unscrupulous politicians, can not survive in society based on lie and violence. Forced Good is ephemeral and powerless before Evil.The last chapter gives a new dimension, new profundity to the story. Good, which was impossible to inculcate from without, appears uncoerced within the depth of the soul of adult hero supplanting Evil and Hate. The novel is full of violence but it gives a hope: the author believes in an ultimate triumph of Good in human being.The language of the novel is positively unique. For those who know both English and Russian its reading is a pure pleasure. The author spells Russian words (sometimes slightly transformed) in English letters and uses them with Russian meanings but under the rules of English grammar. The result is stupendous: such exquisite inter-language play of words, such splendid construction of sentences I've never met. However, Russian translation of 'A Clockwork Orange' is rather lackadaisical, and that only confirms novel's inimitable originality."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This is, quite frankly, an amazing book. It has myriad levels it can be read upon: the language exercise of Nadsat(and of course that one great spot when the doctor drops the knowledge of how English got Russified...&quot;propaganda....subliminal diffusion&quot;), the sociopathic joyride of the violence itself(and violent entertainment is NOT NOT NOT bad in itself...aggressive people seek out violent entertainment, it does not create them), the black comedy just beneath the skin of the book, a deep look into the merits of quick-and-easy rehabilitation in punishment, as a serious discussion about free will, as an iconoclastic trashing of all authority, and on several more levels. Its cheeky nihilism is absolutely infectious(and a bit scary).My only complaint is with all those who believe that the last chapter is essential; I can take it or leave it. The benefits are of creating a real sense of closure to the book, of proposing that it actually ain't so bad as the book said, and sending a moral message. However, the last chapter also creates some inconsistencies with the rest of the book. It seems very tacked-on, as there was absolutely NO evidence of anything of the sort about to happen in any of the other chapters, and it also is inconsistent with a previous scene or two: though he says that as people age and mature, they eventually give up on this destruction, notice that the intellectual old men are as bad to Alex as any of his old droogs. My suggestion? Read to Chapter 20, stop, and reflect over the whole book. Wait a few minutes for it to all sink in in that form, and _then_ read Chapter 21 as an addendum, as it does have some things to add.Despite that little quibble, though, it's an absolutely horrorshow book, and every veck and devotchka should read every single slovo of it. What a book!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Screw all the talk about politics and youth culture in the world when reading this book. Throw out the reviews, good or bad, especially when they mention the graphic ultra-violence and sex which is very comman throughout. Instead, sit back, relax, grab a cup of joe, and enjoy a funny, sarcastic, and exciting book from Anthony Burgess.The story is about a young man named Alex. He is the leader of a group of droogs, or a gang of friends as it seems, who spend they're nights getting stoned on milk laced with drugs, beating up defensless people, and raping women. Perhaps none of this seems very funny, especially in this day and age when violent crimes are becomming more common, but the language and humor that Burgess puts in the mind of his humble narrator, Alex, makes it nerely impossible to resist. Even during Alex's darkest days the book's humor is kept in tact by the charisma, charm, and almost poetic languge used by our Humble narrator. and P.S., make sure you pick up the newest copy when buying in the states...and older version won't have the final 21st chapter..."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"When it comes to so-called classic literature, sometimes it's difficult to differentiate the truly ingenious material from the weirdly pretentious. In the case of Clockwork Orange, I think Anthony Burgess is dancing very merrily along the thin line that separates the two.I won't pad my review by rehashing the plot as so many others have already, but I do want to address a couple things. First, there's the frequent use of certain Russian slang/gibberish which the reader is assaulted with from the very first page. To some it may seem contrived and jarring, but if you plod through it long enough it becomes second nature with the help of context clues and it really does give the main character of Alex a distinct voice as Your Humble Narrator. I can be very impatient, so if I can get through it, anyone else should be able to. However, I don't feel there was much else to go on in terms of why I should care about or feel for Alex, and this is where I feel as if having seen the movie first works as an advantage. Clockwork Orange strikes me as a very visual story, and the Stanley Kubrick film adaptation really went over the top with its disturbing sexual imagery and bizarre costumes and set pieces. Love it or hate it, it sticks in your mind. In the novel, which I realize came first of course, Alex comes off an \\"everyman\\" and is quite forgettable once you close the cover, and is overall quite tame in terms of sex and violence.Thematically speaking I also felt the film version had the bigger impact. Maybe the whole idea of good and bad and the choices each one presents is better illustrated visually than on paper, I don't know, but perhaps Burgess tried to be a little too deep and profound which caused the whole thing to build up only to fall flat at the end, whereas the film presented it in a wink-wink, nudge-nudge kind of way all along. I will give props to the book for presenting a number of memorable and thought provoking quotes on the subject though, which I have since passed on to my friends for discussion.In itself, Clockwork Orange was not a bad read. It's a unique and imaginative social commentary and I can certainly see why it's heralded as a classic. But because of its inflated reputation and the fact I had the film so ingrained into my brain going into it, I suppose I couldn't help but be slightly underwhelmed. Still, I'm reluctant to come right out and say the movie is better at the risk of sounding like I don't \\"get it\\" because I most certainly do. I just happen to think the visuals of the movie enhance the characters and theme. In fact I'd probably recommend checking out both in order to get the fullest understanding of what's going on, because one helps to fill in the gaps of the other."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"You would think that it would be impossible to write a book about a 15-year old rapist/murderer and somehow have him come out as a sympathetic character. Burgess has achieved that remarkable feat in this book. The genius of it is in the use of the first person and in the use of slang to give voice to Alex. The slang also serves to make the violence almost comical as instead of kicking someone in the mouth, Alex describes giving a tolchok into the rot and knocking out a few zoobies. So even though the book is full of violence and rape, the language removes us from it in such a way that the book feels less violent than it is. Although this may seem like it would make the book hard to read, it all makes sense when read in context.The story itself is a fairly simple and fast read. If you have seen the movie then (other than the last chapter) you know what happens in the book. Alex and his friends commit violent crimes, Alex gets arrested, he gets cured of his violence and then gets cured of the cure. The movie follows the book almost exactly. The key difference is that the original American edition left out the last chapter (the American publisher thought it was a sellout as Burgess explains in the introduction) and Kubrick followed the American edition of the book. Is the last chapter a sellout? Does it cheapen the book? I think it changes the story to some extent. Burgess suggested that it changed the book from a fantasy into a novel. I think this overstates it but if you have read the American edition without the last chapter then you need to read it again with the last chapter.The book is a classic and should be required reading. Although adult in concept and story line, anyone old enough to read the daily paper is old enough to read this book. Beneath all the violence in the book, Burgess is trying to make a point about free will and what it means to be human but he doesn't overstate it. The story and the language carry the reader and the message is just there to do with as you please. As Burgess says in the introduction, \\"Eat this sweetish segment or spit it out. You are free.\\""},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"My all time favorite book. Burgess's novel beats the movie 100 x's more (and Kubrick's film happens to be my #1 favorite movie as well so that means I really love this book). The book is alot more sickening and explicit than the film , you really get a feeling of nausea while reading it...and that hasn't happened with any other book i've read. While the film loaded it with artsy filmaking and a bizzare musical score. The book is an energetic bleak look into sadism and ultraviolence. Droogs who violently rape and pillage their community without sympathy and care..just for the sick pleasure of it speak in nadstat style of slang that is very difficult to understand while reading , but it contains a handy glossary. Alex leads this group as the humble narrarator is sent to be reformed by the government in which he can no longer choose violence , but his victims can. Burgess ask \\"what cost?\\" and \\"whats the price we pay for conformity\\". However unlike the movie , the film's final and until the reissue was ommitted ending features Alex looking back on his life and wanting a family of his own. Through all his tolchoking and nastyness he is human afterall which was the message all along. Alex was human and if he stayed \\"reformed\\" he would have been nothing more than \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" ripe and healthy on the outside , mechanical and programmed on in the inside..leaving him freedomless and without choice..which the government has no right to do. Very thought provoking work."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This version of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" opens with an historical controversy in the forward and introduction. The forward is written by the author, Anthony Burgess, and tells his story of the initial publication of what he calls his prized novella. Burgess claims that the U.S. publisher forced the exclusion of the twenty-first chapter, which added a psychological twist to the ending. The publisher, in the introduction, then claims that dropping chapter twenty-one was merely a suggestion and not a condition of publication. Regardless of how this actually played out originally, I think it's obvious by the end of this book that the additional final chapter in question would have been better off left on the cutting room floor.This novel does have much to recommend it including a famous movie version, sans the added chapter twenty-one, and a reputation as a classic horror story. Written in 1962 and intended as a dark vision of the future of mind control, it does work towards this purpose to a certain extent. However, it is also an exercise in cryptography as much of the included slang is as indecipherable as it is obsequiously obfuscating. Perhaps this was what it took forty years ago to get these descriptions of violence and sex to be acceptable to the publishing industry, although the film was still rated X. The result is that much of the book reads as if it was in a foreign language, which while it provided added interest to the story for me will probably be off-putting to the more typical reader.The appended chapter twenty-one actually detracts from the impact of the story in a weak attempt to turn it into a fable on the human condition. It turns a fairly interesting psychological study of violence and destructiveness in the young into a simplistic fantasy. This fantasy involves the false dichotomy between right and wrong in human behavior. The implication being that maturity and social consciousness are determined by age and an evolution of individual thought processes that occurs somewhat naturally. This elevates a very minor subsidiary effect on personality to an overriding importance that only wishful thinking can preserve. The central character not only changes his point of view and approach to the world completely in the added final chapter, but he does this with no deterministic external nurturing event to spur him on towards change.The result is that this amounts to a quaint fantasmagorical fable in which nature runs rampant over nurture. The moral of the story being that all individual actions depend solely on internal motivations, even in this extreme case where external events seem to drive the entire storyline. This book is much more effective as an allegory without the addition of the twenty-first chapter, which is probably why the publisher, and Stanley Kubrick in his film version, quite correctly decided it was best left out. It appears to be a clear case of an author not being able to see the forest for the trees and yearning for the addition of a legacy ending that detracts at least as severely from the story for the reader as it adds some warm cuddly nostalgia for him. Editors and publishers apparently do serve a purpose sometimes and this updated version of an old story proves that point definitively."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"If you are looking for a simple and straightforward novel, then this is not it.This is a piece of literature as art by the talented British writer Anthony Burgess (1917 to 1993). I got interested in Burgess from his non-fiction works on Shakespeare and Joyce.Even the title here is complex, and According to Burgess himself, the title is from an old Cockney expression \\"as queer as a clockwork orange. Burgess wrote in his later that a creature who can only perform good or evil is \\"a clockwork orange -- meaning that he has the appearance of an organism lovely with color and juice, but is in fact only a clockwork toy to be wound up by God or the Devil; or the almighty state.\\"So, the novel is about good and evil and as a vehicle he uses a young man Alex, who leads a life of crime and random violence including rape. He sets the story in the future but using realism. Alex narrates the tale and does so in a language called \\"Nadstat\\" which is not English but a sort of street slang. That adds to the ambiance or flavour or setting of the story.The novel contains three parts: the narrative on Alex and his illegal activity or street crimes, the imprisonment and attempted rehabilitaion of Alex, and finally the retribution of his victims.What does it all mean? First and foremost it is a work of art so keep that in mind. It includes various themes such as the power struggles between old and young generations, the corruption of social institutions, and politics. It is supposed to make us think about the direction of society as a whole."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book Is amazing!!! The way Burgess creates his own slang and original character personas is only a few aspects of his writing. I recomend it to everyone. But to the point of this review, the book is essential with the 21st Chapter, its shows the coming of age in Alex's personality, and it definately humanizes him, makes him very relatable. And that is how Burgess wanted the book to be read."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Anthony Burgess has envisioned an ugly potential future that came to be. In addition to such writers as George Orwell and Aldous Huxley, British authors seem to be the masters of creating fiction which predicts the worst possible societal, political, and cultural decay, based on contemporary observations of the latest trends in these three factors. In Clockwork Orange, Mr. Burgess portrays what was for him, a near-future Britain, in which economic failure, inept and corrupt government, and social malaise result in a society overwhelmed by crime. The main perpetrators are vast numbers of street-gangs roaming the cities, savagely assaulting, robbing, murdering, raping, and vandalizing...for fun. The gangs are largely composed of teenagers, who aside from their random violence, are also obsessed with drug-abuse and pop-culture, a pop-culture with its own trendy slang-language (based on Russian in this case). This scenario, exists now, in certain neighborhoods of specific cities! The vision did come true!The main character and narrator, is Alex, an average street-thug, who describes graphically the psychopathic crimes commited by his gang. Despite his vile behavior, one can't help but find a certain charisma in Alex. His one positive attribute seems to be his love of classical music, Beethoven specifically.Alex eventually finds himself in prison, and volunteers for an experimental \\"treatment\\" in exchange for early release. This turns out to be a form of operant-conditioning, which programs him to be violently ill whenever he feels compelled to violence. The government endorses this new method, so as to make space for \\"political prisoners\\", by releasing \\"treated\\" street criminals. The result: Alex is released into a crime-ridden society, completely unable to defend himself! This becomes the major philosophical point of the story. The most disturbing fact is that some bureaucrats really do believe such concepts are an acceptable means of \\"establishing control\\".Get the unabridged version of this book WITH ALL 21 CHAPTERS. Some time ago, the American version was very foolishly published with only 20 chapters! I didn't get to read the last chapter until 1995!The film version, is a Stanley Kubrik classic, but is based on the abridged version of the story. The film was banned in Britain for quite some time because film-goers were emulating the behavior in the movie!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I'm not crazy about Anthony Burgess, but I hate this book in particular. Yes, the invented English dialect is clever, and the questions about the nature of free will are dealt with literary flair, but this story leaves me asking 'so what?'. Burgess has written a glossy, sexy, faced paced novel that appears to dazzle teenage boys especially. I don't feel, however, that there is much meat to the book once you get past all the titillating aspects of the language and the violence. The ideas about free will are not original, nor are they approached in a new way. You could find the exact same questions and concepts in countless other works, many written much better(like Milton, Shakespear, Godwin,&amp; Byron). This is just one of many novels written by a white Brit or American guy that has lots of cool testosterone driven imagary and a sort of limpid simplistic philosophical lesson about big government and/or human nature. These books came out in abundance from about the 1930's up through the 1960's, and cannot be properly understood with out taking who wrote them and when into context. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is a good book and worth reading, but I don't like it. Mabey because I'm a girl, I can't relate to it. Alot of other girls I know don't like it either, but every guy loves it. Perhaps it should be presented as a story about men; men's choices, men's alienation, men in power. That is, white Anglo men. Not society in general."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I read Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange. I enjoyed the book very much. The story is will developed, and it is written in a creative way. Anthony Burgess uses many words pulled from other languages to replace ordinary everyday English words. For example he uses the word \\"krovvy\\" to replace the word blood. There is a Glossary of Nadsat Language in the back of the book. At first the words make it difficult to comprehend what is happening. The first couple of chapters I had to keep flipping back to the Glossary. Then I got the hang of the words. Not only do the different words make it an interesting read, but he also has a creative style of writing.The story is the first person view of a young boy named Alex. It is about how he and his friends, droogies, like to walk the streets and beat people up. Unfortunately for Alex all the trouble comes back on him. Anthony Burgess uses Alex's story to get across many points depending upon how much one wants to reads into the story. Burgess refers to the change in times and how the police abuse their powers by cracking down too hard. The story is violent, but does not go into details too much to gross someone out. I am not one who likes to read a lot, but I certainly liked this book. I would recommend this book more to males even if they do not like to read."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I won't go into detail about this book, 577 people have beat me to it.

I think that, for one, made the book much more difficult to truly get into.Most obnoxious however is the slang language used by the teens of the book. It was good idea as a device to help take the reader to another time and place, but let's get real...words like bezoomny, slooshy, and klootch may be taking it a bit too far. I found them distracting.On the positive side, the book does a great job of raising a potentially realistic social issue."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"In a horrific, futuristic view of the world, Anthony Burgess takes us on a turbulent ride through the mind of a seemingly psychopathic teenager. But is he really a psychopath? This is the question that Burgess poses to his readers. Is he so far off from what everyone begins as? Is he just the manifestation of the thoughts which run through all teenagers before they are taken over by the system? Alex, the main character, goes through a complete metamorphosis from his violent, gang ways to being a &quot;good little boy&quot; after going through prison and experimentation due to his murdering an innocent woman. Watch what happens when something so full of the juice of life is turned into a machine - when he is turned into a clockwork orange.I recommend this book to anyone willing to read. But be prepared to think, because that's what this book forces you to do."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"'A Clockwork Orange' is an interesting book that has become a classic for the wrong reasons. First, it is a classic because the film is so famous. Second, it is not a classic because of what the book is trying to say, but a classic because of the grotesque material in the story. Personally, I didn't think it was that great, but one should read it for curiosity."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"it has such a funny title when i saw the title i DTTGLOL(Dropping To The Ground Laughing Out Loud)but after i finished reading it at nightime in my bed i SCBIWVS(Started Crying Because I Was Scared) this book rocks like tottaly"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This, my dear droogi, is a book about the best in ultra-violence. Relax to the soothing sounds of Ludwig Van B, and a ptitza or two completely nogoy.Bonus: if you've seen the movie (Kubrick really did do a horoshiy job on that) you'll be surprised to find out that there is a chapter past the end of the movie, worth reading.Read this kniga!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This review is from: A Clockwork Orange (Norton Critical Editions) (Paperback)This novel is as relevant today as it was when it was first written. Alex, the sociopath, is a case study into gang members today. And his treatment by the government a metaphor for how the government addresses crime, treating the effect and not he cause. If you haven't read this book, you should. It is an eye-opener."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"So much of what we read in this book we see around us today. The gangs where members have no parents and make the gang their family. The violence that comes from living in a violent world. Government remedies that treat the effect, not the cause for the crime. This is a must read!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I don't like gratutitous violence, but this novella is justified in including everything it does. Burgess has an incredibly funny writing style and I often found myself laughing out loud at his descriptions then subsequently becoming horrified at the situation at which I was laughing. It isn't a pretty book, or a pleasant one, but it does make you think hard about humans."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Alex is a 15 year old hooligan in a nightmarish England of the future. He and his droogs (fellow delinquents) roam the streets at night performing acts of untraviolence and the old in-out, then retire to milk bars and listen to classical music. Eventually Alex is captured by the authorities and undergoes Ludovico's Technique, a form of brainwashing that makes him ill when he considers violence.The most original feature of this book is, of course, the language that Burgess created for his characters. It's sort of a bastardized Slavic slang. It makes it hard to orient yourself at first, but most of the vocabulary can be gleaned from context.What makes the book great, is it's recognition of the central dilemma of man's existence--&quot;Does God want goodness or the choice of goodness? Is a man who chooses the bad perhaps in some way better than a man who has good imposed upon him?&quot; Burgess concludes, as I think one must, that it is better to have the choice of good or evil, than to have a society which controls its citizens so completely that &quot;good behavior&quot; is imposed from without.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I've read &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; about 5 times now, and I'm yet to find a book with such great use of language as Anthony Burgess has done here. The tale of neighborhood punks that drink milk laced with drugs, and go into the night (&quot;Shopcrasting&quot; as Alex DeLarge says)raping, brutally abusing, and even killing people. This is a great outlook onto the future that Mr. Burgess has done with this novel. I would recommend this novel to anyone over the age of 13, because of the extreme violence."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"What a wonderful book, if you like reading about violent and graphic rapes, beatings, and the inner destruction of man- which I do like reading about. Only Burgess could conjure up a story so incredible, so vivid and disturbing that one could actually enjoy reading it. The language, by far, is the best since Shakespeare picked up a quill. Read this awesome book and it'll make you think twice the next time you think about methods of being nice."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This is because it\`s slowly creeping up to be prothetic. It is a wonderful, well written book, with an abunance of scenes which are moving and engrosssing. Its language gives it a certain edge, it is both extremely funny and enlightning."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Make no mistake, this is what defines a groundbreaking book. Depsite its dirty, metropolis-like setting, A Clockwork Orange is a story tinged with both extreme violence and extreme tenderness, symbolised in the pscychotic teen Alex's love of the work of Beethoven, Brahms and Mozart. Burgess goes beneath conventional prophetic writing to tell a tale that contains a lot more than just the usual &quot;The Future is History&quot; message. He writes like a genius, in a language both intriguing and gripping, a language the reader can latch onto in an instant, a direct result of Burgess' own fluidity and spark as he writes. Is it a comment on society, or merely a tragic story of misguided youth? For me, it is the comment on society that shines through, as Alex begins to understand that his horrific actions have extreme consequences. Yet is the violence subjected onto him justified? Is he really evil, or is it merely society that has polluted his young mind. Brilliant questions and quite outstanding literary genius is apparent in what I see as one of the greatest books of our time."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"we all are alex and dim in this society of peer preasure,and belonging,this impures the fact that the end does not justify the means. and that some well needed parties get theirs in an ironic,humoristic what are ya gonna do for me now? $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ thats what i kinda thought."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"brilliant. burgess exceeds himself. what more could you ask for"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book is Anthony Burgess's most famous work, it is also the one he hated the most. His reason being that he wrote this book when he was just starting out. Anyone one who has ever tried to write knows that the more you write the better it gets. If he had waited to write this book it would have been an utter masterpeice, as it is, it is only a good book."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"The slang stuff makes it seem like a teenager is really telling the story. The way the word &quot;like&quot; is used way too much also makes it seem real. The story is unrealistic, but there's some truth behind it. The dilema that society is faced with, of increasing crime and how to contain it, is interesting to ponder. It's cool how the author presents a criminal reformation idea that failed. Personally I don't think there is a quick fix to things like crime and youth running wild. Sometimes you just have to let things happen the way they will.I think the &quot;controversial&quot; last chapter is a drag and the book is better without it. Ending at chapter twenty would have left me with a feeling of wanting more. Chapter 21 wrapped the book up with too much of a nice warm feeling that the rest of the book didn't have, and doesn't seem to belong."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book is one of those books that once read can be read over and over again. This story of what is good and bad, right and wrong, innocent and evil shows the world through the eyes of Alex, a teenager in a futuristic world. This book raises ideas that many have never thought of or questioned. Burgess's use of inventive words conveys his meaning even clearer and in a way that will have you accidently using them in eveyday language. This book is real horrorshow as Alex would put it."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I read this book in high school on the suggestion of a friend. I have grown up a little since then and I have read a lot of great books since but through them all Clockwork Orange still would have to be my favorite. It is violent, yes, which is probably why I liked it so much in high school, but it has a sense of humor also. Probably the first dark comedy I've read.To tell the truth I had to read the first couple of pages over after figuring out the clever russian/cockney slang Burgess uses. I had never read a book before where the author trusts the reader enough to make up his own language, which what makes this book stand out in my mind. I have not come across another book since that lulls me into the story like Clockwork Orange has.I don't want to get into a movie review but I feel both the movie and book are great which doesn't happen very often. If you like a happier ending with a brighter outlook you have the book and if want a darker ending you have the movie.Through all the books I've read throughout the years this one is my favorite."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Can you program an orange, which is appeeling on the outside and full of juicness on the inside, to behave in a clockwork manner. The novel, A Clockwork Orange, firmly states \\"No!\\"Although the main character, Alex, is ultraviolent in manner and his horrorshow activites make readers cringe, it is his choice to behave in this nature, no matter how shocking it may be. Once he becomes programed to behave according to the laws and moral restrants, then he becomes a tool and is manipulated to the point that he is less of a human being.I'm not going to go into any more specifics of the novel because they have already been firmly stated by previous reviewers. However, I will say that I have not seen the movie version of the novel and frankly do not see how it could acturately portray the author's true intentions without the twenty-first chapter. The final chapter makes the novel, in some sense, an allegory of youth and shows that people are not clockwork--they are not machines that solely follow the forces of good or evil. Instead, people are living beings who do not necessarily follow a set path in life.A great book. I only wish that I hadn't burned through the whole 192 pages in two days."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. It has a good, solid message, and the unusual dialect keeps you looking in a russin dictionary, forcing you to keep reading, and focusing in on the story. It's a gruesome book, and I wouldn't recommend it for the squeamish. Then again, I'm squeamish, but for some reason...I just had to keep reading, and I'm glad I did. Great book. A must read, soon."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book is amazing. It is the epitamy of the symbolic, comical, and frightening book of the era in which it was written, hinting communism and fascism (after the Cold War, and during Vietnam) through the single idea of such a treatment that Alex undergoes. Anthony Burgess somehow also made him a sympathetic character, since Alex' rage blossoms through a gentle neglect his parents offer, and the absurd conformity around him. This is definitely one of the finest pieces of literature ever written in the world, and it should be read by every generation who is ever interested in the views of authors who, for a moment, were bleeding hearts as well."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Such a complex book to review. Let me get to the point: if you are at all queasy about violence or not ready or willing to contemplate what makes us human- this is not the book for you. On the surface, it is simply the tale of a &quot;droog,&quot; reformed, then unbrainwashed, and then redeemed. The Russian slang adds incredible flavor to the story, but also another layer of difficulty. And the final chapter... This is not an easy book to read, dispite its length. It is, however, an important book. A rare thing- this Western novel of philosophy. Where does our free-will begin and end? If we can be killed for our crimes, why not taught to be good? What is the place of the individual in society, and when must its freedom be sacrificed for the &quot;greater good&quot;? All questions are address but few are are answered. Yes, a dense a complicated book. But if you have the stomach, the persistance for the language, and a questioning nature this book is well worth the time spent reading it, no matter what your final conclusions."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"People have argued that A Clockwork Orange is too violent, too &quot;out-there&quot;, too difficult to understnad, but if you pay any attention at all to any sort of possible meaning that can be gained from Burgess' masterpiece it is simply incredible. A CLockwork Orange and its respective film pushed William S. Burroughs and Hunter S. Thompson to 2nd and 3rd on my list of absolutely the best books ever written. The entire concept, characters, language,...everything about A Clockwork Orange is incredible and everyone must read it!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book is quite simply great. It is incredibally well written with a style all its own. It can totally boggle the mind of any who read it. (as long as they understand it - anyone who doesnt would simply think it disgusting) Aspects of this society have already come true, such as the attempt to take everyones ability to make moral choice and flush it down the drain. However, in our case, the ones in charge are trying to get us to think that the bad things are horrorshow (good) and the good are bad. The bottom line is: Anyone who hasn't read this book and doesn't want to deserves a real horrorshow tolchock to the yarbles. (real good kick to the balls)RF"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"WHile I was flipping through reviews on here I read one titled \\"you should watch the movie first\\". Are you kidding me?? That movie was completely unwatchable to me! I never finished it. The movie was focused more on the unthinkable deeds done in this book than the idea behind the book (oh I know shocking coming from Stanely Kubrick (this is sarcasm)). The book is one of the few that I try to read almost every year. I have read it countless times and come away with something new and interesting every time. It has a feeling of accidental profoundness. The reason I picked it up before was because 7 years ago when I was in high school it was banned from school libraries and curriculum because of it's \\"racy content\\". I like every other teen in my high school found something exhilarating about reading a banned book... SO of course I picked it up and finished it in two days!The book follows a group of delinquent misfits who run around the city wreaking havoc on all it's inhabitants. It is written in a sort of made up slang which at first is difficult to follow, but after a chapter you start to easily imply it's meaning by connecting the words with their context (not nearly as complicated as some reviews on here would make you believe!)... ANYWAY... The leader of the group is arrested and subjected to visual brainwash. In the end the reader is presented with the concept of right and wrong and how the line can be occasionally blurred based on beliefs and backgrounds. It shares a sense of classical epic-ness in the same way \\"1984\\" and \\"A brave new world do\\"... but in my opinion it is easier and more rewarding a read than the other two!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"The faults with this book lie completely with its length...it is just simply too long for what it has to say. I havent found myself being bored or anything, but still i wish Burgess would have put fewer pages in this book: it goes on and on when it really doesnt need to.That being said, i enjoyed the book. The language takes some getting used to...even by the end of the book youll still wonder what some words mean (no, theyre not as obvious as everyone else says they are). This doesnt depreciate the value of this book though...actually i find it kind of fun. Sometimes it's fun not knowing exactly what he's saying. It gives the book a genuine feel to it...as though it is a diary.Despite all of the horrible things Alex and his droogs do, you cant help feeling a little sad for Alex...you sort of get emotionally attached, but not too much. The novel is good at producing some sympathy for the criminal. Interesting, it is.I sort of recommend it...actually, anything believed to be a classic is worth reading. I guess im just warning you that nothing really happens in this book, and you might walk away slightly disappointed. But classics do that sometimes. All in all, it's worth 3.5 stars."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange was probably the best book I have ever read. It's an eye opening tale about a boy Alex and his odd path of life. Despite the violence that many people have commented on, I found it necessary to have inorder to do the story any justice, in regards to what Burgess has to say about society. To help help the story out, Burgess softened the violence by adding tons of humor to his characters, regarding their actions and even the hard to follow slang they used. As I read more and more into the book I began to follow what each of the characters were referring to when they used their slang, my friends and I even began to use some of the terminology in our every day conversations. I also suggest watching the movie after the book is read. Despite Burgess' dislike to how the movie was done, I thought it shined a light on the character of Alex and made you want to see more. All in all, to anyone who comes upon any negative comments about the book, disregard them. This is a story that you have to witness on your own. To some it might have a great impact and to others they might find it distastful. Personally, I think Burgess was a genius and wrote a great masterpiece."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Fiction is always hard to review because it really is up to the opinion of the individual. BUt I say this book is worth reading simply because of its literal fame. I don't need to harp on the fact that this was Burgess' least favorite of his works that just happened to become popular, especially after the release of the movie. Read it for your own good, and judge it as you would any work of fiction.Beware the slang and terminology, which can deter the unsuspecting reader. A good story nonetheless, but I can understand why Burgess cared less for it than his other works. There are better Burgess works out there."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"&quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; is a great read in numerous ways. First off, Burgess did a brilliant job with creating an invented language of the teens in the future-set society. At first, it is hard to follow and might be a little frustrating to some, but if you are patient, you will get used to it and realize how incredible it is. The novel also has a very important theme to it, which displays the importance of moral choice. The central character, Alex, is nothing but a clockwork orange (I'll leave it to you to figure out what that is by the end of the book). There are some that might argue that the novel is too violent, but the high level of violence is actually needed to strengthen both the setting (a future society filled with crime) and the theme. The movie was also good, but I enjoyed the book more."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book by Burgess explores into the mind of a genious. The grammar alone brings you into the psycodelic world of the mind of little Alex. This troubled youth I found to be very funny and witty. And when the government stripped him from the greatest gift god gave us, it made me extremely mad. Free will is the greatest gift in the world. I cannot tell the end but it surely is good. I would also see the movie by Stanley Kubrick."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"&quot;A Clockwork Orange,&quot; perhaps Anthony Burgess's most famous novel, is also one of my favorite novels. The classic film by Stanley Kubrick keeps the spirit of the novel, but read the novel anyway because there are certain points not addressed in the film, especially the infamous omission of Chapter 21 and a long sequence involving the droogs bribing some old women with drinks. As for the summary (not very descriptive of the novel or film but I like it), a young man enters a government-sponsored rehabilitation program in order to curb his violent nature, only to reemerge in society no different from who he once was.I used to have nightmares about this type of society. In respect of politics, the novel has some very key points that the film (or any film) would have difficulty trying to add in to the story. But it's a great book, with a particularly odd writing style that uses a language called &quot;Nadsat&quot; (Russian for &quot;teenager&quot;), a mix of Russian and English. Classic. Read it."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This great book follows the life of young Alex and his &quot;droogs&quot;, from their nightly &quot;ultraviolence&quot; to Alex's prison days. This book has great use of its dark futuristic (of the time that it was written) setting. I liked how burgess showed who Alex was right in the beginning by use of showing Alex and his friends prowling the streets, looking for trouble. At first I didn't like the words that Alex used, but once I got used to them, they added alot to the book. The book was written very well and Burgess used very good character development.I like the ideas of the book alot, also. I like that Burgess seemed to be against the doctors messing with Alex's head. I think that he was because of the political writers he used to bring the doctors and the government people that funded them down. I also like how he showed how some people would do any thing to get what they want done. He did this when He showed Alex lay down in the bed and the people that were supposed to be helping him played the music that made him jump out of the window.I am glad that I read the version with the final chapter that was omitted from the book the first time it came to America from Britain. I'm not quite sure why it was left out, but it pretty much changes the whole scope of the book. It shows that even someone as bad as Alex can change.Over all, it is a great book and I highly recommend it to you."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Rightly, A Clockwork Orange is viewed as a modern classic, if you'll permit such an oxymoron. It is an intensely moralistic study of society, and its right to judge. The basis for it can perhaps be traced to an incident in Burgess's own life, when his wife faced down an Alex and his droogs. In the novella, Alex, the antihero, relates his adolescent experiences, and the effects he suffers at the hands of a civilized society. Some have accused the novel of being pornographic, violent, and downright distasteful. First, the sexual content is minimal, secondly we live in a violent society, and one person's concept of taste is inherently personal. Whether art affects society or vice versa is a rich topic of debate for middle class dinner parties, not book reviews. Central to this plot is the concept of sin and redemption. Even the societies who manipualte Alex to their own ends are symbolic, eg the Pelagians. Ultimately one could simplify it to the question of personal choice: to choose to be 'bad' or to be forced to be 'good'. I don't belive the book to be immoral. Undoubtedly there is an argument for Alex being amoral, after all, he is only obeying his own philosophy. (Alex, is, literally, without law.) We are forced to draw our own conclusions about the ethics we adopt. I think some of the other reviews are tainted by the fact that for a long time, A Clockwork Orange, in its proper format wasn't available in the States. The 21st chapter was removed without Burgess's permission. This spoilt the moral questions and also ruined the numerical unity of the book. The 21st chapter crucially deals with Alex rejecting his violent lifestyle. To fully understand how Burgess suffered at the hands of the ill informed, especially after the Kubrick fiasco, one should read the Enderby novel, A Clockwork Testament. The only thing to add is a warning: Nadsat is a difficult idiom to grasp, but the wordplay is a glorious exercise in the richness of language in all its forms. This is a rare book, one that challenges the reader and makes her/him think."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This really is a great book and the language took nothing from the story, in fact it added another dimension to it. It can be easily understood after the first chapter or so. The story is filled with irony and is very thought provoking."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"one of the better books available that goes into the psyche of the modern teenager. the events outlined are not as far fetched as they may sound. clockwork orange reflects the reality that we are headed towards. the events can take place today and in fact may be happening right now! the novel is a good example of how too much freedom can create so much trouble. it is scary because it brings out an inner fear in most people that this may not be totally fictional. one is forced to ask, is this the result of the overdose of violence that goes hand in hand with entertainment? is it a result of the myopic attitude of the authorities? are the guardians and counsellors doing their job properly. the return of alex to his house and the reception thereafter is quite realistic. it's time for further introspection. have we at any point of time turned away anyone in desparate need of help? the language of the teens is hard to follow at the start but it is very easy to pick up. in fact after a point it becomes addictive. it would be difficult for me to see a fight without thinking of &quot;tolchok&quot;. there is one drawback. the author practically raises a toast to alex, at the end of his book. would this not influence wrongly the impressionable ones, especially ones like me!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"One of the fuzziest books I have ever read. There appear to be some versions of the book which have a wordlist included. Come again? Anyone who is reading the book using the wordlist is totally missing the picture. It is amazing to be able to read a book several times for a totally different angle just because your interpretation of the words used in the book differs. Tear those papers out!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Some may say this book was too violent in too many ways. I just felt all the violence helped establish character (The best character establishment I'VE ever seen!). This book also had the best plot I've ever seen. There are only three cases where the movies are better than the book and that's &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot;, &quot;The Shining&quot; (which doesn't really count because the only correct things are the characters and setting) and this. This is the only movie that still brings tears to my eyes (on the part where Frank gets his revenge), gives me goosebumps (almost the whole movie) and makes Beethoven's ninth symphony my favorite musical peice ever. But this movie never would have been made without this beautifully crafted story."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A most read book!! i can and do watch the movie over and over again and read the book over and over again!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I have constantly heard good things about &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, and finally decided to see for myself. I started out reading the book (yes the 'slang' was a little hard to get used to at first), and then in the middle of the book i rented the movie. GOOD MOVIE. I would suggest renting the movie first and then reading the book. I flew through the book...it was so interesting that i found myself not being able to put it down. I found the movie left me hanging...so if you want some closure (as i call it) read the last chapter of the book. Anyway, i can't express how much i liked this book..."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange is one of the best books ever written. Burgess's narrative style is well crafted and never fails to capture the reader's interest. The novella makes one think about how our post-modern societies view criminals and gives a grim look at one free-will robbing form of rehabilitation that may very well be used in the future. The entire book is excellent, but the final chapter drives Burgess's point home for the reader. It shows that one need not be conditioned by horrific technological means in order to be reformed, especially at the cost of free will and choice. Instead, it shows that one can grow out of deviant behavior as one matures and naturally becomes responsible and wise enough to choose right over wrong without being turned into a &quot;clockwork orange&quot; (something natural that has been forced to act a certain way by unnatural means)."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This is one of the most entertaining and engrossing books that I have ever read. A must-read. If you haven't seen the movie, wait until after you have read the book. One of Anthony Burgess's best."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I loved A Clockwork Orange. It was definitely different from any book I have ever read. The storyline was unique and the characters were well developed. Although parts of it were disturbing, they were necessary to emphasize the plot. The book gave me a new understanding of violence and I recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting book."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book poses some many ethical questions one can not help but read the book more than once to get the full meaning. The intelligence of this book surpasses everything I have ever read. Not only does this book present questions most people do not wish to deal with, it shows a mastery of language no one else has shown before. This book should definatly be read by one and all."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Anthony Burgess puts Violence and the Penal System on such a fantastical level that one has to sit back and actually think about our society's view on reformation of convicts. It makes one think about how our actual penal systems don't really work. This is definately a must read for thinkers and people who just enjoy being entertained."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"The most striking thing of this book is certainly the language.The second one is the characterization of Alex: cruel,violent,desperate (and fan of Beethoven).Completely different from anything else you could have ever read."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This masterpiece by Anthony Burgess is one of my favorite novels. He looks into the future and invisions what he thinks the youth of America is going to be. What he sees is gangs fighting for power, rape, ultra-violence, and drug use. The police do little about it. They try the easy way out and try brainwashing. This idea takes a wicked turn for the worse."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"It came before Christmas, so that was pretty neat! I am a happy lady. I need a few more words.."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I'm not going to go over the book, most here know it, I'll just discuss the idea behind the last chapter. So liitle Alex grows up at the end and sets aside his violent ways? Just like that? The previous acts that under any examination are those of a sociopath, so easily cast aside upon reaching the age of 18? This simply makes no sense at all. No wonder Kubrick wasn't buying it. Alex is evil, he is a sociopath. Sociopath don't \\"mature\\" out of violence, they either get worse or discover how to control their actions (if they get the appropriate mental help). I understand what Burgess was trying to demonstrate (free will, yada, yada), but he insults the readers intelligence in the last chapter. The type of crimes Alex committed, the intensity of the violence, his estatic pleasure he derived from committing them are not things that are outgrown. Burgess asks us to suspend belief, but after one reads the book, it is too difficult a task to do. The last chapter, IMO is a cop out."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I admit, although I've known about this book for a long time I shied away from reading it because all mentions of it I had heard were blood, guts, and gore and nothing more but when I finally gave in and read it I was more then pleasantly surprised. Yes, this book is violent and gory but oddly enough that's only one of many distinguishing characteristics.The story itself weaves around page after page of strange and often catchy made up slang with a character that all at once can be hated and pitied. The smattering of scintillating imaginary slang that dance around the story doesn't take away from the often ironic and thought provoking plot. I hadn't really expected this book to make me sit back and think about morality in such a way. What IS good? And for that matter what is evil? Does a lack of evil (by force) automatically constitute good? You'll see the question by all sides and I must say the last chapter that was not published in the original American printings I think adds that final layer to the story it needed. Without it I think I would have been left feeling antsy about the entire book. In any event I do suggest this book even to those who normally shy away from 'ultraviolence.'"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"In A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess, the plot follows a young 15-year old juvenile delinquent through his numerous felonious acts that his gang, Dim, Pete, Georgie, commits. In this gang, while committing a crime, Alex is caught by police, eventually sent to prison, and force to undergo a new experimental rehabilitation technique, in which he is forced to watch violent film clips, in order to \\"brainwash\\" him into abhorring. Upon his relief from prison, Alex in turns becomes the victim of his old gang and the violent acts thrown upon him are those that eventually lead him to his death.In my opinion, I found this book to be very interesting and very powerful in the point the author is trying to make about karma and tells stories of crime that really do happen in society today. I really liked the beginning and the unique twists including in the novel. If you would prefer it, this book was also made into a movie and may be easier to understand, as watching it, made it clearer for me to understand. This book was violent and disturbing, but I would probably recommend this book to older teenagers, keeping in mind that it is graphic."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book, in my opinion, is an amazing book. However, most people, even if they are intelligent, aren't able to read it. The story is about a man who gets arrested for murdering someone. He is in a gang and has raped, and beat people all the time. This time he murdered a woman. He goes to prison, and gets taken out early to get experimented on. This treatment makes it physically painful for him to commit violent acts. He is then let out into the world. Life is different for Alex (main character). His parents think he is still bad, so they kick him out of the house. Alex goes through many troubles and lives life the way other people used to when Alex beat them. In the story language is harsh. The author decided it would be easier to just make up words then use horrible English words like: rape, kill, murder... etc. The author uses great diction. I have never seen any other writing like this. To understand the book a lot better, watch the movie. The movie follows the context of the book very well. Overall A Clockwork Orange was a very interesting, and great story!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"An interesting disutopic sci-fi book on alienation, violence and misogyny. It was even more interesting when I read that it had been published with different endings.I wasn't as impressed with Burgess' using non-English words, because I speak Russian and that's all the &quot;slang&quot; really was. (Example, the Russian word for Friend is Droog; Hand is Ryka; Milk is Moloko). Therefore it was immediately apparent to me though I liked the mixing of the two languages it reminded me of how I talk at home using both languages interchangeably. In a way I wish I could've read the book as most people did (who didn't use the glossary) and try to figure out the words through context."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"It was really difficult to read for me.I think the novel told me a wonderful story that could never exist in reality, because all young men were brutal and killed people. It was thrilling. First little Alex was a cruel and crazy young man and he learnt nothing until he was in custody and when he was a victim of his state, he became an adult. This was a wonderful turning of his life at the end.There were serious moral problems in this book about free will. Should all people have a perfect and well-mannered characters or it's better to live in a world with some villains and criminals of their own making?"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange is a book of definite motif and an understanding of a life people usually refuse to recognize. Not only was the main character/narrator's, Alex, lifestyle portrayed specifically throughout the novel, it was greatly astounding to be noticed as a life worth meaning and acknowledgement. Alex's life was one of violence, a typical hooligan's life who grows up with gangs and other such bad influences. There is a dramatic change in the course of the novel from it's beginning which keeps the excitement up, because I have to admit, the beginning is redundant with the amount of violence displayed. The twist in the plot is ironic and surprising. There is meaning behind all the slang Borgess speaks with through Alex. If you are a person who is able to find meaning if small areas of life and depict reality from the real world, I suggest this book. It gives one a purpose, a meaning to look for between the lines of this book. It keeps one entertained by creating a desire to know what happens to Alex. The end gives one a sweet sense of satisfation although the ending is nothing you could ever imagine. Enjoy."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This is by far the best book i have ever had the privilage to come across. every book i have read after reading A Clockwork Orange has seemed dull and lifeless. The language is new, (once you get past the first chapter it gets easier to understand.) After finishing this book i was saying things like 'all that cal' and 'horrorshow'. I have recommended this book to about ten people, every single one of them has bought there own copy of it!I have yet to see the movie for fear it will ruin the feeling the book has left in me, though maney say the book is just as good as the movie is. Burgess makes a strong commentary on what the human nature to violence is and the human nature to control violence @ all costs, even the free will of a person. This book could make the president hate the government! I hope that every single person in the entire world will read this book, and let it control their thinking the way it did mine."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Only a complete fool could write this off as an excuse to write about rape and ultraviolence. This is at heart a genuine attempt at black [and sometimes subtle slapstick] comedy. The film is a terrible interpretation of this excellent book, and just to correct one reviewer, it was not banned for copycat crimes or anything of the sort. It was *WITHDRAWN* by Kubrick himself after his family received death threats. The book is an essential read and the Nadsat language is easy to decode; you must read this book."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork orange is a good choice for reading material if you have a lot of time and you feel like reading a book twice. I was very confused all through this book. It is not something that I would read again. I didn't care for the language, I found that it made it very difficult to understand and follow. The message of the book is sort of good. The people really want to help Alex but the way they go about it can be debated. Some people i'm sure will love this book, but I have found that this book wasn't for me."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book was excellent i found it very exciting and the plot was excellent.Dedicated to Mr. Norling"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"La naranja mec&aacute;nica. Anthony BurgessLa elecci&oacute;n del bien y del mal, la capacidad del ser humano de poder elegir entre los dos es lo que lo hace humano. Pero, porque alguna gente elige ser malo o hacer el mal sin motivo aparente, excepto el placer del mal? Este es uno de los temas principales que trata el autor, uno que no queda resuelto pero que atraviesa el libro de principio al fin. Si no tuvi&eacute;semos esa capacidad para elegir, seriamos menos humanos, meras maquinas al servicio de un Dios que no tiene un plan, pero como podemos elegir, podemos rechazar el bien y servir la causa del mal, aunque jamas entender&eacute; como la gente se siente bien o deriva placer de portarse mal. Es una de las cosas que est&aacute;n fuera del alcance de mi tal vez corto e ingenuo entendimiento.La novela es acertada y prof&eacute;tica, ya que en estos tiempos esa clase de violencia la podemos ver todos los d&iacute;as en los noticiarios, ni&ntilde;os que matan ni&ntilde;os, adultos que matan adultos y ni&ntilde;os sin motivo aparente y sin ning&uacute;n tipo de remordimiento o arrepentimiento.Despu&eacute;s de ponimar la situaci&oacute;n largamente y goborar conmigo mismo sobre el destino de la crisna humana. Me encuentro en uno de esos callejones existenciales que parecen no tener respuesta-salida para mis ponimaciones. No tengo respuestas satisfactorias en mi golova para lo que le pasa a la humanidad y creo que lo mejor para mi y para todos es seguir viviendo y tratar dentro de lo posible de elegir el bien por nuestro bien-estar y el de nuestros drugos y familiares.En t&eacute;rminos de realizaci&oacute;n la novela esta muy bien hecha y despu&eacute;s de haberla le&iacute;do cuidadosamente creo que el capitulo 21 ( el final) es muy necesario aunque muchos digan que es una traici&oacute;n a la novela de ultraviolencia y maldad. Ese capitulo muestra una soluci&oacute;n y una salida para Alex, nuestro humilde narrador. El camino hacia la madurez y un cambio en la forma de pensar, ya que se da cuenta de que alg&uacute;n d&iacute;a ser&aacute; un starrio viejo como los dem&aacute;s y de que tendr&aacute; hijos que quiz&aacute;s repetir&aacute;n su camino aun cuando el no lo desee.La pel&iacute;cula de este libro es excelente aunque prescinda del ultimo capitulo. Esta en cada lector hacer el juicio final al libro, dejarlo como libro de ultraviolencia o ponerle el fin did&aacute;ctico que el autor deseaba. De todas formas es un libro excelente.Luis Mendez."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I have read quite a few of the reviews on 'Amazon' and everyone of them praises the book highly. They talk about the inventiveness and energy of the language, the sympathy they have for the major character Alex, especially when his Nature is forcibly changed, and he loses the ability to be himself , including the ability to enjoy Beethoven's music. They speak about the skill in depicting the main character's alienation, and the dreary world of an imagined future technical dystopia.They speak about a vision Burgess presents, and the fact that in spite of the language containing many at first non- understandable slang terms, that the work is nonetheless really understandable.I didn't like the book. I read quite a bit of it. I just could not get into it. I do not like violence even fictional violence. I simply could not find any of this entertaining or amusing, however I know the great gifts Burgess has as writer.I may be wrong, but I simply do not like this one."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"i never realized that until i read the other reviews.i was going to give this 1 star but i read another customer review that says that the point was \\"one should grow up and take responsibility for one's actions, or get shock therapy\\". if that's the case, it's pretty good for a book of its length. i don't find \\"is it better to be good by force, or to be bad by choice?\\" (supposedly the question it wants to raise) stirring. sounds like a topic for a junior high debate."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Utterly devoid of any formal or artistic redeeming qualities.

Yes the strange dialect of funky slang is very off putting at first, but that is the least of my problems with this book and something a chapter or so in you start to become accustom to. Now, by the time I got to chapter 4, wherein main character 15 year old Alex, rapes two 10 year old girls (mind you this takes place the day following a home invasion and gang rape performed by the young narrator and his pals) I was done. I know Clockwork Orange is a cult classic and all, but this is just not entertainment, at least not in my opinion."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I read this one to get it off my TBR list. It's been hanging out there for a while, but I've never really attempted to read it before. I found that completing the book was a challenge for me.The writer of this book uses lots of colloquial phrasing and made-up language. Most readers can figure out the meaning of the words from their usage, however some readers will get frustrated and choose not to undertake the challenge.The book is somewhat violent, following Alex, a 15 year old through the streets as he and his friends beat and rape innocent people. They break into houses and steal from whoever is unlucky enough to be in their path.Some people categorize this book as a science fiction dystopian novel. Big words that basically mean it's set in the future. However in reading this book, I can see that it might fit in any time period. I was reminded of The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton. I can imagine youth of the 50s and 60s acting this way, just as I knew a few youth who in the 80s and 90s acted this way.Overall, I wasn't thrilled with the book. I feel a sense of accomplishment for finishing it, but also disappointment that it was such a waste of time."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Genre: Science FictionThree sentence summary: A Clockwork Orange is a story about Alex, a 15 year-old droog who gets arrested for murder.

Anunsparing story of a sociopathic hoodlum, Alex, _A ClockworkOrange_ is shocking and often a difficult read despite thebizarre and sometimes surreal street language employed byits narrator, a dialect of some archaic words, a fewneologisms, and a great deal of Anglicized Russian. Thefilm by Stanley Kubrick is equally disturbing, but, asBurgess himself notes in the introduction to this edition,leaves off the crucial twenty-first chapter, a chapter thatis vital to the book both for its numerical significance(twenty-one being considered the age of maturity), and itsphilosophical poignance."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I can see how people would find this book to be neat. It's defintely unique. I didn't enjoy it, though. I am a reader who likes to get swept onto the page and become the protagonist's shadow, and with this book's inventive language I found that impossible. I could never get into a flow because too often (every paragraph for at least the first seven chapters) I had to stop and figure out what the protagonist was trying to say. I nearly put it down for good when I got about halfway through it. I'm glad I pushed on, though, because the last third of the book--the point in which I had finally figured out enough of the protagonist's language to not have to work so hard--was pretty good.If you like Shakespeare, you'll probably like this book."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"The most fabulous book i have seen.

That's fine, if that's all they want to get out of it, but they also miss the fact that this is really a thoughtful masterpiece written by a true literary genius. A true masterpiece is, of course, highly entertaining as well as being a work of art.As for the 21st chapter, which some believe does not fit in with the rest of the story, this is the way that the author wanted the story to end, and that should be respected. For those who want the story to end the same was as Stanley Kubrick's film version (also a masterpiece, by the way), just stop reading at the end of chapter 20. Either ending works, in my humble opinion."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Once you slog through the slang (think of Beowulf) and get into the core of the book you'll find it is worth your time. It asks one main question, &quot;Is it better to have a choice between good and bad and then choose to do good, or to have no choice at all and be forced to do good?&quot;Regardless of your feelings on the subject Burgess does an remarkable job of showing how young Alex feels about the subject. He says &quot;But what I do I do because I like to do.&quot; His choice is obviously to do evil because he enjoys it.The &quot;controversial&quot; Chapter 21 does not change Alex's view in any way. Although he does change his behavior he doesn't change the way he comes to that behavior. He changes what he does because he wants to change. Alex blames his earlier evil behavior on the ignorance of youth, that he had no choice. This makes perfect sense. Who among us when having made a decision to do good, would want to look back at our evil past and say we also chose that? We would want to blame it on anything we could and Alex does it by saying &quot;Being young is like being one of those malenky machines.&quot; That is not a contradiction at all, only a great example of rationalization by a character who is not exactly what I would call rational."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"If there is one thing besides its content, it is the vocabulary the characters use.

The brutality practiced by all the characters is ungodly. The book itself is written in a strange form of schoolboy speak that makes the plot difficult at first. Eventually (as with Shakespeare), the language helps to draw the reader further into the minds and activities of the characters.

Alex is, \\"Our humble Narrator\\" who takes us on a journey through his youth in London (set in a future time period).We read as Alex goes through what I'll call an extreme rebellious period - his reformation and subsequent life choices. Sometimes when I read what others call \\"a classic\\" I'm left wondering why exactly the book was given that honor, but I can see why A Clockwork Orange was. It's a gruesome but cautionary tale of violence and government repression (in some sorts). Alex is originally allowed the choice of good or evil before others try to take it away, which makes the question of this novel. Is it better to have the choice of good or evil, even if people may pick evil?The storyline and character actions often go to the extreme but I think there is a great point to be found within these pages that is still functional today.One caution: Burgess uses many of his own slang words through the novel - I found a great online site and spent most of the first six/seven chapters translating from their dictionary."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This is a very \\"fun\\" read.

Extremely entertaining: A+"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book was in good shape slightly worn, but no rips or writing. It came on promised date with no problems. Thank you"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Unlike most dystopian novels, which tend to focus on what may happen to government in the future, \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" focuses on the nature of the individual in the future. Our protagonist is Alex, only 15 years old but already a habitual criminal, roving the streets with his band of friends, taking advantage of every opportunity to wreak havoc on the world around him. The boys have no qualms about attacking the helpless. In fact, the more helpless the victim, it seems, the more pleasure the boys take in the act. The most interesting and disturbing aspect is that the boys manage to maintain a strange sort of innocence even as they commit the most heinous and violent crimes. They aren't doing any of this out of malice toward their targets; in fact, it seems to matter very little who they pick as a victim. They are creating mayhem just because it's fun for them.Everything changes, however, when one particular break-in goes horribly awry and Alex finds himself sentenced to 14 years in prison for murder. There, though he manages to create an illusion of good behavior, we see that the experience has no real impression on his sense of morality. Then, after two years, he is chosen for a new, experimental rehabilitation program, designed to rid him of any desire to indulge in, or even contemplate, any acts of violence. As we see, however, this \\"treatment\\" also leaves him without any choice in the matter of being good or not. He HAS to be good because he is programmed to be. This, of course, raises the question central to the book: Does good behavior actually mean you are a good person if you have no freedom of choice?The book can be a little difficult to get in to at first, predominantly because of Burgess's unique style. The story is narrated by Alex and thus, is written in the complex slang language, invented by Burgess for this book, that the youth of this society engage in. For example, a sentence taken from the opening chapter: \\"He looked a malenky bit poogly when he viddied the four of us like that\\" (pg. 5). There is no glossary, but if you stick with it, you will start to develop a feel for what most of the words mean after a couple chapters. However, if you find yourself having difficulty, a nice, comprehensive lexicon can be found on Wikipedia if you search for \\"English to Nadsat\\" (due to review guidelines I am not allowed to include a direct link). Unfortunately, it is alphabetized by the English equivalents, not by the slang terms, so looking up a word can be a little difficult.One final note of interest: The original British publication of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" had 21 chapters, as does the current American edition. However, when the book was first published in the United States, the last chapter was dropped. As Burgess explains in his introduction to the restored version, publishers considered this 21st chapter a sellout. Whether it is or isn't is up to you to decide, but I can tell you that the presence or absence of the last chapter makes a huge difference in the overall feel and message of the book. Without the final part of the story in place, the book offers a bleak message, implying that human nature cannot really change. On the other hand, reading the book with the final chapter in place gives us a little more hope. Beyond that, Burgess tells us in his introduction, interpretation is up to you."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange (1962)by: Anthony BurgessAnthony Burgess is truly a genius which can be seen in this book a masterpiece to most who read it repulsive to others and vaguely readable to some.A Clockwork Orange is the story of a not so pretty vision of the future which includes ultra violence (basically the acts of rape,robbery,and other physical crimes including beating people.) This vision of the future includes a very complicated brutal slang which can be a bit frustrating at times especially when getting to a good part in the story. I personally had to go back a few times to know what the heck was going on, but after about of the book i started to understand more and this made previous chapters more clear.The story itself is simple but it is the way it is told that makes the difference and it has many twists and reverse psychology first making you have doubts about the character ,then hate him ,then like him and so on. But it was not the brutal slang nor the ultra violence, or even the way it was told but the genius of this person and how it was told. To some people it was a repulsive sickening book, but that is due to IGNORANCE there is a message, behind the story that not too many people think about, but burgess hid it in his work so only a deserving person would understand it.(i won't write it here because i cannot explain it as well as he does)To get to the point since by now you are probably frustrated with my explanations i will give you a small non detailed summary of the first chapter.Alex and his three droogs Pete,Georgie,and Dim Dim. A gang of 15 year olds with an obsession with rape,violence,stealing,listening to classical music,and driving their Durango 95.Living in a a near future wearing their white outfits and their black hats strolling around looking for trouble. In the first chapter they are at their hangout the korova milk bar drinking molocco a mixture of milk and things that probably wouldn't be good for you, then going on their rampage beating a drunken bum robbing a house and other bad stuff but all i can say is that this small glimpse is nothing compared to the books vast extremely descriptive strangely interesting events.In the end the truth is that Burgess was not very happy because people paid more attention to this book than his other books, plays and music which he prized even more than this book but this has been seen before as Anthony mentions before the book starts, most of this is due to Stanley Kubrick's film A Clockwork Orange which weakened interests in his better books.The movie only gained more fame for the book but none of this can destroy Burgess genius writing,composing skills. If you like this you should check out his other books.Remember there is more to the book than you might want to know."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I wanted to write this review because I feel this book is reaching in so many ways and on so many levels. Anthony Burgess paints a picture of life, of the way life is at any given moment and then strings you along this journey, expossing the atrositys of culture and the repricutions of our actions. Alex, Your Humble Narator (YHN) is a droog (a gang member sort-of-speak) who fancies raping women and beating others near death. He's the youngest member of his group yet is the bossy ringleader. After having a fall out with his friends they decide to sell him out and he becomes a prisoner of the State. While in prison he undergoes treatment to cure his violent urges and make him a safe human, stripped of free will and a complete robot for the sole purpose to make him safe for the comunity. This novel makes you ask yourself so many questions. Is it fair what they've done to Alex? Did Alex suffer enough? When you see is parents reaction to their sons return home you'll wonder if they're being fair, or if they are being unreasonable. Don't let the language stop you from reading this powerful novel. I almost stopped before the first chapter was threw and that would have been a shame. The slang used in the novel actaully help you to see the attitude of YHN and how he is truly a distressed youth. You can see how for the majority of the novel he is self pitying, feeling that he is a victim of those around him when in actuallity you can see he is a victim of his our selfish decisions. Read and analyze and realize that this is a one-of-a-kind novel with guts that you don't see very often. Great novel and an instant classic. I understand all the praise."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange Book ReviewThe book A Clockwork Orange written by Anthony Burgess is one that never has a dull moment. The book is full of action; something is always going on whether it is a rape, a beating, or even burning down some ones home. Its so action packed that it's really hard to put this novel down. The four main characters in the novel are Alex, Pete, Georgie, and Dim. Alex is what I like to call the leader of this violent gang like group of boys. These four go around committing violent acts and think it is completely alright. They figured since they never got caught they could keep beating people up. Alex was in for a rude awakening in the middle of the novel when he was captured by the authorities and all of his friends ran off. One of the many unique twists this novel had was when Alex was essential brainwashed and forced to watch these violent acts and then released into the general public. Every time a violent act was committed he became very ill. I really enjoyed the unique twists the author deployed to really make the reader think and in some ways created this sense of disbelief. The writing style was quite different in the beginning, I liked how it made you really pay attention to your reading and actually even made you go back to try to figure out what was just said. The novel was a fairly easy read once you got past the first 30 pages or so. At the same time I also disliked the writing style because of the extreme amount of time that was spent trying to decipher the text in the beginning. I also disliked the fact that they didn't have a glossary at the end to help with the deciphering of some of the words throughout the novel. I would recommend this novel to anyone who is looking for something that is full of jam packed action and is ready for the many twists that are thrown out at you by the author. Its one both teens and adults can enjoy."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"The Background of this story is dropped in a standard futurized England where a young Malchick (boy) named Alex and his 3 fellow droogs (gang of friends) are at the local Korova Milkbar, a mesto-plus. The story basically tells of Alex, the main young thuggish proantaganist and the many crimes, violent acts, rapes and murders these malchicks particiapate in. The book really begins to take off and capture the reader after alex's droogs slam him over the head with a glass bottle, knocking him out during one of there many rape attempts and frameing him for murder. He is taken to jail by the millicents (police), he serves time and then is realeased for a scientific experiment. During the experiment Alex is forced to watch many short film clips in which people are being killed, and raped and such. As the clips flash on the screen he is administered a medicine in which the sight of violence and rape makes him sick, weak and powerless. Therefore enlisting that violence and rape are wrong, after awhile of this Alex is then released into civilization again and is considered \\"cured\\". In the original story, A clockwork orange ('resucked') the story continues revealing the future of our little teen thug. He grows up gets married and grows bored of those acts of rape and violence that once caught his attention so very much. As Anthony Burgess has said in the introduction of A Clockwork Orange Resucked, \\"Senseless violence is a prerogative of youth, which has much energy but little talent for the constructive.\\" It is in which the 21st chapter that this happens. 21 symbolizes maturity, where a child is no longer an adult and is therefore capable of making there own descions. The 21st chapter also shows moral growth, room for growth into good making little Alex no longer a clock work orange. A clockwork orange is a old british saying (He was as queer as a clockwork orange.) This is NOT meant to be demeaning towards homosexuals. This is just the way people spoke way back when.) To be a clockwork orange is to \\"have the appearance of an organism lovely with colour and juice but is in fact only be a clockwork toy wound up by god or the devil..or the almighty state.\\" On the subject of the movie, Stanley Kurbrick does no such justice to this phenomenal book. He has based his movie on the american novel only featuring the 20 chapters. The only thing i had a little trouble with was the break down of the futurized teenage slang 'Nadasat' which is russianified english. It is meant to be like this for a reason, as Burgess explains in the introduction, to make it sound as though muffled. Do NOT let the language scare you away from reading such an extraordinary story as this, it may seem hard in the beginning but you get used to it in time which is the same as with everything you do. If you do however begin to get discouraged the following site's glossary is made to help you out: www.clockworkorange.com/nadasat.shtml/I have given this story 5 stars because I believe it is an exceptionally genuis piece of literature novella."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"After reading this book I told said to myself &quot;WOW!&quot; I could not belive that someone could have written such a great book! Burgess scored big with this book. I loved the message that it gave me that people that dont have a choice cannot be people. &quot;A man seizes to be a man&quot; as it is said in the book. The only little throw back in the whole novel was the language. Sometimes it was hard to try and understand what Alex was trying to say with all that &quot;future slang&quot; but even that was so great about the book. A Clockwork Orange is such an original classic nobody to this day has written such a great book. I read the entire book in less than 24 hours. And after I read it I must have watched the movie at least 20 in one week. At the end of the book I acutally was &quot;Cured&quot; as Alex puts it I relized that making choices is such a great thing. That book is now my favorite book of all time. Thank you Anthony Burgess wherever you maybe."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Between Macbeth and a pile of sleepy Can-Lit, getting to read &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot; was a complete break from the rest of the stodgy curriculum. As a 16 year old girl, I loved this book at the time, though I'm sure now years later, the misogyny might irk me. Nonetheless, this book raised so many interesting debates about free will and human morality, I would urge everyone to read it. Burgess created such a thorough rendering of &quot;little alex's&quot; world, right down to the slang of the day. Definite must-read!!!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I decided to read this because I loved the movie so much, and Burgess didn't disappoint. The language was a lot of fun and the story was very exciting again, even though I knew it well. It's a great book to read and will give you hours of good enjoyment."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Has anyone read &quot;Animal Farm&quot;? That book is the worst anti-socialism propaganda ever written. It was as anti-capitalist as it was anti-communist and it appeared to make a point.Burgess tells a tale that is anti-facism, anti-capitalism, andti-communism... anti-ism!! One of the more amazing novels written in the twentieth century, the fact that it is short and still brutally effective is its most amazing attribute. What Burgess has done with this novel is actually change the idea of what literature can be. He dances on the edge of de-construction without crossing over the line.The language is incredibly anguishing to read, but at the end of the first few chapters, you realize that the effect of this &quot;translating&quot; that you have to do, you begin to think exactly like Alex. You feel complete empathy with his feelings. Its actually rather chilling when you think about it.Anyone who enjoyed the way in which this novel was written should pick up &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; by William S. Burroughs."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"It's really a good book I think. I always wondered what Alex would do next, and I really enjoyed reading about his attempts to come through all his adventures getting as few problems as possible. Burgess imagined some really smart steps with which Alex tried this. On the other hand the book made me think about \\"friends\\". How many \\"friends\\" in this world are there like Alex's? Or the other way around: what did Alex do that his friends thought they were right to do such things? I mean they betrayed him as they broke into the house of the old lady with the cats. Of course Alex wasn't exactly right playing the leader of the gang without knowing that his friends don't absolutely agree with him. But is this really enough to betray him in such a way? Or is it just the character of his friends to act this way? Still, it made me also think about the way they wanted to cure the criminals. Is this really a reasonable way?"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book is my favorite book of all time. Burgess uses a self-made language here that's unique and out of this world. By the middle, you will feel sorry for Alex, the main character, despite the terrible things he did in the beginning of the book.This book will really get you thinking:1) Is it better to choose to be bad than to be forced to be good?2) Are we still human if we don't have the right to choose what we want to become?You will learn that even if we do have a 'perfect citizen', the problem might not be the person him/herself, but society."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange expresses the fears of Burgess in a way that the reader eventually comes to sympathize with the main character, Alex. Even though he dotes upon raping and stealing, the end leaves the reader wanting a better life for him. Afer he is taken to prison when his friends turn their backs on him, a certain attachment forms to Alex as he is subjected to Ludovico's Technique, one in which his free choice is taken away. Violence soon makes him want to vomit and commit suicide, along with the classical music he once loved. The moral questions raised in the story about the dreadfulness of having free will taken away from any person raises a bold emotion in anyone reading the story. The haunting emotions Alex feels when he leaves the prison gives an eerie feeling that can't be shaken. However, the ending leaves a satisfaction and a somewhat renewed confidence in those that were once thought to have been so horrible.This is a perfect summer read for those long nights. It is nothing close to a bedtime story, but one that will keep you turning the pages for hours. Absolutly mind-catching."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"as with many of his novels, he is a one-man showcase for his use of the english language as well as his other learnedness, including, as many reviews have already indicated, his knowledge of the russian language. the author has incorporated this into a teen-gang-speak (which bart simpson has used in several episodes, with the requisite cockney/estuary accent) that no one should really be diverted by. humans build their knowledge of written language by understanding an unfamiliar word in the context of the familiar, and can even identify nonsense words as being used as verbs or nouns, as in lewis carrol's &quot;jabberwocky&quot;. so knowing russian would in theory be an asset, but then you would be missing out on the exoticness of the unfamiliar word and its conferred membership of the disaffected underclass to which alex and his friends belong.the violence was indeed hard to stomach and i'm sure it serves some literary purpose and is not meant to be gratuitous. the film version was much more graphic, more of a 70s depressive state, and the ending of the film was far less hopeful than the novel.

This book really makes you think. Even if you didn't enjoy the movie (I personally thought it was rather dull), this book may surprise you. I think it blows the movie out of the water. The made-up language that Alex uses may be confusing at first, but through context you can usually learn what it means and your mind will immediately register &quot;droogs&quot; as friends."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I thought that this was an excellent book and would recommend it to anyone. From the beginning I could not put this book down because I got really wrapped up in Alex's character. His character really reminded me of (in an exaggerated way) a lot of modern youth. Obsessed with violence and not caring what happened to other people, so involved in himself/themselvs he didn't even care he was hurting the people who cared for him like his parents and even his \\"droogs\\". I think the message in this book is that no matter what happens that people will always eventually grow up and that even people who might seem happy still have dreams that could make them really happy and not just seem happy on the outside. But as we mature we realize what is making us happy might not be what we need in life so we change our ways and look forward to a better tomorrow."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange has been reguarded as one of the best contemporary classics of today. It is the story of Alex, a member of a gang in a future Britain. Alex goes around amassing destruction, robbery, rape, and murder to his criminal record before being betrayed and sent to jail, where he undergoes a controversial treatment.This treatment is a basic exercise of Pavlov's conditioning in which Alex is taught to hate everything he loves, so that he could leave the institute within two weeks of arriving there. Unfortunately, nothing turns out the way Alex wanted.A Clockwork Orange is a very good book on realizing why we are the way we are. Because of Alex's loss of choice, we learn through Burgess a great deal about how being able to do bad things is so important.The only deterrent to reading this book is the amount of violence, drug-taking, rape, and other things that might be found on a FOX tv show, which were banned worldwide at the time it was published, in the 1950's. If you thought Catcher in the Rye was a immoral book, I wouldn't recommend this, but for those who can stomach the violence to realize the point are well worthy of reading this book.This version of A Clockwork Orange is almost the same as the American version, except that it has a foreword written by Burgess himself, as well as the last chapter which was not published in America. This book is a very good read, and a great addition to the avid reader's library.Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"oh, woe is me... i feel really d'oh! for not getting this book earlier! honestly i've been thinking of getting it for years but never actually got around to it until i borrowed it from my college library early this year... what can i say?the events in this book took place in the near future... and the world is a weird sort of place. the protoganist, alex is a really bad sort and well, he's really, really, and i mean *really* violent. the problem is, it's by choice. to make things interesting, he comes from a normal family (as normal as it goes; no history of violence, neither rich nor poor sort) and he basically has everything just fine... but, he's not fine. he gives a new meaning to the phrase 'bad to the bone'. not many authors write stories in which the main character is the evil one, and burguess does it without stereotyping that evil/bad ppl have no soul blah, blah, blah but he protrayed alex as a person who sees nothing wrong with violence, in fact, he crave it. now herein lies the problem - how to make readers sympathize with the character. that's the normal recipe for most book, but you know this is not just a normal book.burguess is simply amazing, and i can't seem to stop sayng that. i'm not gonna go in detail on how alex wound up in prison, suffice to say, he was caught, incarcerated, but our clever alex found a way to beat the system and get his ass out from jail. how? by offering himself as a guinea pig for an experiment to eliminate evil from oneself... scary eh?i don't condone any of alex's excesses, but i tell you, i found myself sympathizing with his dilemma. the experiment worked, amazingly and alex is 'cured'... but at what price? he is in constant pain because he can't even think of doing a bad thing.the social dilemma here is not about alex, it's about how far society/government should take responsibility on its' youth and members. do we have the right to direct a person's most treasured possession - his mind - eventhough if it's for the greater good? how can we justify it as right? shuld we make the society mindless drones that are dictated by what we think is right? dare we play god?alex, brave alex, lost his personality, life, loves, *mind* and was brought to the edge of sanity... that, is the most amazing thing about this book. it lets the reader sees things in a totally different way. burguess didn't make it easy for himself, he wrote the book using the worst character he could dish out and make us find some common ground with alex, and *pity* his predicament! incredible.and many ppl are simply amazed by his invention of nadsat, the amalgation of russian and english that the kids of alex's generation. it was kinda hard to understand, but the book is totally worth the effort... read it."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This is a book about a boy named Alex whose interests are rape, ultra-violence, and classical music. He and his droogs are in a gang that goes around and indulges in these things. They enjoy drinking milk laced with drugs to sharpen them up for a bit of ultra-violence. This novel is very brutal but the nadsat seems to be a buffer for the brutality. After Alex breaks into a house and beats and old woman his gang members abandon him and leave him beaten, with a chain, for the millicents (police). He is entered into a criminal rehabilitation program. Now when he thinks of the things he used to love he gets sick. This book is one of the greatest pieces of English liturature ever and was even made into a film by Stanley Kubrick. If you want to know what happens to Alex, read the book. This edition includes the 21st chapter which was originally excluded in the original American release. A highly recommended novella.P.S. The nadsat is really cool. After picking up the book with my rookers and viddying it with my very own glazzies I was impressed with Burgess' masterful use of nadsat. EXCELLENT!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange is one of the ingenius novels in the history of all time. It deals with a teenage boy named Alex who lives in England. And when night comes, he and his teenage &quot;droogs&quot; or friends (in Russian) go out and wreak havoc on the city. During one of the groups ultra-violent encounters, Alex accidently kills an old woman. To add up on to the incredibly frustrating situation for Alex, his friends betray him and leave him to be for the police. Stuck in prison, Alex wants to get out as quickly as possible. He starts to suck up to the warden by reading the bible and trying to be &quot;friendly&quot; to be let out earlier than the original sentence of 14 years. Since Alex is 15 at the time of his sentence. To go through his entire sentence, he would be 29 at the age of his release. Alex finds out about a certain technique that is used on prison inmates to make sure that they get out of prison and never return. Almost drooling, Alex finds himself very interested in getting out of prison. He volunteers to have himself as a test subject for the technique. The basic procedure of the technique is to give the patient a certain drug that makes that patient extremely sick. The doctors and scientists then strap down the patient in front of a screen and hold back his eyelids by tape so that he would be brainwashed in a way. Watching the most violent and gruesome of films, Alex is slowly brainwashed to a state where anything that has to do with violence in Alex's mind would automatically engage a very nauseating and stressing feeling makeing Alex extremely sick. After two weeks of the procedures, Alex is let out of the hospital where he was being &quot;treated&quot; and &quot;cleansed.&quot; Alex is then rejected by his parents, by his friends, and by his earlier enemies. Being beaten by those who he hurt before prison, and being extremely exauhsted, Alex comes into the possesion of certain rebels of the government. The rebels want to use Alex to overthrow the government which seems to be so cruel and bad. To do this, they want to have Alex commit suicide to show that the treatments that the governemtn applied to prisons is bad and that it leads patients to commit suicide. Jumping out of a window out of extreme frustration, Alex survives and is sent to a hospital to be treated. The government takes control of Alex again and turns him back to his original violent self. Alex enjoying the fact that he can control his emotions and violent feelings once more believe that he is fully cured. Back on the streets of England now at the age of 18, Alex starts to move away from the violent feelings in his life. Wanting more out of life, Alex begins a new era of his life. Escaping out of the animal called youth. This story explains, in great words, the idea that everything changes no matter what. We don't need machines, or governements to make everything &quot;okay.&quot; All that we need is to live our lives and let the universe unfold as it should."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I have read this book several times, and read many of the reviews posted here. Many wrote that Burgess' invented slang was difficult at first, or slowed the book down. I couldn't disagree more.Burgess' ear for patterns of speech, colloquialism and his seemingly instinctive choices for slang are uncanny, if not absolutely brilliant. How many writers can invent a language? And do it in such a readable way, that meshes perfectly with the timeframe and intention of the story?Add to this that he has created empathetic characters, a perfect linear narrative, and an incredible social commentary that has every bit of relevance now as it did when it was written. What is the result?...A truly great work, which will be read and will provoke thought long after this reviewer and the likes of amazon.com have perished.Sorry to be so dramatic, but few books fly at this lofty altitude of excellence."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book, though looked at by some as impossible to read and looked at by others as glorifying violence, really does have a point: a person can change. While the movie and the original American version of the book don't have this redeeming quality, this new version does, mostly because of the inclusion of a new chapter that should have been included in the movie and original American version of the book. Those who say that this book isn't thought-provoking don't know what they're talking about.I would recommend this book to anyone who has the patience to work through the very difficult dialogue. Even after having read greats like Shakespeare and Dostoevsky, &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; is even harder to read, but like the works of the great authors I mentioned above, &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; has a greater point than it seems on the surface. Read this book with an open mind and your opinion will definitely be changed."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"After reading the first few pages of Clockwork Orange, I thought it would be too painful to continue, but the word substitutions gradually became clear, and the story evolved into a powerful and-surprisingly-humorous narrative. Gang leader Alex rebels against society in every way, rejecting decency, work, and even language. His mischief eventually leads him to prison at age 15, and mishaps there result in his being selected for criminal rehab by association. The rest is what turns the novel into a classic--the criminal becomes victim, grows more charming in the process, and learns how to grow up."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book is an amazing trip. Through the narration of Alex, a young miscreant, we see his transformation from free-roaming criminal to a thing, the botched result of a government experiment. The book is really good in the philosophical arguments it brings up: Can people be changed from bad to good without choice? What will society sacrifice to feel safe? Is humanity in the choice to be right? It is one of the most provocative novels I have ever read.And that's just half of it. Burgess writes with an original prose that is used by Alex and his criminal buddies. This helps immensely to portray the graphic implications of their activities without actually being graphic. Even though we see the bad things he does, we still feel a connection with him and share in his pain in his treatment. Maybe it is his childlike glee or the fact that the people that are supposed to protect the public are far more insidious. A brilliant book, read it even if you've seen the film, because this book has another chapter which changes the end of the story and gives it a more hopeful tone."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"What is a clockwork orange? Anthony Burgess, the author of A Clockwork Orange, would seem like the first person to ask such a question. \\"\`The attempt to impose upon man, a creature of growth and capable of sweetness, to ooze juicily at the last round the bearded lips of God, to attempt to impose, I say, laws and conditions appropriate to a mechanical creation, against this I raise my sword pen-'\\" (22). Alex, and his three pals, Dim, Georgie, and Pete, are normal teenagers living in a futuristic world that is somewhat of a nightmare. These boys' rape women, steal, kill, and savagely beat other citizens living in this time; as a solution the government \\"rewires\\" Alex to feel sick when the want to do any of these things occurs. He becomes \\"a clockwork orange\\" in the sense that he doesn't have the ability to decide what is good, or evil, and whether to participate in \\"evil\\" acts. Had the book only consisted of my brief outline above, it wouldn't be the well known and thoroughly enjoyed classic that it is today. Along with an eyebrow raising plot, the style, questioning of morality, and unique outlook on the future, makes A Clockwork Orange, not only an important book, but an entertaining one. I truly enjoyed reading, and re-reading this book. I assume that throughout my progression into adulthood, I will find it entertaining for different reasons than I do now, and I hope to re-read it again, and again. A book that can change, as a person changes, is something to cherish to enjoy. I believe that most people will find entertainment, if not shock value, to this controversial text. I definitely consider it to be one of my favorites, and a must read to all participants of an educated society."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I have not seen the movie \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" and at my 3rd attempt at reading the book, I finally finished.

Its GREAT."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"So many passionate and intelligent reviewers have talked about this book, mostly discussing the conflicts of good vs. evil and man vs. the state. But no-one has discussed the unending source of Alex's fascinating personality. Is this modern icon of cool a demon or a damsel in distress?On the surface, Alex seems to be a very macho personality -- a stereotypical teenage hoodlum slashing away with his razor, fighting like a demon with fisties and boots, a cross between the volatile Riff in WEST SIDE STORY and the rebellious James Dean in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE.Yet what makes Alex stand out from the pack is the languid, almost feminine personality he exhibits whenever not actually fighting in the street. Aside from his delight in violence, all his personality traits are \\"feminine.\\" He's dainty and fastidious in his dress, obsessed with cleanliness and neatness, sensitive to pleasant smells and extremely disdainful of sloppy people and dirty surroundings. Moreover, his Nadsat language contains a surprising amount of baby talk, the kind girls use. And he insists on describing himself as \\"luscious,\\" inviting us to imagine a fair damsel and not a foul brute.All this is very important in explaining why the reader cares so deeply about Alex, in spite of all the hateful and ugly crimes that lead to the \\"treatment\\" in prison and the ordeals that follow after. Really we are reading about a damsel in distress -- and we sympathize completely because the person being injected with drugs, tied in a chair, and so forth, responds in a way that's more endearingly pliant, submissive and helpless with each passing page.By the time Alex is relased from prison, our sympathies are entirely with the dazed and helpless damsel, who obviously needs rescuing. And the irony, of course, is that the ruggedly handsome writer who takes Alex in after his beating by police is the same man Alex injured earlier in the novel. Note that in the Kubrick movie version, writer F. Alexander is a cripple and a gibbering buffoon. But in the book, F. Alexander is strong, ruggedly handsome -- and a lot more masculine than Alex. It's very easy to visualize Alex as a forlorn damsel, a beauty in distress whose suffering awakens the protective side of this rugged knight's chivalrous nature. The reader is put off balance, drawn even more deeply into sympathy for Alex, who by now is gentle and meek and sweetly submissive, wearing the rugged writer's pajamas and all but eating out of his hand.If Alex were a true damsel in distress, this would be the beginning of a love story, not a journey into further terror.(See the superb historical romance SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME by Lisa Kleypas.) But in this case the reader does not know what to expect, and these oddly tender images and emotions help to explain A CLOCKWORK ORANGE'S haunting and disturbing appeal."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I love this story. Its violent, but raises some interesting questions and without the Nadsat slang, the book wouldn't be nearly as good."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I greatly encourage the reading of A Clockwork Orange; its use of language alone is reason enough. The incorporation of \\"nadsat\\" words emphasizes the separation of the teen culture from society in the novel's setting. The difficulty I faced while beginning the novel surprisingly dissipated after the first few paragraphs. One quickly becomes use to the new language and Burgess' writing. At first appearing as gibberish, after deconstructing the roots of the nadsat words, I understood the profoundness in the author's choice of words. For example, the name Alex, which is Russian in origin (as is nadsat), literally means outside of the law. As well as Burgess' use of nadsat, he also incorporates repetition in Alex's narration, \\"Then he flick-flickflicked with his bolshy...\\" (Burgess, p. 93). This style of writing really aided me in visualizing the events, despite the narrator's lack of description of setting. The reader is forced to experience the book's events from Alex's point of view, and I found that at times I felt I was in Alex's place. Additionally, in Alex's narration, he would describe the most prominent features of places and people, paralleling the way we remember things in real life. A Clockwork Orange, to me, was like a memory-things that were considered small were omitted or forgotten, but the story was told and the details considered significant were emphasized and described. In addition to A Clockwork Orange's achievements in language, its arguments of morality are insightful. The most fascinating point Burgess makes is about the need for free will, even if that results in one doing bad things. In the novel, the government tries to end crime by removing freewill; however, this is no solution. Since in order to be good, one must choose to be good. The act is not what makes something immoral; it is the intent. In conclusion, A Clockwork Orange was unlike anything I have ever read, and because of its creative use of language, insightful messages and interesting plot, I highly recommend that it is read."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I first became familiar with A Clockwork Orange in 1972 as a 20 year old in Northern California going to the movies with my sisters and friends to see what it was all about. I was first struck by the brilliance of the soundtract but immediately next by the comedic violence that quickly lost its humor. I found the film a witty satire, but I missed the meaning of the Mechanical Orange for a long time. I thought of it as reflecting the circular journey of Alex and all the uselessness of the system and all its bizarre, hypocrites along the way, ending up where he began. Perhaps there was some logic in that view?Most of all, I loved the music. I recall feeling highly critical of people who condemned the film because of the violence in it. The violence wasn't the point but an illustration I thought. I still ocassionally listen to the soundtract, it is as brilliant as ever, but I rarely view the movie. Once you understand the point, this is not a film for entertainment, but for re-exploration of the themes. I was disturbed to hear that copycat gangs had sprung up and were going around actually hurting people. Anyone who argues that movies and video games do not produce copycat behavior in some people should be reminded of this.I still think the movie (and book) has value. But it may be very different now. In a time when our society has gangs everywhere and even the MS13 running around seemingly at will, the idea that at a point young men (mostly) grow out of it may be our only hope. But how DO we deal with it? The film (and book)has an important message couched in the question; \\"What makes a person truly good? However, it does seem that only people concerned with higher values care. Current gangs are not concerned with intellectualizing their lives at all.I always thought that the film made the point that even religion was manipulative in this sense. In the film when the reverend claims \\"The boy has no choice. He is forced to be good by mechanical programing rather than a conscious moral choice.\\" (This is a paraphrase, not a real quote). But what struck me in the film is that the reverend was earlier threatening Alex and all the other prisoners during a preaching sermon with horrible torture in Hell. Myself, I see no difference in Behavior Modification methods as the \\"Ludovico Technique\\" represented or the religious brand of what turns out to be the same proposition. Perhaps a political compromise where a prayer could be said during the subjects treatmemnt would have made the reverend and the Church happy because the Church was being involved in a State mandated intrusion into questions of moral conduct via the consciousness of an individual? \\"As the PM said, who cares about the details, the fact is that it works!\\" We would try whatever we thought would suceed in ending the cycle of youth gang violence if we had the chance, I'm guessing.I have read many reviews of the book and the movie and no one I have read has mentioned this problem. I read that A. Burgess himself a religious man was attempting to convey that moral choice is important. But how does anyone reconcile this when entire cultures all over the world seem to depend on some form of moral programing from birth? Is anyone really free to choose? I am reminded of the exploration of inherent good and evil in books like \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" and \\"Heart of Darkness.\\"Perhaps the true message of a book and film like this could be that we need to explore the question of thought freedom. Free thought and action as opposed to programed thought and action like the \\"chicken and the egg\\" may in the end be locked in an odd circulum of contradictions - A Clockwork Orange?"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Most fans of subversive literature (and film) probably already know what this book is about. Of course the story is casually violent, while the bizarre invented slang spoken by the goofy classical music-loving and philosophical young hoodlum gives the reading of the book a vaguely surreal and sarcastic quality. That's all fairly well known, so it helps to consider the themes on violence and state control that Anthony Burgess explores here. Alex the nogoodnick is weaned off of his personal violence when the authorities force him to watch state-sponsored violence, so how is the state less morally corrupt than the individual? The idea that violence can supposedly stop violence is probably the most brutally ironic theme considered here. Meanwhile, an average schmuck is used by competing political factions for their own small gains, and in the process nearly loses his humanity - while the state gets more and more control thanks to timid citizens who are willing to give up liberty for security. Sound familiar? Some parts of this classic novel are a bit worn out and are not aging too well, but you have to admit that it really makes you think. If you can viddy it. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"To the reader who declared, \\"The theme I'm told is, 'is it better to choose evil than to be forced to do good,'\\" I have to point out that this is a misreading of Burgess' intent. The problem, or question, posed by this \\"nasty little shocker,\\" (as the book was called by Burgess himself, if I'm not mistaken), comes down to \\"what does it mean to be human, to be a moral creature?\\" In other words, why did God create humankind with free will? Why would He allow His creatures to commit evil? Wouldn't He have preferred His creatures to act peacefully and benevolently, such that he would have made them incapable of choosing malevolence and violence?The title itself, \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" refers, according to Burgess, to something which has the appearance of life, but which is mechanistic, its actions predetermined. An orange is an organic object, which grows naturally, while a \\"clockwork orange\\" merely apes the appearance of an organic, growing object: it is a construct, a machine which cannot change and which cannot act other than how it has been designed to act.As a catholic, Burgess wanted to demonstrate that God gave his creatures free will--choice--in order that they come to moral behavior out of their own reasoning and spiritual/moral maturation. In other words, had God's creatures lacked the capacity to behave brutally and with evil intent, they could never become moral creatures, as they would only have been machines, capable only of acting as they had been designed. Such creatures are not alive in a spiritual sense, but are windup toys which simulate the activity of life but which are dead. Machines have no morality, and neither do creatures who cannot choose their actions. Each major section of the novel begins with the question, \\"What's it going to be then, eh?\\" A machine cannot ask or answer that question, but can only hum along performing its limited, thoughtless reflex actions. Animals, similarly, despite being organic creatures, behave largely mechanistically, in that they do not have a morality, but behave according only to instinct and inborn impulses which allow them to survive in an unforgiving but morally blank environment.It is our capacity for free choice, even when we choose to behave evilly, which allows us to develop a morality, and this distinguishes us from animals and machines, and it is what makes us God's creatures. That Alex appreciates music and adores Beethoven indicates he has an aesthetic, a capacity to enjoy that which is not merely related to the brutal imperatives of survival, and it is this which signifies his potential for deeper human growth.(I must point out I am an atheist, but I am speaking via the terms of Burgess' own thinking.)The final chapter of the book, which was truncated from the original American edition of the book, and likewise from Kubrick's film, illustrates Burgess' point: in it, Alex has grown a bit older, he's perhaps in his early 20s. He's married, has children, and looks back on his career of teen hooliganism with a nostalgic enjoyment, but he's also grown out of it, and he realizes that one cannot always live such a life. He has grown in years, in experience, and he has developed a morality. Had he not been \\"cured\\" of the government's behavior modification treatment, he might never again have behaved violently, but it would not be because he had grown out of it, had CHOSEN to leave it behind. It would have been only because he could NOT have acted in any other way. He might have always harbored violent desires, or he might have had NO desires, but he would not have been a creature of God, a moral creature, because the chance to grow into that state would have been denied him. He would have been a \\"clockwork orange,\\" and not a human being."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"The main character in A Clockwork Orange, Alex, has many hobbies such as stealing, fighting, raping, murdering, and listening to classical music. As you hopefully can tell, Alex isn't your typical teenager, and this is not your typical novel. Instead it is a quirky and offbeat story that highlights the conflict between individuality and conformity. It also dips into the realm of totalitarian governments, propaganda, brainwashing and pretty much everything else that has to do with THE GOVERNMENT CONTROLING YOU. Alex lives in a desolate near-future world were his friends are not his friends, his enemies are not his enemies, and nothing is truly what it seems. From page one it is evident that Alex is already a sub-human whose only emotions are rage, jealousy, greed, lust, and hatred. He has no aspirations, no goals, and no motives of any kind. The reader follows him through the night and bears witness to his senseless and repeated acts of violence and destruction. Although he believes he is the master of his own domain, it is made evident throughout the story that he is nothing more than a mere pawn.I enjoyed this book because it made me think about how the world may someday be. In many respects it reminded me of George Orville's 1984, in that it creates a world where human rights are frequently violated so that the government can control the entire population. I will admit that the unique language in which Alex speaks is obnoxious until you eventually decipher the meaning of his words. On the whole though, A Clockwork Orange is a quick read that you will not be able to put down, and it will keep you thinking long after you finish it."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I have a peculiar trait of not reading what i am told to read. When the teacher tells us to read sheakspeare for homework, that is the one thing i dont do. I read quite often, and I DO IT FOR PLEASURE AND ENJOYMENT. This book was one of those books that I would pick up apposed to doing my calc. I enjoyed this book very much, It tickled my mind more than whatever I wasnt reading in school would have, I guarentee it. This book brought to the light issues of free will, governemnt, humanity, and morals, or lack there-of. Kindof funny isnt it. Morals. I read this around election time and morals seem to be the hot topic, especially with the right wingers. People seem to think government can improve peoples morals, what a load. Lets take a look at alex's world. His government is the epitomy of controlling ones feeling and morals, but lo and behold is Alex a nice person? What about his droogies? NO. Even with alex's transformation at the end he is miles from what we would call acceptable today. Let us not forget that the goal of being \\"moral\\" is to provide an enviornment where an alex must change, not to change an alex. I think we are forgetting that, and this book is a good reminder.

THREE: The language takes a while to understand. FOUR: This is one of the most exciting and innovative books to come from any author in the last century!Anthony Burgess has achieved something extraordinary; a book with class and style, and a centre character you would love to hate...but you can't! If you look at the movie (Stanley Kubrick) it plays like a direct opposite to &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;, with the first half showing total and utter mayhem and the second half a sickeningly controlled enviroment where Alex our &quot;Poor and humble narrator&quot; has his write to freedom taken away. While reading the book you may be disgusted and put the book down but you'll end up picking it up again and questioning yourself how the hell did I put this down? The answer is that this novel is so intriguing and so inventive that if the violence and sex is a bit too much you can forgive it because it is needed and necerssary! The language he has created &quot;nadsat&quot; is a stroke of genius and before long you'll be speaking the lingo in your normal conversation without knowing it. Absolute class.If you have a taste for contraversy and innovative thinking you'll love this. If you have a small mind and don't look beyond the norm than you'll hate it and be disgusted but for the people who aren't delve into the world of Alex and his droogs and viddie how propper horrorshow this novel is!

The story of a teenage thug in a dingy, bleak world of the near future is probably one of the most disturbing and talked about books ever written. I believe that the most disturbing stories are the ones that are the most realistic. And this book, for the most part, is very realistic. I think that if a government was offered a quick solution to the problem of violent crime the government would happily accept that solution regardless of the moral implications it raises. The futuristic slang invented by Anthony Burgess is a clever way of making sure the novel never becomes dated. If I was an English teacher I would make my students read it. One thing I do not agree with about the book is the idea that violent people grow out of being violent. Getting older is not a cure for criminal behaviour. There are murderers and sexual offenders out there aged in their sixties. The novel would be just as good without the last chapter, even if it does affect the numerical unity. Apart from that, &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; is a good book about morality and freedom of choice. I can never listen to Beethoven without thinking of this book."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"The setting for the unusual and ultra-violent events is in the far future, as seen from the 1960s, and perhaps still so,as seen from the 1990. The time frame is never clearly specified, either to take away from the story's credibility, or to attain the opposite purpose, that of inducing the reader to see the characters as contemporaries, or able to inhabit any epoch. For those who saw the novel as a &quot;nasty little shocker&quot; (Time Magazine; out of context), and were afraid of the implications, there is one hope-giving detail: the main character briefly reflects about the people living on the Moon, so this future is still somewhere in the unreachable domain. The predominant impression is that of abandonment by society, alienation from the mainstream (of whose existence the reader is barely made aware) and absence of a true authority, except for the non-interactive Ministry of Interior (or Inferior, the two of which were interchangeable in the mind of the main character), and the Correction Officers, both of whom only briefly appear. The readers who get scared are comforted by the setting's anonymity. Those who search beyond the cruel reality of the time see book as moralistic, even didactic. The events portrayed are excessively dark, but their purpose is not to shock, but to show life as a dialectic interaction between good and evil, and to reflect upon human freedom, and even the cost and perhaps worth of redemption.The antihero is a fifteen-year-old boy, Alex. He is pathologically criminal, vicious, uneducated, drugged or drunk most of the time, and occasionally arrested. In addition to being the main character, he is the narrator of the story, which he tells in a brutal argot, called nadsat (a russified English). His nighttime rapes and murders are committed in an ultra-violent manner, with no justification other than fun. Alex's three droogs (friends), Pete, Georgie, and Dim, &quot;Dim being really dim&quot; generally surround him, and are his accomplices. Alex has a very hot temper, never takes Dim seriously, and assumes the position of leader of the group, suggesting the increasingly severe crimes to be committed. Besides torture, he has a passion for classical music (by which he feels inspired), Beethoven in particular. The book follows his evolution, which remains linear (and directed toward evil) until the very last chapter, when he becomes &quot;cured&quot; of his wickedness.A certain Dr. Brodsky had thought of a cure for Alex's condition, something that would redeem him. When informed that the treatment &quot;cured&quot; people, making them not have to return to isolation from society, Alex honestly thought that the treatment would teach him how to escape the police, and thus not have to return to prison. The treatment consisted of giving Alex &quot;vitamin&quot; shots, and making him watch, movies (whose soundtracks were all pieces of classical music) of various acts of violence similar to those committed by him and his friends, without the possibility of closing his eyes or moving. In a way, the treatment proves successful, because Alex's body is trained to respond to violence as any rational human being would: through fear and disgust. Later, news breaks about the treatment and it is deemed cruel by the vox populi. After a series of events at the end of which he is injured, he wakes up in a hospital and realizes that he was capable of violence again. The last chapter is almost identical to the first chapter, except that Alex is now older, and surrounded by different droogs. Alex realizes that his life had been insignificant, and that violence is a prerogative of youth, and wants to start a family. To his child he would explain what he had done, why he had done it, but he would not try to stop him from making the mistakes he had made in his youth.The point of view adopted is that of Alex. He is the narrator, and directly addresses the reader. From the beginning, he treats the reader as one of his droogs, asking, &quot;What's it going to be then, eh?&quot; His point of view is a very good choice for the story, because frame of reference is located in one extreme, which emphasizes the irrationality of the behavior presented. The opposite side, that of the time's society also affects Alex. The State, though never present in the reality surrounding Alex, somehow stretches an invisible hand, tries to play God, decides to save the poor droog, and of course, fails.It is hard to distinguish style in such a work, where almost every trick has been done, every artifice tried to disguise, distort, diffuse and obfuscate reality, normality, and common sense. However, there are some characteristics of Mr. Burgess' style of writing that are common to his other works and the surface in &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. The characters have slightly varied speech patterns, so that it is evident when Dim speaks, and when Alex makes fun of his intelligence. The &quot;nadsat&quot; used by the characters is not only inventive (making the book a little hard to understand), but also puts a barrier between the delicate mind of the reader and the very graphic violence of rape, torture and murder. There are some very British recurring phrases, such as &quot;the old&quot;, which seems to be used for every other thing.The main symbol is the orange, clockwork, as it is. As it is clear, there are no such things as clockwork oranges, except when society creates them out of its members. A human being, a member of society is endowed with free will, with the ability to choose, to distinguish and to discriminate. The message the book tries to send is that when this will is lost, there is nothing to ensure one's humanity; it is very tightly condensed in the &quot;clockwork orange&quot;. A person can become a clockwork orange, that only looks like an organism (human in this case), but is in fact nothing more than a machine that always responds in the same way, whether good or evil (depending on who manipulates the machine).The question of free will and goodness is debated throughout the book. It is the theme of story. The horrible crimes, and the shocking violence are presented to shake the reader's senses, and to prove that when the important questions (such as &quot;At what cost should redemption come?&quot; or &quot;Is a man who chooses the bad perhaps in some way better than a man who has the good imposed upon him?&quot;), although about a murderer, are asked, the reader no longer has a clear-cut answer(such as :&quot;He's guilty. Should be killed&quot;). In the final instance, the book asks if God values more the product of oranges, or the will of humans.The subsidiary theme, that of evil as a part of life, is too directed toward the concept of free will. Moral choice would not exist if there was no evil to choose (or not) over good. The main character destroys, because destruction is easier, but more spectacular than construction. Violence is a priority of youth, because youth are not wise enough to see the potential of creativeness and the undermining that is hidden by the seemingly spectacular chaos they create. Evil is present in all of us, and that is why we find this book of interest, no matter how remote. To deny that there was some interest would be to deny humanity and to embrace a state of clockwork orangeness.Noteworthy is also the idea of continuity. After growing up as young murderers, the droogs become policemen. They enter the opposite part of society, only to let their children take their place on the opposite end. In their own, different ways, both extremes tend to become oranges, but society does not, because the oranges it contains have clocks going in opposite ways. The evil presented, which seems to be boundless and unappeasable recycles itself, and becomes good, but somehow, it doesn't balance the self-destructive tendencies of society. The proof, and the truly sad and disappointing part is that the State is removed, and it is capable of more evil than good, even when treating the most evil of men (toward which it should have a fair attitude, an example of just government)."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This version of the book starts off with a rant from the author. He explains that this book is not what he considers his best work. He also tells the reader that this is the first complete version of the book in the US. The first release or the \\"Kubrick release\\" left out the last chapter. Burgess tells us that he believes this to be a mistake. He was correct when he says that this is not his best work. It isn't his best work. It is a great concept and he has a way with words but it's much too \\"mathmatical\\" and less creative. I had trouble creating my inner animation. Which many would not agree with that assessment considering his creation of a slang, which was to highlight youths ongoing penchant to create an esoteric lingo to distiguish themselves from authority. Now, Burgess was incorrect in saying that his original version is the best. The Kubrick version of 20 chapters is the better book. That last chapter is not exactly fitting and doesn't satisfy the theme as Burgess imagined it would. It's tired just like Alex. His use of \\"What's it going to be then, eh?\\", leaves me grey. I can't make up my mind on whether it's quite intelligent or pretentious or contrived or all of the above. It is not the prophetic masterpiece many believe it to be. Violence has always been a constant in human society. Prophetic would be speaking of peace. It's a good concept, too technical outside of the slang, and can be difficult to read."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I would like to begin by saying that I chose this book for a high school book report. I am not sure if I would recommend it for other high school students except for juniors and seniors in honors classes. It is difficult to overlook the violence to get to its true meaning. The story was incredibly interesting because it is so different from anything else I've read. Nothing can give you the same disturbing feeling that this story can. I also recommend the movie."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"After following a few violent days in the life of Alex, the anti-hero of Anthony Burgess' A Clockwork Orange, and his friends (his 'droogs' in the slang of the time), we're obviously supposed to be shocked when we he declares, after murdering an elderly woman, &quot;And me still only fifteen.&quot;Yawn.Maybe when written in 1962 this was shocking. Post-Columbine High School, most people have become numb to violent acts committed by children. The fact that Alex and his gang's favorite past times were spreading terror, theft, and rape, may even seem tame by today's standards. Yet we should be appalled, none the less. Not at his age, but with the cavalier attitude towards death and the destruction of the lives of others.It is a well known fact that Burgess was dismayed at the success of A Clockwork Orange. In the introduction to the 1986 reprint, which included the &quot;missing&quot; 21st chapter, never published in the United States before (more on that later), Burgess says he would &quot;be glad to disown it for various reasons, but that is not permitted.&quot; While ACO survives, other works of his that he values more, &quot;bite the dust.&quot; Such is the life of an artist.Our humble narrator is a 15-year old leader of a small gang of droogs. The four spend their after-school hours wreaking as much havoc as they can muster. Of course, boys being boys, someone has to lead the pack. Following a scuffle, in which Alex remains shakily atop the hill, the boys decide to rob the house of an old woman. After failing to gain entry through the front door with a sick friend sob story, Alex climbs through a window. He's supposed to open the front door for the rest. He doesn't. In an attempt to show them who is in control, Alex decides to take care of business on his own. It does not go as planned. The little old lady, aided by a multitude of cats, refuses to go quietly. Why such spunk from an obviously frail vessel? After refusing to let them in the front door, she called the police. A crack from granny's cane, sirens and a few squished cats (reeeeeer!) later, Alex makes a mad dash for the front door. Unfortunately (for Alex) his chum Dim sees Alex's shaky footing and decides that the King must move over. Alex takes one across the glazlids, and is left blinded for the police to pick him up.Though sentenced to spend 15 years in prison, a stroke of luck gives Alex the opportunity to participate in a new experimental aversion treatment for violent criminals. He emerges from prison a changed, if not particularly new, man. The violent impulses are still there, but he is overwhelmed by nausea whenever they rear their ugly head.Enter Politics.Now a &quot;victim&quot; of the state, the opposition political party that is fighting the government's recent crackdown on violent crime seizes upon Alex's plight. He becomes their poster child for overthrowing the oppressive regime in the next elections. Tormented by his present condition, Alex attempts suicide by leaping from a window. His failure only draws attention to the issue (the opposition is delighted) but prods the government into righting its previous &quot;wrong&quot; by changing Alex back to his old self.&quot;I was cured all right,&quot; the original American version ended. So now our little droog is back to the way he was; violent, chaotic free will and hormones raging. Ready to prey on society once again, only now with a good paying government job from his new friends.The new version or, perhaps I should say, the original version (now available in the U.S.) has an entirely different ending. In the final chapter, our &quot; young thuggish protagonist grows up. He feels bored with violence and recognises that human energy is better expended on creation rather than destruction.&quot; This version, Burgess believes, is a true novel as it is founded on the principle that human beings change. The old American version was a fable as are all fictional works that fail to show change in human character.Magill's Survey of World Literature calls ACO an attack on totalitarian states. Burgess believes, &quot;No matter how awful Alex's actions become, he should be allowed to choose them.&quot; Without the ability to choose to do right or in other words, to be forced to do right, isn't really doing right at all. The prison chaplain, who befriends Alex, puts it succinctly when he says, &quot;When a man ceases to choose, he ceases to be a man... It may be horrible to be good.&quot;Of course, the good Chaplain doesn't get an opinion of Alex's past victims on how horrible it would be. He warns the pre-treatment Alex, &quot;You are passing now to a region where you will be beyond the reach of the power of prayer. A terrible terrible thing to consider.&quot; Excuse me? This from a man of the cloth? But he's not finished, &quot;And yet, in a sense, in choosing to be deprived of the ability to make an ethical choice, you have in a sense really chosen the good. So I shall like to think.&quot;Burgess, like his jailhouse preacher, is a strong believer in free will. They are appalled that government could decide to take away ones ability to make decisions between right and wrong. If that happens, a person is no longer a person and the fact that they will no longer harm anyone else is secondary to the fact they have been harmed themselves. Then what is the point of punishing criminal behavior?One supposes that modern readers of the book, probably like those that read it 35 years ago, don't really have a moral dilemma when it comes to punishing criminals. After all, aren't they denied free will when they are put in prison for life? Why the controversy over a little &quot;reprogramming&quot; that allows them out on the streets again and, perhaps, contribute something to society.One is reminded of Bruce Springsteen, when his hit 'Born in the USA,' an anti-war, anti-American ballad, was being sung as a pro-American song. Springsteen was indignant: That's not what he had in mind at all.Which brings us to the final, omitted (dare I say censored?) chapter. In the original novella, and the revised American version, Burgess' character has a sort of realization that maybe the life of violence he has lead is not the right way. Maybe he should even get married and have kids - not that he would be able to control them any more than his parents did with him, but just maybe...Is this a true conversion in Alex? Or is it the idle prattle of a common street thug? Burgess intended for us to believe that it was the beginnings of a true change.Suppose it is. That's not a hard thesis to support. Alex himself recognizes that something is changing. &quot;There is something happening inside me,&quot; he says, &quot;and I wondered if it was like some disease or if it was what they had done to me...&quot; But Burgess fails to take the cue from his own character. Perhaps out of resentment for the original omission of his last chapter, Burgess refuses to even recognize that maybe it was the punishment he received that has lead to the new Alex. Instead, Burgess gives all the credit to Alex's free will. Perhaps. After all, as he says, &quot;The important thing is moral choice. Evil has to exist along with good, in order that moral choice may operate.&quot; And so it must."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange has twenty one chapters, yet the version released in the United States has only twenty.

It has been made particularly famous by Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation, and both the film and the book are routinely ranked in various surveys amongst the most significant works in their corresponding genres.One of the main idiosyncrasies of the book is the use of an invented teenage slang (or more specifically \\"argot\\") called Nadsat. Burgess was a polyglot, so for him it was an interesting exercise to create a whole new manner of speaking. Nadsat was largely based on Russian words with a few traditional English slang words and phrases. One of the motivations for the invention of a completely fictional slang was Burgess' desire to keep his characters fresh and relevant for a foreseeable future. Thus, a use of any concurrent argots would have made book dated very quickly. However, the heavy use of Nadsat makes \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" fairly difficult to read. My native language is Croatian, another Slavic tongue, and I found that I was able to understand majority of the Russian words without a need for a glossary. Nonetheless, the Anglicized orthography of the words made them sufficiently alien to me that I needed to pause and think about the meaning of those words as I was reading. If you are not familiar with any Slavic languages, then either try to go through a glossary of Nadsat words or try to figure their meaning out from the context.If you can get past the language then \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" will present you with one of the most innovative and original works of fiction in the twentieth century. Burgess' ability to completely get into the head of a delinquent youth is astounding and has not lost any of its original freshness. Even in the age when we are bombarded with violent images in the media on a daily basis, the descriptions of \\"ultraviolence\\" is still very unsettling and disturbing. One of the book's main themes is a reform of violent offenders, and the ethics of the use of behavioral conditioning as a form of rehabilitation. This is what the title of the book refers to: clockwork orange is an unnatural combination of mechanical clockwork, and a soft, juicy living organism. The contradiction between these two opposing forces creates unresolvable tension that can only end in a disaster.Despite its innovative use of language, futuristic setting, and the graphical description of violence, \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is essentially a classic morality play. This is probably one of the main reasons for book's enduring popularity and relevance. Themes of youthful alienation, repentant malefactors, and individual's moral progress are universally relatable and applicable. This alone makes this book worth reading and all the effort worthwhile."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This has a higher star-rating, as at least one (and probably more) used this area to inappropriately complain about \\"not receiving the book\\" which is a mercantile problem Use the A-Z Guarantee system. The book is five star: read it, read a few essays so you'll appreciate it's brilliance, and write a book, NOT service review. Please join me in reporting all such misplace criticisms as \\"inappropriate.Amazon, remove them, please - they pollute you otherwise very useful review system!!!!!!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This is an instant favorite of so many people because: 1) It is very creative 2) Well-written 3) Has a contemporary feel and 4) It explores human nature, free will, and hope. Burgess does all of this in the number of pages that few authors have proven possible. The depth of Burgess' writing is something that I think has not been reproduced since. When it comes to literature, the only thing I value more than complex, flowery poetry and abstraction in the guise of a novel is depth, in the sense that every sentence gives the reader many tidbits of information about the literary construction of the novel's world. I also think that Burgess' understanding of psychology is unheralded. Many of brief notes, often subtle, speaks volumes about the uman condition and man's response to it.I also like that Burgess uses the russian language as slang in this book, because I have a penchant for the language. I thought it was an interesting and original implementation.I recommend this book to everyone!(note: that there are two versions of this book; the original and the american version. The american, or Kubrickian version, does not have chapter 21. I have been asked on many occassions why I speak of hope and free will when discussing this book, and this is due to chapter 21, which entirely changes the meaning of the book.)"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Right, right, right, Amazon droogs, let me bend your ookos about something for a minoota. This malchick here's got a couple of bolshie slovos to shazat to you all. One of the many books in my biblio is A Clockwork Orange written by that Anthony Burgess veck. It's the story of Little Alex and his droogs who go about shopcrasting, tolchocking other gang members with britvas and nozhes, as well as going on the surprise visit and having a bit of the old in-out, in-out with some hapless devotchka or what not. His tyrannical ways becomes his undoing and his droogs turn on him. He is sent to the Staja (state jail) on a murder charge, but that sentenced is commuted in exchange for taking part in \\"this new treatment that gets you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure that you never get back in again.\\" But is that better than the traditional eye for an eye, as the prison Governor says?The debate between good and evil is the bolshy theme here as explained in this passage comparing goodness and badness as different shops: \\"If lewdies are good that's because they like it, and I wouldn't interfere with their pleasures, and so on to the other shop. And I was patronizing the other shop. More, badness is of the self, the one, the you or me on our oddy knockies, and that other self is made by old Bog or God and is his great pride and radosty. But the not-self cannot have the bad, meaning they of the government and the judges and the schools cannot allow the bad because they cannot allow the self. And is not our modern history, my brothers, the story of brave malenky selves fighting these big machines?\\" The self against the machines. Yes, we saw in the 1960's, my brothers. But the quote also explains that we are all so full of what Christians call original sin, we want to go into that shop of badness, we enjoy seeing scenes of ultraviolence, people being tolchocked. After all, it's easier to destroy rather than create, so it's no surprise despite having a decent pee and em raising him up, that our humble narrator dishes and gets dished the tortures of the damned.Another bolshy theme pops up when the prison charles has a govoreet with Alex, who has just gotten the opportunity to undergo this Ludovico vesch that turns a malchick like himself good. The charles says, \\"What does God want? Does God want goodness or the choice of goodness? Is a man who chooses the bad perhaps in some way better than a man who has the good imposed upon him?\\" Or still, \\"in a sense, in choosing to be deprived of the ability to make an ethical choice, [is to have] in a sense really chosen the good?\\"The number of chapters also plays a significant role, like it did in Dante's Divine Comedy. This book is divided into three sections, each of 7 chapters each. Seven times three is twenty-one, which is the age at which someone reaches adulthood, and that last chapter was originally taken out of the American release of this book. That's how the film directed by that Stanley Kubrick chelloveck ended.And that's where I too end, oh my brothers, for a bit of spatchka. I finish with a tall glass of the old warm moloko, \\"before getting my passport stamped...at sleep's frontier.\\", to spat perchance to sneety, but that's another work altogether"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I came accross A Clockwork Orange sheerly by accident. I was looking for another book entirely; however the title caught my attention, I read the back, and forgot about the other book.A Clockwork Orange is an amazingly well written book. Burgess' Alex narrarates the entire story using his made-up Nadsat (teenage) language. On reading the first sentence, I was like, &quot;What the heck is this?&quot; It left me completely confused, yet I promise you, that by (at most) the 5th page, you will understand entirely what is meant by viddy (see), metso (place), litso (face), nogas (feet), horrorshow (fantastic), so on, so on.Anthony Burgess takes you into the mind of a teenage boy and asks you whether or not a person who does only good because they have no other choice is better of than a person who chooses to do bad. It is amazing and leaves you thinking and laughing all at once. YES, you heard me, LAUGHING! A person may be so cought off gaurd by what is happening to even realize that the book is laugh out loud funny.Read A Clockwork Orange. Now. You'll love it. I Promise."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"By writing A Clockwork Orange, Anthony Burgess created one of the most disturbing novels that I have ever read. It begins with our most humble narrator, Alex, living his teenage years as a drug-addicted bugular and rapist. Alex and his friends commit crimes for fun and see nothing wrong with their incredibly violent ways. When eventually Alex is caught by the police and put in the State Jail, he is entered into a program that will supposedly 'cure' him of his violent actions and allow him to go free. The question is, though, does someone actually become 'good' when their free will to make that choice is taken away? Which is worse: choosing to do wrong or being forced to choose good? Burgess really makes you think about that idea as Alex's life progresses after he goes through the cruel procedure to 'reform' him. I would definitely recommend reading this book to anyone, as long as they are prepared for a lot of violence and gore (as well as Burgess' invented slang that Alex and his friends use - it takes a little while to get used to). What's it going to be then, eh? Go read A Clockwork Orange and get ready to think about a lot of stuff you never have before."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Often as readers we like to stay within our comfort zone of understanding disguised as a genre or favorite Author. It's when we break from our solace that we learn something new and expand our thoughts. With it's futuristic slang and disturbing, yet sometimes comical satire, this book is an enjoyable yet challenging (to finish at a normal pace) read. Although first published in the early 1960's, A Clockwork Orange is timeless."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange in my opinion is by far the best book ever written. Anthony Burgess did a tremendous job of writing about the frightening future and all the violence it brings. But, evil becomes good at the end, and that is great."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange is a page-turner that captivates the interest of all who read it. Burgess's invention of the &quot;Nadist&quot; language is pure brillance. The message of the book (which is left unmentioned, to capture the intrest of the &quot;unexperienced&quot; reader) is a message that can still be applied today, aproxemntlly thrity years later, to the modern society. The discriptive language paints a vivid picture of the violent acts described. I wish I could have read the book the way the author had intended it. He was upseted by the American transformation of the book. The last chapter (Chapter 21), was left out and a glossry of the Nadist language was added. Despite these suttle changes the novel is interesting and though provoking, overall very enjoyable."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This is by far the gratest book ever written. One thing that people oftin forget is that this book is also very funny. Brillent language, and exuisit writing make this a real horrorshow of a book. I highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This novella is now one of my favorites. It's short, addicting, and it's hard to stop reading once it's over. It's not for the light hearted, however. If you are sensitive when it comes to gang violence and the like, I wouldn't recommend this book. With that said, if you can handle it, I highly recommend this novella; it's wonderful!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Clockwork Orange stands as a excellent piece of literature that stands the test of time.

The book was in very good shape too with no pages ruined."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is definitely not for the easily offended, especially the first thirty or forty pages, which include beatings, rapings, and robberies, all done without any guilt felt by the criminals. But if you can get past this, then you will see that this is almost a perfect book. It's central theme, which is that it is better to have the choice to act immorally and to do so than it is to act morally without choice, is weaved masterfully throughout the entire novel. I also loved the invented &quot;nadsat&quot; slang that is used by Alex and his friends. I reccomend that you go online and download the nadsat translator or print out the fifteen pages of definitions from your computer-- this helped me immensely. This really is one of the best books I have read, and I would reccomend it to anyone with an open mind."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I really enjoyed a Clockwork Orange. It's comment's on society and government were tremendous and the launguage is brilliant. I actually had a little bit of a hard time adjusting to the style of the book but once I got into it it was a great read. Other books you might like if you liked this book are: One Flew over the Coo Coo's nest, Howard Zinn's: A people's History of America or On the Road."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"In this highly original, graphic, and powerful book, Anthony Burgess, endows his main character, Alex, with a futuristic slang, in which Russian words play a major role...Alex's first person narrative flows so smoothly and naturally that, oh my brothers, I really felt the horror that comes from realizing just how natural violence is to us...Alex undergoes a moral transformations, in the chapter that was originally omitted when the book was published in the U.S. Ultimately, moral transformation can come only from within. And the possibility of this transformation is a redeeming element for Alex--and for human nature in general.Russian is my native language, so the book flowed fairly easily for me after just a few pages. But beware that this new addition has no glossary. If you do not know Russian, it may take a little longer to get into this book. But it is very much worth the effort."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"jump into the mind of little alex and prepare to be caught by the whirlwind. you'll follow this 'humble narrator' as he tramples and stomps his way through a world he thinks he can control... you'll get inside his head and travel the ups and downs in the peak of nadsat fashion... burgess thrusts readers into a unique, futuristic world where young evildoers rule the streets (at first you may feel a bit lost in the language but by the second chapter you'll find your footing and by the end you'll read the talk as if youve known it all along). this book will stir up your mind, questioning ideas like human tendencies towards good/evil and the gov'ts constant manipulation and yearning for ultimate control --definitely a stimulating and satisfying read (quick one too-it took me all of 3 days) go for it!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Alex LaBarge, the central character, is a typical teen in this futuristic novel. He and his friends go to a milk bar to talk, and have a drink, and discuss what to do with the night. Such as whether to attack an old man or rob a store. And after stealing a car, what should be done with it? Just average kids doing what kids do. When Alex is betrayed by his so-called friends and caught by the police is where the novel becomes truly frightening. The deeds Alex committed are nothing compared to what is done to him in the attempt to cure his wicked mind. He is left with no defenses against the world, the image of a perfect citizen without any chance of surviving the reality he is released into. After many of the people he has abused exact their revenge, Alex is returned to his natural, sociopath self. This is where the Kubrickian (or American) version ends. However, Burgess intended the last chapter to show a mature Alex who finds himself thinking of family and a new course in life. This novel is an amazing glimpse into one human's experience. Though not the author's favorite, it is mine. The statement about society and violence and psychological treatments is impossible to miss. This is a classic. Though the language is at first hard to grasp, it is worth the effort."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Once you get over the language barrier (and you do after a while), this book is a pretty quick read. However, do not let that overshadow the significance of the book. I read it for the first time in high school and it is still one of my favorites. The last chapter is not &quot;new&quot;- it was deleted at first from the American printing (on which Kubrik based his film). The last chapter, in my eyes, ultimately forces the question around which Burgess wrote the book. On my AP English exam some years ago, I wrote that the final chapter was a happy ending, and I got a perfect score on the exam. If all you can see is the violence or the language, this book is way above your level."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"It's been years since I read this book, but I remember not being able to put it down and a profound fascination with the strange terminology used in the text. I had mentioned some of the words to a foreign-exchange student from Georgia, Russia and he said that they were Russian words. For instance moloko is milk in Russian. By the end of the book you don't think twice about the silly words, because you already know what they mean."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I guess, I am very lucky. My native language is Russian, and itwas real fun to be able to understand the meaning of the russian wordswithout referring to the last page. I was impressed with the author's ability to use foreign words and make them the part of the futuristic slang. Some of the puns are great. For instance, &quot;horroshow&quot; which means &quot;good&quot; in russian or &quot;Korova Milk Bar&quot;. The main character, Alex, is unforgettable. Coldblooded cynical murderer who appreciates great classical music and who is definetely much more intelligent and educated that his &quot;drugies&quot; will stay in your memory long after you finished the book. I would recommend the movie. Made by Stanley Kubrick with Malcolm MacDowell as Alex it is very successful screen adaptation which was nominated for several Oscars in 1971."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Regardless of what anyone says, this is a book that will stick with you. If you have the patience to get through the first few pages and to begin to apply meanings to the slang words you will not be disappointed. Years after I have read this book I still find times when the slang pops into my mind. To top it all off, this book tells one great story. Highly recommended, way better than the much praised film, even though the film follows the book near 100%."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"From page 1 through both endings this was the most enjoyable book I have ever encountered. I loved being torn between despising and feeling sorry for Alex. Burgess makes him a consistant character with never even a taste of right or wrong until his &quot;omitted&quot; chapter. I drove my family and friends crazy as I transferred the books lingo into everyday conversation. Another reason I throughly enjoyed it. If you love the classics, make room at the top of your list for this one."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"The most famous and one of the most brilliant novels writen by English author, Anthony Burgess. A masterpiece of psychological evaluation, linguistics and satire.The work chronicles the &quot;near future&quot; as seen by Burgess, where he creates a new form of slang and language for his characters and masterminds a dark reality in the vain of &quot;1984,&quot; &quot;Brave New World&quot; and similar stories. Yet there is not just the forewarnings of doom seen in the writings of other dark future writers, but also a slightly hidden but wonderful sense of wit and humor.In the American re-edition called the intro &quot;A Clockwork Orange Resucked&quot; and complained bitterly about what Kubrick did with the movie. More likely than not he was proud but just angry with Kubrick's leaving out the final chapter of the book, as he mentions.Burgess looks at the darkest impulses of humanity, and the out of control attempts that society goes to in order to rectify and &quot;cure&quot; the social deviants. This is not just a dark future, but also a warning to us about the course that our reform programs seem to be heading towards.Gritty, dark, somber and somehow always cleaver, this mini novel is a must read for everyone. Burgess flourishes with his mastery of how language works and employs his gifts as a linguist to bring out a colorful sub-culture lingo that has evolved (within the context of the book) from the reasonable and normal perversions of every day speech to the language.Burgess said that there were other books that he would rather have been remembered for. &quot;A CLockwork Orange&quot; brings modern readers to the late Burgess' prose and leaves us interested to go on and see some of the wealth that inhabits the rest of his writing."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I saw the movie first and was blown away by how disturbing and real it was. While it is true that I and many others have been de-sensitized to violence, the book delves into a different kind of violence. I guess what scared me after reading A Clockwork Orange was that we do not really know why Alex was &quot;evil&quot;. Alex would do his thing every night, come home to sleep, then in the morning, gets up and eat breakfast and usually goes to school. What is up with this guy?Usually when you see movies or read books that involve killings and other types of violence, you can always trace the reason to a person or an event that happened previously. Even in the Columbine shootings and others like it, the kids had reasons and they acted out this anger.But in A Clockwork Orange, Alex chose this evil. This freaks me out. It's not I find the other type acceptable, but when shoud people ever have a choice between a good and evil lifestyle?Anyway, the book was good. It took me like 15 minutes to read the first three pages because of the Nadsat language. Make a printout of the words and keep it on hand when reading. The first-person narrative was great and I do think the movie makes the book better because you don't quite get all the emotions of Alex out of the book. For example, you can hear him laugh and giggle during a rape scene in the movie - something you can never get from a book even if you have a great imagination. Then reading about his trip to the chair to watch the films - wow - it was described so well - you actually had to feel for the guy.I did get a little turned off by the politics - maybe that is because I always get turned off by politics. But this book was great!!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"one of the better books available that goes into the psyche of the modern teenager. the events outlined are not as far fetched as they may sound. clockwork orange reflects the reality that we are headed towards. the events can take place today and in fact may be happening right now! the novel is a good example of how too much freedom can create so much trouble. it is scary because it brings out an inner fear in most people that this may not be totally fictional. one is forced to ask, is this the result of the overdose of violence that goes hand in hand with entertainment? is it a result of the myopic attitude of the authorities? are the guardians and counsellors doing their job properly. the return of alex to his house and the reception thereafter is quite realistic. it's time for further introspection. have we at any point of time turned away anyone in desparate need of help? the language of the teens is hard to follow at the start but it is very easy to pick up. in fact after a point it becomes addictive. it would be difficult for me to see a fight without thinking of &quot;tolchok&quot;. there is one drawback. the author practically raises a toast to alex, at the end of his book. would this not influence wrongly the impressionable ones, especially ones like me!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Burgess himself thought that this book is overrated, but I don't agree. This is brilliant on every level. The purpose of the invented slang is to make the book timeless - it doesn't date like it would if he'd used real early 1960s slang. At first I was put off from reading the book by the notoriety surrounding the film. I thought this might be one long round of rape and murder. But it isn't - the violence isn't at all explicit and anyway the effect is dulled by the use of the slang. Clockwork Orange is a deep exploration of good and evil, with the conclusion that it is better to choose to be bad than to be forced to be good. In other words, man's free will must be protected at all costs, and we mustn't curb our nature so that we become little more than a machine - we mustn't become like &quot;a clockwork orange&quot;.

This book started me off with a challenge. That is, as many reviews (good and bad) have stated, the slang. The slang threw me off a bit at first, as I am sure it would any reader. However, if you keep reading and look for context clues as to what the words mean, it becomes easier and easier to understand. And, to be honest, it also becomes fun, being able to read and speak the slang that is so prominent in the book is like being one of Alex's droogs.This book will throw you for a loop when it comes to the violence (sexual and non-sexual). However, I would ask anyone, even those who are sensitive to violence, like I am, to please see past that and read on, as the extreme violence has it's place, there is a reason for it. I would not, however, read this book if violence or sexual violence is, in any way, triggering for you.This book comes, so I've heard, in two forms. There is one in which the last chapter has been removed. The addition of that original last chapter totally alters the tone of the entire book and I suggest getting the book with that chapter (the 7th chapter of the 3rd part).This book will make you think long and hard about morals and ethics. I came away liking Alex more than hating him, even though I hated him in the beginning of the book. Any book that can do that, I think, is a good book.Give it a try, but please, I beg you, don't stop reading it a third of the way through or half way through... Doing that will leave you completely unfulfilled and with only a pin-hole's peek at the big picture.If you read it through, and don't like it, fair game. But give it a fighting chance."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A number of groups have put together their list of the '100 Greatest books', and I have been slowing reading through some of their choices. 'A Clockwork Orange' appears on a number of the lists. There have been times when I read a classic novel, and it just doesn't connect with me. It is a great pleasure when a classic book turns out to be...just that a classic.'A Clockwork Orange' is the story of Alex, a young hooligan who spends most of his evenings/nights reaking havok. Alex and his 'droogs' beat people, fight rival gangs, steal, rape, and murder. We see some tension and a budding power struggle in Alex's gang. This leads to Alex's eventual capture and imprisonment. The state has a new treatment to reform the ultra-violent inmates. Will this change lead Alex down the right path?This novel is a great look at loosing ones freedom. Whether from the gangs who inflict violence on the innocent, or from the prisoner who looses the ability to choose. We watch Alex move from a gang leader, to a prisoner, to a test subject, to a government pawn, to a political pawn, and back to violence. While this book is nearing 50 years old, it still sends a strong message. It a very enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Title: A Clockwork Orange by Anthony BurgessPages: 212.Time spent on the \\"to read\\" shelf: 0 days.Days spent reading it: 3 days.Why I read it: I enjoy dystopian society novels, like 1984 and A Brave New World. I heard that A Clockwork Orange was in the same vein, so I checked it out.Brief review:A Clockwork Orange was a great gem for me to discover. While it can be compared to the types of worlds described in 1984 and A Brave New World, this novel stands on its own for me. I loved the main character of Alex and we are in his mind during the whole novel.Essentially this book asks one question: What if we could solve all crime committed by humans, but the cost was our free choice? Would the price be too high ? In this novel, Alex is a juvenile punk, and when he gets caught in the act of breaking into a home, he is sent away to prison. While there he is offered a treatment that will get him out of jail in 2 weeks. He takes it, but in the process loses his ability to act out in violence. He gets physically sick when he thinks about hurting someone. He also loses his love for music (one of his few redeeming qualities before his incarceration). He then revisits his previous life, but there are some surprises in store for him as he encounters people who he attacked or knew from his earlier life.I love how this book explores the big ideas of good and evil as they are presented in humanity. I love how it explores freedom and bondage. I love how the themes could be taught in a theology class and not miss a beat, and a theology class would be all the richer for it. Is this book for everyone? No way. The language is difficult (Burgess made up a kind of teenage slang for the book) and the events include senseless violence and sexuality. But for those willing to get past the first few pages of slang (which oddly enough actually mutes the violence and sexuality present in the pages), the book opens up into a wonderful treat that is both entertaining and philosophical.Favorite quote: \\"What does God want?

Your Humble Narrator - or, Alex - and his three droogs spend their evenings and nights beating, raping, torturing and stealing from any person unlucky enough to be in Alex's path. One evening, however, the gang turns on Alex and he is set-up, with the police arriving just as he murdered an old woman in her house.Off to jail he goes, having to serve over a decade in a prison over-stuffed, with six or more people sharing a cell designed for two or three prisoners at most. Alex, however, is given the choice to take part in a new program that will get him out of the prison in two weeks, and back to the outside world to live his life as he sees fit. This new program, however, is not something Alex expected; Alex was tied to a chair, with his eyes taped open and forced to watch horrible acts of violence and murder - acts all-too familiar and enjoyable to Alex - as an injected chemical makes him feel nauseous and sick. After two weeks of this treatment, Alex would feel sick at the mere thought of violent acts.The treatment worked, and Alex's life became a living nightmare, as his former friends were now police officers and old victims were able to exact their vengeance upon Alex. A failed attempt at suicide left Alex in the hospital - cured of Ludovic's experiment - and a return to the life of violence and crime he once knew.So ends the previously published American version, short one chapter that had been published in the UK. Burgess claims the American publisher made the decision to leave out the final chapter while the publisher claims it was \\"merely a suggestion made for conceptual reasons.\\" Regardless, the American version misses a chapter that is vital to the message: the power of choice.One of the characters - the prison chaplain - asks the questions, \\"Does God want goodness or the choice of goodness? Is a man who chooses the bad perhaps in some way better than a man who has the good imposed upon him?\\" Through the experimental punishment to rid Alex of his evil ways, he no longer had a choice in his actions. This brings a moral dilemma, discussed by a panel after Alex has completed his punishment. \\"He ceases to be a wrongdoer. He ceases also to be a creature capable of moral choice,\\" argued one person, but the general consensus was that, \\"We are not concerned with motive, with the higher ethics. We are concerned only with cutting down crime...and with relieving the ghastly congestion in our prisons.\\" This moral dilemma, the ability to choose right or wrong, good or evil, is the message of Burgess' work. The final chapter completes the story and how Alex chooses and acknowledges this moral choice.A Clockwork Orange is written in a peculiar way - the entire book uses the nadsat language created by Burgess. Not so much a language, rather heavy slang influenced by Slavic languages, the use of nadsat creates a unique world the reader becomes entranced in. It also helps to alleviate the gruesome nature of Alex and his friends, putting more focus on the message rather than the brutal acts of violence. While some may be put off by the confusing language at first, Burgess does an excellent job introducing it and using each new word in context easy to understand and grasp, and before long the reader will be reading at his/her normal pace."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Beyond the detailed violence (very well written on Burgess' part) I REALLY enjoyed this book especially the slang (Nasdat). A Clockwork Orange is a dark and humorous tale which when given a chance expresses deep insight on government, free will, moral choice, and much more. I can't really think of much more to say except that if you are considering seeing the movie, read the book first...in my opinion the book is much better. Also, don't let anyone's tales of the violence depicted be a reason for not reading the book, because beyond that, is so much more.A real horrorshow book. : )"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Many who are familiar with the movie are probably not as familiar with the fact that the movie version was not exactly accurate - specifically in the ending. I think I can understand the reasons behind the last chapter being initially left out (in the American version) after reading it.This book was a challenge to read due to the nosdat language used throughout. The idea of using the nosdat language did indeed keep this classic from becoming dated- the language is old yet futuristic in a bizarre contradictory way.Once you get familiar enough with the language its quite a hearty take on the concept of having a choice to do right or wrong and whether it is acceptable to change those who don't choose a \\"moral\\" path. It also addresses the concept of morality too- are those that enforce change more moral or less moral than those who are committing crimes? Or is this just one really big mess of a gray area? As the reader you must debate and decide these concepts for yourself. As for me it was a read horrorshow read and when I have more time I will focus my glassies for a re-read."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I own a few copies of this text, but for class was required to purchase this edition. I &lt;3 Norton anyway (if only they would get on the Kindle), and this is no exception. The footnotes are authoritative and cover all bases, from giving a definition for an infrequently used English word, to the history of British football, to marginal notes Burgess made on the typescript, to notes made in previous Norton editions (a feature I wish other editors would chose to use more often). There are essays and interviews with Burgess in the back along with all the expected criticisms and a few unexpected ones. I think the inclusion of essays on the film are a nice addition to round out the experience of _A Clockwork Orange_.Well done.(and it never hurts that it showed up within three days of ordering)"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I'm a new fan!A Clockwork Orange had been sitting on my to-read shelf for quite some time before I decided to pick it up. I kept avoiding it, and I'll tell ya why - it was because when I bought the book I had read a couple pages and immediately I hated it because I couldn't understand what the F Burgess was trying to say! But I couldn't give up on a classic so easily, so I bought it anyways, and on the to-read shelf it went -- and stayed.I should have read this a lot sooner! Yes, the nadsat slang drove me nuts at first. I thought Burgess was trying to drive me into a world of madness! Perhaps to bring me to a similar level as our narrator, Alex. But, by the end of the book I was driving my wife nuts, I'm sure she still would love to tolchock me on the gulliver.You've probably read a plot synopsis already(or maybe have seen the movie), so I'll leave that alone here and just lay out some opinions -I still haven't seen the movie, but I do know one thing for sure - I too would have chosen the same version as Kubrick. The 21st chapter isn't terrible, but in my opinion the difference between the 20th and 21st chapter is so radical that I felt the book lost some of it's impact. I understand what Burgess was going for in the 21st chapter, but when I read the book, I read the 20th chapter as a finality, just so I could think on it for bit, then I read the 21st chapter a day later and I'm in the camp that believes ending it on 20 gives one a bit more to ponder on. Plus, it's chilling as hell, and I liked that.The only other minor issue is that much of this story does feel a little contrived, especially towards the end. I understand why, it's because this book is quite short and for maximum impact certain events really need to take place, but some events just felt a little too 'convenient'. But, this is minor, really.Overall, even given the few issues the full version of this book has, it is still one of the greatest books I've ever read. There are very few books that are on my 'to re-read' shelf, but this is certainly one of them. A Clockwork Orange is short, fierce, and incredibly deep. I never felt like I would be able to connect with a character like Alex, but I did. However, on future re-readings - I'm gonna stop at 20, I was chilled to the bone when I read the last sentence!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess is one of those books which stayed with me after the reading and one which while reading I wasn't sure if I quite liked. And while it has much to say, I'm not altogether sure how much I agree with.Even the main character, the charismatic Alex is a quite unsavory youth, who excels at violence for its own sake and yet shows his finer side by his love for classical music. Does this small glimmer of gentility, redeem him?In the last chapter of the book Alex states:\\"I knew what was happening, oh my brothers, I was like growing up.Yes, yes, yes, there it was. Youth must go, ah yes. But youth is only being in a way like it might be an animal. No, it is not just like being an animal so much as being like one of these malenky toys you viddy being sold in the streets, like little chllovecks made out of tin and with a spring inside and then a winding handle on the outside and you wind it up and grr grr grrr and of it itties, like walking, O my britgers, But it itties in a straight line and bangs straight into things bang bang and it cannot help what it is doing. Being young is like being like one of these malenky machines.\\"Hmmm...such a strange excuse, especially when considering much of the book is about free will, choice and mind control or maybe it is not strange at all."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"With so many reviews already written, I feel that one more may be useless. However, I am inspired to contribute to the Information Age with this emphatic recommendation for \\"Clockwork.\\"Burgess makes use of his musical background, blending his pharonic powers of discerning with artful imagination, to create a true juggernaut of philosophical work. Like most philosophical novels, there can never be sufficient analysis, nor will we ever fully flesh out the \\"true\\" intent. However, among the topics upon which we must ruminate upon include: the state of the individual in a scientific tyranny, the decline of vigorous human spirit in modernity, and the immortal \\"man's struggle with instincts within a society.\\"Like many of the original philosophical novels (Candide, Rasselas: Prince of Abyssinia) the protagonist is young, naive, and ambitious. However, the similarities stop here. Burgess has written for a modern audience. Our Humble Narrator is irresistible not because of his altruistic pursuit of \\"truth\\", but because he is unapologetic, yet at the same time, a seemingly pleasant fellow who dares to explore (and play in) the abyss of man's darkest instincts. We understand that Alex's (defender of man) youthful excesses are intolerable, yet like music, they come from deep in the human DNA, where positive forces, such as inspiration and creativity, emerge. Just how can we assure everyone's safety and also support this type of liberated being in the same epoch? Perhaps we are asking the wrong question."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"When I first read the introduction from Burgess, I knew that this book was one that I have never come across before. To have the author of the book blast not only the director of the film adaptation, but also the publisher in New York in the first pages, I was already intrigued. Understanding the vision of an author and to have that altered can really be a shame.Like most of the reviewers, I read the first page of the actual novel and I was very frustrated with the slang of \\"your most humble narrator\\". However, I found that after using the context clues as well as looking at some of the other reviews to get some insight on the book, it was quite easy to read. I found that having to reread the phrases helped me focus on reading the novel. Though it was a very grimm subject matter, I couldn't stop reading.The question of justification on the government's part is still an active argument in today's society. Should one's morality be controlled by someone else if it means turning them 'good'? Everyone is going to have a different opinion on this and Burgess is great at the visuals of explaining the consequences of brainwashing even the worst criminals. I enjoyed reading the book and though the subject is gruesome, the avid reader should get a chance to viddy themselves to open their glazzies and rots to something new."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I love dystopia, but somehow never got around to this book. I finally picked it up and gave it a read. Right out the door the nadsat language threw me. I found it a true struggle to get through the first two chapters. but after that it became easier and flowed as a book should. a must read!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Ok, I'm way behind the times with this one. But, lately I've been into dystopian fiction and this one seemed like a classic that I needed to be able to say I've read. I have never seen the movie either and I figured I'd better read the book first. When I first pick it up... I honestly could not get past the first page or 2. The nadsat language really through me for a loop. So, I put it aside for a few weeks, then came back to it and tired again. I decided to just go for it and see if it started to make sense.... and after about a chapter I had the flow down. In the end, the language of the book really hooked me. It made it that much more fun and interesting. So, if you too have a hard time at first, stick with it. I promise it's worth it.I really liked this book. It was much more thought provoking and intersting that I thought it would be. The character Alex starts off real arrogant and annoying in the beginning... really asking for it. But as the story goes on I really felt sorry for him. He really makes his own bed the whole way through, but you still can't help but feel for him. What I find really interesting is that the final chapter was originally left out of the American version fo this story. Personally... I don't think I would have liked the book as much without that final chapter. For me, it really made the whole story. But I don't want to give anythign away so that all I have to say. :)"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book and movie was actually a satire because it examined the reasons why criminals act. The idea was an experiment that took a criminal and gave him a pill that prevented him from committing crime. In real life this most likely was tried with hypnosis and brainwashing as well as sedatives that were used to suppress a pedophile's urge to rape young boys. The results were not always the same anyhow the book did a good job shedding some light on the subject and asking some good questions."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I have never read such an original book, the language is completely genius. I wanted to read it before I watched the film and I'm glad I did. I personally like the book more, especially since the last chapter isn't included in the film."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Two versions of this book are in circulation. One version, the one originally created by Burgess, has changed many lives for the better and fulfilled many people's views of society and culture. The other version, the one published in America, is an incomplete and bastardized version of Burgess's original. The ending is changed 100% because the American publishers left the last chapter out of the book.Burgess wrote the book in a format of 3 parts with 7 chapters apiece to add up to 21 chapters. The story is about a boy named Alex who grows up defying society and its laws. Without the final chapter of the book the true ending, and the true future of Alex's fate, is not revealed. Many people who have read this version are left feeling ill and doubtful about the direction of youth.Burgess also created his own language (Nadsat) in the writing of this book. It is slang that the characters use (many of the words are based from Russian) and is easilly tripped over in the beginning. It took me two hours to read the first twelve pages of the book (using the glossary in the back), but after that I could read it easily.I hope this review helps you in making your selection. Good luck, and happy reading."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Just so you know, the Kindle version of the Norton edition is just the novel and Burgess' intro. It doesn't contain the supplementary materials that make a Norton edition valuable to have."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"To be frank, this book changed my life. I have never seen the film, but from what I had heard about it I was a bit apprehensive about picking this piece of literature up. But for whatever reason, I did, and I am sure glad of it.This is the bleakly futuristic tale of Alex, a young droog who loves doing the ultraviolent, razdrazzing others, peeting milk-plus in seedy mestos and slooshying Beethoven. He and his three other droogies wander the streets when the sun goes down, looking for a chance for some twenty-to-one, and rarely are they without a decent find. One fateful noche, however, he is taken by the millicents to the staja where he gets by on his oddy knocky day in and day out.What?!Written in a beautifully brutal dialect (something of a combination of slang english and russian), Burgess leaves the reader to figure out that Alex, a young hoodlum, loves to rape, kill, drink halucinogen-laced milk, and listen to classical music. However, when he is caught one night, he is taken to prison where he dwells for 2 years. However, he learns of a new treatment that will get him out of jail in a fortnight. This treatment is the creation a connection in his brain between sickness and violence by making him watch violent films (i.e. holocaust documentaries, interestingly enough) after given a shot that makes him yearn to vomit. The state, in all of its arrogance, releases young Alex into a world where his actions come back to haunt him.Thus, the book asks: is it better to be bad on your own free will, or to be good without free will (a clockwork orange)?Perhaps one of the most redeeming characteristics of this novel is the likeability of \\"your humble narrator.\\" Remarkably, Alex is quite a sympathetic character, if you can put aside all of the atrocities he commits nightly. You wholeheartedly root for him until the end, although you are not sure why. I am: it's the magic of Burgess' writing.If you can stomach a little literary violence and a great philophical quandary, packed in with a message of maturity and hope, this book is for you. And if you can't, go watch Bambi."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Well oh my little brothers, patient and tolerant though I may be, I just couldn't help but have a malenky smeck at some of the grazhny customer reviews by the like indignant vecks and ptitsas here. Like the starry ptitsa who creeches about the like excessive ultraviolence, saying this is not her idea of \\"entertainment\\". Personally droogies, I find Burgess's ingenious creation of a whole new vernacular language and youth subculture to be hilariously horrorshow entertaining. The more specific point the naysayers miss is that Burgess is using the violence merely as a vehicle to pose some deep moral questions about the nature of morality and the seeming impossibility of expunging violence from the human soul. A lot of reviewers are also falling into the trap of thinking that Burgess intended merely to shock or to sensationalise, which couldn't be further from the truth. His tongue is very firmly in cheek. Persevere through the first chapter or so and the nadsat becomes strangely \\"right\\", somehow enhancing the realness of the world Burgess creates. 4 stars rather than five only because of a redemption story in the final chapter which doesn't quite fit. Nevertheless, this remains a courageous and darkly comedic philosophical masterpiece which will reward those willing to push through the intimidating language."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Anyone who thinks Stanley Kubrick's film version of this is any good should definitely read the book, because it is much better. Many people talk about how hard the slang is to understand but I first read this when I was about 16 and I had no trouble at all. Being from a small town in the U.S. with no real exposure to Slavic languages it only took me reading the first chapter to get used to the slang. So don't let the language discourage you from enjoying this masterpiece of literature. It is a bit graphic and quite violent but (unlike the movie) there is a purpose to it all."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Don't take this fine novel too seriously. Yes, there's a statement here about free will and the price society must pay for its preservation, but I believe the funny parts were not meant to escape as many readers as they do. There were times when I was reading this story of a violent teenager (much younger than he was in the film version) where I laughed till my sides ached. I know devotees will see that as sacrilege, but it's also just plain true and if you miss the laughs in here, you're missing the best part.A Clockwork Orange is about Alex DeLarge, his teenaged gang of \\"droogs\\" and their sordid misadventures in England a generation or two hence. Alex and his cohorts dress like characters straight out of a comic book, talk to one another in Slavic-flavored \\"nadsat speak\\" an invented, brutal dialect, and imbibe psychotropic-laced milk before proceeding on nightly raids into their dilapidated city. In among the descriptions of turf wars, assaults, robberies, vandalism, rape, and eventually cold-blooded murder, Alex tells us of his keen love of classical music, which he appreciates to...er, \\"auto-erotic\\" heights. Alex is intelligent, driven, shows strong leadership skills, and one gets the sense that in another age or slightly different background he might have made something of promising young Tory spouting \\"Britannia Forever!\\" while wrapping himself in the Union Jack. But not in his rusting era of post-Imperial decomposition.Eventually Alex's crime spree goes too far and he is sent to prison for slaying a woman in her home. In the overcrowded prison, Alex survives and in a manner even thrives, and in the course of serving his time, he is befriended by an earnestly good man, the hard-drinking, true believing chaplain, whom Alex uses to his advantage. It is during this period that Alex learns of a psychological treatment being proposed as a means of solving Britain's horrific crime problems. It involves a sort of brainwashing whereby the recipient can no longer of his own free will choose to undertake an act of violence upon any other living creature. Alex volunteers to be the first to undergo this course of experimentation, and is rendered harmless but somewhat pathetically neutered in his capacity or act on his own volition. It is the consequences of this treatment and the effects it has on Alex's life that provides the final portion of this brilliantly inventive piece of fiction.This is a novel divided into three sections of seven chapters each, highlighting author Burgess' fondness for numerology. Until recently, most readers in the United States read a version that conformed more to the legendary Stanley Kubrick film that ended with Alex \\"cured\\" and once more set free on society. The novel as originally written and now restored goes one step further and projects several years into Alex's future, wherein he outgrows violence and consciously elects to become a law-abiding citizen, an exercise in free will accomplishing what the harsh chemical treatments during his incarceration could not.A Clockwork Orange is a worthy book that rewards with humor and thoughtful prose."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"It took me years to get around to reading this, because 1) I'd already seen the movie several times; 2) I was afraid Burgess' invented \\"language\\" would make the book a tough read. Far from it. There are really only about a dozen invented words, which are supposed to be the teen-speak of the time; and you don't even have to memorize them because their meaning is always clear from the context.So is the book better than the movie? Well, they're very different underneath, even though their plots are superficially identical, and they're both brilliant in their own ways. Kubrick's movie is typically obscure and mysterious, and he leaves you to draw your own conclusions about its point. Burgess' book, on the other hand, is much clearer about its political stance. One good thing about the book is that its characters are in their early-to-mid teens, as opposed to the movie, where everyone looks around thirty, O my brothers.The book is absolutely compelling. The violence is brutal, but not all that disturbing, because the novel takes place in a \\"dystopian future.\\" In actual fact, it's no more dystopian than the industrialized societies of today, or of the '60s or '70s; the book is an allegory of 20th century society. The novel is actually pretty short; it's a quick and easy, fast-paced read.You're probably familiar with the plot; vicious little Alex, he of the ultra-violence and the in-out, in-out and the Ludwig van, gathers his droogs every night, and together they terrorize the decent folk after drinking their narcotic-laced milk. Eventually Alex is captured, and what little free will he has is removed through some kind of controversial aversion therapy. It's a relatively short but very strong story.My only problem with A Clockwork Orange (the book) is that Burgess oversimplifies the causes of social problems. Burgess strongly implies at various points in the book that \\"free will\\" is an illusion; that little Alex, Your Humble Narrator, is nothing more than the product of society. His randomly violent behavior is not his \\"free choice;\\" he behaves this way because his peers do, and because it's the only logical way that society gives him to act. Again, I don't necessarily agree with this, but this is what Burgess implies throughout the book. In case you had any doubts, he makes it clear near the end, when the kind old guy who takes him in (the same one little Alex terrorized before his \\"rehabilitation\\") is also named Alexander. Burgess is saying that little Alex and nice old Alexander are the same type of person inside, just brought up in different situations. And at the end, Burgess throws in a chapter which Kubrick left out, which has little Alex realize that he's too old for the \\"ultra-violence\\" and the old \\"in-out, in-out\\" and decides it's time to become a respectable adult. Again, Alex does this not because he's \\"changed\\" or become \\"better,\\" but because it's what all his friends have done at that age, and what society expects. But this isn't really a flaw in the book; Burgess set out to make a societal statement and he makes it.Burgess is a born writer; the dialogue and plot are far ahead of their time. The book was written in the '60s and feels not the slightest bit dated today. I may not entirely agree with its politics, but A Clockwork Orange may be the most vibrant and memorable book I've ever read."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Brilliance. Burgess' text will grasp you from the very beginning, from when Alex starts his mystery tour to when he drops you off at the end.You feel attached to the text instantly as Alex and his gang start on their evenings work. Great start to the book, which you can, and will, read over and over again.The slight drop in standard for me was during the third section. Although it is almost compulsory to be there, it seems to drag out slightly. It is nauseous - yet interesting - to know that he gets treated in a rough way, as he may have treated somebody else.Towards the end, somehow the disgust I feel for Alex during the opening chapters, turns to pity through sorrow.A Clockwork Orange has the best ending I have read, to top off the finest book I have ever read.A stunning and original use of languages and an enthralling structure, which describes and educates an extremely a morbid subject."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I read this book to benefit my A-level cousework on dystopian fiction - and finishied A Clockwork Orange safe in the knowledge that it is probably one of the most psychologically enriching reads I have ever experienced. Burgess' creative manipulation of language slang and structure is astoundingly catchy - he delicately entrapps the reader (through the use of language and 1st person narrative) into the deceptively vicious world of Alex. He is the &quot;anti-hero&quot; who has been reformed by the state - using new &quot;scientific methods&quot; - to end his diabolical orgy of rape, torture and murder. Towards the end of the book, however, you find yourself despising the government for having used Alex as an organic guinnea pig, even though &quot;Ludovico's Syndrome&quot; (which involves making the criminal look at horrific images of extreme sadistic torture until they become almost &quot;accustomed&quot; to the eventual sickness they feel) is actually reforming Alex to be a socially acceptable citizen. Of course, it is evident almost from the start of the book you are in the hands of a master craftsman of literature - a craftsman who carefully, almost delicately, constructs an enormously important argument which will blow you away with it's absolute social relevance and gravity."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Very rarely do I enjoy reading the book rather than watching the movie, but with A Clockwork Orange, it was quite the opposite. Having seen the movie first (and loving it), I knew what to expect from the book, but I had no idea that it would leave me feeling like the movie was not nearly as good as I thought before. The book is beautifully written, with the young Droogs own language that is confusing at first, but soon becomes easy to follow. Burgess portrays the world of the young criminal in such a way that rather than being disgusted, I was very interested in continuing with the story. By the end, I even felt bad for him. Any book that can make me feel bad for a boy who enjoys rape, murder, and crime in general must be very well written. What I enjoyed most about the book was the fact that it left so much to the imagination. While the movie showed scenes and settings such as the woman with the cats' house and her attack, the book merely described them, which allows the reader to come up with his/her own mental picture. I found myself picturing things very differently from the movie, which I love. Overall, this was an excellent book and I am overly impressed by Anthony Burgess's writing."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Well, This book was the best book I've ever read. If you've seen the movie, you can understand that the language in the book was art, spoken like Shakespear. I found the book in a pile in the basement, from my dad's days in highschool. I had heard about it so I decided to read it, and I'm glad I did. Fourtunately for me, It included a glossary, but did not include the finall chapter. I read the book, and couldn't put it down. When I finished it, Iread it again. Now, I personally didn't like the last chapter, when I found it online. I had already read the book once, seen the movie, and was halfway through it again. The last chapter looses the flow of the violence. I liked being able to imagin what Alex was thinking when he was cured. The book expresses a hatred of violence on the part of the author, yet he writes from a violent youth's point of view.

I'm afraid that to get the true essence of the book I've had to keep my Russian dictionary with me at all times, and as a result, the reading has been rather slow."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"When I first began reading &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, I found it difficult and frustrating to read. The language Mr. Burgess has created is annoying at first. But after a while you don't even think about what words like &quot;rasoodocks, rot, govereeting...etc.&quot; mean. It becomes second nature. When I finally understood these words, I found the book impossible to put down. I loved the style that Burgess wrote this masterpiece. He does not write it like a man in his fifties; he writes like the fifteen, and seventeen year old character that is Alex. The story is distorted in the way that any story would be told throught the eyes of an immature teenage &quot;droog.&quot; Finally, the much debated final chapter. I would not dream of giving it away, but I will say that the story may suffer depending on how you percieve the Alex of this chapter. Personally, I could go either way, But it does seem more satisfying without that final chapter. I HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMEND this FANTASTIC, FANTASTIC Novel."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Anthony Burgess is a magical author when it comes to beautifing random violence. Through his intricate use of diction and syntax we are able to fully access each scene in all of its blood spilling beauty. He creates a world governed through an artillary of wild ideas and a government which is diseased through pure democracy, in the younger generation's eyes. Burgess makes you compare the ideas about today's villans with that of the future and certainly those of the past. Who would have guessed that a character like Alex could actually exist, and that there would be no regard for authority or goverance in this futuristic world. Even through the entire book Burgess makes you want to &quot;ROOT&quot; for Alex, despite his continous disregard for his parents, the law and the well-being of society! His use of creative and unique language not only kept my interest but inspired to write a piece using his language. Challenging and graceful all in one. There is no other book with such a spectrum of intelligence, irony and interest!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book is a must-read for pre-teens looking for a direction in life.

This book is way out there, and I mean WAY OUT THERE. If you like such off the wall books as Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, than this book is for you. Have fun, the book is real horrorshow, as Alex puts it! ;)"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Fifteen-year-old Alex lives in a world where crime takes over at night. The government/police dont do much about it, and while Alex roams the streets, just looking for &quot;fun&quot; (yes, apparently it IS fun to bash peoples' heads in) he eventually kills an elderly lady and is arrested.In jail, he puts forth a false attitude that he wants to change, and so he is the first &quot;victim&quot; of a new government program to reverse the mentality of criminals. For a fortnight he is forced to watch gruesome videos of people being killed, of the German concentration camps, of a world of evil that he once took part of.When he was released, he went back home to find himself replaced by his own parents. He then saught shelter with a man that he once tried to kill, but instead gained respect for him. When he stayed in his house, the man put forth the attitude that something awful had been done to him, but he was really the man who pushed for it.Eventually, all the effects were reversed, but nonetheless Burgess has created a remarkable novel here. Throughout the story, Burgess tinges the plot with his own made-up slang such as you would &quot;viddy&quot; a movie or watch a movie. Its quite interesting at times and also through out is the line &quot;So whats it going to be then, eh?&quot; which is quite interesting. Overall, wondeful book and I loved it, had that 1984 feel, but that wasnt nearly as good. The slang can be difficult to get used to, but you do, and want to talk like it afterwards, really gets you in the feel for things."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Although this book was hard to read initially, I was able to get into a flow reading &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot;, and enjoyed it thoroughly. There were times when Burgess uses his invented language to describe things, and it turns out to be extremely funny. Along with this book I would also suggest George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;Animal Farm&quot;."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"after seeing 'a clockwork orange' many times on film i thought i would try the novel.i have found it to be the best book i have ever read.Burgess completely captivates you with his use of innovative language and the way he tells the story through alex.even after alex's diabolical acts,the novel still calls for the reader to have symathy for him when he is being tortured by the state.very challenging in it's time but it has always been a fantastic novel."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"The lyrical narrative in this book was what captivated me most, my brothers. This includes the unrivalled originality in Burgess' nadsat language. The story really captured the often destructive self-absorption and invulnerable feeling of youth -- the ability to act without fearing the consequences, and even when suffering the consequences, caring very little if at all about one's own part.The introduction, in which Burgess harped on about the excluded 21st chapter of the American version prior to 1986 had me curious. I think that the book without the final chapter, the way it was captured in the movie, is in fact better. Burgess makes an important point about the final chapter, yet I found it didactic and perhaps with the least flow of any in the rest of the book.Still, this is an excellent book, and well worth a read for anyone."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange tells the horroring tale of young Alex as he partakes in acts of ultra-violence and his reform which sends him right back to his evil ways. The novel presents the question of: Is it better to be made to be good or is it better to have the choice of being good? Anthony Burgess attempts to portray the extreme of youth and the capability of it's evil, but he is also able to show more than simply the aspect of evil, he shows the human side also. Our narrator enjoys Beethoven and by this we see that he has intrests common to our own, not just that of crime. This book was so well written using a unique dialect which Alex himself creates. The reader soon becomes accustomed to this language and is able to sit back enjoy an extremely thought-provoking book which will send you off with a renewed hope for mankind."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I read this book a couple of years ago, and to say that it scared and thrilled me is almost an understatement. Burgess' use of language is fantastic, creating a slang that's as disturbing as it is confusing. The story itself is especially interesting for the times we live in. The only thing I disliked was the added final chapter. It seemed to be tacked on, even though it was originally in the text. That's why this only gets 4 of 5 stars. Aside from that, it's one of my favorite books of all time. ^_^"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Anthony Burgess' finest work is not only a disturbing look into the future, but also asks intruguing ethical questions. I found Burgess'use Nadsat Language intresting, athough it is difficult to understand. Espically disturbing is the dystopian world Burgess invents.

It was angry, it ws brutally honest, it was somehow endearingly disturbing. The author makes you think, reason, listen and question. I am so glad that I was able to get the edition with the last chapter not previously published in the US- but a word of advice: either get the book with a glossary or download the vocabulary from the internet because it makes the book that much more enjoyable. Although at first, the dialog is a bit puzzling- if you look up a few key words you are able to easily follow it and somehow get caught up in the author's speak. A malenky bit of beuty my friends!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange is a conceptually simple but potent allegory bringing up questions of free will and the nature of good and evil. Two things about the book may be stumbling-blocks to some readers: its extensive use of invented slang (based mostly on Russian), and the violent content necessary to portray Alex's depravity. The former actually tends to suppress the latter. Philosophically ACO seems to be a parable praising free will, but the book raises more questions than it answers. So do many great books. This edition fortunately includes the controversial last chapter, which I agree with the author is essential to the work. But whether this is really so, along with the social lessons to be gleaned by this effective story, is for the individual reader to decide. After all, as Burgess said, &quot;you are free&quot;."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"There isn't much more to say here about this book...it is brilliantly written, conceived, and executed, albeit occasionally heavy-handed with its message. The implication of the world being taken over by the Soviet regime is lost on many, but lends an excellent dimension to the book. I hesitated, however, to give it 5 stars...so many of Burgesses' other works are much better...but it deserves no less. Read it while listening to Vangelis's &quot;Blade Runner&quot; soundtrack--it adds a new dimension..."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"At least one person said that the book glorifies and trivializes violence. That is total nonesense. Obviously this person couldn't understand the deep and powerful messages this book carries within its pages.Sure, the book has very extreme and gut-wrenching violence. Not to mention rape, torture, and everything else. But it is all to show a specific point. Halfway through the book, the extreme violence lets up, anyway. It is a book about people's rights. It's a book about how far we can go to try to make other people's lives safer, before we cross the line.It's an amazing, thought-provoking book. And if you're one of those people who didn't like it because you thought it glorified violence and robbing, you shouldn't haved been reading the book in the first place, it's WAY OVER YOUR HEADS.5 stars."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This is a fantastic explortation into language, a real mind teaser, and, overall, an absolutely FANTASTIC book!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"being a big fan of dystopia novels, it was suggested that i read &quot;a clockwork orange.&quot; Since that fateful day, i have been in love with this book. does that mean i am a sick, twisted individual? i don't this so, because i recognize the quality of this novels story, characters, and message. the plot, among other things, is full of conflict and horrible twists of fate. each new chapter is a new problem; a new conflict; a new struggle for the narrator.in addition, the nadsat language that Burgess invents for his &quot;humble narrator&quot; is pure genius. altough initially difficult to understand, over time the language makes perfect sense. this understanding creates a bond between the reader and the character, making the reader feel like one of his droogs. this presents a unique perspective, because the reader begins to pull and root for alex even though he is a vile and horrible individual. the reader begins to feel the pain alex must endure along with him.no other book has allowed me feel so profoundly involved and mentally engaged in many years. the overall uniqueness and creativity of this book make it a must read for anyone not easily offended."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"If I were an English teacher at Columbine High School (or any American high school, for that matter), I would put this book at the top of my students' reading list, even if I had to go to war with the school board to do it. In addition to being an utterly captivating literary performance from beginning to end, this book examines the problem of violence in society in ways no writer has done before or since. Regrettably, I think, most readers miss Burgess' point. A Clockwork Orange is not so much about the evils of totalitarianism and the importance of free will as it is about the clash of the &quot;evil&quot; state vs. the evil individual. In the end, total government with all its prisons and behavior-modifying technologies is no match for man's potential for total depravity. So who's to blame for violence in society and what's the cure?

The book explores the meaning of free will and the conflict between good and evil, which is often not apparent. It also poses the following important question: can a person be forced into being good, and is being good truly good if it is not by choice?The main character in the novel, Alex (a 15 year old boy who is a rapist and killer), is injected by prison doctors with a drug that makes him experience nausea and headaches, and is then forced to watch violent flicks. He associates nausea with violence, and can stand violence no more! He is therefore restricted from his free will and forced to become good! According to the author, we all have a sense of what is right and what is wrong, so do we need to be forced into being good?Interestingly, readers in America and the rest of the world will read different versions of this book. In America, the editors edited out chapter 21 all together, giving the novel 20 chapters in all. In Britain and the rest of the world (including all translated versions), chapter 21 is included in the novel. Readers in the rest of the world will therefore get a different ending. The movie version of the book by Stanley Kubrick was based on the American version of 20 chapters. I will recommend readers of this book to read the British version to get the ending the author meant for us to read.Another interesting fact is that the author wished this book to go away - but obviously it is not, accumulating fans from all over the world since its publication in 1963. The book has been translated into many different languages, including Russian, Japanese, Spanish, and Italian, to list just a few. Many of the latter books written by the same author (32 novels in all) have not succeeded as much, even though the author believed them to be much superior. The book he believed would fail succeeded and the ones he believed would succeed failed miserably compared to A Clockwork Orange.Many will find this book difficult to read and understand (me for one). The dialogue is quite unique but difficult to understand because it is slang, with most of it invented by the author (was the slang taken from the Russian language?).The title, A Clockwork Orange is a cockney word meaning to the limit or hilt. For example, he is queer as clockwork orange (a saying often used). The author believes that we cannot be evil as clockwork orange; that is, pure evil with not an inch of goodness in us. Similarly, we cannot be pure good with no evil in us. We all live with a balance of evil and good, with some displaying more evil while others more goodness. And we all have free will to choose whether we want to be evil or good.A lot of people have liked the movie more than the book. Read the book first though (the British version), and then watch the movie. You'll get a much better flavor of the book this way. And if you gave up reading the book, watch the movie. It might just make you want to give the book a second chance!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A CLOCKWORK ORANGEIn Anthony Burgess's, A Clockwork Orange, his depiction of the future teenage culture is a disturbing one. It is a compelling story about the importance of free thinking. The main character, Alex a fifteen year old boy leads a group of three other \\"droogs,\\" Pete, Georgie, and poor old Dim. The four boys antagonize citizens for amusement, roaming the streets, engaging in gang violence, robbery, beating up men, and raping women. Justice seemed like a thing of the past until one night it caught up with Alex when he and his droogs stole a car and cruised the streets looking for trouble wherever they could find it. The others, were inspired to turn their backs to their leader. The next time they go out, they break into an old woman's house, and she calls the police as the boys are trying to flee the scene Dim hits Alex in the face was deserted and left for the police. The police then inform Alex that the women he beat and raped in an earlier robbery has passed. Alex is sentenced to fourteen years in prison for her death. After fighting with and killing his cellmate he is chosen for an experimental treatment called Ludovico's Technique. The doctors inject him with a drug that makes him experience nausea and headaches, while making him watch violent movies and listen to classical music. After two weeks of this brainwashing torment the mere thought of violence is enough to make Alex ill and is released from prison. A twisted hand of fate leads him to a cottage for help, and he recognizes the man whose wife he had raped. After talking with Alex he begins to recognize the slang nadsat, that the teenagers who broke into his house and raped his wife used, which arouses his suspicion. He changes, his mind and locks Alex in an apartment and blare classical music, hoping to drive him to his suicide. He throws himself out the window, but only to wake up at a hospital, shortly after the old violent Alex is restored. The only thing that defines individuality is our differences, whether they be good or bad ones, it's wrong to try to correct people's faults. Humans are far from perfect, and brainwashing them to fit the mold, stripping them of their individuality is sinful. The book is narrated in teen slang called nadsat, which incorporates elements of Cockney English and Russian. I would suggest that you search for a glossary online in order to develop a better understand of the text. I would highly recommend reading this book, because it offers insight into the mind of a violent thinker."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"In this book A Clockwork Orange, the character Alex displays the personality of an adolesent who longs for the attention of his peers. He seems to have a sense of violence instilled within his inner self and cannot seem to get rid of this feeling that he feels. Alex surrounds himself with sex, violence, and hatred which shows what he is really feeling on the inside. Alex started of the book with him and his \\"gang\\" wrecking havoc on the community by stealing a car and then preceeding to Mr. Alexander's house and raping his wife. While raping his wife Alex sings the song \\" Sing'n, in the rain\\". This seems like something someone who is trying to put on a show and act like their cool in front of their friends. The only time Alex was ever a descent person in this book, was when he was spending the first two years of his stay. After he began to feel comfortable with his surroundings the bad Alex seemed to suddenly reappear from the dark side to take over the place of the \\"rehabillitated\\" Alex. I think that the time he was good shows that he can be good when put under pressure by peers. Also when he is in a situation in which his surroundings are unfamilliar and unwilling to cater to every single of his needs. If Alex had never gained that much attention from his familly and \\"gang\\" i dont believe that Alex was really bad to be bad; but he was just bad to gain the respect and attention from his gang and familly."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This is a great book, except for the raping, that could have been left out.

But then again, it makes me think about philosophy and good and evil, human nature and all that razdraz, at the same time.It's not like all those other books that portray all the stark realities of our fallen world, that makes u go all boo hoo hoo. The strong bad in here is counteracted by the main Character's, Alex's, charm, wit, and his love of classical music. This book makes u happy and think about free will and God and good and evil at the same time. Whats interesting is that this book doesn't give an opinion, like all those other philosophical novels, instead, it asks all these questions and has no answers, but instead of leaving you confused, it makes you not care and instead, crave Alex's idea of fun.when first reading, ull be confused because of the thick slang, but u understand it all in a little while if ur not dim witted.And another thing: this book is for the mature minded who have self control. I hate it when yooung people read things (those who normally dont read), just cuz it has all this \\"cool\\" violence in it and such, but then again, im like that myself a bit and so is everyone else. Even if you arent' much of a book worm, read it, itll dispel your stupidity, and possibly make u wiser.To me, the theme of the story is this: if u are meek, unselfish, humble, and dying, u are great not in the world but in God's eyes, if you believe in a God in the first place."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I don't know what's wrong with some of you people like the one reviewer who read the book when they were 19 years old and didn't like it.

What planet do you live on? Even in the real world people grow up in real loving homes and commit violentcrimes,get a clue.This book was very powerful and lets us look at a point of viewmost of us don't even know about.The view of a troubled,violentteenager.

The protagonist(using this term loosely) is named Alex and is the leader of a street gang who spend their time fighting, stealing, and raping. This goes on until Alex is caught and put in a program designed to reform him. A Clockwork Orange is an interesting, but disturbing look into violent criminal actions and a desire that is can only be motivated by an obvious lack of a moral compas. If the reader can get past the excrutiatingly frustrating use of random slang dialogue and the graphic depictions of rape and other violent crimes, then A Clockwork Orange is a very interesting read that reallly forces one to take a look a the violence in our own society. A Clockwork Orange was not an easy read, but it was still a very interesting one. Therefore, I would give it a 7 out of 10."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book is amazing. It is a great, fast paced story of the future that also has a strong moral message. Burgess opens it by introducing us to Alex. A teenager bent on destruction and violence. He's not the only one though, nearly every teenager is like him. At one point though he gets caught in one of his acts of violence and he has to go to prison. He then gets a miracle cure that makes him absolutely sick of even the thought of harming anyone and is thrown out into the world leaving him open to the revenge of all the people he harmed before.This book alone would be a good story. Burgess doesn't just tell a good story though. Every action has a meaning and a purpose in the book it is not just 'filler paper'.A good show of how teenagers have an affinity towards violence. But Burgess doesn't stop there. Burgess writes on how people can change. He brings up the problem of choice. Is the man who is forced to good more moral than the man who chooses to do bad? Moral choice is what seperates man from beast isn't it? It is very thought provoking and I am very happy that I stumbled upon this book."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Because I have spent virtually my entire adult life in prison, I&#65533;m always interested whenever I hear about a book suggesting a different response to crime. Locking people in cages for decades at a time fails to prepare prisoners for the challenges they will face upon release.Several years ago I heard a fellow prisoner talking about Anthony Burgess&#65533;s novel, A Clockwork Orange. He said that Burgess wrote about the state &#65533;reprogramming&#65533; prisoners in a way that would ensure the offenders would no longer break the law. I decided to read the book if ever I came across it, and was happy to see it last week.Burgess tells his story through the first-person accounting of Alex, his teenage protagonist. Alex is a juvenile delinquent who catches his thrills by hurting people and destroying property. Eventually, one of his robberies turns into a homicide, and Alex finds himself in prison. He becomes part of an experimental project where prison doctors cause Alex to experience severe pain and nausea whenever he witnesses or contemplates the possibility of crime. When Alex&#65533;s mind is completely reprogrammed, he is considered &#65533;cured&#65533; and released from prison as a free man.I found the book somewhat difficult to read because Burgess tells the story in the vernacular of a British teenager. Many words are not Standard English, so it&#65533;s like reading a book in patois. Fortunately, the volume I had included a glossary in the back that I was able to turn to frequently, and through that translation, I was able to understand the book.Like George Orwell, Burgess uses satire to expose the government&#65533;s efforts to control all aspects of its citizen&#65533;s lives. During these Bush/Cheney/Ashcroft/Rumsfeld times, we&#65533;re seeing more and more of this governmental intrusion. In A Clockwork Orange, the government tinkers with the thought patterns of criminals in order to bring them into compliance. Once the government perfects its methods, those in control may use those methods to program everyone to think and live in accordance with the government machine. Freedom becomes threatened as citizens become numbed into the New World order.Although I&#65533;d like to see the criminal justice system reformed in way where individuals could earn their freedom after they achieved some clearly identifiable objectives, the onus should be on the individual, rather than the government, to make the change. This book was not an easy read, but one that the politically cynical might enjoy."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Brilliant - Brilliant - BrilliantIf you can see past the gore and the sex, then this is a book of a generation.Quality writing brings this story to life.I have never seen the movie because I don't want to spoil my opinion of this book - this is a must read!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I had heard of this movie from a friend many years ago. From what I'd heard of it, it was a graphic story laden with violence. I also learned that it was based on a book. Years later, still have never seeing it, I saw that my local library at the time carried the movie. So I checked it out and prepared myself for a controversial film. (I was in the midst of watching a lot of other classics at that time that I had never seen: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Pscyho, Gone with the Wind, etc.) This was around 2009 or 2010.What really ended up surprising me was that I really liked the idea behind the movie. I didn't care for the violence or any of that, obviously, but the central idea behind it all really won me over and really stuck with me well after I had turned it off and moved on. And what was this idea? It was the classic issue of morality. Free will. Good and bad. Moral choice.The gist of the story is, if a society had the ability to \\"rehabilitate\\" sadistic and violent individuals, at what cost would that be justified? Because, ultimately, after Alex receives his treatment, he may no longer have been able to inflict harm on others, but he was also rendered incapable of choice. In addition, he was incapable defending himself against the evils of the world, since he was conditioned to be intolerant of any kind of violence.So this leads one to wonder, if this type of treatment existed, would it be a fair course of action? Might some justify it as payback for truly sadistic persons who have inflicted so much harm upon others? If given the choice of this \\"treatment\\" versus a life incarcerated, or even the death penalty, what would someone in Alex's shoes choose if they were truly informed of the implications of such conditioning? We certainly become aware that Alex comes to regret his choice and loathes the \\"rehabilitation\\" he recieved, but he was never truly informed of the specifics of his treatment. Ultimately, he finds his quality of life so intolerable after the treatment that he sees the only possible way to resolve his situation is to off himself.In 2011 I got my hands on a used copy of this book. Ever since viewing the movie, which, as I mentioned earlier, stuck with me, I was eager to read the literary work that was responsible for inspiring the film. The edition I picked up was the one most recently published in the US, the one that included the original 21st chapter that was published in Britain but excluded from previous copies here in the states. Therefor, Kubrick's film, though filmed in England, sticks to the American version - the version that ended with the 20th chapter - instead of the 21st. (More on the 21st chapter later.)The first thing that caught me off guard when I first began reading the book, that I had no knowledge or expectation of, was the language. The language! Surely I've read books with some unusual use of language, old english, slang, etc., but the language in this book was a different breed altogether. The language Alex speaks in, while essentially English, is so obscure and filled with such odd words that it hardly resembles English at times. It's called Nadsat, and it is the teen slang of the future. This in itself was intimidating. Just a few pages into the book, I was quite nervous about what I'd gotten myself into.Sure enough, I got the hang of it eventually. A lot of it can be figured out in context. A few chapters into the book I ended up looking for a glossary type resource online, and found one. This helped a lot with determining the meaning of some of the tougher words. The truth is, though, if you go into the book and treat it like submersion in to a foreign language, you'll understand enough, do just fine, and ultimately figure it out. Of course, if you want to pause and look up every word, too, this will eventually work out fine as well, since by the time you're half way through the book you have an excellent grip on Nadsat. (P.S. Any one want to govoreet in Nadsat with me? I'm real horrorshow at it now.)It's been a few years now since I've seen the movie. From what I can remember, the movie seems to be quite true to the book. Though I am curious, had Kubrick incorporated the 21st chapter into his film, how that would have been done. I would love to see yet another director take on this work of fiction and put it on the big screen yet again in a fresh new interpretation.So, that 21st chapter. I said I'd get back to it, didn't I? Well, though I appreciate that Alex eventually comes around and wants to change (a nice fairytale ending), I have a few problems with it. The thing is this: yes, kids can be irresponsible, reckless, explosive, impulsive, and violent. But I don't believe that all kids are this way, and the ones that are all exhibit these traits to varying degrees, and most not to the extent that Alex was. The level of violence exhibited by Alex was in no way a mandatory or common component of youth. Alex was above and beyond the troubled teenager. And, in my opinion, Alex demonstrated psychopathic characteristics. (I'm no phsycologist - this is all just my opinion.) He got his kicks from other people's suffering and demonstrated little to no remorse for his actions. In addition, he was incredibly egocentric and narcissistic. So, for Burgess to suddenly have Alex overcome this youthful lust for destruction, and crave the more productive route of creation, seems a little too \\"out of the blue,\\" if you know what I mean. Especiallly given his propensity towards violence throughout the entire book. It bothers my that Burgess implies that youth=an inclination towards detruction, and maturity=an inclination towards creation. It just doesn't work that way, to me. Maybe in this strange, distopian, nadsat-speaking world Burgess fashioned, but not in this world. In spite of my criticism, I realize why Burgess wrote the 21st chapter this way, as he said himself, \\"the twenty-first chapter gives the novel the quality of genuine fiction, an art founded on the principle that human beings change.\\" The problem is, I would have liked the change to have been more authentic and convincing.Regardless of the 21st chapter, this is a fascinating story of a thuggish protagonist with some serious issues, and the curious path he follows which brings into question the matter of moral choice, free will, and a human's inclination towards good and evil. A classic tale, for certain, with some crazy language mixed in. Now I have to go find the movie again and see what I think of it now."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book is very interesting. It explores an interesting topic and keeps your interest throughout. I would recommend this book to anybody looking for a mind bending experience."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I read this book as a Freshman in high school and was shocked by it's graphic nature, but it is the twistedness of the story that made it have such an impact. Readers either have already or absolutely must read this one."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"As a general lover of books, it was some time ago that I added \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" to my list of books to read someday, and I was very excited when I finally got a chance to sit down with it. I read a little bit each day, until I reached the point of Alex's transformation. That night, I sat right there on the floor and read the rest of the book in one go. It's that engaging.Now, I've read a lot of books, and while this may not be the single greatest work of literature that I've ever read, it is certainly one of the most haunting. The main question that Burgess asks is a very difficult one to answer--it's easy to reject something like the Ludovico method when your victim is innocent, but what if he happens to be a killer, a rapist, and generally just a bad guy? Do we take the road of pragmatism or moral integrity? This book feeds on a fear you may not have known you had. It's not the fear that someone like Alex will waltz through your front door and kill your wife while singing a merry tune. It's the fear of not knowing the lengths to which a government will go to maintain order. It's the fear that you could be building a future where the concept of rehabilitation has been lost completely.Of course, if you're reading this review, you're probably familiar with Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation. It is an outstanding piece of art, and stands on its own very well. However, readers of the novel will discover several differences, some subtle, and some not so subtle. This is inevitable with any book-to-film adaptation. Out of respect for Burgess's work, I would recommend reading the novel first (in its original 21-chapter format), as the two works take vastly different opinions on the question posed above. Both are well worth your time.As to the final chapter. I don't want to give anything away for those who haven't read the novel yet, but I can understand its lack of popularity. Alex is such an extreme character throughout the rest of the novel, it does seem very unlikely that such a change could come about, and so suddenly. I ask only that you read Burgess's introduction to this edition before you pass judgement. Besides being a very interesting read, and unexpectedly eloquent for an introduction, it contains valuable insight regarding his intent with that last chapter.To summarize: a fascinating read, deeply haunting, and well worth the effort it takes to get the hang of the slang. But by the end, it'll be like a second language to you."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"The book came in perfect condition!

Thank you so much for your quick service. I would definitely use you again."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Rarely have a film and book inhabited such distinctive worlds of their own as those of 'A Clockwork Orange'. As a youth, I felt lucky to see a film so bizarre; as an adult I feel like I appreciate what so many others cannot. Burgess makes it clear through the introduction that Stanley Kubrick ignored the book's final chapter in his film, in which Alex grows up and grows tired of the ultra-violence and such. I was happy to read the 'lost' chapter, but the film had a lot more impact by letting the viewer guess where Alex's life would lead, that cheeky grin and those gleaming eyes hiding a new monster. I still enjoyed the book, although the film is so vivid it seems like the book is based on it, not the reverse. The liberal use of slang might put some people off, but it's repeated often enough that you'll catch on in no time. The story itself is impossible not to be intrigued by: do we prefer absolute morality in our society, or do we value choice so much that it sometimes comes at the expense of morality? I'll leave the tough questions to you, but there's no question this book deserves to be more widely-read. The film is so famous for being graphic and controversial that it often overshadows the story, which should always be the real star of the show."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange (\\"orange\\" referring to a seemingly normal outward appearance, \\"clockwork\\" referring to the idea that, on the inside, human beings are controlled by either God, the Devil, or the Almighty State) is a classic work of fiction known mainly for its rich use of \\"Nadsat,\\" a language created by Burgess and used throughout the entire novel, and its controversial elements of rape and violence.The book takes place around, and is told by, Alex, who at the beginning of the novel is fifteen and by the end of the novel is around eighteen. The book starts off with a series of events that set the tone for the state of law and order in the novel (Alex and his \\"droogs\\" rob, rape, and pillage with no regard for authority or their elders). In a nutshell, Alex's \\"droogs\\" turn against him, he is imprisoned, he is promised to be released if he undergoes Ludovico's Treatment, he is brainwashed against violence, returns to violence, and at the end finally decides to repudiate violence of his own accord (if the version you're reading contains the twenty-first chapter, that is).The book focuses mainly on a loss of morals, facilitated by the State, but carried out on an everyday basis by the people, or, more specifically, by the youth. Burgess satirizes such things as police brutality by portraying the State's hiring of gang members to positions in the police department, subtly comparing the police of future generations to be no better than the criminals. Burgess also satirizes the future status of religion by presenting Alex's point of view on the bible (when reading about the crucifixion, he imagines himself nailing Jesus onto the cross), which represents the idea that religion will become increasingly irrelevant as a direct result of degeneration among the youth. Other themes in the novel include: good and evil, the transition from adolescence to adulthood, government meddling, corrupt political practices, and free will.Overall, the book excellently demonstrates Burgess's intellectual grasp on society and also his commanding use of language. It's worth the read."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book is not really written in \\" English\\" it is of the language of Alex and his mates.

I began talking in Nadsat while I read the book, which wasn't a very long time, because it held my attention so raptly that I finished it within a few days. While the language is the main highlight of the book (in my humble opinion), the point of the book is also interesting and important. The concept of the clockwork orange as Burgess explains it snared my mind and made me &quot;think outside the box&quot; if only briefly.

Little Alex undergoes some extraordinary changes. (I do not wish to say anything about the plot because this is a must read for everyone!) If the reader finishes this book despite the revolting (to some) actions of Alex and his droogs, he will be in for a real treat. Burgess succeeds in writing a novel that is only limited by the readers imagination due to NadSat. This language, unique to A Clockwork Orange, allows the reader to interpret nearly all aspects of the book in her own desired way. By the time the end has been reached, a slew of morals and themes will have emerged. I do not know if this is the complete book that is being sold here (the real book has 21 chapters but the book initially released in the US only had 20), but the 21 chapter book must be read, and the movie must be seen. When seen or read separately, each recieve a 9 rating. But when the reader has read the complete book and has seen the movie, a full 10 is the appropriate rating. Keep this in mind. Enough! READ A CLOCKWORD ORANGE! But make sure it has all 21 chapters first!!!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Anthony Burgess wrote what is a very distubing and thoroughly modern tale in A Clockwork Orange, a book that bewilders in its complexity but is yet simple in its humanity. Burgess, like Joyce before him, creates his own language for his tale of these futuristic thugs in a socially apocalyptic England. It is a book that sucks you into its world so well for the very reason that you must learn its language. And Burgess, despite his often shocking vulgarities and violence, is writing what is essentially the central parable of the modern age. It tries to answer the question that lies at the heart of modern society: how do you find your essential humanity in a society that has come to regard the soul as a mixture of brain chemicals? Burgess is relentless in his desire to find something beautiful and enduring about the human struggle in the dense web of human technology, and little could be more appropriate when facing the absurdities of the modern age. This is a difficult, disturbing tale but one that belongs among the greats of all Western literature."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book is one of humor, violence, truth, and human choice. The book depicts a teen who's head has been tampered with. Our lovely government tries to take control and in doing so ruins Alex's life. They failed to realize that one can not successfully change unless willing to do so on their own. Alex simply needed age and the sight of his friend Pete's wife to realize it was time to grow up and get on with his own life. This novel has changed the way I judge society."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Despite its (some people think) outrageous depiction of the near future, the book is actually a harrowingly realistic comment on our vitiated society and what it MIGHT become if its sociopathic paradigms are not arrested. The ending is a sly insinuation: the way its written, the reader is almost supposed to sympathize with Alex's triumph over the system as he returns to his vicious self. By dehumanizing Alex's victims, Burgess plays another joke: instead of condemning the punk's actions, the reader is supposed to ENJOY his 'outings'. Burgess's message, I think, is this: society is rapidly accelerating toward self-destruction; people are disgusting and innately malevolent; things are going fine, and the enduring paradox of our existence is the best testimony to it."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange is what Alex was made into as a punishment for his crimes. This left him without the freedom of choice, a product of the Government. It also took from him his love of music and ability to act to defend himself in a cruel world.

A book that everyone should read."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book grabs a hold of you, as disturbing and charming as it is. An intriguing story filled with emotion, and sometimes the lack of emotions. If you feel like you're ready for some ultraviolence go ahead... Start reading."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess takes place in a dark depiction of the near-future in which both the government and society are corrupt and the streets are rampant with criminals and thugs. This is the world that Alex, the narrator, lives in, and he spends his nights stealing, beating, and raping until he is finally caught by the police. He is then chosen to undergo a new type of treatment that can reform him by making him physically adverse to violence. This leads to drastic consequences that raise important questions about human nature and freewill.Alex is the perfect anti-hero for this satire, since he is immoral and cruel enough for us to hate him as a human being, while still being complex and intriguing enough for us to love him as a literary character. His seemingly contradicting traits make him even more interesting and original, since his love of \\"ultra-violence\\" is contrasted with a love of classical music, usually considered the music of the refined and sophisticated. But for people who don't like reading books with too many incomprehensible vocab words, you should be warned that in nearly every sentence of A Clockwork Orange, Alex uses nadsat talk (teen slang invented by Burgess). The first few chapters will probably be difficult to read, as there's no glossary and each nadsat word must be deciphered in context. However, once you get a feel for it, which may happen much quicker than you think, Alex's unique voice and vocabulary makes the book even more memorable and his character more real.I highly recommend A Clockwork Orange as both a compelling story that explores human nature and a thought-provoking social satire. If you've already seen Stanley Kubrick's movie adaptation, this is still worth reading for the additional insight into Alex's subconscious and for the reinstated final chapter that could alter your perception of Alex and maybe the story as a whole."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange (1962)by: Anthony BurgessAnthony Burgess is truly a genius which can be seen in this book a masterpiece to most who read it repulsive to others and vaguely readable to some.A Clockwork Orange is the story of a not so pretty vision of the future which includes ultra violence (basically the acts of rape,robbery,and other physical crimes including beating people.) This vision of the future includes a very complicated brutal slang which can be a bit frustrating at times especially when getting to a good part in the story. I personally had to go back a few times to know what the heck was going on, but after about of the book i started to understand more and this made previous chapters more clear.The story itself is simple but it is the way it is told that makes the difference and it has many twists and reverse psychology first making you have doubts about the character ,then hate him ,then like him and so on. But it was not the brutal slang nor the ultra violence, or even the way it was told but the genius of this person and how it was told. To some people it was a repulsive sickening book, but that is due to IGNORANCE there is a message, behind the story that not too many people think about, but burgess hid it in his work so only a deserving person would understand it.(i won't write it here because i cannot explain it as well as he does)To get to the point since by now you are probably frustrated with my explanations i will give you a small non detailed summary of the first chapter.Alex and his three droogs Pete,Georgie,and Dim Dim. A gang of 15 year olds with an obsession with rape,violence,stealing,listening to classical music,and driving their Durango 95.Living in a a near future wearing their white outfits and their black hats strolling around looking for trouble. In the first chapter they are at their hangout the korova milk bar drinking molocco a mixture of milk and things that probably wouldn't be good for you, then going on their rampage beating a drunken bum robbing a house and other bad stuff but all i can say is that this small glimpse is nothing compared to the books vast extremely descriptive strangely interesting events.In the end the truth is that Burgess was not very happy because people paid more attention to this book than his other books, plays and music which he prized even more than this book but this has been seen before as Anthony mentions before the book starts, most of this is due to Stanley Kubrick's film A Clockwork Orange which weakened interests in his better books.The movie only gained more fame for the book but none of this can destroy Burgess genius writing,composing skills. If you like this you should check out his other books.Remember there is more to the book than you might want to know."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I found A Clockwork Orange very slow to begin with but about half way through it picked up and became very interesting.This book has been recommended to me by many a friend and they have all claimed that the main character, Alex aged 15, would annoy me with his violent attacks and Burgess would create situations where I, the reader, would feel rage towards Alex and at others times, sympathy. I was surprised then to find that the story didn't really evoke any feeling from me.What kept me hooked was the way that Burgess has written A Clockwork Orange, The clever way that the title is woven into the story and the way in which Alex speaks and narrates the story. Alex has his way of speaking and as I read the first chapter I tried to decode what he was saying which I found hard and stressful. I then read the first chapter again but this time I just accepted the strange words (slovo, ptitsa, bezoomny, litso etc) and the reading of the book became easier and the meaning of these words became very clear and no longer a problem. I think these words help the reader relate to Alex but also, especially at the beginning, alienate the reader from him as well.This is a really good book and I'm glad that I didn't give up on it."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Throughout much of my pre-teen years I had heard much about this story through people who hated Kubrick's film version, naturally this peaked my interest and I really wanted to see it. This would not happen for a number of years though, as I wanted to respect those I lived with. So I went out and got my hands on the book by Anthony Burgess, and read it cover to cover in one sitting. This novella is a highly intelligent, complex and energized futuristic adventure about a brutal fifteen year old boy, Alex, who whirls through the night with his three teenage \\"droogies\\" performing \\"a bit of the old ultraviolence\\" on all the helpless \\"weepy young devotchkas\\". The language shared by these anti-heroes, called \\"nadsat\\" a mix of British and Russian slang, is ingenious and perfectly illustrates these hoodlums social pathology.Alex and his droogs have the time of their lives destroying other people. Each night they begin their reign of terror in the same way, they assemble at the Korova Milkbar for \\"milk with knives in it\\", which is milk laced with \\"drencrom\\" or \\"synthemesc\\" which would \\"sharpen you up and get you ready for a bit of the old ultraviolence.\\" Upon \\"sharpening their knives\\" they proceed through the streets of a post-apocolyptic & fascist London, where they knife the innocent and rape and carve through the beautiful - howling for joy all the while. A third of the way through the book, our hero, Alex, is apprehended by the \\"milicents\\" after being betrayed by his droogs and is sentenced to fourteen years in jail. Here Alex is placed in a state-run program designed to rehabilitate violent criminals through an inhuman conditioning technique. Transforming Alex into a model citizen, we see how Alex was conditioned to respond to violence, sex and even his favorite music - Beethoven with a violent and surging sickness. Though Alex is now incapable of violent acts, and so is forced to remain helpless as one by one, his victims perform savage revenge upon Alex's person. We now see Alex as the victim, crouching over in sickness from the violent thoughts flooding his mind, but incapable of acting upon them. Upon receiving negative press due to inhuman treatment our protagonist is subjected to, the State turns Alex back into his happy brutal self, freeing him to \\"carve through the litso of the whole creeching world with his cut-throat britva.\\" This book is a social and moral commentary on society and the nature of good and evil, and the choices between them.The one downside to this edition, is the inclusion of the twenty-first chapter. This chapter should in no way be seen as a part of this story, it is more like a mini sequel, and it does no justice to the story and its subtext. This chapter was not in the original first edition, and only appeared after the film version, and in a way, it was included solely for the purpose of cushioning the devastating effects that this film apparently had on many viewers. I feel that this last-minute inclusion of this chapter was a sort of disowning act for Burgess, who never liked his own story, and felt it needed this sort of an ending to redeem the whole thing - which goes against everything he claimed the book represented. Read it if you like happy endings, but ignore it at all costs if you intend to preserve this book's integrity. Just my opinion."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"An absolutely amazing novel. Breathtakingly beautiful, to those of us who are slightly twisted and love a little madness. The language, although sometimes confusing, is truly beautiful, if you just take the time to read it.I'll admit, I read this originally for a lit class and I hated it. I didn't get it at all. Looking back, I think I hated the class, not the book. And the professor, but we won't get into that. I appreciated it, as a classic novel, but I didn't enjoy it at all. However, because I am hardcore, I reread it about a year later on my own time and I absolutely loved it. I think it was just a matter of slowing down and reading it for myself rather than for some class.So, kids, let this be a lesson to you.

I was interested in the book when I started reading it and it also disturbed me of how these people lived and what they did and acted. It didn't turn me off of the book.

A strength of this book is the suspense that the author describes. He builds situations up very good. He got me interested in it. A weakness is the diction that Alex and his friends use. The diction is very hard to understand, especially if you don't know Russian, but most of it you can understand by reading what is around the words. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes mysterious books and suspenseful books. A person who likes to hear about violence would like this book."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Clockwork Orange is a wonderful original piece. The whole new language or slang that Burgess invents for the book gets some getting used to but once you're a few pages into it you'll get quite used to it.The story takes place in England which is not really relvant to the story but that where it take place. The main character, Alex, is a young thug who robs and hurts people for fun with his friends. He messes around with the homeless, beats up other gangmembers, he rapes women and in general causes a lot of havoc.One day he gets caught by the police and he kills an old woman in her home (by accident). He hears about a deal where if he lets some doctors perform some new experimental procedure on him they'll release him a lot sooner, so he goes along with it. Here is where the story really begins to unfold. I won't ruin for you so you'll have to read the book. Trust me you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Anthony Burgess' novel A Clockwork Orange has become a sort of underground classic. It is read and loved by young men all over the world.The novel is written in a language all its own; a hybrid of English and Russian slang. Burgess called this language Nadsat. It can be, at first, difficult. However, once the reader acclimates themself to the rythyms of the words Nadsat comes alive. The language of this novel is electric. Burgess was very interested in music, and was a composer. In this novel he uses words as Mozart would have used musical notes.A Clockwork Orange is the story of Alex, a young criminal. He and his \\"droogs\\" (friends) roam the streets robbing, beating, and raping the people they encounter. Alex is quite satisfied with his life, he has everything he needs.Things begin to turn bad for Alex after a midnight raid on a house in the country. He is captured by the police and his friends turn on him. Soon Alex finds himself in prison, where he is offered the \\"Ludovico treatment\\". This treatment will garuntee that he never breaks another law.Alex agrees to the treatment in exchange for release from prison. This is the point in the story where Burgess' talent really begins to show. It is at this point that the reader fully realizes that Burgess is not simply telling a story; he is showing us a metaphor for the world we inhabit.The Ludovico treatment turns Alex into a clockwork orange: he appears to be a living creature, but is merely a machine. Alex, stripped of free will is unable to defend himself. And, because he cannot choose evil, any good he may do is meaningless.In this book Burgess first creates a loathsome character. Then draws us into his world, making us care a bit about what happens to him. He then tears down that characters world, to show how easily our world can be torn down.This is a startling, and brilliant book. It is not for the squeamish, nor the easily offended.By the way, if you purchase this book be sure to look for the European edition which is one chapter longer than the American version.----------------"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"It may well be true that Stanley Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' is one of the rare few occasions of a film being more - or at the very least as powerful and effective as the novel on which it was based (the only other such case I can think of being 'The Shining', also by Mr. Kubrick). That film is, without a doubt, one of the great masterpieces in cinema history and is mandatory viewing. That doesn't mean Burgess's novel is not praiseworthy. In fact, it's a fantastic piece of literature that, though it was overshadowed by its fantastic cinematic adaptation, is comparable to Orwell's 1984 in quality as well as in themes and ideas, and if you liked the film then the novel is well worth your time as well.The comparison to 1984 comes quite naturally because they both run along the same veins of futuristic thinking, and both deal with similar subjects of free will, individual freedom, violence and alienation in a technologically advanced society - though from entirely different points of view. Burgess chose - as you well know if you've seen the film - the point of view of Alex, a teenage delinquent and a violent criminal, in a futuristic New York where teenage gangs rule the night and have their own way with innocent, law-abiding citizens. We see this world through Alex's eyes, and so receive a very disturbing view of this reality; Alex sees the violence and death in a humorous, indifferent way, and so the novel is often hilarious and constantly shocking. A reviewer noted that nowadays, the idea of a fifteen year old committing murder may not be as shocking and unthinkable as it was forty years ago, and that may be true; but the elegant and lightly style in which the gruesome murders and rapes are described by Alex makes the novel shocking and compelling still, and the moral and philosophical questions it raises about free will - essentially, is good truly good only when it's chosen? - or, is good behavior that isn't chosen by one's own free will better than bad behavior that is? - still fascinate. Burgess suggests no easy answers - but he raises some damn interesting questions, that may become more and more relevant.The linguistic aspect of the book is also a fascinating one. Burgess came up with a complete and structured slang to be used by the teenagers of his hypothetic future, composed mainly of words derived from Russian. Since the Humble Narrator himself speaks in that hybrid language even as he directs his words at the readers, it makes for both a challenging and a fascinating read.The 21st and last chapter of A Clockwork Orange is an anomaly that almost every reviewer here referred to, and so shall I. The chapter was omitted from Kubrick's otherwise very faithful adaptation, as it was from the original American publication of the novel (the version which I first read). Quite frankly, I can see perfectly well why Burgess and Kubrick chose to drop it, because it's mostly anti-climatic and does not fit in well with the book's ideas, though it fits in very well with the structure of the novel and answers some questions left by the original twenty chapters (most of all, whatever happened to old Pete?). It's interesting enough to read though - even though I still consider it an afterthought and a separate section from the actual novel - it sheds a very different light in regard to Burgess's views on the matters discussed in the novel, and raises some very different questions than the original ending. Do try to find the version that includes this chapter, but read the first twenty chapters first and this one separately, and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Great books seldom make for great films, but when they do, it's usually the movie people remember better. Films reach more people, requiring less investment of their time. Plus, when they are made as well and as excitingly as was Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of this Anthony Burgess novel, it's hard not to think of the movie first.Both feature a young man named Alex who, in what was a vaguely futuristic society for the time, rides around with his friends committing various felonies. Alex lords it over his friends as well, a bit too much. Then he finds himself with one victim too many, and in the hands of the police. His only chance for freedom: Submit to a controversial mind-altering technique that will make him incapable of violence.There are two reasons the book remains vital above the movie. The first, more surface reason, has to do with Nadsat, the unique argot Burgess developed for the youthful protagonist, Alex, and his friends. For example, while contemplating robbing helpless victims, Alex narrates thusly: \\"Our pockets were full of deng, so there was no need...of crasting any more pretty polly to tolchock some old veck in an alley and viddy him swim in his own blood...\\"You can find a Nadsat glossary online if your edition doesn't have one, but the remarkable thing is how well you pick up on the words' meaning after a few pages without looking up definitions. The movie keeps some of the Nadsat but it doesn't have the same place it has in the book, which is too bad since the language makes a point about the corruption of the culture Alex inhabits.The second thing about the book that places it over the movie is explaining what the title is all about. The phrase \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" recurs through the novel, while never appearing in the movie. \\"A fair gloopy title,\\" Alex calls it, when he first spies it on a manuscript of an author he is in the process of terrorizing.As Alex goes on to read, the author describes \\"a clockwork orange\\" as the artificial imposition on man of \\"laws and conditions appropriate to a mechanical creation.\\" This has a ring of irony when Alex himself submits to the technique. It's not that the movie doesn't carry the concept of the clockwork orange, just that it doesn't connect the dots or make the point as effectively.A third reason to choose the book over the movie is the missing 21st chapter, which is found in later editions of the book but not all, and did not appear in the movie. It's kind of a mixed blessing, since the missing chapter wouldn't have gone so well in the movie (hard to imagine the wonderfully malevolent Malcolm McDowell suddenly having a sensitive moment) but does give the reader something positive to take away from an what otherwise might feel depressing upon reflection, the idea that man has two choices, to be controlled artificially or left to their evil desires.But \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is not depressing to read through. It's actually thrilling, mind-warping, and more than a bit funny. You will find yourself liking Alex despite yourself, and adapting to his worldview with surprising ease. That's because Burgess does such a good job of representing the devil inside all of us, why we listen to it, and even, most daringly, why it's better to have one than not."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I really slogged to get through this one, having decided upon it as it continues to appear on so many \\"classic\\" and \\"must-read\\" lists. First, I thoroughly disliked the over-use of the protagonist's slang language, ultimately finding it just plain annoying. (The protagonist is so \\"cool\\", he has \\"eggsy weggsy\\" for breakfast one morning.) Second, I was repulsed and horrified by the violence apparently done just for fun. Innocent people assaulted, their life-works laughingly torn up, minors raped, an elderly women in her own home, living the last few minutes of her life in complete terror ... raped and murdered. Third, the ending. Apparently, the author believed that \\"boys will be boys\\" and that they tend to grow out of, or get bored by youthful anarchy. Enough! The protagonist, if written today would be readily seen as a psychopathic personality disorder, thus diminishing the novel's philosophical profundity (ie the issue concerning free-will/bad versus state-made/ good). I actually could not have cared if this character had been handed a death sentence, and am glad I didn't have to read this novel in school as I'm afraid it would have singularly diminished my own love of literature."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I appreciate a difficult read. I appreciate fiction from different countries, cultures, and times. I appreciate not trusting the government. I can even appreciate poorly written books IF the story is powerful. This &#34;book&#34; was the worst of all of these statements. The slang was difficult for difficulties sake. The message of the government was heavy handed. The pity for the protagonist was feeble. The overall message was poorly crafted and framed more as a statement than a thought provoking question. I can't remember ever rating something 1 star, but I want the time i spent reading this back. It was truly horrible."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"this book is very good although also very disturbing. the book gives u the feeling of isolation and it really puts the meaning of being alone from the rest of the world into perspective. If you like a lot of violence and a tough read then this is the book for you. If you can get past the weird slang (which i found awesome) then you can pretty much understand the basic meaning of the book. i think a constitution can be written from reading this book. well this book ranks among my favorites including fight club and hannibal. so if you like those books, i'm positive you'll like this one"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"&quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; is a good book, maybe even great, but it falls short in a few areas. I guess the most major is language. The dialect of the boys, although entertaining, overshadows the story itself to some point, and is little more than a device to smooth over some of the rougher areas of the literature. Despite that, it was a good, even touching story despite the raw violence that seemed to jump off of every page. Yet despite their raping and beating and killing you manage to feel some compassion for the boys. I won't give away the ending, but in a mark of true fiction, you find the signs of a character who is dynamic both inside an dout in Alex, the leader of the boys. I think it is a good book because it takes a satrical look at the side of society that is too often ignored, although perhaps not so much satrical as just a magnified projection. However, the language (for me) and the violence (for others) prevent me from recommending this book to everyone."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This is definitely one of the strangest books I've read in my life, but I by far do not regret it. Burgess uses an interesting technique combining the Russian language with the old English to make up the teen language of the future called nadsat. This is a story told from the first person by a teenage boy about his vicious gang times as a kid at 15, his time in jail, and his &quot;new&quot; treatment which made him into a senseless &quot;good person but not by his own choice. &quot;Man ceases to be man when he cannot choose.&quot; Read this book, you'll be glad you have."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I couldn't put this book down no not even if peeted with vellocet could I have been more like hypnotized.

Have a nice day!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I did not enjoy reading Clockwork Orange, although understand the book became easier through the chapters. The main character, Alex, is a naive and immature boy who experiences harsh consequences to his actions, but they are well deserved. Even though his crimes were out of fun, not meaning to kill anyone, they did, and he showed no sign of remorse. He doesn't learn from his mistakes and his true feelings are masked by his inability to perform violent acts.The language used in the book is difficult at first to understand, but with repitition, I got used to it and could understand the plot. I like the fact that the language is unique, but I don't think the book has any other great values. There is no significant difference between Alex at the beginning of the book and at the end. Like all his actions, he has no real reason to start a family. He acts on sporadic instincts and doesn't think about the things that he does. Weeks of physical torture could not keep him from his violent thoughts, and the idea of growing up most likely won't either.I found this book tiring because it was so wordy and I found no real attachment to any of the characters because the only ones described in depth were cold and violent."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This novel is an amazing piece of literature. It centers around the dealings of a young man, approx. 15-16 years old, involved in gangs in the not too distant future. Alex, the sadistic protagonist, is a teenager who enjoys beating, stealing, and raping the innocent, until a tragic murder is on his hands and he's thrown in jail. While in jail, he defends himself from getting raped and accidentally kills his assailant. Because of this crime, Alex is forced into a radical new treatment which promises to change society for the better. Anyone who undergoes this treatment cannot commit or watch any violent or vulgar acts with feeling a sensation similar to that of death (drowning specifically). Once he finishes this treatment, Alex attempts to return to his former life only to find himself surrounded by the very people he hurt, unfortunately for him they decide to get even (involving an orgy of violence begun by very old men). Once Alex attempts suicide, the government's doctors cure him and give him a job, in hopes of gaining some badly needed good P.R.. After a while of being his original self once again, Alex seems uneasy, as if the acts of ultra violence no longer satisfy him. Then he meets an old friend who seems to have grown up, has a wife, good job, and a promising future. Alex then decides to abandon the life of a scoundrel youth, considering he is now in his either late teens or early twenties, for a more upstanding life.This novel explores the Adolescent Psyche showing the thought process of a teen and how, with age, that seems to change so dramatically, like dropping the use of some strange form of slang. It also explores the moral question \\"Is it worse to be bad by choice, or be good by force?\\" and the questionable actions of the government (i.e. the Vietnam War).If one could get past the abnormal dialect, it took me about half way to truly understand what every word meant, 'droog' means 'friend' ; 'korova' means 'cow'; 'golova' (gulliver) means 'head'; 'malchick' or 'malchickiwick' means 'boy'; 'soomka' means 'sack' or 'bag'; 'Bog' means 'God'; 'khorosho' means good, 'prestoopnick' means 'criminal'; 'rooker' is 'hand', 'cal' is 'crap', 'vec' is 'man' or 'guy'; 'litso' is 'face'; and so on. One should not let the language stop them from enjoying a truly classic piece of literature after all."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"The source of one of the most controversial movies ever made, Anthony Burgess's 'A Clockwork Orange' is at once a profound social commentary and a linguistic innovation. The book came around 1962, written at a time when the author was ill and given one year to live (he went onto live another three decades); but it was not until Stanley Kubrick's visual adaptation to the big screen that the book gained it's notoriety. Since publicity-shy Kubrick avoided the media, it was up to Anthony Burgess and the film's star Malcolm McDowell to defend the film when it was accused as a glorification of violence (the film was ultimately withdrawn from being shown in the UK by Kubrick himself). While at the time Burgess was enthusiastic about the movie, he gradually came to dislike the cinematic treatment by Kubrick--no doubt complicated by the fact that the assiduous director had adapted the US version of A Clockwork Orange, which was missing the all important 21st chapter. In an uncanny turn of events, it was the US publishers who thought the original ending in Burgess's novel was too 'optimistic', and was told to drop the last chapter altogether--which the author did, because he was in no position to argue being strapped for cash. In the book, Alex (the violent protagonist) redeems himself in the 21st chapter, renouncing his anarchic ways for a more quite life. What Burgess says is that the violence in youth is ephemeral--just a phase that needs to be lived out in order to be mature. Inhibiting the natural tendencies of a person, however harmful they maybe to society, is wrong; the conditioning of Alex by the 'Ludovico' technique (a play on Ludwig Van Beethoven's name) not only suppresses his violent instincts, but saps out his taste too (mainly his love of Classical Music, which the inhibitors lack). It makes him a 'clockwork orange'--a mechanically wound human being, capable of performing only good. Burgess is not excusing Alex, only pointing out that Alex did not willingly choose to be good--it was not a sincere transformation, but one done out of fear. This is what happens in the last chapter; Alex gets bored with his violent way of life and chooses--not with fear but understanding--to be a good human being.Stanley Kubrick, since he adapted the US version of Clockwork, did not end the movie on that note--it ends bleakly with Alex going back to his sociopathic ways ('I was cured alright'). Later Kubrick and other critics admitted that the original ending of the book was unrealistic and too optimistic, but what they failed to see was that Burgess did not exactly have a ebullient ending either: he points out that though the protagonist has considered a normal life, his son would ultimately go through the same phase, and this trend would go on till the end of time; the rebellious violence of youth being a commonplace thing.Burgess was right, as it turned out and all too prophetic.'A Clockwork Orange' is a seminal masterpiece, without the backing of Kubrick's film (Time chose it as one of the 100 Best Novels Of The Decade). It can stand very well on its own: the highly innovative language (the anti-social 'droogs' speak in 'Nadsat' to separate themselves from mainstream society) and its timeless themes such as the absence of Free Will and its consequences, places 'A Clockwork Orange' in the pantheon of great Dystopian works such as Orwell's '1984' and Huxley's 'Brave New World'."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This has turned out to be one of my favorite books ever.

The entire book is written in first person, and we focus on Alex, whose language will be really hard for some people to get into. But if you read it the second or third time, then you'll understand what's happening and what the characters are trying to say.Anthony Burgess's philosophical novel is a must-read. It deals with modern society and government experiments. Basically, the book discusses the idea of driving a criminal away from crime, but \\"at what cost?\\" Many scenes involving rape and violence are especially disturbing (I imagine that Stanley Kubrick's film version is just as gruesome). And the government testing scenes are fairly frightening. The last chapter of this book (the 21st) is now restored, as it has been omitted the first time this was published in the States. It's somewhat controversial, but I won't give you the details, you'll have to read it yourself.A-"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book is very good.

Upon finding a seemingly just punishment and solution the spin doctors find a way not only to persecute the \\"afflicted\\" youth but also use it to defeat their own enemies.

The epic journey of the protagonist Alex from his extreme highs to his disembodying lows serves as the focal plot throughout the novel.

Burgess is able to evoke an array of emotions from the reader toward Alex such as anger during his reckless days to empathy after he is left a shell of himself as a result of Ludovico's Technique.

This treatment doesn't change the fact that he is inclined to commit violent acts, it just prevents him from doing so, taking away his free will. great imagery, i enjoyed reading it.its also cool how the author creates his own language. this effectively encapsulates the terms created by youth and only understood by youth, without putting a timeframe on the story by using actual slang from a certain time period.great story, definitely check it out."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Answer: Yes, it is wrong and unethical to dehumanize human monsters in order to make our world a safer place.

The author created a slang language in it that was a mix of cockney and russian slang. The outcome is a funny yet disturbing piece of prose that at times reads like poetry. It is vicious with a point. The author is fighting a conflict between being evil or being good because you have no choice. It reminded me of the Catholic religion and Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil. Are you being good because you are afraid of the consiquences of being bad or are you being good because it feels like it is the rite thing for you to do. Living life as you see it should be lived. You don't kill or rape because a Religious law tells you it is sin; instead you don't do these things because you know that they are wrong. This is what Nietzsche called living beyond good and evil.

The narrative flow and the story itself are confoundedly magnificent. Yes, I too love A Clockwork Orange.Here is a story of free will versus society; a devastating critique onindividual human nature and an even harsher attack on the ultimately Fascist attitude of any organized system of justice.In a mildly Science-Fiction-style plot we go forward to the parallel near future where politics have taken over ever aspect of human life. Even thoughts can be controlled and the punishment shall always fit the crime. We, the reader, are forced to choose sides between a violent, anarchist, sociopthic rapist-murder, and the oppressive State Government that will force the mind to suppress thoughts, to suppress all human desire in an effort to make certain that everyone will be safe in their homes, out-of-sight--The arguments are beautifully placed and here, ten years after I've read it, the passion and power of the debate still lingers, fresh. (On a brief side-note in relation to Kubrick's wonderful film adaptation: I love Stanley Kubrick and A Clockwork Orange is, depending on my mood at the time, perhaps my favorite of his flicks; but the book diverges into even more decadent and intense realms, and forces one to actually experience the events in your mind, not transposed on a visual plate, and you experience the horror even more viscerally than the romanticized extravagence of the film)"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"when i was around 16 i saw the motion picture after been forbidden several years in my country and i was fascinated. i was shocked with all that mixed violence and sex showed in it.14 years later ( last week ) i read the book and i was very pleased to see the fidelity related between it and the film. i was like i was watching the movie again... and i have to admit just a few books made me feel that way.is a very delightful reading not only for teenagers but adults too.from the Argentine landsBertr&aacute;n"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Anthony Burgess' A clockwork orange, I have always found the title interesting and had hired out the movie in my teens, oblivious to it's meaning. As I was in reading the novel until it was revealed. Maybe it was lost on my innocence as in my teens I just thought it was a cool movie, not taking much stock in its message. But what a powerful message it is to me now. Almost all angles to the questions this book raises are moot by another angle.Who are those to question vanity, or the heighth of fashion posers, when in true lack of vanity you would walk the streets naked; in itself a pose. What shall it be then, eh? Choice to do right? But by what definition is right? Only in context with, 'good,' do we have, 'evil,' and if Bog in heaven gave us free will, then all mustn't be that bad really... Man has labeled good and bad with the choices he has made and defined a medium unto which there is a context. Alex does what he does because he likes to does. It's a childish shell that he lives in, not knowing good from bad until the definitions are forced upon him.The use of language in this book disturbs me but I love it, as I have already gleaned some of the euphemisms into my own vocabulary. It puts in perspective how wierd the slang I use in fine company must seem to an english speaking outsider. It's a sort of re-affirmation of comraderie, I guess.

The first few pages are a period to grasp this nadsat slang and then, cunningly, Burgess starts to repeat the phrases and so you eventually figure from their context the meanings. Yet towards the end of the novel it almost takes away from genius of it all as he starts to use a core bunch of phrases not quite but almost ad nauseum. I have an, 'I'll let him get away with it this time,' sentiment towards this.On the back of the edition I purchased it has a quote from old W.S Burroughs, \\"The fact that this is also a very funny book may pass unnoticed.\\" Well I noticed it. The frankness that Burgess gives Alex is the very nucleus of this stories charm upon me, and I found myself smirking a smeck away more than once. I guess I'm like the starry old bastards in this book; in that I take certain amounts of pleasure in anothers harm. Ghandi would laugh at least once if subjected to a few hours of Australias home video show. The hypocrisy of the old men who say that Alexs lust for lust is wrong and then leering at the woman they temp Alex with, basically boils my blood; the sign of a damn good book is that you say of the characters: \\"that's exactly what this guy would do in this situation.\\" And to instill anger in a reader about the inner world of a story and not the writing symantics shows a master stroke."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This story is about a mischievous and violent youth who gets set up by his friends and goes to prison. While there, a new rehabilitation experiment is started and scientists are choosing one of the prisoners to be the guinea pig. The main character is chosen and they reprogram his mind to feel nauseous every time he thinks about doing anything violent. He is being essentially made into a clockwork orange, organic on the outside, but programmed on the inside.I loved this book. The story is a direct statement that people are going to be who they are meant to be and nothing should ever attempt to change that. And whatever you believe about good and evil, as human beings, we are meant to have a choice about which way we choose."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I got this as a present for my son, & he was really surprised I found the one with the 21st chapter!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Certainly the most violent book I've ever read, there is statutory rape, multiple armed robberies and assaults, and forced rape within the first few chapters. However, don't let that discourage you from reading this book. Burgess artfully crafts a unique slang which starts out confusing, but the book is so engrossing that you'll find yourself using the terms he creates in your own mind. This printing includes the final chapter that was omitted from the movie. I won't spoil the ending for you, but it definitely adds to the book, and you can choose to ignore it if you so choose. This book most certainly deserves to be called a classic, as it is really quite excellent, though not quite as impactful in the long run, I think, as other similar books such as 1984, Fahrenheit 451, or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Still, if you're looking for an entertaining read that has more substance than your average modern novel, this is a good book to turn to."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"First things first: I have not read this yet, but I know it is an amazing book, as I used to own a copy of it, but I lent it to a friend who lost it...wow.I also wanna point out that this is tied for my favorite movie, so anyone who has seen the movie will love reading this. And for those of you who haven't seen the movie but have an idea of what it's about. Be prepared to be lost on your first read-through, or at least for the first quarter to half of the book. As learning the nadsat language is quite the challenge...albeit a fun one. Once you learn it, it's such a breeze to read through this or watch the movie and not have to stop and think about what exactly one of the characters said, or what it means.Now, if you have no idea what this book/movie is about...go into it with an open mind. Yes it's very adult oriented and lots of graphic rape/torture going on. But that doesn't mean it should be looked down on. It's a brilliant story about something that no one has even touched on before. The story will just keep you going and going and you will soon find yourself at the end, wishing it wasn't over...as I found the book a little short compared to the 2hr. 30min. version that Kubrick has directed.Overall, a very great book, brilliant and intriguing."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"this is a crazy awesome book....

Thank you"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I suspect that 95% of those familiar with A Clockwork Orange have seen the Stanley Kubrick motion picture, as opposed to read the rather short novel written by Anthony Burgess. It had been a long time since I'd seen the movie (25-30 years), so aside from a broad remembrance of Malcolm McDowell raising holy hell and undergoing \\"reconditioning\\", I remembered little of the story. In fact, in an introduction to the 1986 edition of the work, Burgess explains that previous American editions, as well as the Kubrick film, neglected to include the 21st chapter of the story.MILD SPOILERS, FOR THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE STORYThe story is set in a near future dystopia, in which our humble narrator, Alex, epitomizes the rampant lawlessness and thuggery of society. After several instances of extreme antisocial behavior, he is arrested, convicted and incarcerated. Faced with political backlash as a result of the high crime rate, the powers that be have concocted an effective rehabilitation technique to combat recidivism.Alex is the perfect lab rat for the new technique, which utilizes harsh negative reinforcement to forestall even the thought of violence. Effectively cured, he is released into society, where he becomes an unwilling tool for both the current administration as well as its opponents. At issue is the morality of the treatment itself. As the prison chaplain opines:\\"It may not be nice to be good Alex. It may be horrible to be good. And when I say that to you I realize how self-contradictory that sounds. I know I shall have many sleepless nights about this. What does God want? Does God want goodness or the choice of goodness? Is a man who chooses the bad perhaps in some way better than a man who has good imposed upon him? Deep and hard questions, Alex.\\"And later, a former victim of Alex's wrongdoing states, \\"They always bite off too much. But the essential intention is the real sin. A man who cannot choose ceases to be a man.\\" In any event, after a political struggle, Alex's conditioning is reversed. The previously omitted 21st chapter deals with Alex's free choice to be good or be bad, and the inclusion of this chapter, in effect, changes the entire book, in my opinion.No review can be complete without reference to the style of language used throughout the novel. A mixture of English and Russian (referred to as nadsat) serves as the dialect for the teenage punks of the era. While slightly offputting at first, the meaning can be easily discerned through context, except on rare occasions such as the following:\\"This evening at the Korova there was a fair number of vecks and ptitsas and devotchkas and malchicks smecking and peeting away, and cutting through their govoreeting and the burbling of the in-the-landers with their \`Gorgor fallatuke and the worm sprays in filltip slaughterballs' and all that cal you could slooshy a popdisc on the stereo, this being Ned Achimota singing \`That Day, Yeah, That Day'.\\"Enjoy."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Burgess novel in some ways is more enjoyable than Kubrick's masterpiece. The book is more of a satire than the movie, so it allows you to laugh out loud as well as cringe. Burgess, who was a musician prior to being a writer, has a very lyrical style to his writing which makes the spoken language a blast to read. As the kids say \\"real horrorshow.\\""},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"For those who enjoyed the Stanley Kubrick film, A Clockwork Orange, the novel will serve to be the Special Edition of the film, complete with deleted scenes and an alternate ending unknown to those who have not read the novel.Inside this novel by Anthony Burgess, he explores the capabilities of free will, and the transformation from boy to man. With tools like character, theme and language, Burgess succeeded in creating a not-so-distant future with a language solely reserved for teenagers and a government struggling for control of its people.The main character of the novel is a teenager named Alex, who is the leader of a gang of his droogies. Each night they prey on the people on the streets committing acts of violence which bring them joy. As Alex sees the blood running from his latest victim he is filled with ecstasy and this passion only serves to drive the violence onward, \\"it was real satisfaction to me to waltz... and carve left cheeky and right cheeky, so that like two curtains of blood seemed to pour out at the same time,\\" (17). This violent nature is only amplified by the fact that Alex is a boy who appreciates fine music from the composers like Ludwig Van Beethoven and many others, however the music only serves to inspire more violence, \\"for now it was lovely music that came to my aid...and I could just slooshy a bar or so of Ludwig van...and I whished out my cut-throat britva,\\" (53). The fact that Alex is young with a violent intelligence creates a world controlled by him exclusively; there is no room for another competitor, not even the government.Through Alex, Burgess also introduces the themes of free will and also the question of when a boy becomes a man. Alex chooses to be bad, it is what he knows and that is what he will do. He will commit acts of violence until he is stopped. When he is arrested however, the government offers Alex a chance to get out of prison if he volunteers to be part of an experiment in which he watches films. Early into this experiment Alex realizes that these films are violent in the most gruesome ways, films of concentration camps, rape, and murder. These were things that used to thrill Alex, but now they begin to make him sick, \\"I had like pains all over and felt I could sick up and at the same time not sick up...I was heaving away but could not sick, viddying first a britva cut out an eye...while red krovvy shot on to the camera lens,\\" (104). That was the experiment, to rid Alex of any pretense of violence, \\"he will be your true Christian...ready to turn the other cheek,\\" (129), and to fill him with only the drive for peaceable actions inside society.The theme of growing up comes in the final chapter of the novel, the chapter that was not included in Kubrick's film. Alex has been out of prison and finds himself not wanting to perform the old violence in the streets anymore, instead he wants to make a family and grow old with children of his own, \\"like a picture of me sitting before a bolshy fire in an armchair...I seemed to have turned into a very starry chelloveck, about seventy years old,\\" (186). By having a main character like Alex, Burgess was allowed to show through the world of Alex, the themes of free will and mental growth.I agree with Burgess and his views of society. The only person who should have the power to change one's mind is the sole owner of that individual mind. When the state tried to take Alex's mind away from him people began to take advantage of his inability to defend himself. Through this failure in reprogramming I believe that Burgess demonstrated the dark side of government and how far they are willing to go to preserve order. Also the use of an entirely new language which was created by Burgess brought the reader into the world of Alex, and made them a part of his gang, seeing what transpired through the eyes and mouth of Alex.Anthony Burgess wrote a fantastic novel featuring a character named Alex, who armed with a razor and a language all his own brought violence to the streets and also spoke toward the dangers of government control. After his release from the prison Alex becomes a man no longer interested in the violence of his childhood, now he is interested in starting a family and having a son that would grow up and resemble his father. This fact made the novel complete in my eyes, bringing Alex from violent teenager to passive adult made the novel a complete masterpiece. Burgess created a novel told by a teenager, a novel that was to read by a teenager. \\"What's it going to be then, eh?\\" (192)."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Anthony Burgess' vision of the future entertains by subjecting the reader to a crucible of bureaucratic and Proletariat violence and mayhem dissolved in waters of state subsidized cultural supremacy. The final solution reverts back to what brought the reader here in the first place: an earlier omitted chapter neither in the film directed by Stanley Kubrick nor in the original United States publication. This book is about the violent mind of its lead character. Alex, the narrator who along with his evil \`droogs', terrorize innocent civilians is terrorized by the State, when he is subjected to psychiatric reconditioning to curb his violent behavior. This book is wonderful depiction rehabilitation gone awry."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"If you're tired of reading the same ol' stories with a goody two-shoes protagonist, who has some sort of dilemma then through a miraculous epiphany he finds his way and everyone holds hands and sings kumbaya, then this is the book for you! (Whatever you do, do not read the last chapter!!!!)This is a very dark and satirical novel with a very fresh dialogue. Burgess uses a language called Nadsat to alienate the main character and his \\"droogies\\" from the rest of the world. If you have the capacity to read at a slightly higher level (like Shakespeare or Dante), or are enamored by the challenge, then this story will have you quoting it months after you're finished with it. And if you're IQ is above average you might even recognize the author's sporadic humor and sarcasm.Alex suffers from some kind of psychopathic disorder, and the society he lives in has incubated all the malice that lives within him. He is very clever, brave, witty, articulate, and not exactly what you would call a delicate flower.After the government experiments with a highly effective and novel rehabilitation method, Alex becomes an ideal citizen, but he suffers every day and wants to kill himself. His life becomes \\"Clockwork\\" and loses its purpose (I don't know where the orange part comes from).As you read it you will be confused as to how you are cheering on this menace, which kills, robs, and does other horrific activities. However, this is where Burgess' genius becomes apparent and makes the book a classic. You the reader experience what Alex experiences when he goes through the rehabilitation process, he starts feeling and doing things that are contradictory to his natural state of being, and hence becomes mere \\"clockwork.\\" Even though he is a malevolent character you yourself are in oppression of something greater and can't help liking him and hoping for his reincarnation so to speak.All of the characters are interesting and the encounters with one another are real. The only folly of the book is its 21st chapter. I don't know hat happened here but the book is pure magic until its last chapter, where it abandons its key premise and succumbs to social pressures and suddenly becomes politically correct. Nonetheless, the book is profound intelectual bliss-you can end with the 20th chapter and it makes complete sense.I recommend this book to anyone who is not superficial and is looking for a thoughtful experience. Please do not judge this book by its movie! This clich&eacute; was probably coined specifically for this book. The movie has a completely different ambiance and misses the artistic brilliance of the author. The book is probably 5 times more interesting, more entertaining, and much better.It's a great read, and will have you scratching your head by the end of the book, not because it's confusing, but because you can't put it down and thus have no time to shower.In My Humble OnionJohn G (Find Me Please)"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This is a striking peak into the future faintly paralleling the worlds that Orwell and Huxley foretold. The narrator and main character, Alex, leads his droogs (friends) to vandalism and anarchical acts. Burgess uses a slang language derivative of Russian that creates a strange futuristic tone. At first, the language made it hard to understand and read, but as one begins to indulge themselves in the story, the language is nearly non-existent. Burgess puts this group of kids against all the best wishes of society and they survive society's grasp. Burgess also uses parallelism of his future with our reality to show what might happen. Strangely enough, and quite ironic, Alex, the leader of a vicious group of street hooligans, finds favoritism in classical music such as Beethoven, Handel, and Bach. This contrast was obviously intentional to show the influence of the past in the near future. It is a great story that I quickly started reading and enjoyed every slash of Alex's britva and every beating of innocent bystanders. To enhance every brutal scene, Burgess uses a mix of dialog and narration. Burgess' use of strong language, a pioneer of his time, helps create an atmosphere of anarchical lunacy. I would highly recommend this book to anybody that can take a good old graphic novel filled with suspense and fun."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Anthony Burgess is not only a great storyteller, but a literary god. He invents a language and manages to translate it brilliantly without destroying the story. The book is perfect. It describes a horrifying moral society when the children take over at night. DO NOT WATCH THE MOVIE. Read the book it is much better and it includes chapter 21, the most important chapter. The book may scare you and the first few chapters may make you want to stop reading but the book is amazing. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I can easily rate this book the best I have ever read. Although this novel covers a very dark, terrible topic, it is joyful in a sense. I say this, because the narrarator writes and speaks with such a bouncy tone, expressing bad events as \\"a real horror show\\" and swears as \\"grahzny\\" and \\"vonny.\\" He regards himself as \\"your humble narrarator although he is really a psychotic terrible person. Some people might find this book just terrible and disgusting, but overall through the book, you realize just hpw bad ultra-violence is. The plainly bizzare plot hooks you and although really confusingly written, you will understand. Anthony Burgess writtens with many confusing words, but it is fun just to figure out what the words mean. I recommend this book to whoever envies strang plots and loves to read. If you find it slow, just stick with it and you will become the character in the book, feel his pain and suffering."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book rocks. It's basically a dystopian story about a future where England is a socialistic state that has a major problem with youth violence. It's told from the point of view of a young punk whom the state uses as a test subject in an expirimental crime control program.One of the coolest parts of the book is the language the narrator uses, called Nadsat, which is basically rhyming slang and Anglicised Russian. Apparently, in the future, Britain is losing the Cold War and falling into Russia's cultural orbit. The made-up slang of the book might be a little difficult for some, but you can usually understand it from context.I've got the 1965 edition (TERRIFYING SHOCKER OF A WORLD DOMINATED BY TEEN-AGE GANGS!) with the last chapter missing, a Nadsat dictionary in the back, and a picture of a motorcycle gang on the cover (even though there are no motorcycles in the book). The movie is pretty good, but I read the book before I saw the movie, and I think that compared to the movie, the book is a lot less sex-obsessed and does a better job of explaining stuff.If you liked 1984, Brave New World, Farenheit 451, etc., then give Clockwork Orange a try."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book is a landmark, legend, and icon. Burgess wrote in 1963 and it has been an iconoclasitc classic ever since. It's an exciting, innovative literary adventure that I think everyone should experience.Many people are put off by the slang that Burgess wrote this book in. In his introduction, Burgess said that this would happen because people 'are scared, rightly, of language.' I think that this book isn't too hard to read and the slang/nadsat makes the book more exciting and intelligent. This is one book written in the English language that will stretch your mind. However, once you have gotten the slang down, this book isn't difficult to read at all."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I read A Clockwork Orange to help with studying while I was taking Russian in college. (The slang used by characters in the book uses words similar to Russian.) I was pleasantly surprised by the story.The plot follows 15 year old juvenile delinquent Alex. He enjoys ultra-violence, a popular but illegal sport, raping women and girls, and classical music. Alex tells his story to us heavily laden with slang. The first person approach it kind of freaky because Alex is so... normal. Unlike the violent and sexual explicit movie, the book isn't graphic. What Alex is doing is more graphic than in the movie (at one point he rapes two nine year olds), but he doesn't describe it graphically. He just does what he thinks will be fun. If he sees something he wants he takes it As he explains stealing a car he likes is like picking fruit from a tree.Alex ends up arrested. He is offered early release if he goes through a \\"deconditioning\\" program. The program will deter him from crime. It works but it has unexpected side effects. His whole thought process at this point is disturbing since he still wants to rape and beat, but then he is also revolted by violence. He wants the deconditioning undone.This book is more of a pleasant curiosity than a must read. The movie kind of played up the deconditioning and simplified or focused things depending on how you look at it. The book has more issues, including a peaceful disturbing ending in which Alex lumps his violent tendencies with childhood. The book is also good conversations material."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange would have to be one of my favorite books of all time. It is an amazing story of a young boy, Alex, and his daily life as a child delinquent. The moral of the story, to me at least, is that one must choose to be good; it cannot be forced upon them. I recommend this book to anyone who can read it and get the gist of it. It is filled with it's own made-up language, so that is a bit hard to get used to at first. Read it!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"The highlight of this book is the invented language that the narrator speaks. The slang makes the Alex very imposing and makes the book a lot of fun to read, but this is where my praise ends.The main problem with the novel is that every few pages somebody gets up on a soapbox and talks about the importance of free will. Burgess should have let the reader figure that out on his own. A Clockwork Orange sometimes reads more like a pamphlet than a novel.Aside from my stylistic criticism I also have to disagree with Burgess' point about free will. The beginning of the novel sees Alex and his friends hospitalize innocent people, brutally rape and murder a woman in her home while they force her husband to watch, and commit other equally appalling acts of violence. The rest of the novel sees Alex himself get beat around, unable to defend himself. Personally I have no sympathy for him. Burgess should have toned down Alex's crimes in the beginning if he wanted the reader's sympathy. (Which he needs if the reader is to agree that Alex's punishment was somehow not warranted.)Finally, if you do read this novel, make certain that your edition contains the final chapter, which crucial to Burgess' argument that Alex did not require his radical treatment."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Why? That was the main question I seemed to be asking myself while reading Burgess' A Clockwork Orange. I had the same problem watching Kubrick's movie version made back in 1971. Why does young Alex act the way he does? He has normal and loving parents; he is a mere 15 years of age. His background just does not seem to mesh very well with how he is presented: a brutal, savage rapist and even killer.The story opens relentlessly with Alex and his hoodlum friends kicking the snot out of an innocent civilian. Next, they go to an innocent woman's house, rape and beat her to death. (Also bloodying up her husband). Finally, they break into another innocent woman's house, where everything goes wrong. Alex cracks her over the head a bit too hard and ends up killing her. He is immediately sent to prison. The police don't treat him too kindly, but who would?Alex, after spending a year in prison, gets sent (or rather volunteers) to be part of a new \\"experiment\\" in which violent criminals are cured of their inclination towards evil. They are forced, against their will, to watch violent and unspeakable films. Repeated viewings of these films lead the victim to a feeling of nausea and sickness. Soon, they have no desire to commit violence. I guess you can call it stripping away at human freedom and brainwashing.After Alex gets let out of this institution, he attempts to go back home. His parents reject him. Distraught, he wanders to a place where a bunch of old people are gathered together. Ironically, one of them is the same man Alex so ruthlessly beat up in the first part of the novel. He is recognized, and \\"attack of the senior citizens!\\" They all attempt to beat him up and scream for his blood. Give me a break. Next, he discovers one of his childhood hoodlum friends is now a cop along with his former enemy. They beat the tar out of him, of course, because nothing good can happen to Alex at this point.Next, he wanders to the same exact house in which he brutally raped and killed a woman earlier in the book. The man who answers the door does not recognize him though. He helps him clean his wounds, feeds him, and is compassionate towards him. He soon recognizes Alex, however, because of the unique slang language he used. He ties that language to the same villain who attacked him years earlier.After being shut up in a room, Alex can't take it anymore, and jumps out of an open window. He doesn't die, however. Soon after he is taken to a hospital where the doctors \\"correct\\" him and he becomes the same violent freak we have all learned to love from the beginning of the novel. He is cured. Hurray!! Society is outraged at how \\"unjustly\\" poor Alex was treated. Another bit of irony for you, the man of the wife Alex raped and killed gets sent away to an institution so he won't be anymore trouble to Alex. Oh the corrupt government gets its just punishment gets its due for doing what they did to poor old, violent, raping, murdering, old lovable Alex.Ugh. Where do I start? The most glaring thing that upset me about A Clockwork Orange is that because of the way it is written, we are supposed to sympathize with Alex. How can you? I also don't understand the question the novel asks us in an offhand matter, \\"Is it right to \\"reform\\" people by taking away their freedom to choose?\\" No, not for normal people it's not. Alex could have been sent to the electric chair for the things he did, in my opinion, so who really cares if they took away his freedom? I think he was better off as a mindless twit than a sadistic rapist. Did the people he raped and killed have a freedom of choice?IF Burgess would have explained a bit more the society in which Alex lived, maybe my questions would have been more properly answered. He does nothing to explain this ultra-violent society. I can't even picture this \\"nightmarish future\\" because Burgess does nothing to describe it. He also gives us no insight to why Alex acts the way he does. I couldn't get that out of my mind. I like the British ending a tiny bit better because it gives Alex a bit more human elements, opening the door for a possible future change. Maybe he is somewhat human after all, maybe all that violence did cause some regret. By this point, however, it is too late to really care.The only thing I really liked about this novel was Burgess' creative use of slang and jargon. He invents Alex's language. I like the creativity involved in that process, but unfortunately it can't save this mess. Too bad it couldn't have been used on a greater novel.I know this book is herald and praised all over the world, but even Burgess himself can not figure out why, (he says this in his introduction). Can I pity or sympathize with a character I know nothing about? Alex is as cardboard as characters get, aside from the creative, confusing language he uses. I know he likes Beethoven. What else? Hmmmmm.Also, can I picture a futuristic world that is not described? I learn nothing of this \\"ultra violent society, aside from the random acts of violence Alex and his friends commit. How can this be a fable of good and evil, when no good is shown? Listen to the sequence of events in this novel, a beating-a rape-a murder-another prison beating--violent films--abandonment-another beating-a fantasized rape-a bit of redemption.A Clockwork Orange is real hoax of a novel, it entices us to believe it is a thundering statement against forced mind control and restraints on human choice and freedom, but all it really does is rejoice in the viciousness of its \\"hero\\", Alex.Grade: C- (Orignial version)Grade: C (British version)"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I have seen the film adaptation ofA Clockwork Orange (Two-Disc Special Edition)maybe 20 times. The first time was nearly two decades ago. I just finished the book for the first time last week. The film guided me through most of the book, of course. However, one thing I never realized about the novel vs. the movie is that the language is so inventive and so interesting that it feels like a completely different story.Kubrick dropped some of the \\"Nadsat\\" language into his movie, sprinkling words here and there which most viewers would be able to pick up through context of a scene. But the book is absolutely saturated with Nadsat and English rhyming slang. I have heard throughout the years that this book can be a chore or difficult because of the language. I feel completely the opposite: the tricky slang and Nadsat make it a pleasure to read simply because it is a bit of a puzzle to solve.Comparisons of Kubrick's film and Burgess' book are not always fair. The former is a very loose adaptation of the latter, in my opinion. Kubrick's is a cynical gratuitous bludgeon, whereas Burgess' is a rich examination of a sociopath and social engineering.The moral at the end is rarely a reason to read a great novel. If that's what you're looking for, I can save you a few bucks and some time: this book raises the question of whether it is preferable to have violent elements of society be pacified by creating of them soulless machines or whether they should always have the choice to commit violence regardless of the social cost. There, time/money saved.However, if beautiful inventive prose and the journey to the endpoint are some things that still interest you, A Clockwork Orange is well worth picking up."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book was very good.

Dialect is rare and difficult to do well, and this is the best job I've seen of it since the Uncle Remus tales.As far as the philosophical ramifications of the novel, at first I'd say, heck yeah, brainwash those criminals into being pascifists. But then again, what if brainwashing criminals isn't enough for the government and every civilian becomes brainwashed to the point of being incapable of self defense?It's always tough to find a balance for this kind of thing. But you know, a society can only take so much pointless gang violence before resulting to drastic measures. You want to avoid a potential 1984 type future? You can start by not being a gang member.But actually, I like to ignore the violence and philosophy of the book and concentrate only on the futuristic slang.

Is a law abiding person still good if they have no free-will; if their mind has been altered so that they are incapable of violence?The novel is written from the perspective of 15 year old Alex, a charming sociopath who enjoys \`ultra violence'. Alex writes in a street slang of Burgess' own devising called Nadsat (although it is derived largely from Russian). This may be off-putting to some readers initially, but after a few pages you start to get the hang of it, and before long, you start to like it. (I am resisting the temptation to write my review using Nadsat).When the novel was first published in the US in the 1960's, the 21st chapter was not included. Burgess felt the final chapter was important but he needed money and agreed to have the novel published without it. The final chapter changes the tone of the novel. I have to say that I agree with the original American publishers. I found the final chapter a little too optimistic.Burgess wanted to present a world where there was hope that even criminal sociopaths can choose to be good without the state forcing goodness on them. I on the other hand, prefer the nastier (and I think) more realistic ending that the original US version gave us.Burgess felt that the real evil in A Clockwork Orange lay with the state (don't get me wrong, I'm not in favor of radical behavioral controls like the ones administered to Alex) and as a result, he seems to excuse Alex's violent behavior as if it were only a \`phase' he might outgrow.Because Alex is charming and because much of the violence is described in a strangely unfamiliar slang, the reader may be desensitized to it and may even sympathize with Alex (something I think Burgess wanted). In reality, Alex is a self absorbed sociopath who rapes little girls and beats little old ladies to death. Even after his reconditioning, he still wants to be violent (he just can't) and he shows absolutely no remorse for any of the crimes he has committed. Alex may or may not be able to change his behavior and 'choose good' but it's difficult for me to imagine that he is capable of feeling compassion or empathy, let alone find love.I prefer the sarcastic and cynical ending to Chapter 20. While Burgess may have intended the 21st chapter to give us hope, I actually think this chapter is the scariest part of the novel. The only thing more frightening to me than Alex roaming the streets with violence on his mind - is picturing him as a father.That would be a real horror show.Regardless of which ending you prefer, there is no doubt that this is a fascinating novel, well worth reading. Read it and reach your own conclusion."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"(This review covers the 21-chapter version.)A Clockwork Orange could so easily have been atrocious. Instead, it is a classic, and deservedly so. Burgess has crafted a brilliantly original novel, with a distinctive and unique cockney-Slavic idiom. Aside from the novelty, and the aesthetic innovations, A Clockwork Orange is also an enjoyable book to read. I got the sense whilst reading, however, that, in lesser hands, a novel with similar aspirations would most likely have fizzled into overly-self-aware pretension and gratuitousness. That Burgess pulled it off is testament to his talent.I do think that the 21st chapter seems a bit tacked-on, and the coda of the 20th, to me at least, is a better, more apposite ending. But this is a minor quibble, and most people like to end a book with optimism anyway."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange had me asking myself a lot of questions as I was making my way through it. I'm still asking myself these questions.\\"What's it going to be then, eh?\\"Is it better to be bad by choice or good because you're told to be?I can't help but think about the book even though I finished it a month or so ago. Certain scenarios are still racing through my mind and more than ever I am questioning the motives of the people that I interact with. Are they the Clockwork Oranges (with eggyweg in their tummywums) being good little soldiers for fear of the millicents paying them a visit?Am I?That said, this book is fantastic. The lingo that Burgess has invented is very tricky to get to grips with at first, but thankfully by simply understanding the context of unknown words one can easily grasp their meaning."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I first saw the movie and it was amazing, the language and the real life portrayal.

But I kept going and found out how ingenious Burgess really is. The language is challenging but provides insight into Alex and his droogs. It made it more interesting. The role the government takes in this is right for our time and the violence we see committed by youth is somewhat commonplace today. This book is powerful and even better than Kubrick's classic movie."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Today I read about yet another schoolyard massacre (how many have there been this year? Six already?) and once again, A Clockwork Orange comes to mind. How is it that we've forgotten that we humans are innately malevolent? In a society in which we can be &quot;fixed&quot;, there is no pressure to develop a culture of self-control or of channeling the impulse of &quot;might makes right&quot; into &quot;might for right&quot;.

God help us all."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange is one of my favorite books because as well as being entertaining, it touched down on some serious and little explored aspects of human nature. The undeniable fact that humans are prone to change is something the majority of us have not been taught. In fact, society teaches the opposite. We've been given heroes and villains, either the ultimate good or ultimate evil. Somebody had to correct this falsehood, and Burgess has done so with this book. Not only that, but he did so with a very entertaining and fun to read book."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I think that the book is all about the life of living.The way the words are used and the deatails of the fights and sex suff was written down.I would say with my rot that this is a book for peolpe that like diffrent stuff in thier life.I'am one of those peolpe,i get tierd of the same stuff over &amp; over again.Well if no one likes what i say,(if you read the book) ill turn off in the most horrorshow you'v never been in."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"'A Clockwork Orange' tells the story of Alex, a vicious criminal in a future England. Arrested for murder he is sentenced to a surreal form of aversion therapy which removes his capacity to commit violence. The book is written in a strange slang, 'nadsat', a combination of English and Russian. Despite his many violent acts, Alex emerges as a sympathetic character. He is intelligent and articulate. However after his brainwashing, he becomes little more than a machine (his favourite music, Beethoven's 9th, ends up making him sick). This is a very disturbing and thought-provoking book and is definiteley recommended."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Certainly affected by reading plenty of Nineteenth century Russian Lit. (see also F. Dostyevsky and L. Tolstoy), right down to the language (although not perfectly accurate), Burgess' &quot;ultraviolent&quot;, ultra-philosophic and -prophetic vision is much more readable than most of the novels which he based the framework on. I would recommend Dostyevsky's &quot;Notes from Underground&quot; (the Vintage Paperback edition, trans. Pevear and Volhinsky) for anyone who liked &quot;A Clockwork Orange.&quot; Not for the weak stomached, though."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"It was a very good book, which shows a human being put through numerous tests in which he encounters the one most important question this type of person could face: What have they done to me? I'm not capable of moral choice anymore. The language that he (Burgess) uses in the book is efective, although it gets confusing sometimes. For this, I would recommend searching for a &quot;dictionary&quot; of his vocab (NADSAT) and keeping it handy when you read. Once you get used to it, however, it is effective and backs up the moral of the story."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"The right to choose, even if it means choosing evil, is one of the most important philosophical aspect of our humanity and society. That is the point this book makes, and it is a point emphasized beyond all others in the USA's Constitution, and the Bible as shown in the story of Adam and Eve (they chose the apple and fell), some of the most important written guidelines of human conduct. The framework of the book is pure genius, the invention of a new vocabulary forces all readers to truly enter its world, taste it. Concepts of the chapter division, vocab, mindframe of the people, are all brilliant aspects of writing that provide new domains for writers to explore, which they should. The film adaptation should only be watched after the reading of the book."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A CLOCKWORK ORANGE....in my opinion...shows how one must conform to the societys standards of being right...they(society) dosent let you figure out the answers to your mistakes by yourself...buy by making the person a machine...not being able to defend themselves...not even being able to think of violence...whether they are creating it...or they are veiwing/reading it...they become uncapable to chose for themselves(Alex)...then...im not going to even hint at the controversial last few chapters....but it is and ending that makes u...well...actually me...say &quot;holy ****&quot;...sorry...but that is what i said...and i can keep goingjust to say i am sixteen years old... am not reading this over again...so if it dosent make sense...email me satims@yahoo.com ... and would b glad to help u with its explanation... if i have told too much of the story...sorry :("},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"When I read this book, I surprisingly had little difficulty with the difficult language.

I suggest renting the movie afterwards, because it is perhaps stronger than the book - something I rarely see in literature."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Beyond the philosophical issues around senseless violence, Burgess' narrative is extraordinary.

But it is the ideas that underlie these words that make the book great. The frightening vision of a world falling apart and of the horrible lives the teenagers, led by Alex, lead makes one wonder what might have happened if the Cold War had ended differently and what might happen if Americans give up their liberties for the good of The State. Even though we are past the time Burgess has set the novel in, we are not past the possibility of his book becoming a reality. If for no other reason, read this book to learn some interesting Russo-English slang, and learn about the human mind while you're at it."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book is veddy, veddy horrorshow, O my brothers.

If there is a more \\"Americanized\\" version in PRINT, I would suggest that first, since there isn't one for Kindle.Read a sample and you will see what I mean."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Exelent, one of the best books ever written. Anthony Burgess goes into the mind of the juvenile delinquent so vividly. great vilin to hero story."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Okay I admit it, like another reviewer before me, I was drawn to the books' sadistic side. If someone bans a book I sometimes have to find out WHY? In my high school about ten years ago, we were not allowed the choice to choose books such as &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;, &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot;, or &quot;American Psycho&quot;. I am 26 now and yes I became too curious and read them all. Definitely didn't make me a bad person. Would, (if I had) a 13 year old, allow he/she to read it too? Of course. Banning books just makes youth more curious. Anyway, I liked &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot;. It was wild to say the least. I was instantly attracted to the use of an almost &quot;foreign &quot; sounding language the boys used amongst themselves. I myself often wake up from dreams and realize that in them I was speaking in an unknown tongue....one my mind had created on its own. The first few chapters are hard to understand but once you memorize a few words here and there the lingo becomes more clear. Alex and his friends are delinquents. They drink &quot;milk&quot; which I immediately recognized as their drug of choice. They beat up old people without reason. They rape and even kill. They live vicariously, showing no conscience or remorse. They almost remind me of &quot;Jack&quot; and his pig-hunting pack from &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;-Just living on pleasure and animal instinct. I failed to finish reading &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot;, not because I didn't find it a modern masterpiece, but because the violence was more hard to stomach than some Stephen King novels. I finished at the point where Alex was kept in a &quot;hospital&quot; in attempts to reform him. These scenes in the book often brought back memories of Michael Crichton's &quot;the Terminal Man&quot;. If you read the book I know you understand. Someday I hope to stomach the book in its whole-even the edition with the exta chapter. I would give it the five stars I know it deserves, but I gave only three until I finish it someday cover to cover."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Great book. One of my top 10 of all time."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"AWESOME BOOK! THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST STORIES I HAVE EVER READ. IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork OrangeA Clockwork Orange takes place in England and was written by, Anthony Burgess, in 1962. The story is about this boy that is growing up in England, living with his parents by day and trying to rule the streets by night. The main character is named Alex and at night he rules the streets with his gang(droogs) causing chaos. He loves to get his hand on money or pretty poly as he refers to it. They have there own slang terms like rook which is hand and he uses the term, \\"O Brothers,\\" numerous times. At night he would go around robbing people and taking part in violent acts. Alex's dad suspected something when Alex brought home a lot of cash but, never accused Alex of anything. One night while the droogs were taking part in these violent acts, the cops finally caught up with them. Alex went to jail for the crimes that he had committed and was locked up at the age of fifteen. Jail didn't do him any good. There he even tried to fool the system by getting out early, but he wasn't ready to face the consequences of his actions. There he under went a detox experiment, only they weren't taking the alcohol out of him but, the violent side of him and trying to make him more humain in society. They finally release him back into society but he had nowhere to go and his family didn't really want him. There he went back onto the streets of England.I recommend this book because it settles all the hype that you hear about it but, I thought it would have been better than people said it was. I've heard people say that this book was too gross for them to read and it gives them goose bumps but, it's all hype. This book isn't as bad, if not less intense, as any movie out today. I don't think this book should have even been band in the sixties because it not really that vulger. This book was ok to read yet, it had its slower parts. I think the best thing about this book was that you kind of had to decode some of the phrases that Alex was trying to say. This book reminds me of a Shakespeare play, in that the langue is hard to understand. Unlike Shakespeare, you don't have to decode every line word for word, for the book to make sense. After a while you get a feeling for the langue that Alex's uses. This is what I like about the novel, trying to figure out what the character was trying to say. This made the novel better than it might have been. If they had this choice of books in high school, I would have rather read a book of this nature,to prepare me for novels like Mac Beth. If you think that you are going to read a novel filled with acts that are unheard, then maybe you should read another book. There is only one major shocker when he breaks into this ladies home after playing a nasty trick on her. This is a type of book that you should read through a second time to get the whole story, and to understand it completely. My thoughts were that this book was going to be a type of story that was taboo but, it was about as bad as brutal as someone getting mug, which happens everyday. Over all I would have to rate this book a five because I feel it didn't live up to the magnification"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"this book is an amazing feet of acomplishment. i mainly have a prblem with the reviewer who gave it a bad grade. your reasons where because you thought there where a million books like it, and better. why not try to rate the book based on THE BOOK for once? not based on why others like it. and how do you know what the aurthor likes or disslikes? i personaly loved it and have read some of these other books of &quot;yours&quot;, and thought they had an interesting new perspective on the subject as well. thank you all for your time."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book is real horrorshow!

It was unique and entertaining. The main character and his \\"droogs\\", or friends, are teenage criminals. They commit many crimes including stealing, vandalism, harassment, beatings, rape, and even murder. Alex is cold, mean and evil. He knows no good and all that he does is bad. He lives to destroy and cause pain. He and his \\"droogs\\" use English but with a very slang twist. I thought the slang made the book much better because it brought forth the challenge of finding out what the words meant. Alex finally gets caught in the act of a robbery and murder and his \\"droogs\\" betray him. He is sent to jail. After two years, he is sent to a different building to test a new way of correcting criminals. In this new technique, he is given an injection and is forced to watch extremely violent movies. The injection makes him react as a normal person would when exposed to such grisly images. The technique works on Alex so they release him. Whenever he even thinks of doing something violent, he gets a headache and becomes extremely nauseous. The people whom Alex hurt before he was sent to jail get their revenge on him and he cannot fight back or he will get sick. He then realizes what he did was wrong. Politicians then argue to the government that the technique enforced on Alex was cruel and inhumane. Alex then had the medicine taken from his body so that he was back to normal again. He had the choice to evil but he chose not to. He was a changed man. I loved this book so I give it five stars. I recommend it to anyone interested in what I just wrote"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Unless you have fair warning, A Clockwork Orange can be a startling novel.Yes, the slang can be hard to understand at times, yet it does not take away from the story. If anything, it adds to the gang like feel Burgess sought to convey. To tell the truth, I found myself using Burgess' made up words by the end of the book. The scary reality of this futuristic story makes the language even more powerful.The two contrasting ideas of the novel are so well presented that I found myself unable to actually decide which side to agree with. Is it better to choose whether or not to be evil or just to be good? Is free will really what makes us human? What was also a bit disturbing was the fact that I felt sympathy for someone as devilish as Alex. Burgess' incredible storytelling can be thanked for that. From the middle to the end I sympathized then empathized with the little droog.I recommend the novel, especially now in light of recent developments in the world, however I do not recommend the movie. Seeing the movie is not enough, for it does not do the novel justice in the slightest. I do not understand why it received as much acclaim as it had. I find it ironic that the one book Burgess really didn't like, turned out to be his most famous. It was good, not spectacular, but definitely a must read for anyone who likes stories along the lines of Brave New World (I did enjoy Aldous Huxley's masterpiece far more than I enjoyed A Clockwork Orange, though they both have certain un-ignorable similarities). I picked up this novel without having any idea what it was truly about. I did read summaries and things of that nature, but those can only tell you so much. It is the sort of literary work that one needs to read oneself in order to get the full effect."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I first heard about this book from my best friend. He said the movie and book were both unbelievable, so i decided to give it a try. I loved the book. It is one of the few books that i love, and not one of the many that I like. It is unique in its style, and content. I loved the use of language by Anthony Burgess; it made me think about each event even more. The story line was great, and i felt it had a positive message, even after all the violence that was incorporated into the book. It tells of growing up and how being your own person is important. I would recommend this book to anybody, preferably over the age of 14 because of the violence and use of language. But i feel the message portrayed is important for people of all ages, and especially teenagers. i rate it a five."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Clockwork Orange is an unusual, but great book. Some of the language is hard to understand because the characters use slang from England in the 60's. Alex, the main character who narrates the book, is very interesting. He is the leader of a gang of his friends called the Droogs. Alex and the Droogs go on their missions nightly to drink milk laced with drugs, beat people up, steal from people and rape women. Parts of the book are somewhat disturbing, especially when he beats up an old man, but it keeps the reader riveted to the book. Once some one starts the book and figures out all the crimes Alex has committed you almost have to keep reading to see what he does next. This book has a lot of twists and turns and is very unpredictable. Clockwork Orange is a book that is great if you aren't scared to read it."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Burgess writes in 1962 a very disturbing book, taking Alex through the experience living as a youth, committing as a member of a gang, burglaries, rapes, and finally being caught by the police. Alex Suffers more than he believes he should have, his friends as traitors, the government experiments, and the crimes he committed in his previous years. Everytime he sees a break, everytime it backfires on him and takes him to more sickness and suffering.Burgess gives his idea of how the future could be, he draws an ugly, may be a reastic picture, of how things work in the modern world. The book could be disturbing from time to time, but it keeps you glued to see how the future would unfold itself.You should have the heart to read such a book, it could be that real."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"One of the most unforgettable novels I've ever read. Anthony Burgess' predictions of the future (written in 1962) have not come far from the truth. This novel is a disturbing reflection on the basic structure of our society, on our government and on what it means to be good and evil. In a world where science has the power to turn flawed human beings into perfect machines, one must wonder whether it is moral to turn sadistic individuals into a good doing robots for the sake of preventing crime.Those of you who have seen Kubrick's film, read the novel just for the sake of finding out what the title means!If you do chose to read this book, make sure to read the European version, which contains the 21st chapter. Personally, I found the chapter to be unnecessary and unfitting to the dark tone of the novel. It seemed like a forced happy ending to a very dark story. It almost contradicts all the statements Burgess makes about the human race throughout the book. Nevertheless, I recommend that you read it anyway so you could make up you own mind."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Forget that stupid, overrated movie! This book is where it all began, and it's just as poignant now as it was when it was first published.When addressing the problems of crime, evil and violence, most people (conservatives and liberals alike), would prefer the \\"pop-the-pill\\" remedy of making people conform to the standards of \\"good\\". Unfortunately, it's not that easy, and this book proves that. Alex, the murderous droog, is put through a program that will remove the \\"evil\\" from him. But as we eventually see, he's worse off without the ability to choose good. Without his free will, he has become \\"a clockwork orange\\", because he does good not because he wants to, but because he has to. Simply brilliant!One problem is the \\"Nadsat\\" dialect it's written in. Sure, it's ingenious use of language, but it gets old fast. It does not detract from the book, however! But the best thing in here is the fact that Alex, who commits rape, murder, assault, and theft, is a huge fan of classical music, especially Beethoven. That oughta show \\"in-your-face\\" to those bozos who think rock and metal cause violence.Read this book: prepare to be shocked. And enlightened!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I had first heard about this controversal novel through the constant padories and tributes of the film adaption. I wanted to see the film for a long time, but it soon gave way to me reading the novel before I saw the film.Please note, the book and film are TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT VERSIONS. In best intrest, I suggest reading the novel and igorning the film. Kubrick's version is a wonderful peice of work, but I felt robbed of that feeling I had after I had finished the novel, so I regret seeing the film.Onward, shall we? The plot deals with a teen rebel named Alex, who, along with his gang of \\"droogs\\", terrorize the streets of London by raping, killing and barging into homes of those whoever they wish. Suddenly, Alex is left in abandonment by his friends and is arrested in a failed break-in. He is sent to a faclity to undergo a radical experiment inwhich he is \\"reprogramed\\" into a model citizen.Burgess' novel is grand and explores the meaning of a person's personalty and well-being. He also states the questions Is it right to control a person's personality and his free will; as well as the set up of such a program, is is right to do so? While the vocabulary is often confusing and can leave the reader dumb-founded, Burgess based it on the slang of the British and the Russians, which has promted many to formate their own lists of translations, which are proven helpful.The novel left me amazed and pondering those questions for the longest of time.

All the vesches he commits with his worthy droogs are like govoreeted in the first person, so you get the full effect of being one of the gang and stealing and tolchoking and slurping white moloko and slooshying lovely Ludwig van. But alas, poor Alex is betrayed by his droogs, and gets caught all on his oddy-knocky for a crime they commited. He gets sent to a prison where it's all like boo-hoo boo-hoo and no more listening to Ludwig van, oh my brothers. Then our poor narrator gets out, only to be treated to the terrible Ludovico vesche. They give him the hypo and force him to viddy films, terrible vonny bits of ultraviolence. And he gets sick from the needle but he like associates it with the gratchny films they're forcing on his young innocent weepy glazzies. Our poor droogie Alex is set free, but violate can he not, for he has been conditioned--now he feels the needles when he viddies anything like in the films. Depending on which version of this story you get, our droog will either be doomed or saved in the end..."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"The novel begins: \\"'What's it going to be then, eh?'There was me, that is Alex, and my three droogs, that is Pete, Georgie, and Dim, Dim being really dim, and we sat at the Korova Milkbar making up our rassoodocks what to do with the evening. . . .\\"With that, the action begins as Alex and his three thugs go out for action, ultraviolence, and the like. This is a portrayal of England at some future point. While much of the focus on this book has been conditioned by Stanley Kubrick's stunning movie, the central point is the society versus the individual. After his depredations finally bring him to \\"justice,\\" Alex is subject to treatment that rids him of his violent behavior--at the cost of taking away his personality (and, as an unexpected consequence, his ability to enjoy Beethoven).In a sense, then, this novel is about a dystopia. This version, apparently, is closer to the Kubrick version; the ironic final chapter is missing. This version ends as Kubrick's movie did, with Alex \\"cured\\" of the conditioning that took away his individuality, with the final line being: \\"I was cured all right\\" as he listened to Beethoven without pain. The 21st chapter, as noted, leaves one with a far different feeling at the close of this classic.It takes a while to get used to the language used by Alex and his peers, a mixture of Russian and English (for the most part). There is a glossary at the end, which is helpful. For instance, devotchkas are girls; tolchok is hitting or pushing; nozh is knife. In the end, a powerful work."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I'll preface this review by saying that before I read the book I had seen the movie, so I did have some prior knowledge disposing me as I delved into this fine piece of literature.The movie is a wonderful interpretation of the book, but, like most instances when a book is converted into a movie, the movie does not fully capture the book's raw, unbridled brutality nor the intensity of its incisive criticism of totalitarianism, profligate consumerism, and youth culture, nor does it raise quite the same questions regarding the ethics of controlling morality.The book is narrated through the eyes of Alex - recalcitrant youth extraordinare. He and his gangs he tenderly calls \\"Droogs\\" galivant around, inciting chaos, creating mayhem, and carrying out heinous acts of violence that they convey through a rather facetious slang called nasdat. The slang itself is indicative of their situation - it's ironic, brutal, and a bit unsensical and serves to mitigate the overt cruelty of their acts, which, until part two, range from beatings, theft, and even rape which they execute with a disturbing enjoyment. However, a deeper examination of Alex's character reveals perhaps Burgess' intended assertion: Modern youth culture is defined by its meaningless shenanigans (in this case amplified to the extremes of violence, however the droogs do not see it as such), a shallow morality, an egocentric personality, and a seemingly meaningless purpose in life. Burgess only intenifies such a culture through the book's autocratic government. Each adult is forced to work, life has little to no significance in the grand scheme of things. Indeed, Alex's morality is implied to be corrupted via his vapid future.Alex's fortunes shift after he is arrested and convicted of murder following a raid of an affluent old woman. However, he finds his niche in prison, and endears himself to the prison's chaplain, and is afforded utilities that other prisoners are not. Ironically, Alex's prison setting is almost idyllic for him - a stark contrast to the gritty streets in which he ruled. Yet, a new prisoner is implemented into Alex's cell, and a subsequent brawl leads to another indictment of murder for Alex.His following punishment serves as Burgess primary form of commentary on the totalitarian state. Alex is subjected to psychological conditioning by association. By pairing savage scenes with a nausea inducing serum, Alex is inculcated to have an averse biological reaction when he thinks of violence - and tangentially, classical music which he adores. The novel's central theme is henceforth revealed - Is it ethical to restrict the free impulses of man if it benefits society as a whole?Without revealing too much of the rest for those of you who have not read it yet, Alex's apparent cure is not all that it seems.All in all this was a tremendous book to read, and I quite enjoyed it. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys dystopic type settings and novels whose themes deal with broader social issues. Be warned however, it is not for the squeamish nor the faint of heart. A Clockwork Orange is one brutal, yet satisfactory read."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I first heard about A Clockwork Orange around my college campus, a banned book made to film by the great Stanley Kubrick. The movie poster presented a violent psychedelic trip from the 60's, and I was deeply intrigued, immediately attending a showing during the weekend. That experience prompted me to find the book as soon as possible. The author Anthony Burgess writes in his introduction (and this is paraphrasing) that he makes no affiliation to Kubrick's interpretation, and rightly so. This edition of the work contains the 21st chapter that was originally cut from printing and later in the film adaptation. Unjust! Reality takes the grand finale in the life of the \\"humble narrator, Alex\\" and the 21st chapter symbolizes the natural change from adolescence into adulthood, deep into the unknown. It does not provide hope, only speculation, as Alex finds futility in the \\"shopcrasting\\" and \\"ultraviolence\\". This is the real \\"horrorshow\\", this edition and comments from it's \\"humble\\" author. Enjoy the \\"old in-and-out\\" Burgess works on your mind and the classic language \\"Nasdat\\" as you read about Alex, the clockwork orange."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"When I first picked up A Clockwork Orange I was immediately confused. I read the first couple of pages and had no clue what the hell was going on but I kept reading - AND THANK GOD I DID! Once I caught on to the slang (which didn't actually take too long) I couldn't put the book down. A Clockwork Orange will literally grab you and pull you into the story and won't let go! This book is everything from hilarious to terrifying and everything in between. And it makes you think! What more could you want in a book? Now stop reading reviews and pick up A Clockwork Orange!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"One of the most misrepresented novels in 20th century literature, \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is best remembered for the Stanley Kubrick film of the same name. Set in the near future (from 1962), the Britain it portrays is a liberal socialism with a repeatedly elected government. The anti-hero of the work is 15-year old Alex, a fairly bright lad but lacking any moral values (no redeeming qualities). Like many in his group he hooks up with fellow sociopaths into a criminal gang that beats, robs, rapes, and eventually murders their way through a bleak landscape. It is a culture, strangely familiar, where people prey on one another, or get preyed upon.Young Alex is eventually caught in the act of murdering a wealthy aged widow in attempting to rob her. His power play in gang politics forced them to set him up and he was convicted for fourteen years in State Jail... After less than two years an opportunity presents itself with the emergence of a new technology claiming that criminals can be permanently rehabilitated within a fortnight. After much manipulation Alex is selected as a candidate for the treatment. It turns out to be behavior modification of a particularly nasty sort, but Alex is released, with the promise that he is a new man, entirely prophetic. There is debate over man's capacity for goodness and moral choice, seen from liberal Christian vs. pragmatic viewpoints. After a series of misadventures Alex's past comes back with a vengence, forcing him to attempt suicide with the support of the government's enemies.Where most interpretations of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" go wrong is to base their assumption on the movie. Colourful, glitzy, with a stirring soundtrack, the first twenty minutes of the film stick in the mind and all the subtleties of the novel are left unobserved. The argument is over the right of the individul to make a moral choice. Pavlovian dogmas that assume society and it's representatives should overrule objections to their role in guiding men forget about fascism and communism. Author Burgess was well aware of the abuses of power and it's role in a \\"free\\" society. When man loses the choice to make a moral decision, he loses the essence of what makes a human being. This work should be seen as a modern sequel to Orwell's \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" and a seminal representation of science fiction. This edition includes a glossary for the slang used by the teens in the work. It is a mix of Russian and Gypsy, with added English derivatives. Short, intense, and to the point."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"PS~ 20 NOT 21 CHAPTERS! ((( American Version)))This is NOT the original Anthony Burgess 21 chapter version.The American version (20 chapters) was adapted byStanley Kubrick for the film, which ends quite differently.[...]Read the REAL DEAL!Jaime Pico"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I thought this book was going to suck. Mainly because every time I would attempt to watch the movie I would fall asleep, and never even get past his time in jail. So I decided to try and read it, and it was great. I had the edition with the final chapter that was once edited out in the American versions, so there is a different ending for the book, which I think made me ultimately like the book more than the movie.The language was a little hard to get through in the beginning but once you get a hang of the words it's a lot easier. Also if you go on Sparknotes.com they have a glossary of what all the words mean. But by that time, I had already figured them out for myself. I would recommend this book, but I would suggest reading it before watching the movie."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"the novel is a great read, but i need to make a few notes. You definately need to understand, or have nearby a translator(website or dictionary), basic russian and proper english. otherwise some of the meanings of words will get lost, of course use the sentences as context for the meaning, but it helps to have it by nontheless. the russian words were put in as a political reference to communism and russian, and how the author felt it would have moved into english culture."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I had \\"viddied\\" this \\"sinny\\" many times at a young age \\"Oh my brothers\\" and it was real \\"horrorshow\\" but I had never read the book. Let me tell ya... the language takes a bit to sink in. Even at the end of the book there were bits and pieces that I had to mentally translate to myself. Burgess wrote this from the POV of Alex, a nasty little 14 year old who enjoys theft, burglary, assault and battery, rape and then the dabbles into manslaughter. I say manslaughter because I don't believe that Alex and his friends intended to kill anyone, they just laid on the beat down a bit too hard.Oh, and Alex speaks directly to us... the readers, who he refers to as \\"my brothers\\" but Alex speaks in a slang that I hear is a mish-mash of Eurasian languages, particularly a lot of Russian thrown in. It takes a while for your brain to process this language. It's not hard to figure out through context what each of the words means, but it will certainly slow down your reading. The version I read was 149 pages (the original European publishing that DID include the final chapter) and it took me close to a week to finish it. Now I had been told that this was an ultraviolent book... and at the time it may have been... but I didn't find it to be any more violent than \\"In Cold Blood\\" or some other classics that I was encouraged to read. However, the book keeps referring to the goings on as \\"ultra-violence.\\" True there are several beatings, a knife fight, a few rapes, drug use, etc... but with the mental translation it took to figure out exactly what was occurring... sure I knew it was wrong, but it didn't \\"horrify\\" me. Then again I grew up in an age where this kind of thing actually does happen. I believe that when this was written, they had a belief that the world was a better place than those of us from later generations believe.The underlying theme is the question of - if you could force someone to be good... force them to only be capable of doing the right thing... is that good? Or is it better to allow them the option to do evil, provided they have options. What is the \\"Christian\\" thing to do in this case? Would God be pleased to see his creations only doing good when they have no choice but to do it? There are other themes running amok through this book, childhood, growing up, the violence inherent in the system, and the futility of rehabilitating prisoners when our prisons are overcrowded and unmanageable to name just a few. There is a lot of meaning in this book, if one can manage their way through it. Some will be turned off by the difficulty of reading the made up language, others will be turned off by the violence... but those who make it through certainly are left with quite a few tidbits to mull over in their minds. I would suggest reading this with someone, or a group, because I assume that the most enjoyment can be reached by really discussing this book with someone. Good luck, enjoy and know that this is a very interesting, vile, yet purposeful book."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Written during the height of the Cold War in 1962 this famous Burgess novel looks towards an England dominated by the Soviet Union. The grim Soviet England of the twenty first century is ruled by a puppet Labor Party bent on restoring order at any price. The price is the adoption of compulsory brain surgery to control rampaging, restive youth crazies who threaten the stability of the state.State-provided hallucinogenic milk apparently does not pacify the youth gangs that plague London. Alex and his \\"droogs\\" become the unwilling experiments in the state's surgical pacification scheme. CLOCKWORK raises the question of whether free will or state madated determinism rules the human soul in a dramatic showdown between priest and commissar. As in WANTING SEED, medicine becomes the grim handmaiden for the state and a constant nemesis for the prolife Burgess.This book works well as linguistic fiction with the future culture of England defined by the newspeak of Russian/cockney slang. We visit CLOCKWORK'S crumbling, socialist England as witnesses to its unique newspeak language defined in a glossary at the end of the book. The slang puts us in scene. CLOCKWORK is classic dystopia and succeeds where its sister dystopia WANTING SEED, also written in 1962, fails.The american book edition drops the last chapter as does the movie, but it is here for you to read. The reflective Alex decides to grow up and apparently look for a wife to propagate his kind as society has been supressed. As in ONE HAND CLAPPING we are left in a moral desert created by the working class and the mass culture that allows them to flourish. The elitist Burgess would have nothing less.The Wanting Seed (Norton Paperback Fiction)"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"seriously an awesome book. i could not put it down and nerdily finished it in two dayshaha....many people think that the \\"nadsat\\" slang makes it very hard to read but it really doesnt...it brings you more into the story and makes it more realistic imo, different generations have different slang, a young gangster might use yo and nigguh [just giving examples i love black people haha] while an elderly man might say...youngster or...whippersnapper [biased there im not close with any old men so i wouldnt know for sure]and anyways you get used to it and if you can connect fruit and a picture of an orange you will get it in a couple of chapters. ok on to the story....easily one of the best out there, it was very original and...gritty is the only word i can find...it doesnt leave much for you to imagine.the characters are very memorable and make you really feel for them [and hate them at some points] [ok many points]. it has two deep meanings [depending on the edition you get] *****MAYBE SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!***** one being that people are bad and always so, dont trust anybody, and do whatever it takes to do what feels right to you. the other one= everybodys really good on the inside and you just need to grow up and out of your stupid kid ways. either one is good but i recommend the latter its how its supposed to be read haha. wonderful book, definitely a must read for anyone [maybe not small children] and thats all i gotta say! thankss"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I bought this book a few years ago and started.. and quickly stopped reading it, probably around 4 or 5 or maybe 6 times.

Last night I got a little down and wanted to escape...so I went to my bookcase and couldn't find anything quite right to read, everything was too...nice...so then i saw \\"A Clockwork Orange\\"...I was so depressed, bored, and down, i didn't give up on the book because i was honestly so annoyed with my current predicaments that i didn't really care just wanted to get my mind off things, ya know? so i began reading...and reading...and reading some more...i passed that line i never got over...and let me tell you, though the book is hard to understand at first, the book really is a little brilliance of a thing. some people write for the sake of their own imagination, some people write to let out their feelings, some people write because they WANT to be brilliant, but he wrote something intricate and with purpose and he also wrote something that really tricked you into thinking about..things. he is brilliant because he was so clear in purpose and pure. it was very natural. and i ended up loving nadsat (the lang. that confused me at first) my bit of advice in capital letters in case no one wants to read this...PUSH YOURSELF THRU THE FIRST FEW CHAPTERS, AND YOU WILL BE HAPPY AND JOYFUL. :)"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"No matter how many books I've read, A Clockwork Orange has been and I believe always will be my favorite book of all time. First and foremost, it is different from any other book you will read, ever. The first time I read it, I put it down halfway through because it was so difficult to follow. Anthony Burgess does a complete 180 on the English language (not something uncommon for him I have come to find out) and the characters in it speak in a made-up language throughout the entire book. Being me and hating to leave a book unfinished no matter how terrible it is, I had to come back to it some 6 months or so later and start re-reading it from the beginning. You start picking up the language that is used and the book becomes one of those can't-put-it-down, makes-you-rethink-your-life sort of book.The main characters are early teen gang members who do some pretty horrifying things, yet when you read it you're not as horrified as you think you should be because you can sense that these are just kids and they don't understand the gravity of what they're doing, they think they're just having fun. They beat up the homeless, break into people's homes and rape innocent women, all in the name of good fun. Then they go home, drink some milk, listen to music, and don't think twice about the things they've done. But then on the other hand, that is exactly what IS so horrifying about it. A part I like about it also is that these kids are not getting drunk or using drugs and then going out and ruining their lives, this is just the way they are, they actually enjoy it. Anthony Burgess does a great job of not letting you think of these kids as perverted juvenile delinquents, you can't help but like them, and sometimes feel sorry for them.This book is well worth the effort that must be put forth to enjoy it- If you have trouble halfway through, start over, YOU WON'T BE SORRY."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Of course the book came before the movie, but if you fell in love with the movie like I did, reading the book is even more love. I'm glad Stanley omitted the prison murder and the teacher mugging. However I think adding the last chapter to the movie would have been better. So Alex could be shown to loose interest in mayhem somewhat."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Just finished reading this book maybe 10 minutes ago and I wish I picked this book up ages ago.

Infinitely better than the movie. It has some political viewpoints related to government interference into the lives of citizens for 'the better good'.

I've never read anything else like it. This one will definitely stick with you."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"To say that A Clockwork Orange is a \\"controversial\\" piece of media is an understatement: militant feminists and \\"family values\\" activists have gone so far as to remove this book from library shelves. It has been hailed as genius satire and denounced as violent exploitation. Some read it as Burgess's own depraved rape fantasies. Other people will argue that it's an attempt to get into the heads of the young men who gang-raped his pregnant wife. Others read it as a piece of chaotic, post-modern art to be appreciated by the edgy and the hip.A Clockwork Orange may be all of those things and more. What it is most of all, however, is an amazing, sweeping, page-turning read.Burgess takes the reader inside the mind of Alex, the leader of a small youth gang, all of whom enjoy nothing more than imbibing mind-altering substances, giving women a bit of the old in and out (whether they like it or not) and beating up the poor. This all changes, however, when Alex is arrested and given the chance to participate in an experiment to cure his sociopathy and turn him into a fine, upstanding member of society.While Alex's violence and the moral quandary posed by the experiment form part of the sick, prurient excitement of the book, none of it would work nearly as well without Alex's cynical and humorous tongue-in-cheek narration, told in a fictional Slavic-inspired slang language that may be difficult to comprehend the first few pages, but soon becomes readily clear.With Alex, Burgess takes the anti in anti-hero to new levels, to the point where he can barely be called a hero if not for the fact that his observations and asides are strangely and hilariously charming."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I am going to start off by saying that this book is not for everyone. I repeat: IT IS NOT FOR EVERYONE!!! If you are offended by violence and other \\"adult situations\\" then you will not like this book. It is also an intensely difficult read for the first chapter or so. This is due to the fact that Anthony Burgess invnented his own kind of slang, through which the story is narrated by the central character, Alex. There is no glossary so re reading is a necessity if you're going to enjoy this book, simply to figure out what the language means. For a book written almost 50 years ago, it is quite a ways ahead of its time. The way all of the characters can be loathed and loved at the same time is just mind boggling. Even Alex can be felt sorry for after he is subjected to the government's rehabilitation program. To sum it up, amazing, but not for the faint of heart."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I had seen the Kubrick film about a gazillion times, and finally broke down and read the book. Glad I had. The opening line of the book instantly caught me, and did not let go till the last hair raising sentence.Before going off on the story, I want to comment on Burgess' intense writing style, which has reshaped my own view of what writing should be. In addition to the Slang used by Alex (Nasdat) There is a wonderful natural fluidity to his language that grips the reader instantly.The plot, it seems, is intertwined so that reader must identify with any one particular person at a time, but this changes rapidly. At one point you find yourself loving the character Alex, then the next moment you realize he's a total jerk! The police are appreciated till their evil is revealed. The old man F. Alexander seems to be compassionate till you realize he plans to kill Alex. You want to smack Alex's parents for not having raised their kid right, yet you pity them for fearing their own sons evil tendancies. It's bothersome because you don't have any character that you can latch onto.Alex is evil. Let there be not mistake. The state is evil. The kind old man is evil, driven so because of Alex. By the end the evil has not left. It just simply went through a cycle. In short, this book scared the crap out of me, Bog blast it!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I did not like this book at all until I reread the first few pages. I had to actually go back and read them over after putting the book down. I then read the whole hting in one sitting. I do not think everyone will like this book but I think if you can read it it is worth the read. My point is that although difficult to read it is worth the struggle."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I got this book at some cheap used book section; simply because it was cheap and I remember seeing the film as a kid but I didn't really remember it that well. The William Burroughs recommendation on the back of my edition didn't harm either.A bit shallow start but I wasn't expecting a thing and that propably helped alot. As I started reading I went, after a few unknown - to me - russian looking words &quot;what the hell is this?&quot; But the brilliant black humor came right on the first page and that's how I got to know a book that I can read anytime with the same pleasure (if not more) as the first time.By far the best book I've ever read - and I've read ALOT of books that have similar elements but the wordplay is so special that no book comes close. It's got everything in it, this neat little novella: black humor, satire, insane violence, a new language and even some prophetic statements.If you like this one I recommend &quot;the wanting seed.&quot; It's also by Anthony Burgess. That one is a futuristic dystopian novel/la.

Its paradoxical name refers to its political overtones. A story about an English boy overcome with hedonistic and violent tendencies. He is treated by the system and trained to become sick when his evil tendencies arrive. Like many writers of his time, Burgess metaphorically communicates a portrail of our own society. The Clockwork is a hint towards the mechanical workings of our socitety; with its regular schooling, social groupings, criminal control and government. The Orange hints towards the rather live working members inside this mechanical evironment; being the people. The book give question to our larger purpose and mening, testing the bowndries of right and wrong, and moral norms. A clockwork Orange remains a classic in our generation and will remain for generations to come."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Quite an opening line, eh? And Anthony Burgess didn't stop there. He creates an atmosphere, an entire surreal environment that I both knew could not exist but wondered if it might be possible.Each of the three sections of the book open with this ambiguous line, &quot;What's it going to be then, eh?&quot;, and with each usage I came up with a new interpretation. Example A: the first portion of the book is spent watching 15-year-old Alex and his gaggle of friends take out their aggression on nearly everyone they meet. A man walking down the street is beat so badly he bleeds and can't get up off the street, simply for being a &quot;teacher-type&quot; and carrying an armload of books. Burgess uses this repetitive opening line as bait...I had to keep reading just to find out what shape it might take on the next time around.One of the most amazing aspects of this book was the language. Burgess creates his own vocabulary, replacing random English words with his own concoctions. Alex didn't have friends, he had &quot;droogs;&quot; they didn't drink a little at the bar, they drank a &quot;milenky&quot; bit. Sure, it takes a while to figure out just what in the heck Alex is doing or saying, but it's well worth it.So, to make this short and sweet, read the book, be stumped by the vocab, try to not be too appauled by the violence, and decide for yourself what that opening line means."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. It was a little awkward that I found myself really enjoying this book. The content is very disturbing, but the way Burgess writes, makes it absolutely fascinating. Burgess uses a type of Russified slang that takes a little bit of reading to get used to, but don't let that stop you. Some of the books have dictionaries of the slang words, but I'd recommend not using it. One of the best parts of this book is that you find yourself able to understand what he is saying even though you don't quite understand the language. It is also interesting how the sections of the book mirror each other. There are a lot of recurring events that happen over the course of the book to look for, while reading it. And if you have read the earlier American version of the book, that only has 20 chapters, be sure to pick up the newer version with the complete 21 chapters. That goes for the movie as well, it was made based on the 20 chapter version of the book, so it's a good idea to read the book with all 21 chapters, if you have already scene the movie. That last chapter adds a whole new spin on the book.Burgess also explores some very deep political themes. The idea of Ludovico's technique, which is mentioned in the book, shows Burgess's views on Skinner's behaviorist theory, which can also be applied to Communism. This book is very thought provoking and brings up a lot of controversial issues that can be great class discussion topics."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange takes place in a futuristic England, centering around a teenage gang. Their leader, Alex, is our narrator, as he lets us join in on the gang's adventures, which mostly center around &quot;ultraviolence&quot; such as rape, beatings, very sick jokes where someone ends up severly damaged, etc. On one of these outings they make their way into a middle-aged woman's house and Alex ends up killing her and is caught by police. If I say anymore I will give away the book, so I will stop now.This is definitly my favorite book ever. I read it for the first time while at Camden Military Academy. It was the original American edition, plain orange cover, no special design, only 20 chapters (the American publisher didn't seem to really like it, telling Burgess he should be lucky to have even 20). It was a torn, forgotten book lying beneath one of the shelves at the school's library. Burgess, as usual, plays around with language in this book, creating the &quot;Nadsat&quot; language, a combination of German and something else, which is the slang language of teens and the lower class in the times of the future in England.This book also, I think, satires government control, because they &quot;reform&quot; Alex in some sick way, but if I explain it I will give it away...I truly reccommend this book to anyone that likes to think, and isn't offended by horrible violence taking place while someone sings &quot;Singin' in the Rain.&quot;This was a hard review to write... you just have to read the book to get it."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"No book has captured the disillusionment and separation resulting from the schizm formed of technological advancement and cultural devolvement like 'A clockwork Orange' has. Quite simply put, it is a not too distant future of ours. As technology breeds increased comfort and increased isolationism, it also breeds racism, hatred and desensitization. This near 40 year old book really captures this feeling, daring to the reader to attempt to define 'free will' in a world in which all images and content are provided for you and have a singular semiotic meaning. In light of our all too common subway shootouts, our random executions and a penal system spiraling out of control (all things happening relatively recently), it is amazing that Burgess could so accurately cast a world of rave clubs, X, random abuse and Ikea furniture.This version has the 'controversial' 21st chapter, and let me say the controversy really lies on the choice of the idiot editor who removed it in the first place. It sums up so much and adds an interesting twist to the theme of the book.If you are between the ages of 16 and 45 and consider yourself to have a social conciousness, this is THE must read book."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"The Kubrick movie won Best Picture, and it deserved it. But you should read this book because the language-Nadsat-is beautiful, once mastered. Of course, the story is important for us today because much of Burgess' predictions of the &quot;near future&quot; have come to pass.Open your newspaper and you will find Alex's droogs are alive and well in your neighborhood.As a political/morality tale, it is a classic.Kubrick really couldn't explain Alex as well as Alex can, even though there is some necessary narration in the movie, or else the Nadsat spoken would not be understood.So,buy it and enjoy! Let &quot;Your Humble Narrator&quot;(Alex) explain all!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"(...) This book is not just a blob of violence and rape, it is a fascinating narrative into the lives of a teenage gang who find pleasure in the illicit acts of rape and murder. I recommend this book to anyone who can stand the graphic language of this novel. Check out the movie if you get the chance."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"It is hillarious what Mr. Burgess made of the language in the book. Most of those words are Englishised Russian words or Russianized english words. The book itself, although really violent, has great philosophical value and should be considered a classic."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book is very interesting form the first page until the last. The author jumps right into the story and gets his readers hooked. The strongest aspect of this book is the appeal of the story line. The other elements that contribute to the books sucess are foreshadowing, different dialects and the strong characters. This book uses language that is unique to it and while it is a little hard to follow in the early pages soon the slangs used are easily rembered. Also the well developed characters add a new dimension to the book.This book intrests, appalls, and stuns all at once. The actions of the narrator and his frinds are often so extremely violent it's sickening. The concept that is the hardest to swallow is how the characters of the book could act so horribly. The book takes a deeper look at what youth is coming to. All the extreme actions that are taken all to entertain this young man through out the book takes a good hard look at the narrators psyche. This book is not a light afternoon read, it is an intense disgusting and intriguing well written piece of literature."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Most people probaly only know about this book because of the Kubrick movie. This book is so my favorite book of all time. So involving, and I can't belive the original version didn't have the last chapter. Thank bog it does now."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Burgess said that this was one of his least favorite novels but when it comes to books that delve into the basic primal instincts of man, this one tops the lists. He (Alex) exhibits an entirely nonchalant attitude toward violent crime. I think that Burgess was trying to get readers to understand that if man does not stop his violent downward spiral, the world found in &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; will become the world we live in. A real horrorshow effort."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Well i never really wrote a review before so its not that great. but yeah, this book is great, it took a while to learn what some of the english words meant translated to american slang, but it really makes you think. this is my current favorite book."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A very good book that may be too graphic for some readers. Realistic attitudes set in the near future provides a scary sceneario of what we all may face."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"In a time when the literary world is becoming just as lazy as other branches of entertainment (film and music, for example), it's refreshing to be taken aback by a classic that stands convention on its head and disregards the rules of dull, refined storytelling. This is what I experienced with &quot;A Clockwork Orange,&quot; which is part science-fiction, part comedy, and part social satire, and feels just as current (and relevant) today as it no doubt did during its initial publication (1963). It's essentially the tale of a young hoodlum named Alex who robs, rapes, and murders without remorse, until imprisonment introduces him to a strange medical technique designed to turn criminals into 'normal' citizens. The made-up slang writer Anthony Burgess uses here is very challenging (while you read, you pick up on certain words and are left to decipher the meanings) but ultimately may be too much for a casual reader; if you manage to make it past the first twenty pages, though, it's a safe bet you'll be set for the rest of the novel. Issues of Free Will, social disorder, and childhood merging into adulthood are addressed without Bible-pounding preachiness, topics that can easily be related to our own chaotic modern society.The much-ballyhooed final chapter, in which (SPOILER) Alex discovers that being a droog is a drag and adulthood is the next step in his life, struck me as syrupy--an ending that's been ripped off countless times since in film and books, among other places. The whole 'recovery' at the end of chapter 6 was far more satisfying, with the threat of the patient out at work in the real world again, raping and robbing as he had before.&quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; was also the basis for a 1971 film adaptation by Stanley Kubrick, and I must say--in comparison to the book--the language had been softened up to no doubt make it more accessible to the audience. However, I believe both the novel and the film stand on their own as masterpieces of their respective medium."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"When I started reading this book, I was inclined to put it down, because it didn't feel as something I would like. I'm glad I didn't, this is one of those classics that gets better with every read.I know Russian language, but after first couple of chapters it was still hard to follow the 'nadsat' talk. 'Nadsat' is slang language invented by Burgess, it is a mixture of Russian and English. After You get used to this talk, it adds a lot to this book: it makes You think with both side of Your brain and follow more closely the text, because You're looking for clues what certain slang words mean. I think people who have given low mark because of the slang talk haven't given enough effort to read the book.After reading the book, I also watched Kubricks movie and got the same initial impression as reading the paperpack, that I don't like it. Everything seemed so theater-like, artificial, but the more I got into the movie, the more I like it. It is a classic as is the book. They supplement each other nicely: the more You read the book or watch the movie, the more You want to do it again."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This version of Burgess' classic contains his original transcript (and the one released everywhere outside the US), meaning the 21st chapter is the end. This 21st chapter makes a huge difference in meaning and authoreal intent, and the difference is obvious.After getting used to the lingo created by Burgess, the book has a great flow to it, and the chapters are the perfect length. I found myself lying in bed, reading, and coming to an end of a chapter, deciding \\"ohhh they're short enough that I can read just one more\\". One more usually turned into at least 3 more, and it made for an exceptional, entertaining, and meaningful reading experience. Truly a classic work, I cannot wait to read more of Burgess."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This sentence from the second-to-last chapter of our modern Dante's journey through Hell sums up this book in many ways. Intellectually stimulating, violent, fun, beautiful, dark and open; you won't find a better dystopia.The problems I tend to have with dark novels about possible futures are that the authors tend to be extremely proud of themselves, and this smugness can ruin a book--and also that the changes in society often seem too clever or silly for me to actually enjoy the story.A Clockwork Orange, however, pleases the ear as much as it does the mind. Maybe this is because most of Burgess' new words are actually words stolen from other languages. Whatever the reason, this counter-culture comes off as eminently plausible; and one that embraces violence without condemning it is a refreshing change from all these didactic novels about the \\"dangers\\" of the nature of humanity."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange is a great read for anyone interested in a unique and compelling story of a personal battle of a violent teen with his surroundings and inner-conscience. A Clockwork Orange draws in the simple reader with its raw brutality and violence and leaves them greatly affected with the social implications of this literary masterpiece.Regarding the Russian-English slang spoken by the protagonist, Alex, and his fellow hoodlums; it's initially hard to comprehend, but after the first chapter, one should have no problem reading it.This book is more than just a thriller - it also touches on the psychological and social aspects that are prevalent in today's society."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Warning: This book is not for the faint of heart or the uptight. A Clockwork Orange is a very graphic and dark depiction of a sophisticated young man named Alex, who commits brutal acts of \\"ultraviolence\\" with his friends for pure aesthetic pleasure. However, it is also one of the most philosophically poignant books I've read, dealing with issues such as the nature of good and evil, the importance of free-will, and the inherent evils of government. This is definitely a must-read.The most compelling aspect of the novel is Burgess' heavy use of a made-up teenage slang language called Nadsat (very appropriate commentary for our time, where today's teenage language of hip-hop vernacular and IM acronyms continues to puzzle adults). Although difficult to read at first, once you learn the Alex's language, you will become so absorbed in it that you may find yourself actually using Nadsat words without realizing it.Also, if you have already seen Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation of A Clockwork Orange, do not pass over the book! It is much better in both style and meaning. At the very least (if you don't want to buy the book), stop by the bookstore and read the final chapter of the book, which Kubrick unfortunately decided to omit from his film. It fundamentally changes both the story and its message."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Great book, a little hard to read a first because of the slanguage. But you will get used to it and it will be easier to read. I did not see the movie until I finished the book and the book is better, of course!! A classic!!!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"After trudging through the first couple of pages, readers may wish to throw the book across the room. DO NOT DO THAT! For you would be engaging in a personal disservice. You shall read on, and you shall learn the lingo. This book is vivid, cruel, and evocative. I had to read this book more slowly than others. Probably because of the bizarre syntax. However, after short spells of putting the book down, I could hardly wait to pick it up again. This is a truly monumental work."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I read this book my senior year of high school (now a good bit of time in the past) and it's impression still resonates to this day now 8 years later. I found it to be particularly interesting that the author of this book was christian and that the story had religious undertones regarding the importance of consent to goodness. I think literature can tend to take on new interpretive qualities apart from what the author intends, but that bit definitely is there."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"An amazingly creative, engrossing novel. I thought in Nadsat for weeks. I must say that I disliked the glossary in the back, and didn't use it. That sort of colloquialism is subjective, and trying to define it reduces its meaning. The final chapter was kind of a throw -- not sure how I liked it, but Burgess is a master storyteller -- he really makes you interested in a perverse, completely insane person."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"\`A Clockwork Orange' is one of those novels you don't expect to make the impact it does. When I first purchased the novel it was simply because I wanted some shock-therapy so-to-speak. I wanted to read something daring and edgy and a novel tagged with the \`ultra-violence' moniker must be both. Well it is both daring and edgy, to the extreme even, but as most every reviewer has stated, this book is so much more than just a mishmash of violence. Inside this novel beats the heart of modern society and it asks questions we all do well to ponder.Anthony Burgess paints a haunting picture of a world torn about by violence. Alex (Your humble narrator) is a fifteen year old punk, a bossy irresponsible rebel of the extreme kind. He rules the streets with his droogs (fellow gang members), pillaging as it were. The first few chapters give the reader a glimpse not only into these teens' actions but also their attitude towards them. They have absolutely no sense of justice or consequence, and in a way they have no idea they're doing anything wrong. The novel takes a turn when Alex pushes too many buttons and his friends turn on him, selling him out to the cops and he ends up a prisoner of the State.It's here that the novel becomes that \`classic' or \`masterpiece' everyone keeps talking about. Once Alex is imprisoned he goes through many changes, but it's the cause of those changes that makes all the difference. Forced to become a walking robot, stripped of his free will and programmed to be the perfect citizen, Alex becomes a model example of everything that is wrong with society.Anthony Burgess's fantastic vision asks so many questions and the reader can't help but try to answer them. How should we feel about Alex? Did he get what he deserved? Did he get away with too much? Was his rehabilitation extreme or justified? The reader is forced to hate, even loathe this boy one minute, but only the heartless wouldn't feel pain for him towards the end.\`A Clockwork Orange' changed the way I look at literature for it provides a balanced look at life and the decisions we make. It makes a statement more so then just tells a story. It exposes human emotions and inner workings, the darkest parts inside of us that we keep hidden from us all. Upon finishing this novel I was forced to ask myself, \\"aren't we all the same?\\" and it's a question I feel this novel addresses well. Everyone is appalled at the life Alex is living and the horrendous acts he commits, but isn't his punishment, his \`treatment' as it were, just as masochistic?"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"An ultraviolent coming of age story told in a unique and raw manner. The film (one of my favorites) doesn't capture the spirit of the tale. The last chapter was the piece that had been missing."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I have loved this book for a long time. Now I can carry it with me and read parts whenever I want."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This story is very old and very good. The author really knows how to put you in Alex (The main character) foots, and tell you his story.It can be a little bit confusing when first reading nasdat, but it's worth it.Alex is a young gang leader, which after a few events, will see how all the evil he done to this world, somehow goes back to him, after a shocking treatment.The book is full of ultraviolence and gross scene descriptions, so you must see the real meaning of the message Burgess is trying to transmit."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book, given the era when written was a change in literature. It explores youth disenchantment and thier values in a world increasingly diffciult for them to come to terms with, related to such things as extremes of wealth and systems that do not treat all as equals.There is no question that the behaviours related to violence are unacceptable. However, Burgess is trying to suggest that without a changed world, these types of behaviours remain possible.The most important aspect of the book, however, relates to the \\"treatment' the main character receives that renders him unable to continue to commmit crimes. The thesis here is that we need to provide a world where people choose to behave appropriately rather than to remove peoples' right to make choices.A highly recoemmeneded text."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"In this book about an out-of-control near-future, young Alex is a cynical and violent young man, living in England. Alex has two loves in his life: listening to classical music and seeing flowing blood. Stealing cars, raping women, brutally beating anyone he feels like - it's all an evening's lark to Alex. But, when an elderly woman dies after being attacked by him, Alex finds himself doing hard-time in an over-crowded prison. Offered a chance to get out after a mere fortnight of \\"treatment,\\" Alex jumps at the chance. Little does he realize just how successful this treatment will be, and all the changes they will make.This is a rather interesting book, painting a dark picture. Indeed, it's definitely not a book for the faint of heart. I think, though, that this does paint a surprisingly accurate picture of certain elements of modern, Western society. Alex feels the \\"Joy of the Knife,\\" the same as Macheath did in The Threepenny Opera, and as the recent rioters of London and the flash-mobs of Philadelphia and the Wisconsin State Far do today.The one flaw in this book is the twenty-first chapter, which was omitted from the original American editions of the book. In this chapter, Alex turns 18, and turns away from his early violence. Indeed, the author seems to suggest that at 18, the criminals suddenly embrace middle-class values and become solid, productive citizens (drinking tea, and attending mildly amusing cocktail parties). Coming at the end of such a frank book, this chapter appears nothing less than Pollyannaish (or as the author put it, \\"Kennedian\\").No, this is an interesting book, one that you should read and consider...except for the last chapter."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"\\"The important thing is moral choice. Evil has to exist along with good, in order that moral choice may operate. Life is sustained by the grinding opposition of moral entities\\". I absolutely loved this book.I heard about it years ago but I didn't pick it up because many people were saying it was ultra-violent. Yes, it contains a lot of violent scenes, but this book is not about violence. It is about the free will that everyone has, the will to choose the right or wrong, without being controlled by the society.\\"A man who cannot choose ceases to be man.\\"What impressed me was that the author was able to take a character like Alex and make him sympathetic.The main character was easy to relate to, despite his inhumanity towards other people. Yes, he is violent, brutal, but in the end you wonder if he is not a victim too.P.S. You will have to struggle a little bit with the language used in this book."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Once you get past the NADSAT terminology, you are in for a treat, because A Clockwork Orange is a fantastic book. This book was the first book I ever read with the \\"Anti-Hero\\" in the main role. I think any book that throws up such an unlikeable character as Alexander LaStrange and still manages to capture its readers is a classic. Obviously, most people will compare this book to the ever popular Stanley Kubrick movie of the same name. Whereas, I enjoyed the movie (its acutally one I own) I felt that the book drove the main points a little deeper than the movie did. Whether you think prisons are to lax or too strict, you will probably find something in this book to agree with. I don't think Anthony Burgess' point was to make you feel any specific way about criminals or prisons, but just to experience them from all sides and perhaps make you realize that, as with most things in life, there are layers upon layers of factors that complicate any issue. Nothing in life is straightforward as most people would have us believe."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book is such a classic, definitely one of my favorites now. My friend told me to check it out, so I hopped onto amazon and had the book about a week later. Great service, exactly how it was described."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"\\"A Clockwork Orange\\" together with \\"1984\\" and \\"Animal Farm\\", three classics of the post-modern era which should be required reading by every student prior to graduation.We should now know what to anticipate from the 'droogs' and they will know what to expect in return. Ludwig Von."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I found this book very interesting and enjoyable. It is definitely different. It is an easy and quick read. Come to think of it, I should read it again!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I read this book to benefit my A-level cousework on dystopian fiction - and finishied A Clockwork Orange safe in the knowledge that it is probably one of the most psychologically enriching reads I have ever experienced. Burgess' creative manipulation of language slang and structure is astoundingly catchy - he delicately entrapps the reader (through the use of language and 1st person narrative) into the deceptively vicious world of Alex. He is the &quot;anti-hero&quot; who has been reformed by the state - using new &quot;scientific methods&quot; - to end his diabolical orgy of rape, torture and murder. Towards the end of the book, however, you find yourself despising the government for having used Alex as an organic guinnea pig, even though &quot;Ludovico's Syndrome&quot; (which involves making the criminal look at horrific images of extreme sadistic torture until they become almost &quot;accustomed&quot; to the eventual sickness they feel) is actually reforming Alex to be a socially acceptable citizen. Of course, it is evident almost from the start of the book you are in the hands of a master craftsman of literature - a craftsman who carefully, almost delicately, constructs an enormously important argument which will blow you away with it's absolute social relevance and gravity."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I have to admit, I was actually afraid to read this book. I have never seen the movie but had heard many awful things about it. I was expecting a book without a purpose (as many described the movie to me) that graphically described countless horrific crimes and then ended. I knew it couldn't be as bad as people described and still be so popular so I decided I would read it for myself. I am happy to report that this book is nothing like what I expected.The slang language used by the main characters of this novel serves two purposes to me. First, it transports the reader directly to Burgess' futuristic world that quickly becomes frighteningly real while at the same time provides a sort of buffer that allows the reader, for some unknown reason, to still like Alex despite his tendencies toward terrible, violent crimes. It is for this same unknown reason that I found myself appalled at the \\"cure\\" Alex was given in order to be released from prison.This novel poses several very intriguing questions. I found the prison chaplain's view especially interesting. \\"It may be horrible to be good.\\" Is it better to choose to be bad or to be forced to be good? Being good, or in this case, not doing bad things, doesn't make a person good when their inner thoughts are still bad. The closest Alex gets to being good is not when he is physically kept from committing violent crimes but when he realizes, through his own reasoning, that there is more to life than violence and crime.There is much more to this book than graphic violence and crime, or even what I have briefly mentioned here. The language of this book makes it one of a kind and the thought provoking questions it raises make it definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"\\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is a novel by Anthony Burgess, and it is one of the most famous works of dystopian fiction. It has been made particularly famous by Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation, and both the film and the book are routinely ranked in various surveys amongst the most significant works in their corresponding genres.One of the main idiosyncrasies of the book is the use of an invented teenage slang (or more specifically \\"argot\\") called Nadsat. Burgess was a polyglot, so for him it was an interesting exercise to create a whole new manner of speaking. Nadsat was largely based on Russian words with a few traditional English slang words and phrases. One of the motivations for the invention of a completely fictional slang was Burgess' desire to keep his characters fresh and relevant for a foreseeable future. Thus, a use of any concurrent argots would have made book dated very quickly. However, the heavy use of Nadsat makes \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" fairly difficult to read. My native language is Croatian, another Slavic tongue, and I found that I was able to understand majority of the Russian words without a need for a glossary. Nonetheless, the Anglicized orthography of the words made them sufficiently alien to me that I needed to pause and think about the meaning of those words as I was reading. If you are not familiar with any Slavic languages, then either try to go through a glossary of Nadsat words or try to figure their meaning out from the context.If you can get past the language then \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" will present you with one of the most innovative and original works of fiction in the twentieth century. Burgess' ability to completely get into the head of a delinquent youth is astounding and has not lost any of its original freshness. Even in the age when we are bombarded with violent images in the media on a daily basis, the descriptions of \\"ultraviolence\\" is still very unsettling and disturbing. One of the book's main themes is a reform of violent offenders, and the ethics of the use of behavioral conditioning as a form of rehabilitation. This is what the title of the book refers to: clockwork orange is an unnatural combination of mechanical clockwork, and a soft, juicy living organism. The contradiction between these two opposing forces creates unresolvable tension that can only end in a disaster.Despite its innovative use of language, futuristic setting, and the graphical description of violence, \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is essentially a classic morality play. This is probably one of the main reasons for book's enduring popularity and relevance. Themes of youthful alienation, repentant malefactors, and individual's moral progress are universally relatable and applicable. This alone makes this book worth reading and all the effort worthwhile."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I loved the way that a book like A Clockwork Orange, by Anthony Burgess, can make the reader feel bad for the villain. It is the story of a fifteen-year-old boy named Alex, who maims, rapes and robs people for recreation. He doesn't really think much of it, just as we don't think much of killing a fly. Well one night, he and his droogs (gang friends) go to a house to rob it, and Alex ends up killing the lady and then is betrayed by his droogs and brought in by the police. He then goes under a new scientific procedure that will make him good again... One of my favorite quotes from the book pretty much sums it up: \\"Is a man who chooses the bad perhaps in some way better than a man who has the good imposed upon him?\\" (p. 95).I thought this book was eye opening. It really debates whether it is better to choose, for better or worse, or to let people tell you what to do. It also shows how desensitized people get after being exposed to so much violence. At first it is hard to understand, with all of Alex's slang (hands are \\"rookers,\\" guys are \\"malchiks,\\" and the aforementioned droogs). But as one gets more into the book, one picks up on the slang, and it is a great language that Burgess writes in."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Anthony Burgess warns us of what the future holds in his outstanding book &quot;A Clockwork Orange.&quot; This book became a classic when it was first published over thirty years ago. The movie, which starred Malcolm McDowell and was directed by the late Stanley Kubrick, has developed a cult following.Alex, the protagonist, is the leader of a small gang in his town. He lives in a world where the hell-raising kids take over the night, while the adults are at home glued to their TVs. He steals, vandalizes, rapes 10-year-olds, and much more. He gets caught eventually and is sent to prison for murder, where he hears about a new rehabilitation program which he is eager to join. However, rehab is far from what he expected, and has some serious side-effects.Probably the most brilliant thing about this novel is it's language. Burgess invented a slang which Alex and his friends (or &quot;droogs&quot;) use. It's called Nadsat (which means &quot;teen&quot;), and is widely based on Russian. It takes a while to pick up, but it's not all that difficult (there's an unofficial Nadsat/English dictionary at clockworkorange.com).The problem is, a lot of people dismiss both the book and the movie and put them in the &quot;violent, tasteless, shocking and corrupting&quot; category. These people have to see beyond the violence and realize this is clearly a work of art. This edition of the book includes the 21st chapter which has a different (surprising, perhaps) ending (different from the first American release and the movie).I truly recommend this book to anyone. It's better than that Harry Potter junk anyway."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This is the first book I've read by Burgess. It will NOT be the last. It's been quite a while since I've been so enthusiastic about a book!Burgess creates a tale about twisted teenagers, who's life is dedicated to violence. In their eyes, the more people hurt, the better. When the police capture Alex (leader of the gang), instead of sending him off to jail, they use him as an experiment. He is given to the government as a lab rat for a new &quot;treatment&quot; that boasts criminals can finally re-enter society, and instead of being a danger, will be a constructive and completely &quot;corrected&quot; citizen. However, the method has it's down sides, and leaves Alex completely defenseless. He is quickly and easily driven insane by a group manipulating him in a scheme to prove the government wrong. I won't give any details, and I'm not going to give away the ending, but even if you knew the whole story from start to finish, every twist and turn, A Clockwork Orange would stilll be this good.What makes this book so fantastic is Burgess's ability to tear you apart. Throughout the book, Alex narrates as if you were his friend. You go through everything with him, and then you begin to feel sorry for him! All the while, I couldn't help but think, &quot;I SHOULDN'T feel sorry for Alex!&quot;. I was completely split. It really breaks down traditional good and evil. When I began reading, I thought, Alex and his &quot;droogs&quot; are the evil, the government is good..typical theme... As I read furthur, however, I began to question which was good and which was truly evil. Then you see that not everything breaks down into black and white. A Clockwork Orange is certainly no ordinary tale. It questions all kinds of things that most authors never really take the time to question. Questions that don't really have definitive answers.. that will keep you thinking longg after you're done the book.The language that Burgess created for the book sets the mood and puts you in the story once you get the hang of it. I had anticipated it being much harder, and printed out a long &quot;Nadsat Glossary&quot;, which was completely unnecessary. There aren't any words that you won't be able to figure out from the context.I also thought that I should address the fact that the original version of the book has 21 chapters in it, and the movie cuts out the last chapter. I've never seen the movie, but without the last chapter the book would be quite different, without as much meaning. So even if you've watched the movie, you should read the book.I can't think of the last time I read a book that made me smile, laugh, and gasp in horror and discust all within 192 pages. And when it was all over, I came away satisfied, feeling like I'd actully got something out of the novel. It's really an amazing book."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Burgess vision of the future is one of totalitarian control and violence at the point of chaos. The authorities have given up the night to the youth gangs that then menace citizens in both the street and in their houses. What is scariest of these thoughts is that the perpetrators of this violence are kids under the age of eighteen. Our protagonist, Alex, is fifteen and his droogs (friends) are not much older. They rob, rape, drink, take drugs.Once you get past the language (try not to spend too much time looking at the glossary), there is a powerful message about good and evil. Alex is arrested for murder and then commits a second in prison. A new treatment based on drugs and aversion therapy has been developed to control the 'bad' impulses, and Alex is chosen as the first prisoner to be treated. As is to be expected, the treatment does more than just stop Alex from being 'bad' it takes away his ability to protect himself (in more ways than one).This is the full version of the book. The original american version was missing Part 3 Chapter 7. For anyone who has read the pre-1986 version or seen the Kubrick-McDowell movie, the missing chapter will come as a revelation. In his intro to the novel, Burgess himself discusses the meaning of the last chapter and what was his motivation. Read it and make your own conclusions...which is what Burgess was going for in the first place."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Although in Mr. Burgess' introduction, A Clockwork Orange Resucked, he rambles on about how much he doesn't like this book, I read it and was nothing short of amazed.In a world where criminals rule the street after dark and anyone standing in their way will get killed stands young Alex and his \\"droogs\\" (invented slang for close friends) are young and bloodthirsty teens who go about every night robbing, beating, and raping innocent people. This part was extremely disturbing, as they involved terrible acts of violence, such as the beating of an old man, the robbery and beating and raping of a couple (the husband was writing a book called \\"A Clockwork Orange), and the drugging and violent raping of two ten-year-old girls. Finally, after beating an old woman to death while robbing her house, Alex is caught by the police and sent to jail, charged with mainly murder.Here the book takes a very personal turn, and really shows you how Alex feels, and exposes the real person inside him, not just a ruthless, violent child out to terrorize the world. In jail you get connected to him as he gets disconnected from the world.In two years time it seems like Alex has really cleaned up his act, and is released to a group of doctors who will test a new technique where they are able to program the violence out of Alex. They succeed in doing so, but now Alex is not a real person, for he cannot chooses how he wants to live. He is now a free man who can walk the streets alone, but now that he's been reformed into an ordinary citizen, nobody wants him and he has many encounters with previous victims, including F. Alexander, the author of A Clockwork Orange, who Alex beat up and raped his wife (along with three other guys). It's revealed that after being beaten up so badly and raped so fiercely, the wife died.This was probably the strangest part of the book and one that really crawled under my skin.Alex is now repeatedly betrayed by people and finally, in an attempt to end it all, jumps out a window.But Alex does not die. He wakes up in the hospital weeks later and finds out he's back to normal.The book ends where it begins, for the most part, but, although it sounds awful, this book was really well written.It is very sad, tragic, and true, but also makes you think about certain things that you usually do not. It's hard to explain, but, read the book. It will do you good."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"The inspiration of a movie that was banned in Europe until just recently, A Clockwork Orange has been a long standing classic of modern literature. Set in a futuristic world where \\"malchicks\\" spend their nights prowling for unsuspecting victims to mutilate and/or torture, the story revolves around a young man named Alex and his \\"droogs\\". The gang of teenagers begins the evening with a milk-plus at the Korova milkbar, followed by a thirst for violence which is satisfied by breaking into houses and beating the inhabitants to near-death while destroying everything tangible, or \\"tolchocking\\" a starry (old) veck (man) or two that they may come across on the dark city streets. But, as is suspected, all is not well in Alex's world. The self-proclaimed leader of his gang, whose faith in him is failing, eventually causes a revolt of sorts. Alex is left, at the scene of one of their crimes, to be caught by the police.Alex is locked up after being given the usual brutality, and soon is carrying a long sentence with him. After some trouble in the cell which he shares with five other men, Alex is yet again fed to the wolves, so to speak, when he is blamed for the death of an inmate. At this point he is brought forth as a candidate for the experimental \\"Ludovico's Technique,\\" and it is at this point that the motive of the story surfaces. In the battle between good and evil, to what extent should the willingness to do good be imposed upon the members of society? At what cost should the government interfere with it's citizens' urges and desires? In the end, it all comes down to a moral standpoint, and the question of whether a man without free will is really a man at all."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"'A Clockwork Orange' is the fourth Anthony Burgess novel I've read (after 'One Hand Clapping', 'The Doctor is Sick', and 'The Wanting Seed'), which is strange since 'A Clockwork Orange' is undoubtedly Burgess's most famous novel (thanks in no small part to the film adaptation). I was hesitent in tackling 'A Clockwork Orange' because I knew it contained many invented expressions by the author and, I feared, it would make for difficult reading. Thankfully my fears were unjustified.Firstly, as most everyone knows 'A Clockwork Orange' is a futuristic story about a sadistic teenager causing havoc with his equally disturbing mates. His behaviour is vile, with this futuristic society being portrayed as an ultra-violent hell. Fortunately he is caught, imprisoned, then undergoes 'treatment' to cure him of his violent obsessions. The story flows well, with both the characterizations and the description of this future world being very believable.However it is Burgess's creative use of inventive gang-land slang which makes this book most memorable. Of course initially it is all rather confusing, but after a bit it is rather easy to follow. One is simply left over-awed at the author's ability to get away with such creativity - I imagine his publishers (back in the early 1960s) were rather disturbed at Burgess's creation.Bottom line: violent, shocking and unforgettable. While not for the squeamish, most everyone will be impressed with 'A Clockwork Orange' - regardless if they've seen the film."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"If you are a fan of the dystopian drama then look no further. This book has a wonderful and imaginitive plot with a good moral to follow. Burgess's unique storytelling abilities, combined with the \\"Nadsat\\" dialect which he himself adapted for this novella, makes it a great read for any type of reader!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"When I looked at ACO on Amazon there were 589 existing reviews. What more can be said. It is a \\"real horrorshow\\" read. This is Burgess' finest work. It is short and very readable. We have ultra violence and an excellent exploration of what is a world gone wrong. It is a kind of \\"Cather in the Rye\\" meets \\"American Psycho\\" set in the beta part of \\"Brave New World\\"Although engaged in assult, murder, rape Alex and his pals are somehow engaging. Their future speak slang has not aged at all and has a cool feels (its baaaad). The lingo is addictive - it is very engaging to learn the lingo - tocchock, horrorshow, groodies, veck and many more.Recommend it to all who are angst riven - Not!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Anthony Burgess wrote his most famous novel, A Clockwork Orange, in 1962. When Burgess wrote his book, the violent, God forsaken world he wrote about was in the near future (I'm guessing around 1995, since Alex and his droogs at one point go joyriding in a \\"Durango 95\\"). Burgess was apparently a rather keen sociological observer, and most readers will conclude that there was a lot of accurate prediction in what he wrote.The book is narrated by Alex, an oddly lovable amoral teenage thug. Alex uses \\"nadsat,\\" a slang derived mostly from Slavic languages, and this language makes Alex's world more real for the reader. This language is mostly comprehensible from context, and there are several glossaries on the internet. His language has great comic effect throughout the book, as when Alex reads some propaganda in a government newspaper:\\"This gazetta I had seemed to be like a Government gazetta, for the only news that was on the front page was about the need for every veck to make sure he put the Government back in again on the next General Election, which seemed to be about two or three weeks off. There were very boastful slovos about what the Government had done, brothers, in the last year or so, what with increased exports and a real horrorshow foreign policy, and all that cal.\\"Or when he describes a bit of refuse on the floor of a milk bar:\\"I had my glazzies like fixed on a malenky bit of silver paper from a cancer packet that was on the floor, the sweeping-up of this mesto not being all that horrorshow, brothers.\\"Much of the humor in the book comes from the contrast between the horrible things that Alex does and his unshakable self-esteem. It never occurs to Alex that the reader's sympathies might not be completely with him as he rapes and murders and plots and schemes. And Alex is so buoyant and resourceful that it's hard not to root for him.But Burgess didn't write this book simply to draw attention to an alarming increase in juvenile delinquency. The central struggle in the book is between the little man and the soul-stealing bureaucracy. In one soliloquy, Alex tells us \\"They of the government and the judges and the schools cannot allow the bad because they cannot allow the self. And is not our modern history, my brothers, the story of brave malenky selves fighting these big machines? I am serious with you, brothers, over this. But what I do I do because I like to.\\" The government tries to make Alex good but of course it can't: Alex has to choose to be good, or not.The 1987 Norton edition restores a final chapter that had been deleted from the original American edition of the novel, and it is here that the reader sees why all men are equal, in God's eyes: everyone has a potential as well as a past, and no man can say what another man will become."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I first read this book about 2 years ago, maybe 5 months after seeing the movie. And I can agree with everyone that the first pages were kind of a struggle, as the language is primarly taken from the Russian language and some altered english slang, and i think one or two german words.But as i continued to read i got the hang of it. And upon finishing it, i felt that without a doubt it was better than the movie. As I find with all books that were made into movies. But the movie still is a classic in itself, and is one of my favourate films.What I would primarly like to talk about here is the Nadsat language. I read the book more than 3 times over and realy, almost memorised the entire thing. I even went as far as buying the book in german and reading it. As I have been learning german. But about the language.I recently had a forigen exchange student come to my school from Russia. I immedietly was interested in him, as i myself am going to be an exchange student to germany next year. After i became friends with him, i showed him A Clockwork Orange, and really he thought it was kind of silly, because the russian used in it, is inaccurate as far as to what it would really say. I shall give some examples:Korova in russian means CowViddy in russian means to like watch a movie or something to that extent, it doesn't precisly mean to 'see' or look, how it is sometimes used in the book.Ptitsa in russian means bird.. so starry ptitsa, would mean old bird, which is accurate as old women are sometimes refered to as 'old birds'Devotchka is the russian word for a woman, and depending on the way it is spelled and pronounced, it can mean young girl, or woman i believe.Sharries in russian means testicles. and often people say that 'Kiss my sharries' means 'kiss my ass'Spatchka in russian means hybernation, and is usually only refered to animals like bears that hybernate in the winter. In the book it refers to simply sleeping.and there are more but those are some of the main ones that stick out in my mind.Overall i think this book is among the greatest novels ever written. And will remain a classic."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange is a deeply disturbing exploration of the psychological alienation present in a not too distant future. Written in the 1960s and using a variety of Russian and British street slang to come up with its own bombastic and puss-spewing lexicography, the prose and plot-line create a tremendous feel of the emotional distance located in the criminal mind. In addition, the outcome leaves the reader with huge quandaries and questions about the nature of human rehabilitation, forgiveness, and re-construction. In today's society with our sights set on bio-tech enhanced visual, mental, and health transformations, what will politicians, scientists, and the common public decide to do with tomorrow's criminal sub-sector? With gangs, the availability of guns, and the emotional detachment from ones fellow human beings all increasing, what ramifications, punishments, and treatments will occur in future years? This book explores this and many other heartfelt societal issues from a more simpler, technologically blase, and reclusive society. Fascinating rhythmic read from Mr. Burgess."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"The first 10's of pages reading this book, is, without a doubt, going to be a slight challenge for the reader, because most of it is written in a completely different language; in the form of English, not quite actually, more like German-English, and is known by the rambunctious teens and protagonists of this tale, A Clockwork Orange, taking place in the unleading future, as 'nadsat' talk. Or in other words, since 'nadsat' means 'teen', it would mean, 'teen' talk, the way the teenagers, in the supposed future, talk. And it's not anything normal, I can tell you now. To help you out a little, when the time comes if you ever read it, I will give you the definitions of some words the characters often use in A Clockwork Orange, so you won't become utterly confused.Many, many other reviewers have already stated the plot and other main parts of the book, so I see no purpose or no vindication or no positive results in doing so; it would only be redundant and a big, fat waste of my time, and your time. So let's just stick to the language of a Clockwork Orange. Nadsat talk 101.\\"mesto\\" means place\\"tolchock\\" means to punch\\"gulliver\\" means head\\"horrorshow\\" means good or well\\"lewdies\\" is people\\"millicents\\" is police\\"ptitsa\\" is bird\\"pee and em\\" means pop and ma(how Alex, the protagonist, refers to his mother and father by)\\"grahzny bratchny\\" means dirty basstard\\"skolliwoll\\" means school\\"Bezoomny\\" means mad\\"Baboochka\\" means old woman\\"Bog\\" is God\\"Britva\\" is razor(or how Alex refers his by: 'cut-throat britva')\\"Cal\\" means sh*t\\"Chelloveck\\" means fellow\\"Devotchka\\" is girl\\"Fagged\\" is tired\\"Goloss\\" is voice\\"Glazz\\" is eye\\"Govoreet\\" is to speak or talk\\"In-out-in-out\\" is sex\\"Malchick\\" is boy\\"Oddy-Knocky\\" means lonesome\\"Skorry\\" is quick, quickly\\"Veck\\" is guy\\"Vesch\\" is thing\\"Yarbles\\" is balls/testicles\\"Zoobies\\" is teethAnd many, many more.But, you don't really need that list of definitions. If you just continue reading the book, you'll eventually pick upon the language."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I enjoyed reading A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess. The whole idea behind the story was very appealing to me. The thought of how at night the world we know can be taken over by criminals, got my interest, since I have not read a story like this before. I also liked how this really made you look at how important free will actually is, in our society. In this book, one gets the idea of how a criminal looks at the world, and how over time people do grow up and change. This book is full of detail and surprise. Anthony Burgess I think really did an amazing job with capturing the mind of a criminal teen. It intrigues me the way Anthony Burgess was able to put humor into this story of good and evil. An example of this would be when the character, Alex is breaking into this old woman's house, and it is full of cats everywhere, and how his main problem with this robbery, is because of all these cats. It really adds to this story to have humor involved. I really liked how the main character \`Alex' had a language of his own, which made this witty story even more interesting. The book just throws in a bunch of surprises one would not expect. The only real weakness this story has, is that it was in such complex text, it may be difficult for many to understand. I know for me, I had some troubled at the start of this book because of the language \`Alex' created. Over time however, I seemed to adapt to this language, and actually understand it just fine. I recommend this book to those who are capable of reading something in complex text, and would be interested in the frightening ways of how evil sometimes prevails over good."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"The first thing that should be known about this book is it's literary style. The book is based in a british slang called nadast. Don't be discouraged by this style of writing and decide not to read this book. I know when i first picked up this book and i had read the first page i thought to myself, \\"man, this is one hard book to follow.\\" At that point i had almost put the book down and planned on not reading it. But, people telling me how good this book was kept me reading the book. After a few pages into the book taking it slowly i started to make sense of this confusing text and now i'm use to it, and it's a wonderful book. SO FROM ME TO YOU, IF U PLAN ON READING THIS BOOK DON'T PUT IT DOWN THE TEXT WILL MAKE SENSE THE FARTHER YOU GET INTO IT. Hey, Maybe you'll even start talking like them, this being a very horrorshow (good) book.As for the actual review of the story, i will start with the beginning but i dont plan on giving it all away (you can read someone elses if you want to spoil it for you.) Also im not good at reviews or writing in genral.First off, the book starts with a young 15 year old boy named Alex, who is sort of a juvenile delinquent. His average days consist of Hanging out with His Droogs(friends,also gang members) sitting at a milk bar (drugged up milk is drank here) and doing several delinquent acts such as rape,thievery and maybe even MURDER! The first main thing to happen in this book is they take a little trip to a authors hows to have a little fun. Alex using his charm to make the kind young lady open the door enough for them to run in and attack and rape his wife and him. Later they return to the milk bar and a young lady starts to sing a little opera, when Dim (the dumbest and biggest of them)makes a very ignorant gesture/noise towards this women. Which results in a nice kiss to the face from the leader Alex. This makes his droogs to conimplate betrayal and hatred towards there leader. Then the droogs go off to another house to go for more vicous acts. Alex leads in and is confronted by a older woman who puts up a terrible fight. As Alex leaves the house he is confronted by his droogs to see that they have come to betray him. They knock him to the ground which results in him getting caught by the cops.Alex is then charged with murder and sentenced to 14 years in prison. 2 years in prison leads to a scientific discovery made by government officials to \\"brainwash criminals to be good\\" and Alex is \\"forced\\" into the program. They give Alex a drug that inflicts pain on him which then they keep his eyes open as he watches disturbing videos; so as the drug co-insides with criminal acts triggering when he does wrong.There is more to this book but like i said early i am not about to give the book away thats pretty much to much info right there. If you want to know what happens next then look at someone elses to find it, like i said im not giving it away. Also Yes! there is a movie on it but i reccomend you should read the book instead or at least read it before it is certainly much better and more enjoyable then the movie."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange is not only a suspenseful and enjoyed book, but a solid support in my theory that there is no such thing as right and wrong. It is a masterful fable that teaches us the same part of us that feeds on destruction, plants the yearning to create. I am little surprised that in most of the other reviews this idea has gone largely unnoticed. (i.e. I don't believe the point is that he and everyone else just came around and decided not to be bad anymore because of their experience.) Anyway, I really loved this book because it helped me in polishing my ideas of life, which I think it will do for many who read it. It is beautiful, simply beautiful."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Kept my attention the whole way through. Great book!"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This is a book I had to buy 3 times before my mom stopped throwing it away, and she threw away the DVD I bought of it too. It's trash, she said. I thought it was a good commentary on what's wrong and what's right with the world. I read the book in school, because I _wanted_ my teachers to see I was reading it, because I wanted to wear my mind on my sleeve to some extent, by showing them a book that meant something to me.Much to my surprise and chagrin, they did not respond as my mother did. In fact, they would ask me why I found it engaging (and believe me, I did), and they would talk to me about the characters and the story. It was a book that made me re-evaluate a lot of things in my world, and to a large degree, it helped me (indirectly) gain some valuable insight into myself and the people around me.To say this book didn't change my life would be a lie. In fact, I'm sure this book changed in one way or another the life of everyone who's read it. Lately, in America especially, people will hide behind the veil of decency and what's right and good to repress and take away freedom. ACWO indeed gives a deep insight into this sort of action, and the deadly and terrible consequences it may have.It dares to ask the question of if good is good because of intentions or because of instinct. In a more direct way of saying it, it says &quot;does society act civil because it wants to or because it is somehow forced to by an influence other than its own&quot;.Like &quot;Mother Night&quot; by Vonnegut, this book points out that the individual, no matter how much you might not like them, or how much you might not believe who they really are, is defined by their actions and their words, and that the world around them forces who they appear to be onto them, or forces its views of who they are onto them."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"An incredible, violent and almost surrealistic dream (or should I say nightmare?) about the future. A mechanical and dehumanized society where Alexander De Large has become a sort of evil creature of it and ironically its sacrificial lamb. A superb description of how the opportunity of choosing between good and evil must be considered as a gift of God."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"What can I say? This book is disturbing and lovely. If you've read the American version (minus the last chapter) you are missing the whole point! Get the updated American version (which is the same as the British version) for the entire story. It's not just a book, it's a social phenomenon! The movie is wonderful as well, but Kubrick (the late genius) also excluded the last chapter from the film version. Shame on him! However the book is still simply astounding."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I first read the book upon turning 13, and upon finishing (besides being in a state of complete and utter mental shock) I hurranged my mother to let me see the movie. Four months later, I had my bar mitzvah, and being a man I saw this movie. I could go on for hours about the movie, but I'll post a review of that later. Many months afterword, I reread the book, but took care not to read the last chapter.What I wish to do on this review column, is gather some oppinions of the 21st chapter (just please don't give anything away). After my first reading, I really liked the 21st chapter, and thought it added a nice optimistic twist to the story. I had known the movie did not feature the events of the last chapter, and was eager to see how that would work. I later learned that, although the movie was shot in Britain, Kubrick had read the American release and had not known about the last chapter, and upon reading it, said he was not too fond of it. Kubrick, of course, was a pessimist. But after reading the book a second time, I really understood his statement. Although interesting, the last chapter really interupts the feel of the book, and leaves you with a feeling much different than that of the 20th chapter, that of which I prefer.I would like to appoligize for the terrible writing of this review, but would appreciate anyones oppinions on the 21st chapter."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Anthony Burgess uses the central character and narrator of the story, Alex, to show the differance in good and evil, and the meaning of human freedom.

It is violent in a few places but I have no problem with it. And Burgess's &quot;Nadsat&quot; language is what makes the book. Without it I doubt it would have been all that great. I didn't understand the words at first but after awhile I started learning it and by the end of the book I barely noticed it. Some people are saying the last chapter is sort of a let down. I don't. The last chapter was what made the book great. It showed that people are capable of changing and not being Clockwork Oranges all their life. I strongly recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I just moved and happened across my copy of CO. I sat down and read it again only to be mesmerized by Burgess once again. In his introduction, he is very self-deprecating, but this is one fine work.Holden Caulfield, this is what teenage angst is really all about. The use of language (nadsat talk) is truly an amazing literary feat.Read it again or read it a first time...it is so worth it."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"What amazes me most about A Clockwork Orange is not the literary pretensions that Burgess set out with in creating it, but how quickly and easily he draws you into the world he creates. Two things allow him to do this.The first is the flow of his language, a thing that is doubly amazing when you consider that he had to invent a fairly complex slang vocabulary which can be more than a little off-putting to readers at first. I say at first because within a few pages I barely noticed that I was reading words like &quot;rooker&quot; and &quot;litso&quot; instead of hand and face. In fact, the language has a cadence and rhythm all its own once you become used to it that actually guides you through the story.The second reason is Alex, the narrator of the novel. Alex is a 15-year-old leader of a gang of droogs who has equal love for Beethoven and &quot;the old ultra-violence&quot;. Something about this character makes him completely appealing, even as his actions make you want to turn away. Or maybe appealing isn't the best word. Fascinating, perhaps. And Burgess doesn't have to do THAT much to make him that way. Contradictions. Simply things like contrasting violent tendencies with his effete nature. Singing showtunes while beating a man to a bloody pulp. I wish I could explain better, but maybe there isn't more to explain. For whatever reason, I simply find myself pulled in by Alex and his antics.Speaking of antics, though, I refuse to discuss the specific plot of the book (I think it's rude and a bit juvenile; besides, Amazon has that information already if you want to read it), but I WILL say that Burgess' book deals with many themes. It is in ways a social critique, a &quot;fable about good and evil&quot; and a philosophical text that questions what &quot;the self&quot; entails and what freedom means.ACO is alternately bitingly funny and horribly frightening, and Burgess manages to paint a portrait of a dystopic future in which street punks rob, rape and cause general havoc to everyone they can, parents are mostly useless and ignore their children because they cannot deal with the horrors in which they participate, and the government concerns itself only with good public relations rather than the welfare of its people. Moreover, Burgess manages to do this with seeming ease.Please do not think that if you have seen the movie you do not need to read this book. While similar in plot, Burgess intends certain thematic differences than Stanley Kubrick completely dropped the ball on in his movie. This will become crystal clear if you read this version of the novel, which contains the much debated 21st chapter that was not originally released in the United States.My personal feeling on this chapter is that Burgess did not understand his own novel enough if this is the way he intended to end it. I say this because there are certain things that happen in this chapter that I cannot find any evidence for in the rest of the book. I feel like Burgess began to write one book and then just decided that he couldn't follow through with it. For this reason I call ACO flawed brilliance.But don't let the first word draw your attention away from the second. This book is brilliant, and well worth a read or two. I am even glad for the inclusion of the last chapter, because it is what Burgess originally intended and opens up interesting lines of discussion.Others books would be so lucky to have a flaw as wonderful."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Well, I, viddied this book at the store some years ago.

Apparently this is a nightly routine in which they bloodily attack any number of random victims, sometimes with no hope for gain at all. He is eventually caught and brought to prison, where he remains for several years. The state later decides to reform him using an experimental technique. Anthony Bugess' A Clockwork Orange challanges our fundamental beliefs regarding good and evil, right and wrong. This novel asks whether those human beings who are inherently malicious (meaning our protagonist, Alex) can be forcibly molded into upstanding citizens. The answer is, of couse, no. The only means of doing this leave the victim bereft of the basic human right choice. Robbing one of his free will changes him from man to machine. It is far worse to be a law abiding machine than an evil human, because the evil human still has the option of voluntary reform (as seen in the 21st chapter which is, in my opinion, absolutely necessary)."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"this book is a celebration of language. the creativity of slang and youth combine to challenge the reader to decipher and diagram every sentence. once some repitition has been established, new words are introduced and the adventure continues. the storyline revolves around violence, both physical and mental. the 21st chapter of the book is not included in some editions so this is the one to buy."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This is one of the few books ive read which not only causes the reader to expand his or her's language and perception of how our speech works but also causes one to evaluate society as a whole.

At first this book was really hard to understand because of the language but after a few parts I began to understand it. This book is very graphic and the movie is much worse. This book has just about every horrible thing you can think of. It has rape, murder, beating, betrayel, and much more. I am glad i read this book even though my parents told me not to because of what scenes are in it. They also didn't think I would understand it but i did."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Burgess created a masterpiece when he wrote &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. It is truly amazing what he did with language in this book, creating a futuristic teen slang. It is difficult to read at first, but with patience you get used to it.The story does have a high level of brutal violence and criminal acts in it, but when you look beyond all of that, you realize it's quite necessary. It serves to strengthen both the theme and setting, namely, a future society filled with crime. Through the main character, Alex (the &quot;clockwork orange&quot; himself), this novella brilliantly displays the importance of moral choice in the individual."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Great book, well worth the read... the movie does it no justice.."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I have read this book twice and as I was reading it the second time I realised it was a lot more violent and brutal than I originally remember. this was probaly beacause the overall mood and message stuck in my head as opposed to alex and his droogs acts. If you are at all skeptical that you will not like this because of content, don't worry. It is more than well worth it. Oh and if you were at all disapointed at the way Orwell's 1984 ended as I was, try this."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Boy, that Burgess has some nerve! First, he gets us to like this ultraviolent teenager due to the fun narration, then he encourages us to feel sorry for him when Big Government intervenes and prevents him from acting as he would wish! Outstanding story and language...just one thing, couldn't Burgess have left the final chapter out, as Stanley Kubrick did in the film? I love how the final made me wonder about Alex, where the novel tried to make amends."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Personally, This Is One Of My Favorite Books. I Think That Many People Are Turned Away From This Book Due To The Extremely Violent Content And Horrific Crimes Described Herein, But, Beneath The Violence And Crime Is A Masterpiece That Gives A Terrifying Vision Of A Possible Future and Poses An Important Moral Question. The Book Has Some Connections To Christianity That Are Represented Mainly Through The Prison Chaplain. The Big Moral Dilemma Of The Book Is Expressed Through The Title. Alex(The Narrator), Is Subjected To A Treatment In Prison In Which He Is Shown Films Of Violence And Sex, While Strapped To A Chair With His Eyes Forced Open And While Feeling Extreme Nausea, Fear, Discomfort, And Feelings Of Paralysis. After Alex Gets The Treatment In Prison, He Becomes A &quot;Clockwork Orange,&quot; Something That Appears To Be Alive But Is In Fact Mechanical. The Treatment Forces Alex To Be A Non-Violent, Non-Sexual person. Just The Thought Of Sex Or Violence Causes Him To Become Incapacitaded By Feelings Of Extreme Nausea And Severe Discomfort. Alex No Longer Has The Freedom To Choose How To Behave And He Becomes A Slave To Fear, The Fear Of The Effects Of The Treatment. Consequently, These Feelings Also Appear When Alex Hears His One True Love In Life, The Music Of Beethoven. This Is Due to The Fact That One Of The Treatment Films Had A Piece By Beethoven Playing In The Background. The Chaplain Sums Up The Main Theme Of The Book In One Statement: Is A Person Truly Good If They Have No Choice Between Good Or Bad Behavior, And Are Forced To Do No Wrong. Basically, The Theme Is The Connection Between Living And Freedom. It Seems To Me That What Burgess Is Trying To Say Is That People Are Not Truly Alive If They Do Not Have The Freedom To Choose How To Live Their Lives, And Without This Choice, Are Nothing But Machines That Have The Characteristics Of Human Beings. I Couldn't Agree More."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"The language in this book is so awesome. At first it was difficult then after the third chapter I was able to get throght it easily. The book questions whether someone can be completly evil or completly good and at what costs can you change someone. The end of the book will really having you thinking.

How can I explain that it is possible for me to empathize with a rapist, a murderer, a child molester, a parent hater? And yet, to me, that is Burgess' genius in this book. When I was requested to follow along with &quot;Our Faithful Narrator,&quot; I eagerly submitted with anticipation, to learn where the future would take him. And possibly us.Burgess asks in this novel a question of some simplicity: what is the human species? But his answers are unlike anything I've seen, with apologies to Orwell and Huxley. He first guides us into the mind of an individual criminal. And then he indicts society at large with the criminal manner in which he is handled. Unfortunately for us, true examples of similar means of &quot;bettering&quot; our society are too plentiful to mention (like castration of rapists) and too scary to dwell upon.And then there is the language. It made me chuckle, it made me want more; I wish this book were a 1000 pages longer. One criticism I often have is that novelists poorly finish otherwise good books. This is NOT true of &quot;A Clockwork Orange;&quot; it ends fittingly and true."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book is excellent and on so many levels. The slang of the book makes it timeless and so it is as relevant now as when it was written. It also makes the book so alive and so it doesn't exist merely as words on a page. The book is also thought provoking and full of ironies. One of the ironies is that it is civilised people who are meant to listen to classical music and yet here Alex does. Tis is Burgess's response to, perhaps, the fact that the Nazi's were said to have listen to Back and read Goethe. The slang also means people read it differently and that is why there should not be a glossary. People should interpret it all their own way and should think about what they are reading and not be told what to think. It is the same as Chaucer - once you understand the language you become so immersed in the world that the author creates that you almost slip into the slang in everyday speech - much more so than if it was pure English.The book is surely about the capacity to choose and how it is better to have the choice to be bad than being forced to be good. People choose their own path and choose to go to hell their own ways. People must be able to have a fling because that is making a choice.The dark humour also adds to the book but it may be overshadowed by the violence.It is something everyone should read so that they can see what a well-crafted book looks like. Also, and I hope I am not alone here, there is something about Alex that you end up sympathising and empathising with and there is something of alomst a charm (if that is the right word) about him.A truly artful book"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I agree with the Wisconsin reader that the slang is one the best parts of the novel, giving the futuristic society that very dirty gritty feeling. I have the new edition (no glossary), and I can't see using a glossary for this book. As I was reading it, I would attribute new meanings to undefined words... it makes every chapter a new experience, almost allowing you to mold Alex's point of view as you think necessary. While a glossary may have been helpful at times, I think it would take away a certain interaction with the characters that was (to me) so important to the novel. Also, pay attention to the slang. A lot of the words say a lot about the atmosphere - an example being 'horrorshow', meaning 'incredible' or 'good', which really says a lot about Alex's perception of 'good' in the end. There's a lot of that thrown in there, adding to the brilliance of the novel."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I'll be the first one to admit that I am something of a bookacholoic, and a result of that was that I speed read. I read the new version without any glossary and the slang actually made read every single word and that is a quite of a feat for a book.In this era of Colombine, you would think that I would shy away from this book, being a high-schooler myself. Many people think this book is the mirror of the future, but this book really is a form of our past, making us see that we will have to do something about teenage violence before this world turns into a negative uptopia of violence displayed in A Clockwork Orange."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I scanned through a good deal of the reviews below and decided it was time to reinforce the most fascinating thing about the book -- the use of an English/Russian hybrid in the form of teenager slang at a time in the world where attitudes towards Russia were not exactly open arms. Seeing the movie first can add and subtract to the reading of the book. It can add to it by hearing how the language is handled by a real human voice. The movie can subtract from the reading of the book by giving you images of the futuristic society and the characters that really are not given to you in the book. Plus you will never believe that Malcolm McDowell is fifteen years old. The age of Alex is part of what makes the atrocity of the crimes so horrid and terrifying, both by Alex and by the State. The other bit of adding and subtracting has to do with this edition of the book. Sure it has a great new cover (to attract the MTV generation) and the restored chapter (which always should have been there). But it is missing the very helpful glossary of terms that my original copy has. There are some of you out there who would feel that paging back and forth to a glossary would ruin the pacing of the book, but is reading the same passage five and six times to guess at what the heck a certain word means any better? I recommend getting this for the missing chapter, and then going to the local used book store and finding the older version with the ugly orange cover for the glossary in the back. This could help make this amazing book a more rewarding experience to read."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book is a marvel of all books and should be read by everyone.

This is a must read, but not for the weak minded"},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I recently finished reading \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" and quite frankly, I expected more. Instead I found it to be quite predictable and ordinary. The protagonist, Alex, is nothing more than a posing hooligan trying to fit in with his \\"crowd.\\" His brand of violence is not really shocking in this, the 21st century. He is merely a victim of peer pressure. The only thing that sets him apart and adds a slight air of menace is that he embraces a lot of different types of violence - from rape to beatings to petty theft. He is not a true believer of his own world, though, with his reluctance to pull off true crimes in the form of burglary and out-and-out murder. And his supposed shocking \\"rehabilitation\\" is simply aversion therapy. The last \\"lost\\" chapter is neither a shocker nor a surprise and I really don't see any significance in it at all other than the numeric importance to the author. Sort of a cop out - time heals all wounds... and psychopaths. I will grant that the slang language invented by Burgess is a very good tool for transporting the reader into the \\"droog\\" world. Otherwise, I don't see the fuss over this predictable novella."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I read this book expecting to be blown away. 1984 blew me away. This book was touted as in the same vein as that book. It's not. The book makes some observations about free will, and the nature of good and evil, but I don't find them to be very profound. Also, in this book the protagonist uses slang that the author has created. This adds little to the story, and wears thin upon the reader after many pages. In conclusion, this book probably just couldn't live up to the hype. The reviews on this book make it out to be more than what it is."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I was given this book by a friend. It's the best that I have ever read. The way in which the writer creates a whole new language is really inspiring. If you are able to get past the first chapter you will really enjoy this book."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I remember coming across this movie several years ago as a teeneager, while just flipping channels. At the time, I knew nothing about it. However, over these past ?20 years since I saw this movie, it always stuck in my mind.I finally read the book over the past 2 days, and must say, it is a good thing I had not read it previously, in an immature state. Even now, I had difficulty initially understanding the language, and it took a while to grasp the meaning of the words. However, once I got the hang of it, I could appreciate the book more, and went back to reading the pages that totally evaded me.Comes off as a really warped book in the initial reading, but on deeper look, I found it profound! Strange, eh?I personally debated whether that last chapter, which was cut out of the movie, needed to be included or not. To tell you the truth, yes, it could have been totally eliminated for a better bang, so to speak, as, certainly, the world is not an ideal place. It is indeed difficult to perceive our Humble Narrator being totally transformed and becoming a family man, after a life like he led. Nevertheless, on the other hand, an optimistic ending is always preferred, with its rose colored glasses. Hope springs.Yes, a good book, even though not one that will be liked or appreciated by all."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"It's funny how people gave this book such a low rating because they couldn't understand it. Yeah, Burgess basically made up a language for it but it's not hard to grasp if you have more than eight brain cells.A Clockwork Orange is an amazing book. It had me basically on the edge of my seat, just waiting to see what's going to happen next. It's very rare that a book is able to hold my attention and this one dad a great job of it. I did not want to put it down and it left me wishing that there would have been a sequel of sorts.I would recommend this book if1. You have a good sense of humor/can easily detect sarcasm.2. Don't mind violence.3. Are at least somewhat intelligent and able to think logically.4. Have a good grasp on the English language (in order to better understand the made up slang)I would not recommend this book if1. You are an idiot and can't understand basic English, ala the people that have written bad reviews about it.Overall, it's a very interesting book and if you've yet to read it, you should definitely consider buying it right now."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I am 14 years old, and, after reading the novel A Clockwork Orange, i did not go out and kill my friends or get a gang of droogs together to rob stores. I have my own will, and make intelligent descisions on my own rather than copying what i read. This said, the violence seemed to make the book appeal to me more, i suppose because of my sadistic side. Perhaps the shock value and unfamiliarity of the events intrigued me. However, the part of the book that I had the most fun with was the Nadsat. The language, while it seemed very difficult at first (I came very close to throwing away the book after the first page), turned out to be cool once you understood it (i finished the book that same day). After you learn it, the slang makes the book more enjoyable- you feel a bit proud that you can finally understand what they are saying, and the story shines through. Good pacing (except for part 3), great use of narrative and language, and an enjoyable, disturbing read."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"This book is a refreshing substitute to the Stanley Kubrick movie with the same name. While Kubrick does follow the story line until omitting the final chapter, his intent seemed to be focused on the shock value of the violence and sexuality of the story, not the message. Readers of A Clockwork Orange will find that Burgess does not put Alex on a pedistal; rather, he tells a story about a hooligan who at first glance deserves the treatment he receives. It is up to the reader to determine if such punishment is an acceptable alternative to current means of criminal correction. I highly recommend A Clockwork Orange to anyone who has seen the movie and wants to better understand what Alex was thinking as well as doing.This book is much more relevant to today's world than 1984, Animal Farm or Brave New World, as Burgess more accurately predicted what the world today looks like than Orwell or Haley. Further, Burgess does not discount the ability for humans to think independently, while Orwell and Haley simply believed we were all incapable for making good judgements. In fact, it is this distinction that enables Burgess to be so accurate about how violent, yet free of dictators, we have become."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I have read thousands of books in my life, and am a very picky person. This book, however, is honestly the best it can get.It is written in a weird and crazy format, but somehow reminds me of the way I write poetry, so I actually enjoyed it. It is written on a blank canvas, with ideas pointing to what it is trying to say, while also being fully open to interpretation. The points about life it raises are remarkable and are hard to go unnoticed. For example, one day my mom asked me if the government should legalize the use of marijuana.I said of course!My mom said that is not Christian of people to do.And I responded: Mom, just because people don't do things they shouldn't, simply because they are not allowed, does that makethem a better person? No, it makes them A Clockwork Orange.And that is what this book is all about, choice and will. Freedom, it's extent and limitations. What do the acts of each and everyone of us really say about the kind of person we are? Does society have any effect on decisions that can lead to happenings not intended upon?The answer is for you to decide by gathering evidence buried deep in the many hidden gems of this story. There is so much to learn from this book, and that is why it is truly unique. But oh ya, there is a heck of a lot of digging to do with this story, and that is why some people hate it so much.*******NOTE: This book is also extremely explicit, repulsive, and spectacularly horrifying. Kind of scarred me for life. Involves grotesque rape and murder scenes, be wary."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange is an interesting book worth reading for almost any (age-appropriate) audience. It's not a long novel, and not a difficult read, aside from the use of unfamilar slang; I never had too much of an issue with the slang, but a few words took some heavy contextual reading to figure out for me, when I first read the book at the age of 14.The beauty of this book is that, despite its simplicity, it still presents philosophical points about morality and the development of a young teen in his maturing to adulthood. The choices he makes have a great impact on his present and his future.I would agree with other reviewers that this is one truly left best to the imagination. If you have the opportunity to read the book before seeing the movie, you won't regret it. The book became one of my favorites before I ever saw the movie, and I don't have much interest in the movie as a result. I don't know what your experience will be if you view the film first, but my recommendation is to read the book first to capture the elegance of Burgess's writing at certain points which, while novel in film, do not strike the same philosophical cords as strongly in my opinion."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I picked this book up after having seen the movie several years ago. Sadly, nearly everything about the movie version of this book is better than the book version.CharactersThe book follows Alex, who is 15 years old when the book begins. He is the leader of a gang which includes himself and 3 \\"droogs.\\" The book is told in 1st person and Alex is a very introspective character who constantly analyzes his situation. He is an intelligent person who spends his time constantly breaking the law and getting into fights with other gangs.SettingThe city where the story takes place isn't really named, not that it's important to the story.PlotWith his law-breaking ways, Alex eventually gets caught by the police and then taken to prison where to avoid his entire sentence he agrees to undergo an experimental treatment that will allow him to return to society \\"cured\\" and able to function as a proper member of society.EnjoymentThis book is odd in many ways, some of which Burgess mentions in his introduction to the version that I have. One of the first things stated in the introduction is that the original American version only had 20 chapters as opposed to the 21 that the author wrote. The movie is also based upon the version containing 20 chapters. In all honesty, the book is better without the 21st chapter, which seems out of place from the direction that the rest of the novel was going. The other part of the book that needs to be mentioned in any review of it is the language used. Alex and his droogs talk in a very heavy slang that is at times very hard to understand. Especially in the earlier sections of the book, I would have had no idea what was going on had I not seen the movie and been able to relate what was going on back to scenes from the movie. Later in the book you are able to understand it easier (while very odd, it is at least consistent) but it's still frustrating to read.Overall GradeThe idea of the story is powerful, but it's not good enough to overcome the dialect flaws and the fact that the last chapter just doesn't fit with the direction the story was going in. I almost hate to say this, but for anyone interested in this I would suggest that they watch the movie rather than read the book.3/10This and all of my reviews are available in my blog. Check out my profile for a link to my blog."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"A Clockwork Orange, written in slang difficult to pick up on at first, is told from the first person by a teen named Alex. The book was set in a futuristic time period in which teenagers created choas and violence in the streets at night.As the book progresses, the recurring theme seems to deal with violence and punishment. When Alex gets arrested after breaking and entering into the old woman's home, he is put in prison. About 2 years later, the government developed a procedure to cure the violent behavior and he is put into a sort of rehab program and tortured with violent vidoes and disturbing pictures. The question remains, does the government have the right to act in this manner and torture it's victims into non-violent behavior? In my opinion, the government can not act all powerful and controlling as it did in A Clockwork Orange. Torturing it's victims, sometimes to the point of suicide, is not the answer. When Alex completed the procedure, what he once loved was completely unbearable to him, such as the music he listened to.As a whole, A Clockwork Orange is an excellent book. Once I began to understand the slang and put it into context, I enjoyed the novel much more. The book was a kind of reality check in that it reminds us of the violence in the world and that no person should be stripped from the things he once loved."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"If you have only seen the Stanley Kubrik film &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, you really must read the book. The movie only shows the first twenty chapters. While the movie is well done, it does not tell the whole story. In most copies of the book, all twenty-one chapters are present. Both the movie and the book are a very insightful and alaramingly realistic satire of modern day adolescents. What Anthony Burgess wrote in 1962 seems very realistic today.While the coded language or slang used by Burgess is often hard to decode, it gets easier as you read further into the book. Alex is a rebellous and often violent teenager. With his gang of thugs, he rules the night with violence and theft. The crime spree continues until Alex is arrested and convicted of murder. At this point, we see a megalomanical government attempt to intervene by committing what we might now call a human rights violation. Through a series of dramatic episodes, classic conditioning cures Alex of his violent tendencies. Alex is then released into a world he is forced to rediscovered. Many of the things he once found pleasurable are now painful. These events nearly cause Alex's demise. It is only through his near death that the conditioning is reversed and his mind is liberated. With a free mind, Alex is left with the prospect of finally having to act as an adult and take on adult responsibilities.The controlling government is eerily reminiscent of books such as &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;Brave New World&quot;. If you enjoyed these books or books similar to these, I suspect you would enjoy reading &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. Even if you personally find the book unreadable, you will at least learn what a &quot;clockwork orange&quot;, the name means."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"At first I felt that this book would be just another highly overrated piece of literature, but I was pleasantly surprised at how wonderful it was written and how innovative the character and storyline is. I would highly recommend this book for a great read that challenges your intellect because the vernacular used in this book is a little out there and at times quite cumbersome."},{"Title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"I read this book after seeing the very well known movie, A Clockwork Orange. The book is even greater than the movie, with a bit of a different ending. Both are excellent works, but I enjoyed the book slightly more.

For a person who is supposed to be an 'Orientalist' he sure does hate his subject. Under cover of being a scholar Lewis promotes his neoconservative ideology as serious learning. This ideology is the guiding force behind the troubles in the Middle East today. Powerful people listen to Lewis and follow his advise on how to deal with the Muslim world. Unfortunately this advice comes from a person who has made it a lifelong mission to destroy and defame the very subject he claims to be an expert of."},{"Title":"The Arabs in History","review":"This book covers the history of the Arabic world since pre Mohammed times to date. Of course, given the length of the book, you cannot expect a very detailed treatment nor an in depth analysis (the same author seems to offer them in other works). But as a concise and first-approach History is very useful. If you just need to get the facts, a road map and a sense of what has been the History of the Middle East, this is a very useful book. It is short, fast to read and opens up your appetite for more. It does not answer questions but it does something more important: it makes you ask lots of questions."},{"Title":"The Arabs in History","review":"Bernard Lewis is probably one of the West's most recognizable and respected experts on the Middle East. Fluent in Arabic and having lived in various countries of the Middle East, he has written a plethora of books on this region for the western reader. THis is one of his more recent works, and provides a quick and digestable history of the Arab people; i.e. the people living in and around the Arabian peninsulaThe book starts by examining the region before Islam. The pagan culture is examined, along with the local geography, climate, and economy. Next, the book shows how Islam came about thru Mohammed and his teachings, and how Islam came to be the predominant religion and social force in the region. The book then goes into the history of the Sunni-Shiite split, the growth of Islamic empires such as the Umayyads, Turks, etc. The book ends with the topic of Western influence in the region, and how this is affected by the Israel question and oil.Overall, the book is fairly easy to read and serves as a good introduction to the region. It is suitable for students in college, high school, or adults, and can be picked up by anyone without prior knowledge of the region."},{"Title":"The Arabs in History","review":"Bernard Lewis is one of the world's foremost scholars on Islamic history and the Middle East. He has written a multitude of books, some dealing with more specific aspects of the Muslim world and it's relations with the West. But here history is written in broad strokes, as Lewis covers Arabic history from pre-Islamic Arabia to the present day. If you are not familiar with the subject matter then this book will be an outstanding primer. But even those already knowledgable will appreciate Lewis' articulate and insightful analysis. Commerce, warfare, religion and the arts are all discussed, with particular attention paid to the grand achievements of the Ummayyad and Abbasid Calipahtes during Islam's \\"Golden Era\\".The reviewer from Scotland that claims Lewis is a neo-con with a bias against his subject clearly has not read the book and has no idea what he is talking about. Lewis is a serious scholar who comes across as highly objective, discussing both the glories and failures in Arab history. He also is one of the few academics able to write in a pleasurable and easy to read style while still maintaining his scholarly credibility This book is a classic of non-fiction and I recommend it to everyone with an interest in history."},{"Title":"The Arabs in History","review":"Lewis's book has been through many editions, and as a short intro to Arab history it is hard to beat. What would not be hard to beat would be the dreadful production values of this OUP paperback edition. It is printed on horrible paper, and the binding keeps falling off. Shame on Oxford UP for putting out such a good book in such a shoddy format."},{"Title":"The Arabs in History","review":"After a short chapter entitled \\"Arabia before Islam,\\" The Arabs in History is essentially a history of Arab Muslims from the time of Muhammad, through the hundreds of years of Islamic imperialism, to the short time of European dominance, to contemporary Islamic nationalism and resurgence.While some will think the Lewis is a neocon who hates Muslims, others will protest that he downplays both the atrocities committed by Muslim rulers, and the humiliation forced on dhimmis down through the centuries (dhimmis were Christians and Jews who were subjugated, humiliated and forced to pay protection money just to save their lives). Either way, the book is a well written and highly informative treatment of a very complex subject by a world-renowned expert in Islamic history."},{"Title":"The Arabs in History","review":"Bernard Lewis is arguably one the finest and thorough writers on Islamic history, society and political history. So no wonder that he wrote this book 50 years ago and since then it has remained in publication around the world.This book is a compact history of the Arabs from pre-Islamic times till present. As most of the history of Arabs before Islam was only oral, few details have reached us. Most of the details, therefore, about Arabs, their culture, traditions, life and times, are of Islamic times. And Bernard Lewis recites his narration in a very non-emotional, matter-of-fact, running commentary style. This is an easy book to read and is fascinating though not detailed. Any book covering over 1500 years of History cannot be enough and Bernard never tries to make it such. He provides glimpses, quotes and general theme and attitude of the Arabs towards other Muslims and towards Christian, Jews and idol worshipers. Throughout the book we can sense his fascination with the nation called Arabs.In all a wonderful, general history book on Arabs and Muslims."},{"Title":"The Arabs in History","review":"very informative, but also incredibly dry until the final chapter in which everything comes together and the relevance of the information in the previous 9 chapters to the current relations between the West and Middle East is explained"},{"Title":"The Arabs in History","review":"If you are like me and you have always wondered about the Arabs, \\"What crawled up their @$$ and died?\\", then this book is for you!Dr. Lewis gets to the point: The Arabs blame others for their own self-made problems. It is a bold statement and like always, Dr. Lewis treads on the subject lightly.The Arabs began as tribal groups showing close genealogical lineage to the Hebrews. The Arabs consolidated their identity with the advent of Mohammed and Islam. Under Mohammed and the first four \\"Rightly Guided Caliphs\\", the Arabs grew into a large land empire that created beautiful architecture, art, poetry, scholarly work, etc. However, the Arab empire contracted almost as soon as it expanded. The fifth Caliph was not as charismatic as the first four, which marks the decline of the power of the Caliph and of the Arabs.The Arab aristocracy clung to power and wealth, where most of their fellow tribesman lived in abject poverty. Baghdad became the seat of the Caliphate and the center of Islamic learning. However, poor irrigation techniques dried up the once fertile crescent and the center of Islam moved to Cairo, which is its current home. Class disparities remain exactly the same.The Arabs had been in decline since the death of the fourth Caliph, moved their capital twice, and had a brief revival of power and competency when they conquered and occupied Spain. The Alhambra at Grenada is a symbol of this triumph. This period, also led to the one and only Jewish golden age in Europe. The dhimmi laws, like all laws, where relaxed or not enforced at all. Jews were given high-ranking cavalry and administrative positions in Arab Muslim-controlled Spain. The Arabs were kicked out of Spain during Spain's reconquista and the Arabs regressed back to a state of hopeless poverty, powerlessness and backwardness.The Turks eventually succeeded the Arabs in controlling the Caliphate. The Ottoman Turks controlled the land of the Middle East, where the Arabs resided and continued on with their decay. Dr. Lewis argues that the it was the backward, poor and deeply declining state of the Arabs that brought the Crusaders and the Mongol invaders. It has prefect logic: conquerers attempt to conquer vulnerable people and lands, not strong peoples who can defend their land. The occasional claim that the Arabs and the Caliphate went into decline because of a two-pronged attack by Crusaders and Mongols is refuted (I believe accurately) by Dr. Lewis in this book. Dr. Lewis argues that the institution of the Caliphate was already so weakened that by the time the invaders got there, they put a nail in the heart of something that was already dead. Dr. Lewis argues that the Arabs have themselves to blame for their own weaknesses and poverty during this time period.When the Ottoman empire collapsed, the land of the Middle East came under the control of the British and the French empires. The Arabs appealed their case successfully to the Germans, who were anti-colonialist.When the British and French empires collapsed, the Nazis (who were Arab allies) lost the war, the Arab states became independent, plus one Jewish state. The Arabs were humiliated that their own state of vulnerability, poverty, backwardness and decay could not only fend off European colonialists, but they could not even defeat a gang of \\"dirty miserable Jews\\". It was the ultimate shame and humiliation for the Arabs that they had become so weak and vulnerable that they couldn't even win against Jews. They have never gotten over this feeling of shame, which has boiled over into a wider Middle East conflict.Dr. Lewis argues that the only solution to the greater Middle East problem will involve Arabs owning up to their own faults and stop blaming others for their problems. I would also like to add that the extreme victim mentality is a common attribute of aggressors. I believe that if you can remove the sense of extreme victimdom from the Arabs, then you will remove their aggression as well. I agree with Mr. Lewis that the first step to peace will involve Arabs taking responsibility for their own problems."},{"Title":"The Arabs in History","review":"Bernard Lewis here in this book which was written more than a half century ago, rides through the history of arabs very quickly like an express train.The book is excellent for someone who wants to know about who & what are arabs & their history in a brief way, but for those who want more detailed backgrounds, this book wil only serve as an appetizer.Many attack Bernard lewis for inaccuracies, some even were angered by a single line & called for him to check facts albeit the facts were unattainable as it was purely dogmatic belief, undoubtedly some are unjust, how can anyone write about who sits next to God & call it a fact? unless you believe that every word uttered in the old/new testament is asbolute truth & needs no further research to prove but then its called belief not facts.Bernard lewis has his detractors as any serious scholar expects, this book here is not definitive but an interesting read for those blind on the subject."},{"Title":"The Arabs in History","review":"This is a decent attempt to reveal the history of a very misunderstood place. Lewis, however, does little to destroy the misunderstanding...only presenting some facts with some questionable interpretations."},{"Title":"Hakon of Rogen's Saga","review":"Haakon of Rogen's Saga is a mesmerizing book of unusual literary beauty for grade 5 and up. Viking culture is made human in this story of a young boy caught in a web of jealousy and deceit. He learns about true courage and loyalty as well as the power of compassion. Vikings are most often presented as wooden, valueless monsters who fascinate for their unadulterated evil. This book will help readers to consider other posibilities. I have used this book as a lead-in to studies of William the Conqueror and the Middle Ages. It is wonderful.(Haugaard also wrote another novel about the last Viking colonists stranded on Greenland.)"},{"Title":"Hakon of Rogen's Saga","review":"A great story of the Vikings. No, not those Vikings. The Norse raiders and pirates who were a menace to Europe from eighth to the eleventh centuries. The Vikings were a fatalistic people who believed in personal honor in battle. They're like the Klingons of Star Trek. It's the story of a boy who becomes embroiled in a family feud. No, not the one with Richard Dawson. Hakon's father kidnaps a woman named Thora Magnusdaughter. Her father, enraged, leads an invasion to take her home. Hakon and his friend, Helga, the daughter of his former wet nurse, Gunhild, are caught in the middle of it. Gunhild, like the rest of his father's servants, including Rark, are slaves. When his father's killed, Hakon becomes the new king of Rogen. Rark rallies the army of his father to defeat the invaders. Hakon's uncle is partly to blame for the treachery. He wanted the throne of Rogen for himself. Haugaard's Viking verse comes close to approximating the real thing. Read this book for the rest of the story. The Vikings gave Russia its name, they ruled England, and they were the imperial bodyguard of the Byzantine emperors. This would be an excellent introduction to Byzantine and English history. Most people think the Viking era ended with the Battle of Hastings. It didn't. It ended with the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Harold II defeated Harold Hardrata and his own brother, Tostig. Then he was defeated by William the Conqueror. The English Danelaw and Normandy were both founded by the Vikings."},{"Title":"Hakon of Rogen's Saga","review":"No, not those Vikings. The ones who raided the coasts of Europe from England and Scotland to the Mediterranean, and even served as the bodyguards of the Byzantine emperors. In Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, Turkey, there's a piece of graffiti that says &quot;Halfdan was here.&quot; The Vikings founded colonies in Greenland, Iceland, and probably Newfoundland. Their reign of terror lasted over three hundred years. The Vikings ruled England off and on. I first read this book back in the '70s. A must read for those who love history. I recommend it to all college students. Don't dismiss this classic historical novel as a &quot;kid's book.&quot; (Haugaard also wrote a book set in Roman-occupied Palestine called The Rider and His Horse.) I recommend this as well. If you can find it here. If not, then go to a used bookstore."},{"Title":"Hakon of Rogen's Saga","review":"Hakon of Rogen's saga is a wonderful example of fine literature for kids my age (I'm 13)! I loves the book. In fact , all of Erik Christian Haugaard's novel are wonderful and I want to read them all. Reading the book was like being there, right at that moment. I highly suggest this book!"},{"Title":"Hakon of Rogen's Saga","review":"Hakon of Rogen's Saga is a classic children's book that has stood the test of time. I have seen it recommended on reading lists for children by those who place an emphasis on quality or \\"living\\" books that aren't \\"twaddle.\\" In other words, quality literature. As the author himself states in the preface, \\"It was not written for \`youth,' in the sense that I have blunted my pen before I started. I abhor those writers who have not the skill to keep the attention of adults, and therefore think themselves equipped to write for children. I have done my best, and I leave you to be my critic.\\" And, I am one very satisfied critic.The book is set in the Viking period on the island of Rogen. The main character, a boy named Hakon is the son of the chieftan, whose mother died in childbirth. When Hakon is about 10 or 12, his father kidnaps as his bride the daughter of a powerful chieftan. When his stepmother's family retaliates the following year, Hakon is left an orphan and goes through many trials in seeking his manhood and his birthright, Rogen.I found this book to be enjoyable reading for me as an adult, and I have no doubt that my 8-year-old son will enjoy it as well. He reads on a 6th grade level, and while he may not be able to understand every single individual word, he can understand and appreciate the story. I also think this would be an appropriate read-aloud for lower elementary years, but in general it would be best suite to upper elementary school or middle school years.Some themes to be aware of. There are several battle scenes, and Hakon is hit by his uncle several times. There are no particularly graphic depictions, they aren't very frequent, and are very appropriate to the time period. I would not have any trouble reading these to my 8 yo and 6 yo. One of the more graphic descriptions follows as an example: \\"Then swiftly, before anyone could stop him, he thrust his sword through Bjorn. \`Brave man,\\" Bjorn muttered; then sighing, he spoke his last words, \`Now I shall sleep.' Blood flowed from his mouth, and his body twisted and fell with a dull thud from his bench to the floor.\\" Personally, I don't find that really anymore gruesome than telling children Hansel & Gretel where the witch pushes the children into the oven. In addition, there are some passing references to the Viking's religious beliefs, nothing extensive enough to bother me as a conservative Christian parent, though I would discuss it as reading aloud or before giving it to an independent reader.A good feel was given for the time period, the practical aspects of everyday life, the culture, the harshness. Besides being informative, the story was entertaining and made the reader want to follow along with Hakon. I would definitely recommend this as a children's book on the Viking period, especially for homeschooling families."},{"Title":"Childhood","review":"I was expecting more of a laugh. It was mildly humorous. I agreed with his observation about children nowadays lacking creativity as far as free play is concerned. Too many kids play electronics and neglect their childhood. Cosby said: \\"I was a child when hand-eye coordination was needed only to stick your hand in someone else's eye.\\" I loved his parents comments whenever he was up to something.

That bandage gotta be coverin' somethin'--besides your entire brain.\\""},{"Title":"Childhood","review":"The books written by Bill Cosby give unique and humorous insight into his chosen topic. While Fatherhood became his best selling book, little is ever mentioned of Childhood. While this book has the standard format of most Cosby books, it does not measure up to the standard of his other books.Childhood is a brief chronology of some of Cosby's childhood adventures. Periodically, he uses his own children as a means of comparison to demonstrate the changes in the stage of life known as childhood. Some of the more entertaining stories that I related to included childhood crushes, finding games in most any object, and terrorizing substitute teachers. I was particularly amused by the Spanish Fly story and the hose-ball games. In hindsight, children of years gone by could have been amused by almost anything.While the book had its moments, it never made me laugh the way some of Cosby's other books did. I think this might be a book that only true Cosby fans would enjoy. I believe there is good reason that this book is not as famous as some of his other books. It is just not as good."},{"Title":"Childhood","review":"Coz is on a roll in this one. I laughed all the way through.

For anyone who was ever a child, this book is well worth the time to read."},{"Title":"Childhood","review":"\\"Childhood\\" started off rather funny, but then lost steam as it progressed. Bill Cosby is a very funny person, and I've enjoyed his stand-up comedy about childhood and parenting, but reading about it is very different, and I felt he tried too hard to be funny. I sometimes got confused at what age he was speaking about in his childhood and sometimes it all just felt muddled. I also wished he had either solely spoken about his childhood, or his own children, as they transitions into both were a bit choppy. I \\"sorta\\" recommend"},{"Title":"Childhood","review":"...and that is a good thing. In this book, his fourth, Cosby again collects some of his material from his comic routines to compare and contrast his childhood with that of his children. I have alway found Cosby at his funniest whenever he shares the misadventures of his youth in the projects. The book also has a warm, nostalgic feel for a time long past. Sadly some of my favorite routines (i.e. \\"Chicken Heart\\" and the one where he and Weird Harold stay far longer at a horror movie than they should have) are absent, something that keeps the book from getting five stars. Nonetheless the book is a laughter inducing read. Recommended."},{"Title":"As It Is, Vol. 2","review":"This is a good book on the ultimate view of Dzogchen, Mahamudra, and Madhyamaka, but not, I think, the author's best work. I liked volume I (and \\"Rainbow Painting\\") better. But, it's certainly worth your time reading it. The title of this book reflects its main tenet (p. 97 \\"nothing needs to be accepted or rejected; it is already perfect \\"as it is.\\" i.e. the title of book). It's also taken from a quotation (pp. 140-1) from Padmasambhava's \\"Lamrim Yeshe Nyingpa\\" -\\"Empty cognizance of one taste, suffused with knowing,Is your unmistaken nature, the uncontrived original state.When not altering what is, allow it to be as it is,And the awakened state is right now spontaneously present.\`As it is here means actuality. \`Actuality' means seeing directly how it is, not as an idea or a concept. This matches the philosophical (and Rosicrucian) use of Actuality for \\"what is\\" vs. Reality for our perceptions of \\"what is.\\"Interestingly, the title of the publishing company similarly reflects the writings of Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche: (e. g. on p. 94) Rangjung Yeshe = \\"self-existing wakefulness.\\" This is reminiscent of Tulku Urgyen's son Drubwang Tsoknyi's book \\"Present Fresh Wakefulness.\\"This view is similarly described in Kagyu Mahamudra, Madhyamaka (The Middle Way philosophy), and Nyingma Dzogchen. The author describes these similarities in several places in the book (e. g. pp. 97, 122 &. 233). He also includes quotations from the three traditions throughout the book (e. g. pp. 117-8, 207, etc.) and even some stories on Ch&ouml; (d) on pp. 222-3.However, the first half dozen chapters are considerably redundant with volume I as well as with each other. Repetition may be beneficial in order for the reader/practitioner to absorb the view at a deeper than intellectual level. Chapter 7 (pp. 127-143, \\"The Highway of the Victorious Ones\\") is very different from the rest of the book-it's my favorite chapter! In it, the author includes a concise yet enlightening description of Trekch&ouml; and T&ouml;gal (the 2 main Dzogchen practices) on pages 136-7. He has a poetic way of pithy description of the essence of the teachings (somewhat like a koan), such as on pp. 141-2:\\"See the view of no viewing.Train in the meditation with nothing meditated upon.Carry out the conduct of nondoing.Achieve the fruition in which there is no thing attained.\\"On the down side, it is difficult to tell if he is using mythological beliefs just for illustration or not. For example, on p. 117 he uses the example of insects born only from heat and moisture and describes the physical activities of obstructing gods on p. 221. On the other hand, he clears up the question of life after death logically: (p. 225): \\"mind is not some \`thing' that can die. The reason why there can be a succession of lives is because of this mind. If mind could die, there would be no rebirth\\" and (p. 228): \\"In actuality, death is only the death of the body; mind does not die.\\"He also provided some interesting quotes for my collection:p. 118 \\"It is not all right to let simplicity be fettered by complexity.\\"p. 149 \\"a thought is simply the extroverted expression of knowing, of awareness.\\"p. 234 Tibetan Proverb: \\"The wise may still find truth in the words of a rascal\\" which is quite similar to the Western Proverb: The wise can learn even from a fool, but a fool cannot learn even from the wise. (Oscar Wilde and others).Finally, pp. 225-8 Chapter 14 \\"Death Row\\" is an actual transmission from the author to a prison inmate and serves as a very good summary of book."},{"Title":"As It Is, Vol. 2","review":"This book was not written for the novice or the merely curious.

This is not a book based upon previously unpublished photos of an OSS officer attached to Patton. Instead, the photos in the book are based primarily on archival photos of divisions that served under Patton (e.g., the 2nd and 4th Armored Divisions). No credit is given anywhere in the book to any photos by any OSS officer, or any chief of intelligence, of Patton's.Second, the book does not cover just the period from \\"D-Day to Victory.\\" Rather, about 40% of the book covers Patton from his experiences in World War I through the invasion of Sicily and the slapping incidents that almost doomed his career. (I.e., pages 1-64 cover Patton prior to D-Day; and pages 65-158 cover Patton from D-Day to his funeral.)Third, the book is very poorly written. Many sentences (and even entire paragraphs) do not make sense. There are numerous sentence fragments. There are numerous obvious editing errors (such as, on many occasions a sentence will use the article \\"the\\" twice in a row: E.g., \\"The drive continued to the the river.\\" or \\"The crews needed the the rest.\\"). There are numerous obvious errors in dates (such as, \\"in January 1945 Patton was called to England to prepare for the D-Day landings in June 1944\\").Fourth, many captions for the photos misidentify the vehicles pictured or provide an incomplete description (e.g., an M3 tank is misidentified as an \\"M4 tank\\").Fifth, the photo captions in the book contain innumerable quotations from reports by American officers in the field on the superiority of the German tanks over the American tanks while the text of the book repeatedly claims Patton's tanks routinely defeated the German tanks (it seems about 5 German tanks were blown up for every 1 American tank). The book contains no explanation for this discrepancy.The book does contain some interesting photos, such as a picture of the damage to the 1939 Cadillac in which Patton was injured after the war (which injuries paralyzed him from the neck down and lead to his death). In addition, the text of the book overall does a credible job of providing a brief biography of Patton and his exploits, provided the reader can get through the sloppy writing and editing.

There are several pictures (half from museums), but many times the captions don't really match the pictures they accompany. My favority part of the book was the last chapter, which relays quotes from Patton on leadership and adds a more personal touch to what is otherwise mostly a history lesson. If you are curious about Patton, this is a good place to start.

I'd recommend it to anyone who needs a little help with Windows 98. Good price too."},{"Title":"Windows 98 User Manual","review":"The clever and knowing subtitle, &quot;The manual you should have received with Windows 98,&quot; combined with the good-looking and orderly layout, drew me to this book. It is clearly intended for the neophyte, and I bought it when I switched from Mac to Windows 98. Like many new users I was mystified - and frustrated - by various aspects of Windows and looked to the index for help on specifics. Nearly every time, this book failed to address my question. Now that I'm fairly competent this book is useful, but would not recommend for the Mac user new to Windows. The author has not adequately anticipated the most common new-user emergencies, and the &quot;Troubleshooting&quot; sections - that you turn to in a bit of a panic - are quite meager."},{"Title":"Department Thirty","review":"I don't about what the last person thought, but I didn't find this book too melodramatic at all. I found it intense, suspenseful, and utterly riveting. I read a LOT of thrillers, and can be jaded at times, but Kent's book puts a lot of bigger names to shame. The story has terrific plotting, but some pretty good human insights as well. I think Kent is a better stylist than some of the big guys like Vince Flynn, etc. who are now doing political thrillers. I hope to read a lot more about Dept. 30 in the future."},{"Title":"Department Thirty","review":"Kent's novel starts out with a bang and immediately thrusts you into edge of you seat intrigue and excitement. It's twists and turns that while interestingly written, tend to be predictable. Unfortunately predictable is preferable to what comes later. Later we are treated to plot holes, which can only leave you to wonder if there was a change made regarding a sub-character halfway through the writing of novel, or if he simply missed filling in the holes in a rush to finish. (At least that was what I was left wondering.) Still the greatest insult is towards the end of the book where it begins to read, not like an original novel, but closer to a script for a bad episode of 'General Hospital'."},{"Title":"Department Thirty","review":"This is David Kent's first book? He writes like a seasoned professional - and what a story!There are so many twists and turns and I feel that writing about any of them would be a spoiler. The basic plot is about a young man who loses his parents in a double-suicide that was just a tragic prelude to a harrowing story of deep secrets, conspiracy, and frightening possibilities. You DO ask yourself, &quot;Who knows? Maybe it IS possible,&quot; as Big Brother gets bigger with each passing day.It is also refreshing, by the way, to have a thriller like this set in the Midwest. There are only so many ways you can describe JFK International, Manhattan, etc. and we've read them all. This is all-new geographical territory for most of us who read this genre and David Kent has done a masterful job.So.....when is the next book, Mr. Kent?"},{"Title":"Department Thirty","review":"I found Department Thirty on Sunday afternoon. Started reading on Monday around noon. Read it nearly non-stop, I did have to sleep, and finished it around noon on Tuesday. What a read!Normally, I do not care for contemporary conspiracy stories, but this was way beyond the ordinary! It is written well enough to take the reader beyond &quot;reality&quot;, and put you into Ryan's reality. I really got to caring about Ryan, and wanted to know what could happen next!Being from Edmond, OK, I could appreciate the details Kent put into the story. It was like being in a Fantasy world I knew.Thanks, Kent, for a very good time!"},{"Title":"Department Thirty","review":"As an avid reader, averaging 2-3 books per week, I'm always looking for new authors. Boy, did I find one in David Kent!! As far as I'm concerned this debut puts him on the level with some of the popular writters in the thriller genre. I'm not going to go into the story it's self but am strongly urging anyone who sees this at their local book store to give it a try, you won't be disappointed. I finished this in one sitting and sat back and asked myself \\"What if?\\" I can hardly wait for his next book!!!! Keep em' coming Mr. Kent."},{"Title":"Department Thirty","review":"I thought that this book was just okay and that there were a few problems with it that prevented this book from being great. For one, department 30 itself. Its a secret organization, but with offices in the Oklahoma justice department with many of the characters knowing of it. Quite a contradiction i think. I thought the characters were as some had said, too spontaneously confrontational with each other, and their dialog lacked realistic banter. It is hard not to be able to follow the plot as it is repeated many many times throughout the book. However, some authors try to twist and turn the plot so much in order to create suspense that the \\"rollercoaster\\" takes an unrealistic turn. I love the idea of government conspiracies, but it is hard to find many good fiction books that accurately and suspensefully weave that into a great mystery/suspense story. Most just are just comical attempts. So, with that, im not going to say this book is terrible or horrible, but i have read better ones. I will probably read the Mesa Conspiracy to see if the author can weave a good tail and save the series. Otherwise, dont expect to be blown away."},{"Title":"Department Thirty","review":"Somewhere there is a story struggling to get out, but this book just didn't work for me. The main reason is I did not like the main characters Ryan and Cass. Just when things seem to be settling down into a rhythm one or both of them would go ballistic.Basing a plot on government conspiracies is fine. There is plenty of material out there to work with, but this book begins with an intriguing Ludlum like premise that started to morph into somethign akin to the Fugitive then drives right over a cliff.I stuck with most of the way, but finally gave up around page 300 and the upteenth inane character drama."},{"Title":"Department Thirty","review":"I met David Kent at a book signing. He's a nice guy, but he can't write. This book has so many laborious descriptions from the buttons on Kelly's jacket to the hysterical and ludricous sex scene. Honestly, I can't imagine who Kent is sleeping with that gives him these strange ideas on how women derive pleasure.The laborious descriptions obviously tripped Kent up because I found two glaring contradictions in the text.

Both his Mom and Dad act strangly as they drive him to their suburban home in Edmond. They send him out on an errand and while he's in the spice aisle of the supermarket, they commit suicide.Seven years later, a certified letter catches up to Ryan in Pensacola, FL. The day before he flew out to Oklahoma, his Mom had sent him a clipping of a symphony review and a piece of paper with the name \\"Department Thirty\\" and an Oklahoma City phone number.Ryan's calling the number starts him on a wild chase to find the true identity of his parents and himself. For a first novel, the story is well-written. Characters are interesting and believable.I can attest to the fact that Kent's writing does improve with further books. By accident, I read \\"Black Mesa Conspiracy\\" first and could scarcely put it down. While \\"Department Thirty\\" is not quite as suspenseful, I also recommend it and look forward to reading more of Kent's work."},{"Title":"Department Thirty","review":"This is a good book and an enjoyable read. It's paced well and I personally thought the characters were interesting, especially Kelly and the old snitch, Cyrus. I'm glad to see political thrillers making a comeback--they just about got swept away by the techno-babble of Clancy and his ilk. This is a story about people in extreme circumstances. Ryan Elder finds lies everywhere he goes--nothing he knows is what he thinks it is. If that's too melodramatic for you, then go buy some Joyce Carol Oates or something &quot;literary&quot; where nothing really happens to the characters!Oh, I like the Midwest setting too. It's fresh and different from DC, NY, Boston, Florida, etc.I recommend this book and look forward to the next by Mr. Kent."},{"Title":"Department Thirty","review":"This thriller by David Kent (Kent Anderson) has all the components of a good espionage thriller. Ryan Elder's parents commit suicide and he goes on a seven year binge of drugs, failed jobs and acting out in anger. When a package comes from his Mother, sent just days prior to the suicide, he is instructed to call a mysterious number. What ensues is a trail that leads him back to Oklahoma and one that leads him to realize that his parents were not all they seemed. Though the plots drags in places, this in an excellent first novel."},{"Title":"Department Thirty","review":"What if everything you thought you knew about your background, your heritage and your parents was wrong? How would you feel? And what would you do to discover the truth? This is ultimately the premise of DEPARTMENT THIRTY, David Kent's debut novel. And if DEPARTMENT THIRTY suffers at times from minor flaws, it is nonetheless a compelling and ultimately satisfying read.DEPARTMENT THIRTY is primarily the story of Ryan Elder, a radio journalist who has been bouncing from job to job for seven years. His inability to remain at one station for very long is the result of a combination of bad luck, uncompromising journalistic principles, and personality flaws. Elder tends to get a bit explosive at times. This is somewhat understandable --- I mean, if your parents committed suicide, practically in front of you, you'd probably go a bit off the rails yourself. Elder, as DEPARTMENT THIRTY begins, is investigating the story of his career when his day suddenly and inexplicably. It turns out that the target of Elder's investigation is related to the owner of the radio station that employs him, and all it takes is a phone call down the chain of command to get him fired.When Elder returns home, he finds a mysterious letter waiting for him, an envelope that was mailed to him from his mother --- the day before she and his father committed suicide, seven years previously. The envelope contains newspaper clippings and a piece of paper with the words &quot;Department Thirty&quot; along with a telephone number. Elder dials the number, an act that sets him on a trail back to the home that he shared with his parents in Oklahoma City and that within 24 hours will cause him to be running for his life from an unknown assassin and an agency hidden deep within the Federal government. With the assistance of an enigmatic young woman dealing with tragic circumstances of her own, Elder discovers the truth about his parents and the secret life they left behind over a quarter-century before that now threatens not only their son, but also the entire nation.There are problems with DEPARTMENT THIRTY. It is easy to sympathize with Elder, but it is extremely difficult to like him. There are additionally some aspects of the plot that stretch the possibility of suspending disbelief to the breaking point, particularly a surprise occurrence that takes place near the end of the book.Kent does an excellent job though of keeping Elder in dire straits throughout most of the novel and accordingly keeping the level of suspense high and, most importantly, the reader turning pages. DEPARTMENT THIRTY is ultimately a promising debut.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"Department Thirty","review":"I was looking forward to a good old fashioned adventure/mystery. What I wound up with was an overdramatic Lifetime movie with a whole lot of unnecessary filler. When it wasn't being dramatic it was predictable and a shade ridiculous. I did enjoy the overall story that put Ryan Elder in search of the something in the present to understand his past. The mysterious Department 30 was a great touch which I think should have been explored a little further.

There were so many twists and turns that I was constantly surprised. The plot is complicated but well written and easy to follow, with non-stop action. The characters are complex and interesting. Since I live in Oklahoma City, the setting for the book, I especially appreciated the accurate descriptions of my city and enjoyed visualizing the action in a familiar setting.As a writer, I have great appreciation for the skill that Kent demonstrated. It's hard to believe this is a first book. I will eagerly read anything else he writes.

All I can say is that this book beats a lot of works by John Grisham, or at the very least, a great contender in the mystery department. The first 100 pages might be a little so-so, but hang on to your hat after that, it flies by as I blew out the book mainly in two days. Outstanding finish; didn't leave me disappointed in the least, a very excellent book which I hope to see in movie form - done correctly of course (i.e. \\"The Firm\\" - twisted that book in film).Props to the Author - you deserve it.

When I read the back cover and saw that this was his debut book, I was intrigued when I couldn't put it down. Not too many writers grab my attention like that.

The author has thegift of using famous children's classic to convey the physics conceptsin a skilful and humourous way in helping readers to conceptualise thelaws of Physics."},{"Title":"Once Upon a Universe: Not-so-Grimm tales of Cosmology","review":"Once Upon a Universe, by Robert Gilmore, was a creative and interesting way to explain complex scientific ideas. This book is a mix of fairy tales that includes well-known characters with interesting names. Some of the tales include \\"Snow White and the particularly little people\\", \\"Waking Beauty\\", and \\"Cinderenda and the Death of Stars\\". Each story begins with a well-known fairy tale and sends its protagonist on a journey to achieve knowledge. Then the story ends with the character learning something extravagant about the Universe or the things inside it. This book did include some ideas that are difficult to grasp and is not an easy read, so do not be fooled by its length. It may be a short book, but it took a long time to actually understand what was being taught.Overall, this was not my favorite book but it was interesting and worth the effort. Its creative ideas made it in a strange way fun to read. It will certainly help students trying to understand quantum physics and such, so if your looking for a book as a teacher then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Once Upon a Universe: Not-so-Grimm tales of Cosmology","review":"Once Upon a Universe, although it uses a creative way to teach its readers high level science theories, was not a very interesting book. Its flawed adaptations of fairy tales made it a difficult book to enjoy and really get into. Such adaptations include \\"Snow White and the Particularly Little People\\", which teaches the reader about particles and atoms. The less-than-captivating adaptations became nearly monotonous, as Gilmore occasionally went into excessive details concerning each subject. In conclusion, although it was a failed attempt at twisting fairy tales, it did teach me interesting scientific information. I would not recommend this book to any except those people who are excessively into science."},{"Title":"The Inner Life and the Tao-Teh-King","review":"This is a classic in my book.

Reading WHAT THE NIGHT TELLS THE DAY is a bit like sitting at the knee of an old storyteller and listening carefully to his tale. Like all reminiscences, this one tends to drift a bit. Stories come out to startle the reader, and and then retreat, changing into something else - a philosophical discourse, perhaps. Yet, somehow, the slight unevenness in tone seems to make the book all the more authentic. Disconcerting for purists, the book's &quot;identity&quot; might annoy some readers. The cover declares it to be a novel, but the inside jacket tell us that the writer has turned from his usual fiction and has written a classical autobiography. The problem here may be that no one knows how to classify this beautiful tale. But the style is truly one of memoir; it is not long within the pages of this book that the reader forgets about the question of fiction vs. memoir and gets lost in the power of the writing. It no longer matters whether the words are near truth or disguised truth. One just feels the characters and, most importantly, the feeling. Bianciotti's strength is an almost pastoral sense of portraying the personal. He renders an interior life for an outside audience in a way not unlike a minister interpreting the Bible for his/her parishoners. The book shuld be read by anyone wanting to read prose of tremendous power and by readers interested in the entire emotional package of the homosexual experience, not necessarily the erotic. Bianciotti does all of this well, but not as well as Yukio Mishima who covered much the same material in his classic novel, CONFESSIONS OF A MASK. The two books have similarities, but Mishima's is far superior, and as well as allowing the reader inside of the mind of someone coming to terms with their sexuality, Mishima gives much more of a feeling of Japan than Bianciotti manages of Argentina. Still, WHAT THE NIGHT TELLS THE DAY is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cultural Atlas of Spain & Portugal","review":"This book is excellent.

I use the term pamphlet as this text actually contains only 12 pages (not 40 - and in large font print no less!) dealing with the background/history/rumors of The Church of Scientology and L.

It is also a book of human triumph over one of Mother nature's most trying environments on Earth. The easy-going narration of the events in William L. Manly's life draw you into the scenery, the essence of the beautiful, yet enigmatic desert which lures yet imposes such harsh demands on the body and soul.

Budge immediately makes a friend, but Libby is shunned by local girls Sally Evans and Pixie Cross, who are faithful to the former minister's daughter, Lulu Burgoyne. The beautiful and remarkable Lulu once lived in Libby's house, and before moving to New York, instructed her friends to keep secret the exclusive club the three girls founded.Libby finds the words \\"Lulu's Window\\" written on a wall in her attic and tries to figure out what they mean. When she finally discovers the hidden clubhouse, Lulu tells Sally and Pixie to abandon it and build a new one. Their new venue choice is unfortunate, as they damage property belonging to a church deacon, Mr. Glenn. Mr. Glenn demands that Libby identify the culprits, she refuses, and Mr. Glenn withdraws his financial contribution for the church's new roof. All ends well, as the two girls finally confess their misdeeds. Through a series of unrelated adventures, they realize that Libby is thoughtful, kind and generous, and Sally and Pixie finally decide that the bossy, selfish, and exclusionary Lulu is undeserving of their loyalty.This is a pretty good look at the sort of petty miseries middle school girls inflict on one another. My one concern is that Lulu's long distance dominance over Sally and Pixie is implausible, as is Libby's passive acceptance of the situation. Sally is such a spineless character that Libby's interest in her friendship is baffling, and Libby, except for a few moments of snarkiness, meekly allows herself to be mistreated by Sally and Pixie. They exclude Libby from a clubhouse that is located in her own home, a clubhouse they enter by trespassing! Do these two girls represent the only social opportunities in town?The book is also mildly dated because more than one character seems to view beauty as a desirable trait when seeking friendships. This was probably not the author's intention, but it certainly comes across that way, as in this passage, which starts when Libby's mother says:**********\\"Mrs. Evans who lives next door has a boy and a girl, too, about Libby's age.\\"Libby caught her breath. She had heard about this Evans girl before from her mother. A week ago Mr. and Mrs. Barnes had gone to Danforth to settle the new house. They had met many of the neighbors then. The Evans girl had been mentioned several times since.\\"She's a pretty girl,\\" said Mrs. Barnes. \\"I'm sure you'll like her, Libby.\\"Libby's heart thumped uncomfortably. It was all very well to talk about her liking the Evans girl. But would the Evans girl like her? That, in Libby's opinion, was the important question. She leaned forward suddenly and took a look in the mirror above her father's head.A pair of dark blue eyes, brown hair that fell in straight locks almost to her shoulders and an oval face with a distressingly snub nose were reflected in the small mirror. Libby felt that it was an everyday sort of face. No one would make the mistake of calling her pretty, thought Libby with a little sigh. She wrinkled her nose at herself and settled back in her corner of the seat.**********By a strange coincidence, the prettiest girls (the green-eyed Lulu, who never appears, and blonde Sally Evans) are the two least worthy of Libby's friendship, but the author never develops the theme of internal versus external beauty, and this reader was left dissatisfied.Still, the discovery of a hidden clubhouse is an engaging idea, and I can understand the appeal of this rare, but only moderately entertaining story."},{"Title":"Yasu and the Strangers","review":"This was my favorite book growing up.

If you read the recipes it's almost like they don't take their own advice, for one. There seem to be a high portion of beef and potatoe recipes compared to the small amount of space devoted to recipes. And if you already have a lot of cookbooks there is nothing new and exciting here. I already have many many recipes for pizza, chicken nuggets, fish sticks, peanut noodles... etc, and actually some of mine are healthier than theirs if I am understanding their advice right.Buy this book for the advice, and another good book for healthy recipes and you are all set to change the way your family eats."},{"Title":"The Healthy Family Cookbook","review":"This is a healthy cookbook that kids will actually eat from! They have lots of practical advice and you don't need fancy techniques or equipment. We've been eating from this cookbook every night and it's gotten us to try some healthy foods and grains we would never have eaten before. We're cookbook addicts and this is one of the best."},{"Title":"The Healthy Family Cookbook","review":"While the cookbook isn't bad by any means, it has a LOT of fish recipes in it. We don't eat fish, so a lot of them cannot be used by our family :( I decided to pass this on to a family member who will use it more extensively than we would."},{"Title":"Newton's Madness: Further Tales of Clinical Neurology","review":"Dr. Klawans articulately presents several more neurological case studies in this follow-up book to Toscanini's Fumble. Not all of them involve his own patients - some discuss historical figures such as Isaac Newton or the biblical figure of Joshua. Dr. Klawans' thorough studies and insightful commentary make this enjoyable reading for medical professionals and laymen alike. I think it slightly better than Toscanini's Fumble, even though both are occasionally given to hubris and a little too much self-certainty. The chapters are not too long and the writing is crisp, so this would make a good Christmas or birthday present."},{"Title":"Newton's Madness: Further Tales of Clinical Neurology","review":"I got this book at my local public library from a general search I was doing in the catalog. I enjoy books in the vein of neurological anecdotes like those of Oliver Sacks.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and decided early on the I would be sure to write a review to share this find with other readers.I was thrilled by this book. Each of the cases presented is well written and interesting. He tells the story of his acquaintance with a subject or theme, events surrounding the case, what conclusions he considered, what diagnosis he chose; also includes historical information on many neurological diseases covered.The author manages to include a distinctly human touch without straying long from the science. A bonus was the &quot;author's notes&quot; at the end of each chapter. These included things like follow-up reading, post mortems, related tales, retrospective comments."},{"Title":"Newton's Madness: Further Tales of Clinical Neurology","review":"This is an interesting book about neurology. I read it over the weekend and totally enjoyed it. Dr. Klawans described 22 neurological cases ranging from common diseasess such as stroke, Parkinson's , Huntington's , multiple sclerosis, migraine to rare medical problem like mercury poisoning, cluster headache, or CJD. The book is easy to read. Highly recommended to students in health professions."},{"Title":"Newton's Madness: Further Tales of Clinical Neurology","review":"An excellent book, well-described by the other reviewers. I have only one quibble -- the author's insinuation (in the footnotes to the \\"cocaine\\" chapter) that Sherlock Holmes might not have been a real person. Who could possibly doubt it?"},{"Title":"Newton's Madness: Further Tales of Clinical Neurology","review":"Here Klawans presents another batch of interesting tales of interesting patients with some speculation from his part as to the mechanisms underlying the disorders. We meet famous people (like Newton) with possible diagnoses, well people with no diseases and a young patient whose treatment sheds light on the relevance of guinea pigs' jumping when one gives them too much serotonin.He writes for the lay audience, but there is much here to interest the professional reader too.

The story begins in South America and moves to France and both places are described in loving detail. The father had first left Europe to avoid serving in the military and he returns, unknowingly, in time for his son to become involved in World War I. The description of the changing opinions and moods in Paris were fascinating. How many times have people thought a war would be over in a matter of weeks? The insight into pre World War I Germany was very educational. Many of the characteristics that I had assumed arose with the Nazis prior to WWII were clearly present much earlier. This book should not be missed by anyone interested in history or human nature."},{"Title":"The four horsemen of the Apocalypse: (Los cuatro jinetes del Apocalipsis)","review":"This novel concerns the Desnoyers family, who move from Argentina to France just before the start of World War I. Desnoyers is a Frenchman, his wife is Argentinian and his brother-in-law is German. When tensions between Germany and France mount at the beginning of the war, the already difficult family relationships are strained. Sisters cannot understand their differing loyalties. Desnoyers cannot accept the laid-back lifestyle of his son, who prefers to tango and does not jump to enlist in the army. This son, Julio, is later devestated by a broken romance and joins the army in an attempt to heal himself. The war changes everyone. As the conflict goes on, the ideaology of the time is examined in great detail, as is the mind-set of each of the primary characters. While it takes a while to really get involved in the story, the conclusion of the book is ultimately very moving and the novel seems to make an important point about the nature of war and the bonds that tie fathers to sons. &quot;The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot; is clearly an important piece of historical fiction which is still relevant today."},{"Title":"The four horsemen of the Apocalypse: (Los cuatro jinetes del Apocalipsis)","review":"This novel with the famous title is a historical adventure fiction from the early 20th century. It is an adventure on a level akin to the Count of Monte Cristo. A good read for the adventure reader looking for new (old) territory to learn about."},{"Title":"The four horsemen of the Apocalypse: (Los cuatro jinetes del Apocalipsis)","review":"The writing is good and the story is gripping. But one should not forget that the author was given the task of writing this war novel by Poincar&eacute;, who was French president in the years leading up to the first world war. This novel was designed as a partisan, pro-French, anti-German novel right from the start. And indeed, its analysis of the responsibilities for the first world war are black-and-white: the phillistine and war-mongering Germans on the one hand, the peace-loving French on the other. Such a depiction might have been right for the second world war but it wasn't for the first. In 1914 France was eager to wage war to recover the two provinces it had lost in the 1870 war. For a non-biased impression of the first world war I recommend Verdun, The Prelude, The Battle by the French writer Jules Romains."},{"Title":"The four horsemen of the Apocalypse: (Los cuatro jinetes del Apocalipsis)","review":"Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance.

Not only did I love the humor of the situation, i remember being brought nearly to tears by the end. The relationship between the two is very touching, and even now, re-reading it in college, the melancholy, but heart-warming feeling of the story is just as touching."},{"Title":"The Man Book & Tape","review":"Well, let me start out by saying that I personally enjoyed this book, and thought it might be an appropriate and thoughtful addition to the library of a mature kid between, say, 10 and 13 years old (all the same, read it first before you give it.) There's a lot of tension between the boy's prosperous middle-class liberal upbringing, and the tiny, aggressively needy drifter who disrupts his life. There's a lot of play on the nature of charity, dependency and exploitation.A key bit of dialogue:-You didn't take me in. I came in.-I let you stay, then.-Yes, but why? That is the question.-I felt sorry for you, of course. You were cold... starving...-You were being kind?-Er... yes. I suppose so.-My size didn't come into it?-No.-You weren't attracted... fascinated... by my size?-Well... not JUST that --Suppose you'd been woken up by a naked starving man six foot tall? You'd have screamed, run for Mum and Dad and called the police?-Yes.On the other hand, do NOT start reading this to your 4 year old unless you want questions and comments like \\"hee hee, he's drinking a BEER!\\" \\"why does he call the boy a sissy? What is a sissy?\\" \\"what is a wog?\\" \\"why does the boy tell lies to his mama?\\" and \\"he's a bad man because he will burn down the house and kill the good boy.\\"I went to the library, saw this next to The Snowman in the children's section, grabbed it along with a bunch of other books for bedtime reading. Meant to look it over before I read it to our preschooler. Husband saw the book on our shelf, assumed that I'd already vetted it, began to read it to the tot, who of course loved the funny little naked man and begged for more! However, we ended up skipping or making up a lot of dialogue-- too many hard words, too much complexity, too much satire.Publishers Weekly review recommends this book for ages 4-8, but that's plain wrong. At that age, kids will get nothing out of it except perhaps a premature understanding that it is possible to steal beer from one's parents, and that one way to deal with anger is to threaten to burn the house down with a match. Lord, life is difficult enough for a parent as it is."},{"Title":"Die And Die","review":"I picked this book up at the library. It looked interesting, and it sure didn't disappoint!

Really Good, and I will check out more in this series."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"Being an avid fan of Debbie Macomber, I must admit, this book is not my favorite.

We journey with them through choices made, good and bad, and feel like we are a trio instead a pair of friends.Between Friends"},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"I was drawn in to style and format right from the beginning. Now that we are in the age of texting, letter writing has become such a lost art. Reading one of the letters from Nick to Jillian while he was on a tour of duty in Vietnam reminded me of my uncle's letters that I used to read to my grandmother while he was away in Vietnam. I loved the way you could feel the girls change and the character grow as they aged. Maybe some of the plot is a little predictable but still a very good read!"},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"One of the best books about friends I have read. It so reminds me of my sister & her BFF, they are in their 60's, yet it seems like they are still kids and keep in touch weekly. This book covers my life with the events she writes about and brings back a flood of good & bad memories. I feel it is one of the best books Ms. Macomber has written."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"This story has no central plot but nonetheless has touching and moving stories from the lives of its characters. The story is told from letters, e-mails, newspaper articles, written announcements with no framing text.The core characters are Jillian Lawton and Lesley Adamski, whose names change later in the book due to marriage, both born in 1948 in Pine Ridge, Washington. Jillian is an upper-middle class girl whose father is a respected judge. Lesley is a working class girl whose father has unstable employment. But the two girls are very close. Two things make the book enjoyable: reading the personal experiences of the characters, and reading references to actual historical events. This made me think about what I was doing in my own life during the dates mentioned at each letter, article, etc. in the book. (Although I am not as old as Jillian or Lesley)Since the book uses exact dates in most of it entries, allow me to nitpick. In her diary, Lesley makes a reference to the Beatles in a January 1, 1963 entry. The Beatles were mostly unknown in the United States until their 1964 appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show and I doubt their albums were available here. There is also a letter to Lesley from her mother which mentions long gas lines. The letter is dates July 2, 1973 but nothing like this ever happened until October 17, 1973 when the Arab countries imposed an oil embargo.The book was published in 2002 so there is not much history mentioned after 9/11/01. Read this book and maybe you will look back on your life and wonder what letters and other items would be used if this book were about your life."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"I have read Debbie Macomber books for years.

It is a story of two friends told through various written documents. I really enjoyed the historical elements as told throughout the story. I highly recommend this book to Macomber fans."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"Between Friends centers around friends Jillian Lawton and Lesley Adamski. The two girls are born in the same town, Jillian to wealthy older parents who have long-awaited their first child, and Lesley as a result of an unplanned teenage pregnancy; despite the differences in their backgrounds, the girls become fast friends. Rather than tell their story through traditional narrative means, author Debbie Macomber draws from alternate sources, namely letters that Jillian and Lesley write to each other but also their journals, news clippings, and other correspondence. I enjoyed this unique format, which lends itself particularly well to quick and easy reading.Jillian and Lesley were both born in 1948, and so they were teenagers in the 1960s, when they struggled to make sense of issues going in their world going on at that time, namely Vietnam. Throughout the book, Macomber does a nice job of working in historical events. Vietnam figures heavily into the plot, but other events, such as the American Legion convention and the advent of the computer age, affect the characters as well. Sometimes these inclusions were a bit predictable or even contrived (eg, one letter contained the postscript \\"my land, what is the world coming to that people are tainting headache pills with cyanide?\\"), but even so, they added interest to the story.This was the first book I read by Debbie Macomber, but it won't be the last. Although this book is likely to appeal mainly to women, Macomber injects a genuineness and warmth into her story that goes beyond \\"chick lit,\\" and I look forward to discovering what else she has to offer."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"Between Friends is the story of 2 girls that became friends at the age of 5 and remained best friends all their lives. The entire book was written in the format of letters, journal entries, and newspaper clippings. It was a strange format, and yet it seemed to give us a deeper glimpse into the lives of these 2 very different women.Lesley grew up the oldest of 6 kids in a working class family. Her dad spent more time out of work than he did employeed, and her mom had to learn to live with him and all his faults. Jillian, the only child of Judge and his wife, grew up in the lap of luxary. And yet, through time and completely different circumstances, they stayed friends. This book encompasses decades in the lives of the 2 friends, through marriage, children, divorce, death and war. At times a little sappy and at times very touching, I found this book very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"I have never read any of Debbie Macomber's books before (I will now), but this book was absolutely wonderful.

Jillian is the only child of a wealthy judge, while Leslie is one of five children of an alcoholic man and his long-suffering wife. The story is told through diary entries, newspaper articles, report cards, police reports, and letters. Although I thought this might be a distracting format, it worked well and author Macomber uses the different kinds of written material with great skill. Throughout the book, the reader sees decisions, both bad and good, which the two women make and how these decisions effect their later lives. It is an absorbing tale, and makes for a very good read."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"I've ready many of Debbie Macomber's books and have enjoyed them all.

I usually don't get into single books because I'm more into a series and usually reading the back of the book doesn't make feel absolutely implied to read it.

You journey through two females friendship, how their lifes change drastically but still remain friends after setting aside their differences.

Just please read, you'll be glad you did, when i finished it it left me with a good feeling in my heart. Debbie Macomber definetly knows how to show the beauty of a friendship like no other."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"Wasn't sure when I first picked up this book if I was going to like the concept of reading letters and journals. After a few pages I was hooked. Cannot put this book down. It makes you feel like you know Jillian and Lesley and are their friends also. You get caught up in their families and cry when they do and laugh when they do. Great book! Would recommend this book to anyone. Brings back a lot of memories and makes you feel like you were there when everything happened."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"This was the first book I read by Debbie and was I very impressed!! I like books with different formats and also about female friendships so I was naturally drawn to this book. Between Friends does a wonderful job using correspondence and journaling as a writing style to tell the story of two very close friends. It captures the essence of the female bond throughout the lives of the two main characters. Being a Baby Boomer myself, this book made me think back to all I have lived through (personally and as a US citizen) and the significance and the impact these times and events have had upon my life and most importantly who I have become. I highly recommend this book and plan to pass it along to several of my friends and family members. I plan to read much more by this author."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"I've read a large number of Macomber's books (not in any order, just as I found them). When the Kindle editions of a couple of her series came out I read them, which meant I re-read a few I hadn't read in years. They stood up to a second reading.Not so sure about this one. Once will be enough. Bit too much of life's sadness and tragedies for me, considering they all happen in the lives of very few people who all surround the two main characters. It was just a bit much.Also, the current events/politics sometimes became tiring for me, maybe because of the format - it often came across as more heavy handed than the rest of the facts and feelings in a particular entry.Overall though, worth a read."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"My cousin showed me this book last summer. Though many people would say this is for old adults, It is my favorite book as a teenager. The heartwarming tales, and the tears strolling down your face you will really appreciate what you have in life.

Wonderful Book."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"My friend that I met on vacation sent this book to me. The story fits us well since we're still keeping in touch after four years through letters and e-mails like Leslie and Jillian (the two friends from &quot;Between Friends.&quot;)The book was absolutly wonderful and I'd suggest it to anyone who wants a good cry or longs for a heart warming story. I never wanted it to end but all good things do."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to get into this book, because it was written solely in the form of written correspondence, newspaper articles, and diary entries. There isn't any spoken dialogue in the whole book. However, it worked wonderfully and I couldn't put the book down.The story takes place from the early 1950's to the present time (2001 or 2002). I was born in the middle of this time period, so it was neat to read about events that have happened in my life time from someone's &quot;personal&quot; point of view in a letter. It really made you feel as though you were part of the friendship and story.Between Friends is the story of Lesley and Jillian, two friends since they were 7 years old. It begins with notes passed in class or diary entries. The story progresses through adolescence, high school, love, marriage, pregnancy, loss and death, illness, and getting older. It is an awesome story of friendship and real life relationships. I would recommend everyone read this book, and then call up your friends and tell them how you feel."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"Usually I love Debbie Macomber's books, but in the book--\\"Between Friends\\" It was hard to follow all thecharacter's lives through all the letters. I was disappointed with the book."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"This is a book not to say you like it but to say you loved it. If you were born bewteen 1948 and 1952 you will be touched. This book is written like a diary in the first person. I started reading the book at 11:30 p.m. before I fell asleep and before I knew it my alarm clock was going off. I was still reading. It was 6:30 a.m. and I never knew the time flew by. The story of Jillan and Lesley is so touching. I can identify what both characters because I grew up with them and I am Catholic and a cancer survivor. All the major events are covered for our generation, the assinations of the Kenndy brothers and Martin Luther King, Watergate, Vietnam, Gulf War,the death of Diana, Bush and Clinton era, Computers, cancer and WTC. These two ladies have loved and lost yet they are so blessed. I hope Debbie will write an update on these ladies. Maybe start a newsletter like Karen Kingsberry did with the Baxter series. What do you think Debbie? Babby Boomer ladies would really like that. This story is really not about romance. Just a hint of it. It's about growing up in the 60's and becoming 60."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"A beautiful story about how friendship can endure despite time, distance, and life's circumstances. I could see pieces of myself in each of the main characters. I bought this four years ago, and , sadly, let it sit on the shelf all these years. Although I haven't been able to find the time to read a book all the way through in the past 4 years, I read this one from cover to cover in 2 days! I highly recommend it! I'm now sending it to my best friend who lives several states away."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"I absolutely loved this book. This author is so very talented and this particular book truly showcases her talents for capturing life and friendship."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"This is one of the finest books I have every read! It is extremely well written--far better than any of her other books!Could not put down--extremely well written!"},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"Generally I am partial to novels about women and women's friendship and I love books written as letters and correspondence. I especially like authors who write notes to readers and invite visits to their websites.But this book disappointed me. Lesley, from a poor family, meets Jillian, from the other side of the tracks. They become fast friends. Jillian's family donates money to help Lesley and her younger sister stay in the Catholic private academy. They remain inseparable until Lesley gets pregnant in her senior year of high school. Although their paths diverge, they women stay in touch by letters and phone and, eventually, e-mail.Lesley's story reminded me loosely of Riding in Cars with Boys, except the heroine of Riding in Cars was a lot smarter and caught on faster: she knew she had married a bum who would never be there for her, a drinker who was in and out of jail. Somehow Lesley manages to stay with Buck, her husband, and keep having children. Not what we'd expect of a scholarship student!Meanwhile Jillian's true love is killed in the war but Jillian herself goes to Barnard College, becomes a New Yorker, and decides to become a lawyer after her involvement in an antiwar protest.In the end, it is Lesley who helps her old friend tbrough a difficult life-threatening problem.The lead characters are stereotyped cardboard. I am not sure why the author gave both lead characters names associated with trendy, upscale WASPs: it was hard to keep them apart sometimes.To the end, neither woman escaped her heritage. Lesley remained faithful to her goal of nursing, ending up working faithfully for a physician. Jillian, after attending a prestigious, expensive women's college, became a lawyer and then a judge. Lesley remained close to home, in her small town in Washington state. Jillian became a real New Yorker.If you want a light tear-jerker, this book does have some moving moments and we are taken through a fast retrospective of the twentieth century. But it's like eating a gooey eclair: enjoyable while you're turning pages, but in the end you wish you'd done something else with the time."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"Grab a tissue and grab this book."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"I too am a contemporary of the two main characters, not only in age, but in upbringing. I have to think the author is a bitter fallen-away Catholic based on the content of the book. Very predictable and not much in the way of content. A lot of political and religious posturing througout. Not to my taste. Having said that I have read a lot of this author's works and liked most of them. She should stay away from politics and religion. You are bound to lose half your audience no matter which platform you take. This one turned me off so badly that it will be a while before I pick this author up again."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"I recently started reading Debbie's books and can not say enough good things about this story. I couldn't put it down; read it in 1 1/2 days. The style of the story is unique with the letters and emails between these two best friends over the years. There were so many things I could relate to and loved the mention of historical events and music throughout the book. I would give it more stars if I could."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I've never had a close friend like this, but I have had friends who have helped me. I recommend this book highly. I had a hard time putting it down."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"I just got through reading \\"Between Friends\\" and could not put it down.

Moves at a nice pace and stays close to historical events accurately.Download it with no regrets!"},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"I became a Debbie Macomber fan with the Angels series. While I enjoyed the adventures of Shirley, Goodness and Mercy, I was very lukewarm about her other books. That opinion changed with this book. I started reading it this morning and I doubt that I will go to bed before I finish it. The format of letters between friends makes it special. Read this book! You will not regret it!"},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"Every woman who has had a friend for many years needs to read this book and pass it on to that friend. You think you know what will happen and then there is a twist. I couldn't stop reading it and I sent a copy to a friend who lives far away. She couldn't put it down either. You will laugh and cry. Then you will want to sit down and write them a long letter. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"This was a great book, I did not know if I would like the format, but found it a really interesting read. The characters were so like real life and I almost felt like I knew them."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"My second book from this author. This made me cry the first night I read this, I called my husband right away to tell him how much I love him. I continued reading this on the bus from NY to CT, and I tried my damn best not to cry in public my ears hurt. I even told myself to nurture my friendship with girlfriends and my sister. I enjoyed the fun format too. I'm hook with this author."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"What a great book. I stayed up all night to finish it and was sad when it ended. This one's a keeper."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"I didn't think I would care for the format of this book, written as letters, but after a couple of pages, I was hooked.

The protagonists are described in such detail that the author makes the reader feel a part of the friendship process. This was my first experience in reading a Debbie Macomber book and it whetted my appetite for more. Luckily, she is a prolific writer and I can look forward to many more hours of reading pleasure."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"I don't have too much time to sit down and read, but I picked up this book and finished it in 2 nights, after I got home from work. I couldn't put it down. I really enjoyed the format in which the book was written, it kept me pulled in and interested in what was coming next. This book makes you think about your friends and the things that you have been through with them. When I finished this book, I wanted to call all of my close friends just to let them know I was thinking of them."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"I can't say enough about this fabulous book. It's unique yet universal--the trials, tribulations and triumphs of two best friends through the years. Reading their letters, memos, telegrams, DUI forms (yep), report cards, graduation announcements and all the bits and pieces that makes up a life -- well, it just makes these two as real as your OWN best friend. PLEASE buy this book. It's amazing."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"My girlfriend gave me this book. When I started to read it and kept reading letters I thumb through it and realized the whole book was letters. Wasn't to sure if I was going to enjoy this book, but I have to say that I loved it! I returned the book went out and bought another one and gave it to my daughter to read and told her when she is done give it to her Best Friend and keep it going. It was one of those books I did't want it to end and thought about days after. And I have started to read other books by Debbie Macomber and have to say I have enjoyed each one"},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"I am of the same generation as Jillian and Lesley and was enthralled by this book from the moment I picked it up. The format of the book, written entirely as diary entries, letters, notes, newspaper announcements and finally emails, is captivating and easy to follow. I have entertained the idea of writing something similar using only emails. Looks like Debbie Macomber beat me to it.So many of the girls' experiences mirrored mine. I could not put this down and read it in one day. Definitely one I would recommend to anyone looking for an entertaining and enjoyable experience."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"The style of the book was definately intriguing and wasn't sure I could follow it. It only took a couple pages to realize I was totally hooked and couldn't put it down. What a great story of friendship."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"Even as I enjoyed reading this book, I wondered why. On the plus side, it is engagingly written. It is also a fast read, a plus for a beach book, because there is so little content, a minus for any book. I stayed with the book because it was not really worth stopping, and because I was curious as to whether I could accurately predict the next set of events. I am basically a contemporary of the two main protagonists. Thus, much of what the book covered was highly familiar to me, and I wanted to see how it turned out.Its predictability made the book both frustrating and familiar. The moment a character has plans to attend the Legionnaire's Convention in Philadelphia, I knew that he was doomed to die of Legionnaire's Disease. The moment a character went to fight in Viet Nam, I knew he would die, too. When another character started receiving blood test results with high levels of cholesterol, I knew he would (a) have bypass surgery, which was new at the time, and (b) eventually die of the disease.Is this starting to sound familiar? I eventually realized that I was reading a bowdlerized version of Forrest Gump, largely in the form of correspondence between two intelligent women.Instead of packing an emotional punch, this book is just trivial. The correspondence that is included hints, tantalizingly, at other exchanges between the chief characters, but does not include them. Indeed, the author seems to avoid the need to write difficult scenes (or even correspondence), replacing possible turmoil and emotional upheaval with a tamer aftermath. (It also becomes repetitious, as the characters repeatedly congratulate each other on bravery in adversity without ever conveying just how hard it was.)As an attempt at realism, the novel is a failure. As a beach book, it is a success. After all, I did keep reading."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"A friend recommended this book for our book club. Honestly I zipped right through it quickly so that I could get it out of the way and get on to something better. I didn't like it at all. I grew tired of the unrealistic letter writing format early on. Plus, it is highly predictable, flat, lacked dialogue and content, and was filled with way too much drama. It is also filled with stereotypes. I also found it annoying how the author tried to tie in so many newsworthy events (pop culture, headlines, etc.) into the journals and letters. Too much like a soap opera for me!"},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"This was my first Debbie Macomber book and I absolutely loved it! The way the book was written made it fantastically fun to read! The storyline was very touching, it reminded me how important it is to keep in touch with my friends. I was in tears before the first half of the book, so much so that I had to stop reading and turn to the back of the book where Debbie's picture is and tell her that she shouldn't do that to readers so soon, it was killing me and I'm not even a softy! I highly recommend this book to anyone who has close friends, as well as my close friends! I look forward to reading my next Debbie Macomber book!"},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"I love every book Debbie Macomber writes. I have tried to get every single one and have read at least half of what she has written."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"Not my usual reading genre, but I couldn't put it down. Maybe it had something to do with the era and my ability to relate to the characters due to the closeness of our ages. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"some times the author needs to maybe leave a little bit to your imagation .the book is not bad though"},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"I have read this book before but it has been several years.

I have also given away six copies of the books to friends and they have all enjoyed it.

From being a lady with education as a goal THEN we thought we knew politics and shouted 'end this war'... It was confusing...and these friends, being so opposite, yet so close, showed both sides of life from the 60 to the 90's.Debbie really shows the great love that lasts between friends for a lifetime.Yes, this is Great Reading."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"I own this book on paperback and Kindle. Anytime I cannot decide on what book to read, I always end up coming back to this book. It is so interesting! It will make you laugh, cry, angry, etc. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a great story!"},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"Once an avid romance reader, these days with a few exceptions I hardly ever read from this genre anymore. And while I was familiar with the name Debbie Macomber I never did read any of her books. But when I came across Between Friends by Debbie Macomber while browsing at the library and read the dust jacket I immediately became interested in this title. I am, a real fan of books written in the epistolary form. Books whose stories are presented as letters or diary and journal entries and today may even be e-mail correspondence. My favorite titles written as epistolary novels include A Woman of Independent Means, Between Heaven and Sky, These is My Words and more recently Dear Stranger, Dearest Friend. And to this list I can now add Between friends which has a permanent place on my favorite books list of 2002.The year is 1948 when Lesley Adamski and Jillian Lawton are born in Pine Ridge, Washington. And while they become life long friends, their families couldn't be more different. Lesley's parents marry after she is conceived and there never seems to be enough money to care for her and eventually her five siblings. Her father who works on and off in the mines enjoys drinking a bit too much while Lesley's mother works hard to keep the family together. With excellent grades Lesley hopes to attend college until history has a way of repeating itself and Lesley finds herself marrying her high school boyfriend.Jillian's life is in sharp contrast to Lesley. As the only child of a Judge and his wifeJillian is afforded a life filled with a beautiful home, wonderful trips, pretty clothes and her own car at 16. Jillian is able to attend college in New York and becomes a fast paced lawyer although a high school romance will leave her heart broken and unable to move on with other men.Throughout the years, through good times, bad times, victories and tragedies the friendship of these two women help to anchor and sustain them no matter what life throws their way. They manage to always be there for one another even when they are miles apart from one another. At first we watch them as young girls writing notes in class to one another, then as teenagers writing in their journals, as young wives and mothers in letters crisscrossing the country and finally as middle aged women corresponding through electronic mail. We are also privy to other pertinent correspondence in their lives like graduation invitations, wedding invitations, birthannouncements, telegrams from overseas and obituary notices. And as we read the lives of these two women lay out before our eyes and we get to know them as if they are our family.I really loved the characters from this book and the time period when it was set. From the two women's writings the author also touches on many historical events. From the civil rights movement to the assassinations of the 60's to the tragedy of 9/11/01, this book is a wonderful representation of what it was like to grow up in the 60's For me, a child of the 60's and the same age as Lesley and Jillian, this book was a walk down memory land which I won't ever forget."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"This is by far one of the best books I've read in a long time. I loved last year's THURSDAYS AT EIGHT, but this time Ms. Macomber outdid herself. BETWEEN FRIENDS is the story of the lifelong friendship between Jillian and Lesley - The story is told uniquely through the use of letters, journals entries, emails (later on in their lives), wedding & birth announcements, newspaper articles - even the occasional gas station receipt! You follow Jillian and Lesley from the day they were born (through the birth announcements of their parents) all the way up through the summer of 2002. What is so wonderful and makes this novel worth reading again and again, is how Ms. Macomber uses actual historic events to tell this story and move the friends through life. You will read about how Vietnam touched both girls and had a lasting affect on Jillian; how they each felt and reacted to the assassinations of JFK, Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy; what their feelings were about Women's Lib; connecting to each other via email and going \\"online\\"; even the tragic events of Sept. 11th are briefly touched upon (only wisely, Ms. Macomber spent little time on this subject and only used the event to explain the feelings of the two women today). You will see Lesley and Jillian experience life & death, the birth of children, loves of their lives entering and leaving; and the joys and heartache that see them through 50 years of friendship. You will witness not only the love Jillian and Lesley have for each other, but the love for their family and friends and the love these people have for each of them. Sometimes funny, plenty reminiscent, but mostly heartfelt, this story will stay with you forever and I guarantee you will return to this book again and again over the years if for no other reason, then to relive some point and time in our history that may have had a similar affect on you and your life as it had on Lesley and Jillian. Bravo Debbie Macomber - it will be difficult to top this one! (but I know you'll try!)"},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"I loved this book! I loved everything about it, the format, the women, the secondary characters, all of it. This is Jillian and Lesley's story about friendship and changing times. Formatted as diary/journal entries, notes, letters, newspaper clippings, and e-mails, we see these two women from the time they were born (1948), all through their school days, marriages, wars, children, lost loves, acts of terrorism, and medical scares.Though they are both so different (Jillian's family is very wealthy, while Lesley's is just the opposite) they manage to always be their for one another. Even after Jillian moves from Washington State to New York for school, and eventually her job.Lesley got pregnant and married young (to a dead-beat lowlife) and never left their little town, while Jillian was off to the city for school and big dreams. There was not a part of this book I didn't like. I read it every chance I could get, and now that I'm finished, I'm mailing it to my best friend back home. I definitely recommend this book for women, and I can't wait to read more from Ms. Macomber!"},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"this book will bring back many memories. Written using letters, newspaper clippings, post cards and e-mails, it follows the friendship of Jillian Lawton and Lesley Adamski from birth to the present day.It chronicles all the changes we've gone through in telling Jillian and Lesley's stories. Parents, marriages, children, bad times, good times - they're all here. And through it all, their friendship endures.The format is so very easy to read - Jillian and Lesley are likeable (for the most part) - neither one is perfect so it is very true to life.If you grew up in the 50's - or have a best friend from childhood - or both!, this is a wonderful read!! You'll have to buy an extra copy for your friend cuz' its a keeper!"},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"I normally do not read the genre that Debbie Macomber dominates, but I 'discovered' her wonderful stories, good writing, and always interesting 3 diminsional characters. And, I became hooked on Macomber, especially her Cedar Cove series.Between Friends is a wonderful story that kept me turning the pages long after bed-time. Beautiful Jillian and Smart Lesley are as opposite as can be, and that's exactly why become and stay best friends throughout their life. Diary Excepts, Newspaper clippings, letters, as well as 'real time' scenes propel the reader forward at amazing speed with tremdous concern for the girls, who blossom into young women, mothers, and finally to professional middle aged women.Problems, Very Big and small, do not exist exclusively in the poor side of town as Jillian and Lesley reveal their stories to us readers and to each other. Their laughter, tears, heartaches, joys, triumps, defeats become ours from the first page to the last satisfying page."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"The two women were born in 1948 in Pine Ridge, Washington. The location, the year, and their gender are about the only things these two women have in common. So how could Jillian Lawton and Lesley Adamski remain best friends and confidantes into the new millennium?Jillian, the daughter of wealthy parents attended college while Lesley an unwanted child who forced her parents to marry repeated the same mistake as her own mother by having two children while still a teen. Yet from the Eisenhower through Desert Storm and the Clinton scandals they exchange first letters and later email as they describe what is happening to each of them during the various decades of the latter half of the twentieth century.BETWEEN FRIENDS is an insightful look at five decades of America through the eyes of two friends living totally different lifestyles as the country goes about its changing business. The story line is an excellent look at the times starting with their childhood during the I like Ike decade to their teen years hindered by Nam and Watergate and finally to the naughty adult era of the eighties and nineties. Lesley and Jillian constantly communicate the \\"thrill of victory and the agony of defeat\\". These two wonderful female characters empower readers to see Debbie Macomber at her best as the dynamic author provides a powerful look at the American half century reminiscent of Billy Joel's tune, We Didn't Start the Fire, but with much more depth.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"There isn't any thing about this book that I didn't like. It grabbed my interest from the very beginning and had me reading it until the wee hours of the night, I just could not put it down.

I especially loved the format of this book: journal entries, letters, etc.I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"Between Friends is an excellent book about just that...between friends. Two women from different backgrounds & lifestyles are best friends and we see they never lose contact with each other. They keep each other informed thru letters, invitations, announcements, phone calls and eventually e-mail. Whether their news was exciting, sad or just a quick update on every day events, they were compelled to share everything. I loved the style in which the book was written....personal journals, postcards, letters, etc. making it a quick read (I finished this book in a day). I also enjoyed it because it reminded me alot of my mother and her best friend. Whether you are young or old, this book is one I feel anyone would enjoy.

It only took me two days to read! It was cleverly written and I really enjoyed both getting to know the people of Pine Ridge Washington,and at the same time reliving some of the most life defining times of history. I was amazed at recalling all I myself have lived through! When I was not even half through, I already felt as if I was part of the close knit circle of friends and family. As if I knew each character personally."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"... why did I buy a book written like this? I was ready for some light reading, but how could I get into a story told through letters, notes, journal entries, clippings, and (how refreshing!) email? Well what a surprise I got. And what a fun re-cap of events of the latter half of the 1900s!The book was quite engaging, and although too fast a read (character development somewhat jeopardized), it was unique. To the reviewer who complained about it's predictability, I'm going to counter with the assumption that the predictability was not distracting, but entirely intentional. We were supposed to know what was going to happen. Readers can appreciate the characters' innocence of the future - the events that we know in our past. And Ms. Macomber did a wonderful job of achieving this paradox. I will be reading more from her."},{"Title":"Between Friends","review":"I love Debbie Macomber's books.

This one though was especially poignant for me because I felt I was relieving my life. The main characters were both born in 1948 and the book tells about their entire lives as friends.

I always thought of this as the story where a bad guy steals Holy Water, but it is much more than this. The young hero has two dreadful brothers.

I would have loved to have known this story back then to tell around the campfire. - - - Three brothers live in a mythical valley where they have a vista of a gorgeous waterfall pouring out of the mountains. The afternoon turns the waterfall to a golden blaze, hence the name Golden River. The two older brothers are very mean and bully the youngest of them and make him do the chores. They are angered to find that one night while they are gone the younger brother gives shelter to a stranger. Arriving back home they throw him out in spite of his warning that he is the West Wind and will return just one time. His return is in the form of a gale force wind that destroys their house. Not only that but the West Wind stops the rainfall into the valley; the farm dries up; the three brothers move to the city. They use some gold that they have to become goldsmiths but spend the profits instead of using some to buy more gold for smithing. The younger brother treasures a gold mug with a face imprinted on it. They tear it away from him and toss it into the kettle to be melted down. Then they leave. The youngest brother hears a voice from the kettle and realizes that it comes from the face that was on the mug. He is asking to be fished out. When the brother does this, the gold face becomes a head and body and sprouts arms and legs and struts about as a dwarf. This is the King of the Golden River. As a reward for the boy's kindnesses he tells the boy the secret of how to turn the river to gold to make himself rich.- - That's all I will divulge. - - There is a moral, of course. This tale is short and delightful; written as present for the young girl who later becomes his wife."},{"Title":"The king of the Golden River; or, The black brothers, a legend of Stiria,","review":"The brothers Schwartz and Hans seem to have it all - a rich valley in the mountains that provides for them handsomely. But, instead of being happy and generous, the brothers are mean and miserly. And when they mistreat Southwest Wind, Esquire, his curse brings about their downfall. They have a younger brother, Gluck, who is everything that his brothers aren't, and his goodness definitely brings its own rewards.John Ruskin (1819-1900) was an English Renaissance Man, who was highly influential in the Victorian era. This book was his only work of fiction, but it is quite good, with a charming story and a firm morality. Also, part of what makes this book interesting is that it was influential on later writers of Fantasy literature, making this something of a pioneering work in the genre.I highly recommend this book. It's definitely one that should be read by the young, and the young-at-heart!"},{"Title":"The king of the Golden River; or, The black brothers, a legend of Stiria,","review":"This is an amusing if slightly odd story. I guess that Ruskin considered himself such an intellectual jack of all trades that he'd a have a go at the genre, if only to say he'd done it.The story is built from familiar parts. There's a Cinderella theme, built around a young boy and his two cruel brothers. There's also a theme of the wandering stranger who, after being treated well or poorly, rewards the doer equally well or poorly. In fact, that was such a cool idea that Ruskin threw in two magical beings quite independent of each other, making the front and back halves of this little creature look like thay came from two different animals.It's a pleasant enough fairy tale, but not one that I'd spend a lot of time hunting down.//wiredweirdPS: This reviews a different edition of the story, apparently not listed at Amazon.

Mixed with an effective subplot involving a woman's physical and mental recuperation from a mountain fall, the novel has all the makings for a truly horrifying experience. Not exactly. As usual, the author's professional pen takes the reader right into the psyche of his people who all end up battling inner demons one way or the other. Hautala's strongest strength comes from stirring twisted threats for his unhappy characters. His ability to do so always makes for a riveting read. What the novel lacks, however, is truly scary moments. The ones that do exist are fairly executed (the appearance of the woman in the mill window, for example) but are uneven as a whole. What DARK SILENCE ends up being is more of a psychological portrait of lost individuals than anything else. Certainly pleasureable if one seek that sort of thing. Just don't expect to be frighten out of your wits.-----Martin Boucher"},{"Title":"Dark Silence","review":"But this book is absoulutely amazing I can';t put it down! infact its in front of me now!

Taking the view that businesses are evolving into 'networked patterns of living systems', Allee observes that we require a different mindset and management tools to respond to these changes. This new mindset includes thinking of organizations as living systems, understanding the principles of networks and how they operate, taking a 'whole-system' view of the organization, understanding how intangibles go to market, and the significance of value networks, people and relationships.Overall, the book offers a fresh, thought-provoking look at what have become already become well-worn concepts in the knowledge management field. Allee has synthesized a diverse array of ideas and concepts and theories from multiple disciplines to this work.Part I tends to be a little abstract and theoretical and some of the ideas here about the new knowledge economy and intangible assets will not be new to anyone familiar with knowledge management. However, it does provide a useful context for subsequent chapters. At the end of chapter 5, the checklist of 'where we are now in the learning journey or knowledge continuum' is a useful summary of current thinking. Allee takes an organic view of knowledge networks and communities, such that rather than trying to create them in organizations, it is better to simply find those that already exist and make them visible to themselves and the rest of the organization.The discussion on how intangibles 'go to market' challenges the notion that we can create value from them in the same way that we do from tangible assets. But perhaps the most interesting section of the book is that which discusses mapping value networks, and the practical examples that are provided. It is here that Allee brings together the concepts discussed in Part I and we begin to see the whole picture that she is building. These chapters will be of particular interest to practitioners who are attempting to grapple with creating value from knowledge in their own, or their client's organizations, and identifying where to focus their attention.Allee has the capacity to discuss complex issues in a simple and straightforward way without allowing us to feel that we've been shortchanged. Essentially, each chapter offers a simple message. In her discussion of communities of practice, there is a clear message is that knowledge cannot be separated from the human networks that create it, use it and transform it. Similarly, in Chapter 6, she argues that the best technology infrastructure does not guarantee knowledge sharing - organizational intelligence is not a technology question, it is a human question.At one point, Allee refers to the ancient saying that one cannot step into the same river twice (pp. 143) because the water is never the same water. This is analogous to what Allee has done with in this book - although the concepts, and ideas may seem familiar and have certainly been discussed previously in the plethora of books and articles currently available, she has presented them in a refreshing new way and brought together diverse ideas to challenge our assumptions. It is well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Future of Knowledge: Increasing Prosperity through Value Networks","review":"I was very enthusiastic about the topic. Section I drops quotes from some of the most insightful people around, like Fritoj Capra. Section II says that technology has to be better at helping people share information. Section III says that Communities of Practice help generate new knowledge (a lot of 'borrowing' from E. Wegner for this section). Section IV says that you have to map a system by looking at participants, their outputs and the required inputs. Section V is a summary. The big 'insight' is that people seek intangibles that aren't always seen with a direct dollar value. No kidding, every car salesman in the world knows that he is not selling transportation, he is selling an image. Isn't that the whole idea behind conspicuous comsumption? No one really needs a Hummer, but what intangibles does one get? Very simply, intangibles are easy to measure in that they are all converted to an object, eventually. Ideas are made into books; engineering concepts are made into machines. That's where the price comes out. All in all, the book reads like a power brochure with several self-promotional descriptions in the book. Pass on this one and try out any of the authors she name drops in Section I."},{"Title":"The Future of Knowledge: Increasing Prosperity through Value Networks","review":"This book again shows Verna Allee's great gift for making the complex simple and practical. In this book she builds and explores the metaphor of enterprise as a living network, successfully weaving together such diverse threads as value network analysis, communities of practice, social network analysis and biology. She shows us what to focus on now and, as always, provides a glimpse of the future. If you want to know what's coming next in this rapidly evolving field, read this book"},{"Title":"The Future of Knowledge: Increasing Prosperity through Value Networks","review":"In today's crowded marketplace of business publications, it takes something that bit special to stand out and be noticed. A decade ago, Peter Senge's The Fifth Discipline was widely regarded as one of the seminal business books of the 1990's, introducing to an appreciative and expanding audience the integrated concepts of systems thinking and the \\"learning organisation\\". This new book by fellow American author Verna Allee carries the potential to compete for similar accolades in this current decade.The idea that there should be any enthusiasm about another book on knowledge would normally be questionable, given the number of books published on knowledge management in recent years, and the attendant hype accompanying such new challenges to business thinking. What makes Allee's contribution special is the elegant manner in which she takes a living systems approach to connect knowledge and value in a profound yet pragmatic way.The focus on value is particularly appropriate for business given that profitability, the lifeblood of any commercial enterprise, depends on the discovery and creation of value. With the new era of the \\"extended enterprise\\" model of the organisation, in that any company competes in a supply chain and wider business ecosystem of customers, suppliers, joint venture partners and other stakeholders, the value network approach is a potentially powerful one in helping to identify, investigate and, ultimately exploit key relationships within the network.Where Allee perhaps scores highest with her approach is in her treatment of intangible deliverables within value networks, and the introduction of a simple, practical set of tools to assist with the mapping of both intangible and tangible relationships. Because value networks take a living systems perspective, it deals with real people - either individuals, small groups or teams, business units, organisations, industry groups, communities or nation states - dealing with value exchanges flowing between participants in the network, linked by arrows showing the transactions and deliverables of value exchanges.The power of value networks lies in its simplicity and practicality. As well as providing a structured framework for dealing with intangibles, it also raises interesting questions and challenges assumptions about the real nature of networks in action and the value being created (or destroyed) within these networks.If business leaders aspire to understand the deeper dynamics of value creation in their extended enterprise networks, The Future of Knowledge will provide them with the philosophy, the roadmap and the tools to guide them."},{"Title":"The Future of Knowledge: Increasing Prosperity through Value Networks","review":"There is a colossal organization structure issue that large corproations haven't yet faced. It is that the basic tool and meme for organization - the organization chart with structure, jobs and reporting lines - can not function in the new world of open innovation, process-driven organization, collaborative networks and roles in processes rather than jobs in structures.Verna Allee has a novel solution in her concept of Value Networks. It passes the conceptual test by offering a new idea of how value is created via intangibles, and the credibility test by providing real-life, very large scale examples. She challenges us to think in an entirely new way about organization. She may have the answer for the 21st century, and you owe it to yourself to at least read it and consider it."},{"Title":"The Future of Knowledge: Increasing Prosperity through Value Networks","review":"I'd definitely recommend it not only to the Knowledge Management professionals, but to the general public.

Their book on CATS has been extremely valuable to me too!"},{"Title":"Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook (Howell Reference Books)","review":"I was very disappointed with this book, but I suppose it serves a certain purpose. I went to several bookstores looking for a first aid guide for dogs, and this seems to be the standard offering. It includes information about first aid, but it isn't suitable for use in a first aid situation. Instead, it's more of a book for bathroom readers and do-it-yourselfers. I really don't know why the authors chose to include first aid in this book. It must have been for the sake of comprehensiveness -- they must have included it not so it would be useful, but so no one would ask why it was missing.First of all, the pictures are a joke. They're small, they're in black-and-white, and if you don't read the captions, you can't even tell what you're looking at. When you have an injured dog to take care of, you don't want to make decisions based on Rorschach blobs. Clear drawings or _very_ well done color photos are standard for presenting human first aid methods.Second, the decision flowcharts are unhelpful. After looking at several of them, I can't imagine using them in an emergency. Try to answer this question: &quot;Is the dog in distress?&quot; Huh? Some dogs seem to be in distress 24/7. Others will injure themselves without complaint if they think it pleases you. Can you imagine trying to translate the word &quot;distress&quot; into concrete terms while your dog is bleeding? The word might have a precise definition elsewhere in the book, but a good first aid guide doesn't require you to do research in the middle of an emergency.Third, I failed in ten minutes of looking to locate information on the simple injury that brought to my attention my need for such a book. My dog's paws swelled up and started to peel after our first run in summer heat. Strangely, the index didn't send me to a central place for paw injuries. It seems that you have to have a tentative diagnosis before you can find any information. I looked up &quot;blisters&quot; and didn't find anything. I flipped through the book trying to pick up a sense of the organization, which led me to some first aid pages but no information about paws.It turned out that his injuries were burns, a common paw injury that would deserve a place in a book a fifth the size of this one. The information must be in the book somewhere -- how could it be missing from a book that includes abortion, cancer, and geriatrics? -- but I could not diagnose the problem until I put this book down and sought information elsewhere.(By human first aid standards, the authors of this book have bungled a well-understood task, but by dog first aid standards, they might be pretty good, for all I know. All the other books I found with dog first aid information suffered from similar problems, and none were half as useful as a typical human guide. Dozens of excellent first aid guides are available for humans, ranging from useful twenty-page pamphlets produced with line drawings and basic vocabulary to professional manuals larger than this book. Why can't I find a single well done, up-to-date first aid guide for dogs? If I recall correctly, _The Home Pet Vet Guide: Dogs_ was well illustrated and well organized, but it hasn't been updated in twenty years. Another book that I haven't been able to examine, but which sounds promising, is _Dog First Aid Emergency Care for the Hunting, Working, and Outdoor Dog_.)Despite my disappointment with the first aid aspect of the book, I considered buying it anyway for the other veterinary information. I decided against it, since I already have a guide to basic care. I just couldn't imagine myself using it. It may be interesting to read about whelping, but if your dog were about to have puppies, would you really rely on this book, or would you buy a more specialized one? If your dog develops cancer, will you rely on the copy of _Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook_ that's been on your bookshelf for three years, or will you seek a newer, more focused source of information? Or will you trust your vet?The truth is that while there's lots of information in this book, it mostly provides interesting but ultimately insufficient chunks of information. A whole page devoted to a rare disorder might seem like an impressive amount of detail, but it's pointless until your dog develops that disorder. Then that page becomes useful, but it also becomes absurdly inadequate. And it hardly needs to be said that a six hundred page book won't enable you to accurately diagnose your dog or second-guess your vet. A textbook for an undergraduate physiology course -- which most vets take before they enter veterinary school -- contains as much information as this guide (and much more lavish illustrations to boot).If you don't want to take your dog to the vet and are too lazy to study real vet school texts and veterinary reference books, or if you enjoy trivia, or if you want to annoy your vet with half-informed theories about your dog's maladies, then this is the book for you. If you have already have plenty on your reading list and just want a guide for basic care and emergencies, I'm sorry to say I haven't yet found the right book."},{"Title":"Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook (Howell Reference Books)","review":"An earlier edition of this book (2nd) was my very first book, along with one on the Siberian Husky, of course (when I adopted my first sibe). The \\"Dog Owner's Home Veterninary Handbook 4th Ed\\" is an outstanding reference for all dog parents; whether you are using the holistic or traditional approach with their general care. The 2nd Edition (1992) I loved, and it got used and abused, since I refered to it many times. This 4th Edition (2007) has all the great useful resources as the 2nd, but with more up to date information.This is a very comprehensive and informative \\"nose to tail guide\\" for your dog & covers just about everything you can think of; including: emergencies, parasites, infectious diseases, the skin & coat, the eyes, the ears, the mouth & throat, digestive system, respiratory system, ciculatory system, nervous system, musculoskeletal system, urinary system, sex & reproduction, pregnancy & whelping, pediatrics, tumors & cancers, geriatrics and medications along with other useful information & resources.Nothing replaces having a good family veterinarian for your dog, but this book is a great guide to help you communicate better with your vet. Whatever concerns you may have with your dog, you will most likely be able to find a good baseline in this book. It's a great tool for helping figure out what might be the issue, give an idea of what type of treatments your dog may need & even give some helpful information on what you may be able to do prior to seeing the vet (or while waiting to get seen; if, of course, it's not a concern for an emergency visit).Overall, the more informed you can be about your pet's health, the better off your dog is. When we are able to do a little researching ourselves (and this handbook is very convenient as a research tool), recognise what is and isn't healthy and discuss these with our pet's vet, this also helps the vet with our dog's care and well being...in many cases, it can also help reach a diagnosis faster...this in turn, means your dog receives the appropriate care much sooner than later.Each chapter is rather informative, and goes into detail that the layman (non profesional) understands. I wouldn't recommend this book for any in depth nutritional information, but the brief information provided is fair for general basic knowledge (and shouldn't offend even the holistic).

I assume people buy The Dog Owner's Veterinary Handbook because it seems encyclopedic. And on one level (its heft) it is. But when you actually try to read the thing, you'll discover it's basically an unreadable veterinary school textbook from the late 1960s.The book is filled with jargon; page after page of tiny type; headlines with such names as \\"Bullous Pemphigoid\\" and \\"Lupus Erythematosus Complex\\" (I'm not kidding); and small hideous black-and-white photos with captions that are utterly perplexing (one example: \\"This Shar-Pei puppy's eyelids have been everted with temporary sutures. This may correct the entropion without need for permanent surgery\\"). In short, this book is deadly.For my money, the best book of this type out there today is the Hound Health Handbook: The Definitive Guide to Keeping Your Dog Happy, Healthy, and Active. Written by a vet (Betsy Brevitz), and 554-pages long, it too is comprehensive---but in sharp contrast to the Dog Owner's Home Veterinarian Handbook, the Hound Health Handbook is actually readable, smart, and well-designed (it uses hundreds of real-life Q&As; organized by subject)."},{"Title":"Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook (Howell Reference Books)","review":"The book is full of medical terms and it always ends up with giving you that one advise - the smartest thing to do in any situation: Bring your dog (and your money) to the vet!

Of course, you have to use your common sense when to \\"do it yourself\\" and when a vet is needed. As an owner of 7 dogs of various ages, I need all the advise I can get. This book should be in every dog owners library. Another positive is you can have a professional conversation with your vet by looking up the symptoms beforehand and discussing various remedies or ailments.This will also give you a better understanding of what your vet is talking about. Especially those veteranians that like to show off all their schooling by using \\"big words\\" so they think their education wasn't a waste of money. The book also gives you choices in the type of care the vet recommends. My Giant Schnauzer was limping on it's back leg. By reading the book, it said the vet would administer a anti-inflamatory med, do x-rays, etc.. . I called the vet, explained the problem and asked if it would be safe to give Mattie an Aleve and see if that would help her. The doctor said it would be safe to give her Aleve once in the morning and once in the evening and if she was still limping on Monday to bring her in (this was late Friday when she started doing this). By Sunday she had noticably stopped limping and by Monday the limp was gone. Without reading that book, I would have paid for an after hour vet visit instead of a free phone call. The book paid for itself with that phone call and keeps on giving back \\"to the pack\\". P.S. All my dogs are inside dogs with a large fenced in yard.

It could use a few changes to make it stellar, though.1) references. It would be good to be provided with further references for topics that it doesn't touch on in detail.2) explanations. The book will tell you things such as not to induce vomiting if petroleum products are ingested, but it will not tell you why that is the case.3) color photographs. This is VERY important. The photos are black and white, and not high resolution. This makes it difficult sometimes to compare your animal's ailment with those in the book.Aside from these issues, it is a very helpful book. I learned that my dog has cheilitis and am treating it according to the book's directions. Although, upon further reading on the internet, I found that this condition could also involve yeast so the method they suggested may not work. This also should have been mentioned.

It's good stuff."},{"Title":"Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook (Howell Reference Books)","review":"We have two working breed pups that are about 9 months old now, and this book has proven itself very valuable already. The breadth of topics covered and depth of information is very thorough but not overwhelming. It can help you ascertain the most likely cause of your dog's symptoms, which makes your decision of home remedies vs. immediate veterinary help a much less stressful one.For example one of our dogs has had a couple of episodes where something had irritated the lining of his stomach and he went into fits of licking the floor until he threw up multiple times. This may sound gross but when you're going through it, it's very disconcerting because you don't know what's happening to the dog. We looked up the symptoms, read the possible causes (based on the combination we saw) and with a call to our vet determined he had most likely ingested something that upset his stomach. This, rather than Bloat (which has similar side-effects and can be fatal or an obstructed bowel (also very serious).The point is, this book, more than any other we've used (including an edition from about 20 years ago) helps eliminate the guesswork. You want to manage your dog's care based on facts rather than guesswork for obvious reason. This book is filled with them.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook (Howell Reference Books)","review":"Explains in enough detail without getting overly technical. Really helpful in coming up with questions for the vet in follow-up care, and in explaining what's going on in your sick dog.

It could be stronger in nutrition, but otherwise near perfect."},{"Title":"Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook (Howell Reference Books)","review":"I have not had that much experience with veterinary reference books for dog owners. However, I can tell you that as a brand new dog owner this book has been extremely useful for me. We recently added a pair of Siberian Husky puppies to our family. We did much research on the different dog breeds and on this breed in particular before we decided to purchase these pups. Nevertheless, I had no experience raising puppies of any kind and I had no real experience dealing with canine medical problems. This book is a very clear and concise reference that gives a good working knowledge about how to deal with canine illnesses and injuries. It lists symptoms to watch for, home treatments, and step by step instructions for administering medicines and bandaging injuries. Each chapter covers a specific area of a dog's body (digestive system, eyes, ears, reproductive system, etc...). The chapter explains how the system works, how to keep it healthy, illnesses or injuries or genetic defects that can affect it, and how to treat them. It also has a whole chapter on emergencies and lists specific symptoms or situations that indicate you need to get to a vet immediately. It even tells you how to make a home emergency kit for your dog. There is an index of symptoms in the front cover of the book for easy reference in finding treatments quickly. In the back is an excellent glossary and bibliography of further references. There is even a section at the back that lists over the counter medications for humans that are also safe to use on dogs. There are also separate chapters on infectious diseases, parasites, pediatrics, geriatrics, pregnancy and whelping, and dealing with cancer and tumors. This book is written in a clear and easy to understand style that anyone can follow. It has many helpful charts and lists for easy reference. It does not go into great detail about specific dog breeds but it is comprehensive enough in basic information to be a great help to most any dog owner (it is 358 pages in length). Whether you are a long time dog owner or a novice, I highly recommend adding this book to your library. It would also make an excellent gift for anyone who is a brand new dog owner."},{"Title":"Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook (Howell Reference Books)","review":"As a retired paramedic & former kennel owner [Chinese Shar-pei] and former vet. assistant and current owner of 3 Siberian huskies I can't recommend this book enough.I owned the 1st edition and this book proved invaluable regarding the health of my dogs in my kennel--from how to hand raise newborns [such as how to mix the formula] to meeting emergency care for my dogs before going to the vet or even in assisting me to call the vet with pertinent info.Thru the years this book has saved me easily over $1000's in vet bills by just the fact of discussing pertinent symptoms in this book and coherently relaying this to my vet during some emergency calls during or after office hours. Often things I had around the house or kennel in the way of 1st aid supplies allowed the vet & I to make educated decisions on treating the animal both at home or at least buying time [saving life] until I needed to get to the vet.As a paramedic and vet worker I often had to rely on this book as many friends, family & yes even doctor friends would call for \\"advice.\\"This book will probably pay for itself the first time it is needed for whatever health issue or emergency you may have with your dog.Definitely recomended book for those with kennels or even one dog, esp. if the dog has any health issues. Even recommended for the puppy owner as any dog owner knows how quickly pups can get into anything from minor 1st aid type injury to true life/death emergency.I'd also recommend the buyer to follow up this book with getting a 1st aid kit for dogs--some items mentioned in this book.****************************There is also a companion-type book for cat owners, too: \\"Cat Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook\\" (Cat Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook) by Delbert G.

If you're a dog lover, this is a must have."},{"Title":"Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook (Howell Reference Books)","review":"This is an excellent resource for pet owners because it is logically written, well-organized and goes over broad range of ailments your dog might have. It is set up for quick reference, and information is conveyed succinctly, so the reader is able to retrieve the needed information quickly. This ease of use literally saved my dog's life.Using this book, I was able to recognize that my dog was showing signs of bloat, an often-fatal ailment. As a result, we were able to get her to the vet before her stomach twisted. If the book had been wordy or poorly organized, I would not have, in my panicked state, been able to find the information we needed.Also, the author does not appear to have any sort of agenda (e.g., raw foods, pro-pharmaceutical, etc.), something that is often found in so many dog books.Because this book saved Maggie's life, I'm giving it 5 stars. However, I do have one small complaint -- in the version that I have, the index on the inside covers of the book did not point to the right information. I hope that they have fixed this.

But there is a big BUT.The reason I give it only 2 stars is because the authors - 4 VETS no less!! - recommend Purina, Science Diet, Ekanuba and the likes as good food... HELLO?!?! These brands make anything BUT good and nutritious foods! These are full of corn, cheap fillers, by-products, toxic chemicals and floor-sweepings from China. It's as \\"healthy\\" as your Primary Care Physician suggesting that you make Big Mac and Twinkies your daily meal, wash it all down with a bucket of soda and enjoy a pack of Camels for dessert. Would that make any sense?!I just can't understand why these (and many other) vets don't care that poor-quality food is seriously hurting the health and much too often shortening the lives of our pets? Could it be that they actually want our dogs to have food allergies, itching, upset stomach and cancer so that we keep their businesses busy and the endorsement dollars from the \\"big players\\" rolling in? In my opinion this is just irresponsible and shameful.In addition to this book - if you care about the well-being of your four-legged family members - please also read \\"Food Pets Die For: Shocking Facts About Pet Food.\\" by Ann Martin and check out The Dog Food Project to find much healthier alternatives to Science Diet, Purina Pro-Plan, Beneful, Iams and the other brands that spend millions of dollars on advertising and not even a fraction of that for quality ingredients..."},{"Title":"Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook (Howell Reference Books)","review":"I have this book in two forms -- hardback and on my Kindle. I have the hardback at home because the Kindle version does not include the Quick Index to Signs and Symptoms that is printed inside the cover of the book and has been very helpful in the past. I have it on my Kindle so that I can consult it when we're traveling. This is very comprehensive reference on identifying and treating dog health problems. I got the previous edition when my older dog began to have problems several years ago and bought this new edition for use with the new puppies that we adopted after her death. The language is clear and concise. It has up-to-date information on treating common health problems. I'm especially grateful for the food recipe for dogs having diarrhea!"},{"Title":"Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook (Howell Reference Books)","review":"This book is definitely a MUST-HAVE for all dog owners. It covers topics that range from simple cuts, ticks, and diarrhea to complex and potentially life-threatening illnesses responsible owners should be aware of. The book is broken down into chapters focused on particular parts of the dog's body (i.e., \\"Chapter 5: The Eyes\\"), functional body systems (i.e., Chapter 12: The Nervous System\\"), and other important topics (i.e., \\"Chapter 1: Emergencies\\" and \\"Chapter 3: Infectious Diseases\\"). Each chapter begins with a detailed introduction to that topic as it relates to a dog's health and anatomy. Although most people will probably never encounter most of the material covered in the book (knock on wood), the knowledge and perspective of protecting your dog's health is priceless and may indeed be enough to save your pet someday. You do not have to be a veterinarian, medical doctor, or scientist to understand this book, though it may take some time to read and learn from it because the text is very specific and detailed - in my opinion, this is great! It is written by three veterinarians and a medical doctor, making this book a very sound and reliable go-to reference.There are quick-references, guides to making your own home emergency medical kit, information and tables about different medications, a very useful glossary, and so much more. For the amount of material covered in this book, I would have expected to and indeed would have paid much, much more than the listed price; the material is better than many textbooks and believe me, I've purchased my fair share of $100+ textbooks that I hardly used!I have nearly read this book cover-to-cover, but you do not need to approach it that way. Even if it is just a reference book sitting on your bookshelf 99% of the time, it is there when you notice something different with your dog and organized clearly to get you to the right section so you can begin to narrow down whatever the ailment might be and know what the next best steps to take are. This fully revised and updated fourth edition was printed in 2007, so it not outdated by any means. This book is the only medical reference you will need to buy. As valuable as your dog is to you, the peace of mind that comes with this book is priceless.

It helps me to much better engage my vet when I do go, and gives me a better perspective on his recommendations.

My beloved mini schnauzer recently passed away from liver failure and this book was an invaluable resource in helping my husband and I understand what was happening, and what we might be able to do to help. Herbie was sick for months as a puppy and our local vet was never able to diagnose him, and we ended up spending hundreds of dollars on medical tests when a simple blood test would have told us all we needed. I felt like sending my vet a copy of this book - there were all his symptoms, diagnosis, and a note saying that mini schnauzers are prone to liver shunts. This book has guided us through dog medical questions from the mundane to the severe and it does serve as a great guide to know when to call the vet in a panic, or when to treat at home and give it a few days.

The reason is that it has practical detailed information to figure out your dog's medical problem, with home remedies where useful, and full treatment explanations, including naming medicines a vet would use that has helped me to understand if my dog's condition is something I can treat myself, or if there is a temporary step I can take to help my dog until I can get him to the vet. I came here now to see if there was an updated version of it and add that to my library. The problem the other dog care books I have purchased over the years is that they are vague and do not give dosing information, and so are not practical. Obviously many of the medications named in this book require a vet prescription and necessitate taking your dog to a vet, but it is great to be able to read about the full care a specific medical problem would take, sometimes getting a lesson in what I may be doing wrong that can be aggravating my dog's condition. Many times I have been able to help my dogs on my own, or know exactly when to take them to the vet because of this book, and it has been an invaluable reference with every new dog I have on helping to figure out the various health problems that crop of when you own a pet."},{"Title":"Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook (Howell Reference Books)","review":"Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook may not be a book you will sit down and read from cover to cover but it contains an astounding wealth of information and is well indexed. While it is not a substitute for your veterinarian, it can help you determine the urgency of a vet visit and perhaps allow you to be better informed before you enter the vet's office.Our two year old Great Dane Tigger developed a single canine viral Papilloma (wart) on his lower lip. We didn't know what it was but were able to find it in the index quickly and decided to leave it alone and observe it for a few weeks since Tigger is due for a checkup in three weeks anyway. We communicated with our vet via email and he agreed that there was no reason to schedule a special visit since the growth was proceeding exactly as described in the Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook.A friend of our observed the exact same symptom on her dog, schedule an appointment with her vet ($75.00) and was told her pup would need to be put under general anesthesia and the bill would be $500.00! Since canine Papillomas generally go away on their own or can be quickly removed by freezing or electrocautery (as our vet confirmed and per the Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook) our friend is shopping for another vet less inclined to fleece their clients.I would suggest you page through the Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook to become familiar with the layout when you receive it. You probably won't agree with everything---since some of the material is the opinion of one or two vets---but it contains a wealth of potentially life saving emergency information that is invaluable."},{"Title":"Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook (Howell Reference Books)","review":"written in a style that is easy to use and understand. a great referrence book to have on hand for everyday problems that your dogs may incounter that don't really need the attention of a vet,or in non-emergencies when a vet is unavailable for a day or so (weekends, holidays etc.) as the owner of two english bulldogs i liked the fact that it points out breed specific problems and which ones should be brought to a vets attention.very much worth the purchace price."},{"Title":"Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook (Howell Reference Books)","review":"After my puppy getting sick for the first time, I was in a rush to get a medical book or two to have on hand.

I tried to get along with internet searches, but they aren't reliable. This book is the answer. It is easy to use and reliable. If you have a dog, this is an essential reference book. If you want to get someone with a dog a gift--this is the book for them."},{"Title":"Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook (Howell Reference Books)","review":"Very informative. Covers first aid, and covers symptoms and common treatments for many canine conditions. Has helped me to make the right decision when my vet was pushing for surgery for a hip problem. Because of what I read, I got a second opinion. Turned out, that the hip pain resolved itself after several months of anti inflamatories and supplements and has never come back.Good reference, when my dog had a bladder infection, I wasn't sure if my vet was gouging me with all the tests and meds.

What happened instead, though, was that I started reading the first few pages and got sucked in and read (briefly) the entire book.

If you have a dog suffering certain symptoms, this book clearly, quickly and thoroughly describes the actions to take: do you need a vet, or is a home remedy available? I have a new puppy and an adult Golden Retriever. The puppy--rescued from the pound--developed kennel cough which, at first I diagnosed as something else (which would have required a different treatment). This book described the sound of the cough, the frequency, the result and offered a quick home remedy to ease his discomfort until he could get to our vet (it was a holiday weekend).

My dog was suffering from liver disease and when he started to act a little strange and confused I looked it up and discovered he had \\"Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE).\\" I was able to call my vet and describe his symptoms and explain that I thought he was HE and the vet gave us a prescription without having to bring him in.

Dog Owner's handbook does not disappoint. The handbooks are our only pet vet references now, other books just don't measure up."},{"Title":"Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook (Howell Reference Books)","review":"I have been meaning to write a review for this book for quite awhile, but when I found myself turning to it (yet again) last week after receiving a difficult diagnosis for my beloved geriatric dog, I thought it was time to sit down and express my appreciation for this book.I am not fond of reviews that insist I &quot;must! &quot; have this or that, so please forgive me if I sound strident in my insistence that this really &quot;should! &quot; be in the possession of everyone who has a dog to care for. Here lies information that can help you out of the trenches and decide when you should wake up your vet in the middle of the night, when to wait till morning, and when to try handling things yourself. This is also the place where I learned how to monitor my pets vitals so I can get an idea of what may be going on and to provide my vet with some of the information needed to hit the ground running. Out of the several pet care books I have (Pitcairn's being one of them) THIS is the book that I grab first and it's the one my neighbors come over to examine when thier dog seems &quot;off&quot; and the one my family calls and asks me to read parts of over the phone (I will share this book, but I won't loan it). I wish they'd all get thier own copy, but at least one of us has it on hand.As someone who has four large, geriatric dogs I love dearly, I wouldn't be without this book. Plenty of other books are going to provide you with glossy color photos and generic information, but when you need information--real, solid stuff you can leave teethmarks in, this book is what you need. General care and functioning is covered very well, but this volume really shines when things seem serious, even scary and it fleshes out those pre- and post-vet questions like no other.PS--Pitcairn's book, which I mentioned in passing, is a nice general resource that is especially helpful for those interested in learning about feeding thier pets natural, whole-food diets. I like my copy quite a bit, but I can best describe it by saying I'll loan that book to a friend for a week or so, not so with Home Veterinary Handbook."},{"Title":"Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook (Howell Reference Books)","review":"One of the most difficult tasks for the loving dog owner is deciding when a malady needs a vet's attention. This book helps to make this task easier. As a multiple big dog owner, I can't afford to run to the vet every time one of my dogs is not feeling his or her best. This book allows me to research a malady to help make the important decision: does my dog need to see a vet? This saves me money and gives me peace of mind. It also gives me the information I need to have an educated conversation with my vet about treatments, when and if they are necessary. It's like having an assistant on call 24 x 7."},{"Title":"Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook (Howell Reference Books)","review":"This is by far the best health care guide for dogs. From the quick index of symptoms on the inside cover, to the great coverage of many diseases and disorders in canines, this is a well-written and easy to understand book, that goes beyond the basics most dog care books give you, without becoming too technical. My vet actually kept one on hand in his office for quick reference."},{"Title":"Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook (Howell Reference Books)","review":"This book pays for itself 1000 times over! It gives the dog owner peace of mind and also saves thousands of dollars on costly, unecessary trips to the vet. An excellent source of information!"},{"Title":"Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook (Howell Reference Books)","review":"I show and occasionally breed dogs. This book was given to me as a gift a year ago and in that short time it has already *saved* the life of a puppy, correctly diagnosed dog's ailments/problems and given detailed instructions on how to treat them, and was a great tool in preparing for and whelping our last show litter. Beginners can learn so much from this book as well as being an excellent reference for the more &quot;seasoned&quot; dog fancier too. The authors have that special feel for the dog as not only DVM's, but as avid dog lovers, exhibitors and breeders as well. HIGHLY reccomended as a **MUST HAVE** for any dog owner!!!!!"},{"Title":"Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook (Howell Reference Books)","review":"I have been an owner/breeder of wolves and wolfdogs for almost 20 years. Since many veterinarians will not examine or treat wolves, we who own them must learn how to treat them ourselves. This book has taught me more than all my other veterinary books combined. It has saved the lives of several of my animals, plus saved me 1000's of dollars in vet bills. I have bought several copies to share with friends and relatives, and for years I made my customers buy a copy before I would sell them a puppy! It is by far the best book in my vast collection of dog and wolf books."},{"Title":"Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook (Howell Reference Books)","review":"Dr. Giffin has done it again with this updated version of his original best-seller. This book clearly explains the symptoms of canine illnesses in a user-friendly, understandable, and organized fashion. No other book compares in terms of its comprehensiveness, readibility, and authority. This book will make an excellent gift for anyone who has a dog."},{"Title":"Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook (Howell Reference Books)","review":"Believe it or not I actually used this book the first day I received it. My huskie cut his foot and the first aid treatment was at my finger tips! The book contains symptoms, diagnosis and especially informs the owner when a vet visit or emergency visit is required. Every dog owner should have this book on hand for emergencies, symptoms and treatment to take appropriate action for the benefit and health of their beloved pet. The same as having a first aid book for the human side!"},{"Title":"Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook (Howell Reference Books)","review":"Once in a while a book comes along which in the field of practical applications... is a real treasure. This is one of those books. Full of photos and easy to read text, not to mention helpful advice, &quot;this is it&quot;-- for the dog owner who really cares. It will not turn you completely from being independent of your vet, but it will help in determining which symptoms and cases where you would just have to run to him. For example, in the section &quot;Intestines&quot;, it describes the most common irregularities, like diarrhea, the color, consistency, odor, frequency, condition of dog, common causes, and finally the treatment section. And it does not stop there. It will then give related problems about the intestines, from malabsorption syndromes to colitis, obstructions, constipation, voluntary retention, mechanical blockage, damaged nerves, flatulence and coprophagia (yeech!), et.al. And that is just a section, as I said, under Intestines. Whether you have one dog, or several kennels, professional breeder, backyard breeder, or no breeder at all, and just interested in the well-being of man's best friend, it will turn you from a feeling of uncertainty into a confident owner. It's the &quot;leash&quot; you can do.This revised and expanded edition is one of my prime sources of information regarding the health of my dogs. It will save the owner, as it has saved me from needless worries, (or make it worse, depending really on the personality of the owner), and a lot of expenses. Read it, you'll like it."},{"Title":"Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook (Howell Reference Books)","review":"This book is an execellent reference.

The author goes though the possible causes of each ailment &amp; condition and suggests remedies &amp; solutions. While concise, the text particularises and sets out sufficient detail to satisfy all but the most demanding of readers ...Reference to the book, after visiting the vet, is helping us understand better what our vet is saying and doing ... and this provides reassurance that we are doing our best for our dogs.We also find the photographs (although a little distressing) to be of essential value. The photographs have been invaluable in teaching us how to recognise and identify physical symptoms ... The photographs also allows us to make quick &amp; direct comparison between the condition we see in/on our pets with that described in the book &amp; depicted in images ... this allows us to make some sort of assessment (albeit, untrained) on issue of severity and urgency.All in all ... the book is good value."},{"Title":"Dog Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook (Howell Reference Books)","review":"I was amazed at the various topics in this book!

Of course it was... you guessed it... the weekend! Well I knew I needed to stop the bleeding and cover the area so she didn't do any more damage, but I wasn't sure if I needed to head to the ER vet or not. Luckily this book had instructions and told me when I might need to go the the ER - I did what the book suggested and on Monday called my regular vet to tell her what had happened. I was told to bring her in the next day since I'd already done everything that she would have done but they did need to check things out.

Although the allegories had to be modernized, they could be more consistent with the original much as &quot;Alice in Quantum Land&quot; was. All-in-all a wonderful read and a great introduction to some more complex concepts of science and quantum mechanics."},{"Title":"Scrooge's Cryptic Carol: Visions of Energy, Time, and Quantum Nature","review":"My profile 44 yo frustrated enterpreneur but hanging in there, have a degree in mechanical engineering.I have not finished the book yet, as I am also reading it in parallel to \\"A matter of degrees\\" by Gino Segr&eacute; \\"The refrigerator and the universe\\" Goldstein & Goldstein, \\"Why hings are the way they are\\" Chandrasekhar and \\"The II law\\" by Atkins... it is part of this tour de force destined to conquer once and for all the tricky intricacies of thermodymanics.As with all books that are in the popularizacion level, certain rigorous aspects of the language pertaining words such as heat, temperature are bound to be used sometimes in an intuitive level... so do not be confused if you suddenly read that a body has heat instead of a body has thermal energy, this subtleties are the ones that are discovered by reading many authors and finally come to handle the terms in their rigourous usage.About the book, it is delightful and perhaps one of the best introductions you can have to the subject. Firs of all, it guides you to something hat in most textbooks is either omitted or mentioned as a curious note- The heat death of the universe- if the universe keeps on expanding because we are beyond escape velocity, then the death of the universe will look like this, it is an important limit to grasp.This Scrooge is suprisingly astute in its observation to the spirits that visit him, he is not science ignorant.. and the spirits guide us through the laws of thermodynamics in a way that should be obligatory for us to learn in school.Again I would recommend reading this books at par with some other similars so we can see the subject form many angles, but the prose, the examples and the exposition we see in Scrooge's is something we cannot miss, this is a book for old and young."},{"Title":"Decorative Art in Modern Interiors Volume 52","review":"I love this series of books oh so very much.I have a feeling that these books were long-forgotten and have are now experiencing revived interest. (Just look at the couch on the cover...it could be right off the set of the 1964 Mad Men offices in the Time Life Building!)What makes this series special is that there is a rigorously international focus. For example, this volume, #52, has editors from Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Argentina, Czsechoslovakia, Switzerland, and the United States.The basic concept behind this series is a year-to-year look at Decorative Art AND Modern Interiors with a balance between public and private spaces. The decorative pieces receive focus, of course (pages and pages of photos) but they are best understood within the context of the interiors. Thus, we get table settings and glass and ceramic objects within a Beverly Hills house with floorplans. A couple of pages later we get area rugs, bric-a-brac, wall art, and pillows in the Apartment in Stockholm.And there are advertising pages in the back, full page spreads, amazing in the facility or incompetence of their graphic design.I think that this book is particularly important in its devotion to textiles -- some block print patterns which look like they could be from the 50's, but a number of wonderful woven rugs and other pieces which appear quite modern and beautiful while still being rooted in a folk tradition. By 1974, of course, every room in North America had at least one horrid, shaggy, cheap, earth-toned fabric piece in it, but here the work seems fresh and vital. And when these woven objects are incorporated into rooms with some sleek surfaces and clean lines, they are really shown to advantage.Of course, that's my take-away from this volume. I imagine other readers might be transported by the ceramics or the stemware or the lighting."},{"Title":"Witness to Myself (Hard Case Crime (Mass Market Paperback))","review":"\\"You don't have to know if you killed her, he told himself. You've lived all these years, fifteen years, without knowing. And you've got a good life that you're going to destroy, you're only thirty, a lawyer, you have someone you love, and a new career, one where you can do so much good. You've never had it better. For God's sake turn around!\\" -- from Witness to MyselfFor the last fifteen years, an impulsive act has kept Alan Benning in fear of being discovered. Only he is not quite sure exactly of what he is guilty. Did he kill the young girl in the woods off the shore of the fictional Cape Cod town of South Minton, or didn't he? Not knowing is driving him crazy. Little does he know that trying to find out the truth will make him even more miserable.I believe that this is the first time that Hard Case Crime has published a new work by an author from whom they could have just as easily published a reprint. Seymour Shubin (a rather milquetoasty name for a crime-fiction writer) has been in the psychological-suspense business since his debut novel, Anyone's My Name, first appeared on the bestseller lists in 1953.He was nominated for an Edgar Allan Poe Award from the Mystery Writers of America for his novel, The Captain, in 1982, and his 1985 novel, Voices, focused on the phone-sex industry. (There is an interview with the author, from that year, online.) Shubin's work has also been selected for inclusion in critical surveys of the mystery genre (although he objects to the classification of his work in that way).Shubin makes an interesting choice in Witness to Myself by telling Alan's story through his cousin, Colin. Finding out Colin's role in the story is just one of the many questions readers will be wanting answered. The primary effect this has, though, is a lack of certainty in Alan's lifespan, adding to the suspense. Shubin skillfully carries his readers along, involving us deeply in Alan's story, and making this possible murderer an extremely sympathetic character. The conviction in Colin's voice is so strong that, many times, I had to remind myself that I was reading a crime novel, and not a non-fiction tome (Shubin has written in the true-crime field and it shows).Witness to Myself has the old-time feel of noir fiction but is set firmly in the present. Like any modern thirty-somethings, Shubin's characters feel completely comfortable using the Internet for research -- in fact, they prefer it. Alan keeps the Cape Cod Breeze's Web site link on his desktop for easy access, and Colin instantly goes to Google when trying to find the meaning of a half-remembered phrase. This is the first book I've read that has folded modern technology so seamlessly within its storyline -- even more surprising coming from an \\"old-timer\\" like Shubin."},{"Title":"Witness to Myself (Hard Case Crime (Mass Market Paperback))","review":"Adolescence is a hard perplexing time ripe with strange thoughts, strange feelings, and impetuous actions with little consideration of the consequences. It certainly was fifteen years ago for teenager Alan Benning. His family, on vacation in Cape Cod by way of a large motor home, had no idea what he thought or felt. The family was well off, his parents were conservative and Alan, with no one to talk to about life and his feelings, began to hate and fear himself. That hatred and fear of himself grew and grew after the incident in the woods near the beach during that vacation.In the present day, Alan, now thirty is a successful lawyer with a steady girlfriend, Anna, a loving cousin, and an obsession about what might or might not have happened that fateful day fifteen years ago. Driven to know, he begins to unravel his own perfect life. A life that appears to be perfect but hides so many dark secrets that he is not sure of what actually happened back then.Author Seymour Shubin has weaved a complete tale about the human spirit. Shifting in point of view between Alan and his cousin the author paints a picture of obsession. Not only is Alan obsessed with what he might or might not have done but the cousin has his own obsession. The cousin's need isn't as obvious early in the novel but the end of the book it is clear that his own obsession is just as strong.It is also clear that the author is commenting on the nature of mankind. Those little things that surely lead to disaster. Those little things, unnoticed or unremarked at the time and yet become telling through the use of hindsight. The signs were obvious, as they often are, and unnoticed until long after the fact. The author makes this point throughout the work as he weaves complex multifaceted characters throughout the tale.The result is a fast paced intense read. While only 250 pages in paperback, this isn't a beach book and far from it. This is a book that rapidly becomes a real page turner as it pulls the reader into a world not unlike his or her own. This is a book that one doesn't want interrupted and is sorry to see end. Intense and driven, the book doesn't let go until that final phrase \\"the end\\" and even then lingers in the mind.Kevin R. Tipple (copyright) 2006"},{"Title":"Witness to Myself (Hard Case Crime (Mass Market Paperback))","review":"This is a different sort of Hard Case novel. It's not a Whodunit. It's not about planning and pulling off one last big score. It's not about revenge. Witness to Myself is sort of a Whydunnit. I liked it but if you're expecting it to be like the others in the series you'll be somewhat disappointed. 15 years ago when he was a sex obsessed teen, Alan, the protagonist did something disgusting. Now, as sad eyed adult he is forced to look back on that one out-of-character act and find out whether his memory played him false.Did he commit a huge crime or did he commit the ultimate crime? Since the story is being told from a distance of years by Alan's cousin you lose some of the urgency. You also know from page one that this will not have a happy ending. It is ebstablished up front that Alan is guilty of something and the book is pretty much about watching him drive himself mad until he finally confesses.The strength of the book is the emotional punch. You feel sorry for Alan. You feel sorry and worried for Anna. The book makes it clear that if Alan had just walked away that day 15 years ago he would've lived happily ever after and he would've deserved to. This is far more of a tragedy than a classic crime story."},{"Title":"Witness to Myself (Hard Case Crime (Mass Market Paperback))","review":"Mr. Shubin has been writing classic noir novels, including Anyone's My Name and The Captain for close to 50 years now, and Witness to Myself is yet another brilliant novel of Shubin's. The writing is masterfully done, very subtle where instead of explosions you get a slow burn that works its way under your skin as it follows the downward spiral of its doomed protagonist who may or may not have committed a heinous crime when he was 15. This is pure noir, poignant, riveting, and I can not recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Witness to Myself (Hard Case Crime (Mass Market Paperback))","review":"The classic PBOs in the 1950s tackled edgy crimes, tough situations, and tragic figures. Mr. Shubin's PBO, WITNESS TO MYSELF, is no different. That undoubtedly stems from the fact he's been at it since 1953 debut, ANYONE'S MY NAME. Philadelphia lawyer Alan Benning, 30, is an anguished individual who as a fifteen-year-old molested Susheela Kapasi, a thirteen-year-old girl. This deed racks Alan with guilt for fifteen years. He manages to fall in love with his LPN, Anna Presiac, and discovers Susheela was found murdered by her father on the same day. The story tracks Alan's investigation to determine if he's Susheela's actual killer. Alan's cousin Colin, a true crime writer, is the sympathetic, puzzled narrator though he ponders if publishing Alan's crime story might make for a lucrative book deal (so true for any commercial writer). On the other hand, Alan probably won't endear many hearts. This psychological study of a criminal mind is a well-paced and intelligent read."},{"Title":"Witness to Myself (Hard Case Crime (Mass Market Paperback))","review":"Many crimes, violent and otherwise, are committed by people with sociopathic personalities. They have no conscience and therefore feel no guilt. Remorsefulness comes only when they are caught and face punishment.But what happens when an individual with a normally developed conscience commits a particularly heinous act? That is what Witness to Myself is about.Alan Benning, a young attorney on his way up in the world, had impulsively assaulted a young girl when he was 15 years old. The guilt he feels over this long ago crime becomes overpowering and begins to control every aspect of his life. He contemplates suicide. Even going out and buying a gun so he will have the means to end his own life.Narrated by Alan's cousin Colin, Witness to Myself is unapologetically downbeat as it chronicles the hopelessness of its protagonist's dilemma. This is a book about inescapable psychic pain. An unusual departure from the standard crime novel."},{"Title":"Witness to Myself (Hard Case Crime (Mass Market Paperback))","review":"Alan had a chance to confess to the crime he committed as a teen. Instead, he ducked suspicion and let it fest for fifteen years. What plays out, through the words of his cousin, true crime writer Colin, is how the perfect crime and perfect life of Alan went terrifically, horrifyingly wrong.I enjoyed the style, as it's different from the novels of this genre I've read in the past. Every time I find a book from Hard Case while I'm out and about, I pick it up. I've not been disappointed yet."},{"Title":"Witness to Myself (Hard Case Crime (Mass Market Paperback))","review":"Although Shubin tries to distance readers from the crime by taking them through the story via the protagonist's cousin Colin, the author is so intent on showing the perpetrator's internal process that we are, in fact, catapulted into the very heart and soul of evil itself. So we undergo this chilling journey of obsessional worry, fear, and conscience to its ultimate conclusion with minimal buffer and explore the darkness of a single impulsive act all the more lucidly for that lack of detachment. Shubin is an artful writer, and this novel will stand among his very best-may it be on the shelves a long, long time. G. Miki Hayden, author of Writing the Mystery"},{"Title":"Witness to Myself (Hard Case Crime (Mass Market Paperback))","review":"After reading like 4 of them I was expecting something classic. What I got was a entertaining, well written book. So why am I giving it two stars? Well it should have been published under some other company or come with a better warning.As other people have mentioned, this book does not fit Hard Cases traditional genre. There is no \\"real violence\\". No twists, no turns, no robberies, no tough guys... Just one man conflicted about a possible murder told through the 3rd person.I ding it because it isn't tradiontal noir. It is a solid book, don't get me wrong. It just ain't a \\"Two for the Money\\" or a \\"Fade to Blonde\\".Sean"},{"Title":"Witness to Myself (Hard Case Crime (Mass Market Paperback))","review":"If you've been following Hard Case Crime, you know they've put together a distinguished catalog of noir novels. One assumes their publication of a very bad novel by Stephen King was a deliberate mistake aimed directly at the bottom line. But there is no excuse for the Shubin book. There is no complexity, no twists, nothing going on beneath the surface, no surprises, no relationship of any kind with the traditional noir gestures. Anything suggestive of there being more going on than meets the eye, proves to be digressions that signify nothing. The characters are bland and unintersting and the plot almost nonexistent. A fifteen year old boy sexually abuses a twelve year old girl and then kills her. Fifteen years later he turns himself in and goes to prison. Big deal. If he had turned himself in at once, this book wouldn't exist, and we would all be better off."},{"Title":"Witness to Myself (Hard Case Crime (Mass Market Paperback))","review":"WHY doesn't Amazon.com let you rate a book Zero Stars?This disappointing effort is the worst of the Hard Case Crime series.

I've always been interested in the Adeptus Arbites and like how Matthew Farrer brings the reader into their world. In Legacy, we are introduced to the enigmatic figure of the Rogue Trader. In other novels, the rogue trader has been described as every from an unscrupulous privateer, to covert assets of the Inquisition. Farrer presents a historical figure empowered by Imperial Charter to expand the boundaries of the Imperium and who is often times gifted with the independence and unilateral ability to do whatever they want. This ability sets the stage for an engaging story, filled with characters that we grow to care for and develop an interest in until the very last page. Although the novel is part of the Shira Calpurnia series, her character is featured less in this story. The elements that drive the plot to its ultimate conclusion are what make the story so compelling. No need to worry, though, because Shira will play her part in this tale and for those of you who thought this book was too short; I share your opinion. I'll admit that the ending initially disappointed me, but after further reflection, I found that it was a much better way to end the story. Read it and make up your own mind ;)For those of you who feel this book did not live up to the quality of it predecessor; we'll just have to respectfully disagree :) For those of you who are considering this book, I highly recommend it. If you have already read Crossfire, I believe you will enjoy this just as much!"},{"Title":"Legacy (Warhammer 40,000)","review":"MAtthew Farrer's follow-up to his first Black Library novel (Crossfire) is titled Legacy and on its own the book is a good scifi novel, but it doesn't match or exceed its predecessor.The main protagonist of the first novel, Shira Calpurnia or the Adeptus Arbites, is really a background character this time, even though the books is considered the second one in the Calpurnia series. What one gets instead are characters who should've remained secondary. In legacy, Shira has to preside over the passing over of an ancient rogue trader charter to an heir apparent. What begins from there on is a mish-mash of double-cross, political machinations between members of the Imperium's many department's, especially the Adeptus Arbites and the Adeptus Ministorum (the Ecclesiarchy).There is less action in this book than in the first. More of Shira's personality is revealed and that of the Arbites' role in the Imperium. I just hope that Farrer has a better follow-up to continue Shira's saga."},{"Title":"Legacy (Warhammer 40,000)","review":"The Legendary Rogue Trader Hoyyon Phrax is dead. His line holds an ancient and sacred charter and is now due to be bequeathed to his rightful heir. Shira Calpurnia bears the office and the duties of arbitor senioris in the service of the \\"Lex Imperia\\". Her duty and orders, given to her in the name of the law by the Emperor-chosen superiors, are to preside and judge on the inheritance of the Imperial Charter.The known heir is Varro Phrax, trader-in-waiting. His flotilla is en route to Hydraphur to accept his inheritance and receive the charter. There are others who want to get their hands on the sacred charter. An order of warriors called the Fraternal Order of the Aquila want the relic to be handed over to them instead...and so does another religious order. Arbitor Calpurnia would be able to deal with these easily; however, a counter-claim is filed. It is said that Hoyyon has another son, a half-brother to Varro named Petronas Phrax. The ceremony will change into a hearing with Shira as judge.Shira must now deal with treachery and mutiny by the heirs. Someone will do anything to claim the prize no matter what the law states. Death comes.*** The major flaw in this story, in my opinion, is that Shira and her Arbites are not the main characters. They take a back seat in this story, except for the very beginning and the very end. Most of the novel is dealing with the heirs and those trying to manipulate the heirs. I was not too impressed with it all. The deception was not well organized and too sloppy. I found it hard to believe that these \\"intelligent\\" people would even try something that could do nothing but fail against the tests by the revered engines of the Genetor cult (the ark of the Helispex). The ending of the story is not what I would have hoped for either. Worth your time to read, but nothing fantastic. ***Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."},{"Title":"Legacy (Warhammer 40,000)","review":"It's a great idea. A rogue trader dies and various factions compete for control of his vast wealth, fleet of ships and, most importantly, his warrant of trade signed by the Emperor himself. And Arbites Officer Shira Calpurnia is caught in the middle. Legacy promises palace intrigue and mystery rather than the usual all-out action books.And there are some great ideas in this book. It opens with a novel Imperial punishment. Sinners are locked in cages suspended above the main road of the city. Each day priests walk under the cages to hear the confessions of the prisoners. Once they hear a confession the prisoner is freed. The twist is while some cages are suspended just above the road, others rise thousands of feet where no one can hear the prisoner. But don't worry, if the Emperor wants prisoners freed he will find a way for their words to reach the priests. It's twisted and brilliant, and there are other great moments like this in the book.Fans of the Dark Heresy and Rogue Trader role playing games will find some great ideas here.But the main plot doesn't really work out. Like many other Black Library books Legacy needed another draft or two and a strong editor before being published. Author Matthew Farrer has trouble with the old 'show don't tell' rule. Instead of letting the various plots and machinations play out and come to a dramatic head, he instead tells the reader too much. Halfway through the book we know who's lying and what their plans are. So what should have been an exciting trial filled with twists and turns instead is an anticlimax which feels rote and by-the-numbers. The ending has a nice twist, but the build up to it is just poorly done.At just 250 pages this is a quick read, but it still manages to drag in the middle. Add a star if you have a particular interest in the Adeptus Arbites or Rogue Traders but otherwise this might not be worth your time."},{"Title":"Legacy (Warhammer 40,000)","review":"Don't come into this book expecting the same thing as in Crossfire. It's a good book on its own, but it ends a little abruptly and some of the action seems a bit drawn out, or maybe stretched too thin (not enough actually happening to justify all the coverage).However, once you get into Blind, you realize it was all just right.

It's easy to get lost when its one random story after another, but grouped in chapters like they are makes it easier to pick up on particular themes and makes the book as a whole more memorable.If you're interest is in \\"ghost lore\\" and you prefer \\"accounts\\" over modern-day \\"hunting\\" or a lot of embellished \\"storytelling\\" then I would say this is certainly one book you should have."},{"Title":"Telltale Lilac Bush and Other West Virginia Ghost Tales","review":"I remember reading this book in eight grade WV History.

She makes no effort to doll them up (though she does say in her preface that she edited them, some heavily, to take out redundancy), and so they often read quite plain; those looking for a Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark-esque compendium will be disappointed here, as Musick chooses the stories she presents in order to illuminate a specific type of ghost story or a specific set of commonalities. I would think this would be of most use to a writer who's looking for an interesting subplot or the like; there's a great deal of primary source to be mined here. ***"},{"Title":"Telltale Lilac Bush and Other West Virginia Ghost Tales","review":"I really like learning things from my past and this book is a wonderful way to learn about my area's past.

Unfortunately this is nothing like volume 1 because these stories seem entirely fabricated at worst or exceptionally embellished at best. Some are patently fantasy, others are fiction written by professional gay writers. A great example of the latter is Bingo (p.34) by Ryan Field. Not only are there common elements to another of his books, but the timeline makes no sense unless he started the relationship discussed when he was 7 years old. You'll also quickly notice that everybody is an expert at gay sex on their first run through. If you are simply after erotic short stories then this may be what you're looking for, however, if you want a book similar to volume 1 (whose reviews you should read) then I wouldn't bother."},{"Title":"The law of psychic phenomena (1912): A working hypothesis for the systematic study of hypnotism, spiritism & mental therapeutics","review":"This is a wonderful, well explained introduction to mysticism and psychism.

Finally, I know the secret of what guar and xanthan gums are, and the difference between soy flour and soy powder and soy protein isolate. It's not likely I'll use any of these but now that I know what they are, I know how to substitute for them and I understand what they're doing in any low carb products I buy.

The recipies are best for someone with a lot of time to shop for the specialized ingredients and then to prepare the meal. And if you're expecting that with 500 recipes there must be some winners (which I thought), you need to know that most of the recipes are merely variations on a single recipe. This may be helpful since each provides the actual carb counts, but I could have figured out the difference with any carb counting handbook.When I add in the value of my time, I found it more cost effective to purchase the prepared low-carb foods in my local health food store.

As others have mentioned, main dishes are Dana's strong point. They aren't gourmet but we've found many we'll make over and over again. So far, our favorites are the Noodleless Lasagne (try it w/ spinach!) and Chicken Artichoke Skillet. The Chicken Paprikash w/ Fauxtatoes, Heroin Wings, and Artichoke Mushroom Pork are also very good. Misses are mainly clustered in the dessert section, but then again it's understandably more difficult to develop low-carb desserts that taste &quot;normal.&quot; We loved the Oatmeal Cookies, but the Peanut Butter Brownies (a recipe borrowed from Diana Lee) were awful, as was the Sunshine Cheesecake.Be aware--a number of items require somewhat obscure/expensive ingredients (i.e. soy powder, psyllium husks, etc.). Nonetheless, if you have a Whole Foods in your area, you should be able to find them with no problem. It's really impossible to make low-carb baked goods without some kind of substitute for regular flour, so any other reduced carb cookbook that includes breads, cookies, etc. is likely to present the same issue. Also, if you're looking to cut both carbs *and* fat, this may not be the choice for you. Many recipes call for heavy cream, butter and/or full-fat sour cream. Calorie counts are not included.Overall, this is easily the best low-carb cookbook I've found and with the above caveats in mind, I'd definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this cookbook. Let me start by saying that I've always had a bad relationship with cookbooks. I'd open them up and not know which recipe to choose or the ingredients would be weird and not available at the local store. I've given away almost every cookbook I've ever owned because I never used them. Whether I was dieting or not, I just couldn't find one I liked.Well, my mom bought this book and I flipped through it for a few minutes. I actually got excited about the recipes. I started marking the pages so I could plan meals. I wound up taking my mom's copy because I just had to have it. I am taking the author's advice and trying something new every night. I am actually excited about cooking for my family!What makes this cookbook great is it's simplicity. The ingredients are readily available, the techniques are simple and well explained, and the results are fabulous.Even if you're not on a low-carb diet, read this book. So many of the recipes are good for any kind of eating plan!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"this is one of the best cookbooks i have ever owned, and i own A LOT of them.I recently started doing Atkins so i bought this.

Many dinners i choose to cook i will have all the ingrediants in the house.This is not the old fashioned &quot;diet food&quot; your used to.This is truly worth buying!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"As a confirmed 'low carber' for years now (and years after the constant ravenous hunger of the low fat route), I am delighted with the honesty and variety of this gem of a book. The introduction itself should be a primer for all new to the low carb way. Dana, who is not dealing with theories but the personal reality of 'low carbing,' provides a vivid and entertaining treatment of the value of low carb diets and the need to accept that one is 'low carb for life.' (I mention this, in particular, because there is a popular and dangerous assumption that 'low carb' is a temporary programme. No wonder that it is incorrectly thought to be a failure.)The recipes, though not on a par with gourmet cooking, are superior to, and easier to prepare than, others I have seen in books for the low carb market. They do not require exotic, expensive ingredients in most cases, nor, as with some other books in this genre, are they a veiled advertisement for exclusive mixes and other products.I am hoping Dana writes yet another book, and that there are a few additions. This book has a disproportionate amount of space devoted to snacks, desserts, and starters, where many of us low carbers have little need for these. I should like to see more main dishes - though a number are included, many are repetitious (numerous hamburger recipes, various Thai and Mexican variations, yet not one recipe for pork ribs, for example.) A number of the recipes are based on preparation for large groups (6-12), and are not easy to proportion for one or two people. The sauce recipes can be repetitious (for example, garlic butter and garlic bleu cheese steak spread), yet do not include variations on gravies to serve with roasts.Overall, it is the most worthwhile low carb cookbook that I have seen."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"The name of this book says it all - you get 500 wonderful recipes, all of them low carb, and every one we've tried is quite delicious!The book is a soft cover and flops easily open, which is GREAT when we are using this to work with. Many of our other low carb recipe books are paperback or hard cover, which are nearly impossible to work with The recipes are well organized and all quite easy to read and follow.But the key here is the VARIETY. A lot of people, raised on the Western &quot;tons of french fries and sugary foods&quot; diet, panic when they think about eating low carb food. Really, all low carb means is that you eat lots of fresh fruit, fresh vegetables and fresh meat! And this is a hardship? Dana's book helps you realize that your menu is now far *tastier* than it ever has been.There are of course the staples - lots of tasty omelet recipes, lots of advice for salads and grilled meats. But then you get into dishes that seem pure paradise. The spicy peanut chicken. The New England boiled dinner. The Eggplant Parmesan. There are pizza crust recipes, shrimp and andouille jambalaya, jerk pork, curried lamb. You could feed someone recipes from this book for 2 years straight, a different dish every night, and they would have no IDEA that this was a &quot;healthy diet&quot;. This stuff is simply *delicious*.And of course there are tons of desserts too, from pumpkin pie to lemon sherbert to peanut butter bars. Sure, some aren't good for the beginning induction stages of an Atkins diet. But a low carb lifestyle can keep you healthy for years and years - and these treats will help keep some variety in your menu. When you've hit your ideal weight, that 10g serving of blackbottomed mockahlua cheesecake might be the perfect way to celebrate!Highly recommended for anyone who wants to eat more healthily - no matter WHAT diet you choose to follow."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"This is a comfortable book to use unlike other low carb recipe books that are complicated and have so many specialty items. Its a good deal too. 500 recipes! One thing that I like about Dana Carpender is that she's frugal and she tells you to buy whatevers cheapest when its not necessary to purchase &quot;the best&quot;. She also advises when you should go for better quality ingredients. I like it that she's looking out for our best interest. Great book. Love it."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"If you have changed to a low carb way of living, you may need to update your cookbook shelves. This is a grand choice for your treasured basic cookbook. It is diverse, and well tested. It covers lots of basics.One shining example is her pumpkin pie with a pecan praline crust is good enough that when you bring the regular pastry crust pie, and the diet pie with the pecan praline crust, the diet pie is devoured by those who swear that they detest diet food.She has some wonderful salad dressing recipes that lack all of the sugar that the commercially available dressings have.For the people who still think that low carb is all bacon cheeseburgers, hold the bun, read all of her vegetable recipes. She can help people to reach out to vegetables that they have never tried.Her cookbooks are always great to read for ideas. I may or may not prepare her recipe as it states, but it will inspire me, and give me ideas, and suggestions as to what I can do with what.Her suggestions of what to do with steaks are wonderful. The woman does respect a piece of meat, but gives subtle tweaks to really bring out the flavor, rather than simply drowning it, or overwhelming it.Most of the main dish foods in this book work quite well even if your whole family doesn't eat low carb. If some members of your family eat low carb, and some don't, you can always add starchy sides for the other family members, but let me warn you, once the family sees your \\"special food\\", they'll wonder why they have their plain vanilla side dishes, and will be grabbing for your food!She is more respectful of the dietary decisions that low carbers make in her choices of ingredients. Many so called low carb cookbooks are still filled with empty starchy carbohydrates, like white flour. Dana takes the high road, without making weird ingredient substitutions unless she really has to. Her foods are really good because they are real foods.If you have tried to get with a low carb way of life, and have had problems with boredom, his may be your tool. If you find yourself cheating, this may be your best hope. If you live with a low carber, cook up a few dishes from this, and show them how considerate, and gifted you are. If you bring her foods to any pot-luck event, nab some early, as her foods go fast."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I am not entirely sure I can quantify my love for this book, and most of Dana's cookbooks... You see, when I first went low-carb (2004), I wasn't just coming from a diet full of starch and sugar, I was coming from a vegetarian diet. Not just any vegetarian diet, mind you - this was one I truly thought was healthy! I wasn't a \\"chips and soda\\" vegetarian by any means... but being from a family predisposed to blood sugar problems, such reliance on beans, corn, grains and pastas - no matter how natural - made me fat. I went vegetarian in the first place because I was convinced that it was the ONLY way to be healthy and thin... and that's true for some people, but not for me!So, inspired by my mother's success with it, I decided to go low-carb... but I had been a vegetarian for so long that I had no idea how to make the simplest meat recipes! I've been seeing so many complaints here about how \\"basic\\" and \\"obvious\\" some of the recipes are, but I will personally step up and say that I actually NEEDED to know the basics of how to boil shrimp, how to correctly pan-fry a steak - not so much the concept, but the details. Sure, anyone can toss a steak in a skillet and turn up the heat, but these recipes are more than that for someone like me. The subtle guidelines for how long to wait, what types of steaks and chops fare well with certain cooking methods, basically, all of the things that \\"normal\\" cookbooks teach meat eaters, they were useful to me. I would walk into the meat section and have little clue which cuts were for roasting, which for braising and so on.I can't forget the flavour combinations offered in some of these \\"basic\\" recipes, either! I'd always liked eating meat, but having never really cooked it myself before going low-carb, I didn't have the creativity to come up with winning flavour combinations. Sometimes, it isn't even a matter of confidence or knowledge, it's a matter of needing an idea. I tend to need springboards here and there, and so I appreciate the simple things.On to my actual review - this book has done so much for me, from teaching me how to cook meat dishes (I love the Lemon-Pepper Chicken and Gravy!) to saving me from low-carb boredom (the Perfect Protein Pancakes don't require any weird specialty items, and they are delicious) to keeping me from cheating on the holidays (the Pumpkin Cheesecake is gorgeous) to appeasing friends and family who don't count carbs (Cauliflower-Olive Salad is a big hit) to eventually building up my kitchen confidence enough to where I don't rely on recipes to shake some seasonings onto a steak or chop.Dana's tone is very witty, matter-of-fact and down-to-earth. She does her absolute best to explain anything that might be questionable. I never felt lost, even as a total novice in the kitchen, because the instructions were always very clear. This isn't to say I've followed every single recipe to the letter - I have substituted all over the place, and with great results. My one criticism of these recipes is that I tend to use far less Splenda in the non-baking recipes, and wonder what sort of sweet teeth are being catered to, but that's hardly a complaint.One more \\"issue\\" I keep seeing in some of these reviews is the inconsistency in some of the recipes, or admission to not trying a particular ingredient. It states very clearly in the book that many of these recipes were contributed by friends of Dana's, as well as readers of her e-zine. She also states very clearly that she sometimes farmed out the recipe testing. So, maybe that doesn't happen very often in most cookbooks, but it's nothing the author is hiding from us.So... in conclusion, I have practically lived by the recipes in this book for the last five years (I slightly prefer 15-Minute Low Carb Recipes) and I am healthier, happier, more confident in the kitchen, knowledgeable of all sorts of specialty products and cuts of meat... and not so fat anymore. Thank you, Dana Carpender and friends!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"This book is a godsend for people wanting a low-carb lifestyle, but also need quick (family-friendly) recipes.

Many &quot;common&quot; recipes transformed into low carb goodies. Good explanations of ingredients and instructions for reading labels, measuring, etc. I expect to be using it a lot! Fun to read as well!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I had heard how great this book was but had to see for myself and I'm very impressed. I have never read a recipe book cover-to-cover before now. Dana Carpender has a refreshing way of approaching low-carb eating, cooking, and sharing her talents. I can't wait to try the next recipe!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Overall, I think this is one of the better &quot;low carb&quot; cookbooks, with fairly creative recipes. My one complaint is that too many of the &quot;500 recipes&quot; are fairly simple variations - way too many recipes for various omelets (which are fairly self evident if you've ever seen a breakfast menu at any restaurant in the US). But overall, the recipes are good without an excessive reliance on obscure ingredients (although there are a few that call for soy powder and the like). But on balance, good basic everyday cookbook for low carb recipes."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I really like this book. It is full of low-carb easy recipes. A lot of other books that I have looked at claim to be low carb but in my opinion are not. I recently made one of the cheesecake recipes for 9 grams of carbs per serving which was excellent and another recipe for chocolate chip cookies with 3 grams of carbs per cookie, they were pretty tasty! My only complaint about the book is I wish the each recipe told you the calorie content and fat grams per serving as some of the recipes more than make up for the lack of carbs by adding fat. All-in-all well worth buying!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I own at least a dozen low-carb cookbooks, but this is my &quot;bible&quot;.

She explains the role and behavior of ingredients that may be new to you. This book appeals to every cook from beginner to advanced skill level. Tips included in the text help you understand how and what to shop for, what to look for once you find it, and even where to find it! I live in a rural area, and Dana's advice helped me find everything I needed to get started on my new diet.Folks - there are breads and desserts in this book!

This is the best low carb cookbook that I have bought so far."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I haven't tried every last recipe in the book, but have made several. Some of them are delicious and the instructions are clear. However, there is one, \\"Tavern Soup\\", which made me doubt whether all of them were consumer tested. In this recipe, the reader is instructed to whisk grated cheddar cheese into heated broth with pureed vegetables. I followed the instructions as precisely as they were written and ended up with a large gummy cheese mess which could be saved only by removing it with a slotted spoon. If the author was successful in making this soup, she must have left out some essential step(s) or instructions as to which kind of sharp cheddar cheese should be used. I liked the basic flavor of this soup, but if I make it again I have to look to other resources to find out the best way to mix cheese into broth.I have to give the publisher points for answering my email inquiry about this recipe. However, they never answered my big question about the gummy mess, but instead gave information toward a minor statement I had made about the use of xanthan gum, which wasn't a factor since it was to be added as a thickener after adding the cheese. Also, their instructions about using xanthan gum differed considerably with what the author had advised, so I've had to simply experiment on my own to see what works best.Basically, it's a much needed book with a lot of good low carb recipes, but I think it needs some tweaking."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"These recipes make sense.

I have nearly every book Dana has written. I think if you are trying low carb or living low carb you should have her books. She's funny, she's encouraging and besides that, I haven't made a thing in the book that wasn't fabulous (how many cookbooks can you say that about?). If you are going low carb in life, take Dana's cookbooks with you.

It will be used on a weekly basis in my home."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I've had this book for over a year and have been continually amazed by the recipes in it. Even people who swear off low carb food will love your meals... as long as you don't tell them it's healthy. The first recipe I cooked was the Sopa Azteca... if you haven't tried it, buy the book today and cook the soup tomorrow. I think the worst experience I've had so far resulted in a soup that tasted only slightly better than something that comes out of a red & white labelled tin can.Probably the only bad thing I can say about the book is that I've noted a few editing errors, for instance a recipe calls for a sauce that is on another page... but it lists the wrong page number.I would gladly pay a lot more for a sturdier, maybe even color edition of Dana's cookbooks. :)"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"No! I mean &quot;novices at cooking&quot;, not &quot;the cooking of novices&quot;! That wouldn't be nice!I'm not much of a cook. I mean, I can follow directions and work out the basics, but I could stand some serious help, and this book is great for that! It's really not a gourmet cookbook, but it's excellent for the novice through intermediate cook, and has some great ideas that even the experienced would not have thought of. I particularly like the ones that are &quot;variations on a theme&quot; -- you know, I can really use some new ideas about what to do with eggs!The chapter on &quot;Condiments, Seasonings and Sauces&quot; is especially valuable. I know you can maybe find sugar-free ketchup in some stores, but it's not the most common thing to run across. If you have the recipe for it, you can just whip up a big batch and not worry about it. Nice to have some instructions for making Hollandaise, too. (Maybe the Mayonnaise recipe could also go in this chapter?)There are also recipes for things I order at restaurants all the time, but wouldn't have had a clue how to make. Somebody mentioned chef salad. Hey man, maybe YOU know how to make one from memory, but I could use a handy reference! Same deal for a Caesar. I love a steak, a Caesar and a glass of wine.Speaking of which, there are some truly fantastic steak recipes in here!Anyway, the copy I have here is stained and dog-eared, and I happily make space for it on MY shelf!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I highly recommend this book. It contains recipes that I would never have thought possible on a carb-controlled diet. The &quot;heroin wings&quot; (named as such since they are so addictive!) recipe we had last night was to die for (the cheese sauce for broccoli was also great).Don't make the mistake of assuming you have to give up all your favorite foods - or eat meat, meat, and more meat for dinner every night. The key to sticking to a low carb dieting plan for the long haul is to go on a quest to find low-carb substitutions for all your favorite foods. Pick up this book and you'll have a great variety of recipes for pizza, breads, deviled eggs, mock mashed potatoes, and even a Kahlua recipe for good measure.In closing, this book contains a lot of variety (500 recipes) for the low-carb lifestyle."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"The recipes in this book are great.

I have been follow Dana for a long time, via internet at first, then through her book \\"How I Gave up my Low Fat Diet and Lost 40 lbs.\\" Now I collect her cook books. Sometimes a recipe is so simple it's more of a \\"why didn't I think of that\\" and other times it's an elaborate luxury. Either way, the majority of the recipes in her books fit right with my own tastes. Any serious low carb lifer needs her books as the variety and creativity will enrich their dining experiences."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Seriously, these recipes are great. There are so many ideas for those of us who have exhausted our use of the same old proteins. Some recipes use specialty ingredients that low carb cooks are used to, but not to such an extent that the results stink. Anyone that has been doing low carb for awhile knows exactly what I'm talking about. Plus there are tons of recipes with simply fresh, everyday ingredients just used in a different way than one is used to - at least for me.These recipe ideas are diet savers. They give a new spin to the same old ingredients. When you want to give up on this WOE because you're tired of eating the same old chicken, ham, pork, beef, etc - give this book a try instead. It's awesome."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"A friend recommended this book..Its wonderful, I have tried several things everything was as presented.."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I have several of Dana Carpender's Low Carb recipe books and have made many many recipes in them.

I really love a number of the recipes from all of her books and mark any changes in the margins. The only bread product I have made from her books is Zucinni Bread. I have come to realize that I don't miss bread much and by its nature low carb bread subsitutes tastes different and have a different texture than high carb counterparts.

I wish I had been cooking out of it for the past 25 years so that my kids (teenagers) didn't look at me funny when introducing new ways of making their favorite foods, however so far they have enjoyed every bit of it and they cannot believe that you can actually loose weight on this. I try to stay away from the processed low carb food now that I have this book.

Thanks Dana for putting all your time and effort into such an excellent book for anyone and the family!!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I have been using this cookbook for about three weeks. The recipes are both flavorful and easy to make. I would recommend this cookbook to anyone on a low carb diet; many who are not on a low carb diet would enjoy the recipes, as well."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Like many people, I entered the low-carb arena with enthusiasm but several weeks later, I found myself so bored with the monotony of my diet that I nearly quit altogether. It was right around this time that I discovered 500 Low-Carb Recipes, whose back cover promised recipes that would actually make eating enjoyable again. How right it was. The recipes in this book are practical, inventive, and absolutely delicious. A number of recipes are designed to substitute for carb-laden foods that are particularly hard to do without in the first few weeks, such as breads, pancakes, crackers, and even rice. The best feature of this book is the section on marinades and sauces. There are alternative versions of ketchup, teryaki, barbecue, and jerk seasoning, among others, that allow you to pull whatever meat you happen have in the freezer and turn it into a flavorful meal. And for those desperately missing dessert, there are decadent recipes for low-carb cheesecakes and cookies. As a novice cook, I am also particularly grateful for the tips on various cooking techniques scattered throughout the book. I'm now six months into low-carbing, and I have 500 Low-Carb Recipes to thank for making low-carb dieting so amazingly easy and enjoyable."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I have made a few recipes from this book. They are both good and easy. Its a nice change and twist from your normal, meat, eggs and cheese. The author is informative. The book is easy to follow for anyone who is new to cooking or an expert.

Eat up and enjoy!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I've made at least fifty of the recipes in Carpender's book, from main courses to desserts. All of them were very mediocre, and some were downright bad. I don't know if there were typos as far as the amount of ingredients goes, or if Carpender's taste buds have been ruined by eight years of low-carbing. Many concoctions simply needed to be thrown away, and I'm not a novice cook. I'm a very good cook, and perhaps that is the problem: I expect my food to taste good, and I'm willing to spend the time and effort to do it. Many of the recipes consisted of two ingredients, such as a meat and salt. That's not a recipe, that's a serving suggestion. If you want low-carb with flavor, I suggest one of George Stella's books, or even Donna Pliner Rodnitzky's books. These people are obviously good cooks and have many wonderful recipes to share."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Of all the low carb cookbooks I own, those by Dana Carpender really strike a chord with me. I like her books for several reasons.In the beginning, she covers items essential to a low carb pantry and her product knowledge is vast. For example, she explains the difference among soy powder, soy flour and soy milk as well as discussing different polyols and their pros and cons, and includes resources for online purchase of low carb products.Her books do not just contain one or 2 recipes that one might use, but many that are worth a try. When I am looking for a low carb recipe, I go first to Dana. I have done breads, muffins, quiches, catsup, eggplant parmesan, mockalhua and stuffed mushrooms, to name a few.Finally, she writes in a breezy style that I find appealing, and offers suggestions for options and substitutions in the recipes. Reading her books has given me many ideas as to how to create the foods I want to eat while keeping the carbs under control. As I am not great fan of eggs, seemingly the mainstay of low carb breakfasting, her breakfast and baked goods recipes are most useful to me.I currently own 3 of her books and although I already own too many cookbooks, I'm being tempted to buy her slow cooker book. I would unreservedly recommend her books to anyone who wants to move those high carb foods out of his/her kitchen, replace them with low carb substitutes and use those substitutes to create tasty, low carb dishes."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Low carb might be fading, but the Glycemic Index diet is just starting to gain speed and these recipes fit well in that plan.These books, along with my favorite, \\"Carb-less In Seattle\\" not only taste great but are low GI recipes and have helped me/and other family members lose a significant amount of weight. The bread tastes like real bread, not the like the weird stuff most people were marketing as low-carb bread."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Dana makes low carb easy. The recipes are wonderful. What I like best is that it is normal, real food you will want to eat on a regular basis. Even when I haven't been to the store, I can usually find a recipe in one of her books that I can make. I have all of her books and I love them. If you are doing low carb, you need her books. You'll never have to sit and think about what on earth you can possible eat."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Just when I think I can't think of anything else to make for dinner that will fit into my low carb lifestyle, I purchased this book. It was the best investment I could make in my low carb lifestyle. The recipes are pretty easy and there are tons of great ideas. She also has many diversified recipes, I already made the Indian Cabbage and the Spinach Paneer, the chocolate cheesecake and a few others. I must say the dishes were not gourmet but they taste pretty good for low carb cooking. I will continue to reach for the book when I am out of ideas and tailor the recipes to my tastes, the cookbook is worth the money and I think you will like it too."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Like the reviewer below, I've never been drawn to a cookbook without photos. However, low-carb cookbooks just aren't there yet. Even though I loved the author's &quot;How I Gave up my Low-Fat Diet &amp; Lost 40 Pounds&quot;, I decided to check this book out of the library to see how well I'd like it. Well, I was sold, and am buying the book. Wonderful recipes abound, and the first 40 pages contain useful info on ingredients and low-carb products, and there are also tips at the beginning of each section. If you are committed to low-carb, this book is a good investment."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"First let me say that I own many, many low-carb cookbooks, and this one is THE best I have ever read! Not only does it offer 500, yes, 500 recipes that are easy, fabulous and low carb, but the introduction and ingredient chapters were SPECTACULAR! The introduction was warm, witty and informative. I typically skim through the beginning chapters and get right to the recipes, but I couldn't put this one down! So many questions that I had were answered in the Low Carb Specialty Foods chapter, not to mention the Polyols chapter and the Where to Find Low-Carb Specialty Products chapter (she doesn't like paying through the nose for this stuff, either)!The Ingredients You Need to Know About section was the absolute best--necessary and unique information about eggs, fats/oils, flour substitutes (what the heck are guar and xanthan gums, anyway--she answers that, too!), sweeteners (wow, I can have molasses!), vegetables (and I can have carrots, too!), and oh so much more. Her first recipe is addictive enough to eat every day (Heroin Wings)! I wish I could say that I've made all the recipes, but I'm so busy trying out the recipes from the first chapter, I haven't even looked at the other chapters yet, but believe me, I know they'll be outstanding.This author is down-to-earth, funny and charming. I can relate to her so well. She stresses over and over again to listen to your body and let that be your guide regardless of whether the food is low-carb. This works so well for me. The BEST book you will ever purchase on low-carbing and low-carb recipes. DON'T MISS THIS ONE!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"The hardest thing about going low-carb for me was staying excited about eating from the recipes in my plan's book. Then I ordered Dana's book. First, Dana is not a diet doctor, she's real human like the rest of us, and her book is written in a very refreshing, down-to-earth tone. Second, Dana's book has taken the monotony OUT of my low-carb life. Let's talk fabulous stir-fry served over cauliflower \\"rice\\" ... absolutely amazing waffles ... terrific spicy Thai cucumber salad that was eaten up to the very last bite at my office picnic today ... and of course, desserts. The hardest problem I have with this book is not giving away the recipes to my friends and low-carb associates who try the dishes because, quite frankly, like any author Dana is trying to make a living too so I tell them they just have to buy the book so she'll be encouraged to write another one. I promise you that you will not be disappointed with this book!!! And yes, Dana has pretty much attained goddess status in my life ;-)"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I have a bunch of low-carb cookbooks and will continue to buy more! But, this book is by far the best that I have tried so far. The recipes aren't just tired repeats of ones found in other books or ones you can find on-line. The hot cereal is a life saver in the morning as you make up the mix in bulk and then just add hot water to a serving of the dry mix. I was so tired of eggs and this is great. Also, the recipes aren't swimming in fat like so many low-carb recipes."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"The book didn't deliver as much as it, at first, appeared to. 470 pages of recipes and no photography sounds like a lot of recipes. Many of the recipes are so basic you wonder who wouldn't know that boiled shrimp means boiling shrimp in a pan of water with some seasoning. But &quot;Unbelievably Easy Shrimp&quot; gets half a page for this 3-ingredient recipe (2 qts. water, a pound shrimp, salt). The balance of the page is a recipe for cooking fish: 1 piece of fish, 1 tbs. butter, with parsley and lemon wedge for garnish.How to broil a steak (olive oil, steak) gets a page, then variations of steak go on for pages and pages. &quot;Southwestern Steak&quot; is steak served with guacamole. &quot;Cajun Steak&quot; is steak sprinkled with Cajun seasoning. &quot;Garlic Butter Steak&quot; is steak with garlic butter spread on it. There are about 2 of these recipes per page.It's the same with the egg and omlet recipes. The same basic recipe idea is repeated over and over with a flavor variation.The most major flaw with the book, however, is the index. My pet peeve with cookbooks is to use cute recipe titles and then index them alphadetically according to those titles. Under &quot;sauces,&quot; to pick an example, there is &quot;Dana's No-sugar Ketchup&quot; listed in the &quot;D&quot;s. Why not list it &quot;Ketchup, no-sugar&quot; so you can find it if you go looking for &quot;ketchup?&quot; Also under &quot;sauces&quot; there is &quot;Low-carb Steak sauce&quot; in the &quot;L&quot;s and &quot;Reduced-carb Spicy Barbecue Sause&quot; in the &quot;R&quot;s. It makes it very hard to find a recipe. The back cover of the book touts &quot;Chocolate Mousse to DIE For&quot; and I have yet to be able to find that recipe. It's not in the index under &quot;chocolate,&quot; under &quot;mousse,&quot; or under &quot;desserts.&quot;Less annoying but still detracting was the font that was used. It made the recipes somewhat difficult to read.Even with these flaws, it is still a low-carbohydrate cookbook worth having, especially if you don't have one yet and are new to low-carb cooking. I liked the author's personality as it came through in her introduction and ingredients sections. She comes across as an ordinary, regular person. She is not dogmatic or preachy or pushy or &quot;know-it-all.&quot;"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I own quite a few low carb cookbooks and I rank this as my favorite in terms of taste, ease of use and value. Boy, for the amount I paid for this through Amazon, I got a whopping 500 recipes!!! I have tried a few recipes and have been very pleased with this cookbook. I love the all-meat chili (I use it as the meat for my taco salad with sour cream, cheese and lettuce), chicken florentine (was this easy and delicious), and my young son loves the heroin wings. The marinades for chicken are also scrumptious. I look forward to trying more of her recipes. Because of her suggestions, I finally tried spaghetti squash and love it!!! The tips in the book are also very helpful (now I can really make great omelets!). I have yet to try the desserts and breads which do use some specialized ingredients but these are very easy to find in your local health food store or any reputable internet low carb supplier (there are a lot out there) and their prices are reasonable. I just have not had the chance to buy the ingredients but I am raring to dig into one of her chocolate chip cookies! Thank you, Dana, for sharing with us your culinary skills and making low carb an enjoyable and delectable eating lifestyle."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Struggling to figure out how to keep to your low-carb diet but still enjoy food (plus feed your family)?This book is the one you need.Recipes like Pumpkin Cheesecake (great for breakfast with some bacon on the side, by the way), Vegetable Lasagna (tip: add some strips of zucchini cut longwise with a veggie peeler for faux lasagna noodles), and frittatas keep us feeling happy, full, and not deprived. My family has enjoyed many of these recipes (had to arm-wrestle my 16-year-old nephew for the cheesecake - I finally taught him to make it himself).Some of the recipes - particularly baked goods - may require some nonstandard ingredients. Most of these are available in health food stores, natural food stores, or, if all else fails, online.Dana has a breezy, enjoyable writing style that makes you feel like you're in the kitchen with your best friend, and none of the recipes are beyond the average cook.If you can only get one low-carb cookbook, this is the one to buy!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"This book has been the key to my success with low carbing! When I first started LC, I was gung ho for the basics... I couldn't get enough scrambled eggs, steak, and cheeseburgers without the bun. I was in heaven! Soon, however, heaven turned into purgatory as I started dreaming about fruit and thinking about stealing candy from my own kids! Then Dana came to the rescue with this incredible book!Chocolate or sweets craving? She's got it covered and then some. Need something salty and crunchy? Check! Need an entree that will please your non low-carbing husband and kids but still keep you on target? You betcha. She's covered everything from soup to nuts, LITERALLY! If you're bored on any of the LC diets, then you need to get Dana's book RIGHT NOW. Then, if you're still bored, well... you just aren't paying attention!DON'T miss the Heroin wings. If you *aren't* low-carbing, you'll wish you were after trying these tasty treats.In short, get this book now and kiss the bunless hamburgers and strips of bacon goodbye and say hello to a whole new WORLD of food options!(Also, I need to express my annoyance with the very few people who have given this book a negative review simply for the fact that it revolves around a low carb way of eating. The title should be an excellent clue that the book is *about low carbing*. If you don't like or don't agree with low carbing, you should not write a review of a low carb cookbook. It's unfair to Ms. Carpender by providing people with your opinion about the diet, which they don't care about, rather than a fair review of her *book*, which is the purpose of these reviews. In my opinion, reviews that attack a diet without addressing Dana's book should be removed from Amazon's reviews.)"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"This book was recommended by a friend, and he was RIGHT. I'm not the best cook, and I usually gravitate to cook books that have lots of color pictures. This book has NO pictures - but what it DOES have are lots of very easy, very tasty, very low carb recipes. I'm astounding all of my family and friends with dishes they prefer to higher carb versions. Did I mention I've lost 16 pounds and am NEVER hungry?

I am not a great cook, so when I decided to do low-carb eating, it was challenging for me to find things to eat. I quickly became tired of bunless burgers, and the like!500 Low-Carb Recipes solved this problem for me. It has delicious recipes in a variety of categories, and most of these are very easy to prepare. My husband has actually said that since I got this book, I've been cooking some really good meals!The beginning portion of the book is very helpful, with a very thorough section on ingredients, as well as other useful information such as how to determine the usable carb count, low-carb specialty foods available and more. And the recipes! Suffice it to say that there really are recipes for chocolate chip cookies, cheesecakes, breads, etc., that not only taste good, but are healthy!I am still losing weight and, even more importantly, feeling much better--all while enjoying scrumptious food prepared with this book's recipes."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I NEVER write reviews, but I had to with this book!

Her Cajun Skillet Shrimp, Heroin Wings and Kay's Crab Stuffed Mushrooms have become stardards in my home.There is real treasure to be found in the desserts, too. You might not find your ingredients in the baking aisle, but if you know where to look, your supermarket has them. The results are very much worth it.

Wow! I have been cooking with this book for about 6 weeks and there is not one recipe in it that has not turned out just great. I've tried things I knew I would love (oatmeal cookies, meatza, sausage and egg casserole) and things that I knew I would hate, but ended up loving (cauliflower rice!). In addition to the recipes, Dana offers tips on stocking a low carb pantry, where to find low carb items, and her opinions on what ones taste best and what to just avoid.

It is a practical recipe book that is not filled with lots of gourmet recipes. It has things people eat on a regular basis. People who are used to eating at fast food places or whipping up Hamburger Helper for dinner.My favorites are the Protein Pancakes and the Oatmeal Cookies! They both taste so close to the real thing you would swear they had all their carbs. This cookbook has so many easy-to-make recipes that it makes it easy to maintain a low carb lifestyle. I was even able to find almost all the ingredients in my local grocery store and the rest can be found at Health Food stores. I was very impressed!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Let me start out by saying that I am a college student, studying to be a Nutritional Consultant, so naturally I follow a Low Carb diet because...well...it's quite simply the most healthful diet since the cave dwelling days (and we wouldn't have lasted this long if eating fat was killing us)! For the kitchen illiterate and time pressed low carb scholar like myself, or anyone who loves awesome food, Dana Carpender's book is a Godsend. Nevermind the fact that her recipes are easy, all natural, and ingenius: they are the best damn tasting concoctions I have ever had, so good I can't believe they came from my kitchen! The final test; My Soul food carbohydrate addict husband (who wouldn't touch a low carb diet with a 10 foot pole) has to loosen his belt every time I crack open the cookbook because he knows it's gauranteed to be stuff-your-face obsurdly delicious. Thanks Dana!! I'd either be withered away or overweight without you!!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"A good basic book for everyday eating.Where Carpender shines is the main course meat dishes. The Turkey Curry meat loaf is terrific.All of the bread recipes call for a breadmaker, though, and desserts are not really her thing.Avoid the Chocolate Mousse to Die For (which my husband renamed To Die From) unless you are someone who can eat raw tofu and pure cream without aggravated intestinal assaults.A better book for desserts is the book the Eades cowrote called The Low-Carb Comfort Food cookbook.

Every recipe I've tried has been great and even better than that, my boyfriend (who isn't on a low-carb diet and is a picky eater) is enjoying the recipes as well!The recipes are practical. Some of the baked goods involve ingredients that can be tricky to find...but for the most part, one can make any of these dishes with foods they have around the house. I cannot praise this book enough. It is by far the best and most useful low-carb I've found."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I now have four low-carb cookbooks, but this is the one I use every day. You don't have to be an expert chef to make the recipes in this book, and except for the bread and dessert section, you don't need a whole lot of special ingredients either. (Look folks, making low-carb bread is necessarily complicated--it's not as simple as subbing Splenda for sugar, given the chemistry involved). I especially like her vegetable and salad recipes (I'm always looking for ways to make myself eat more vegetables, since I ate practically none before low-carbing it), and I wouldn't have made it this far without Dana's cracker recipes, using sunflower seeds as the main ingredient. Other favorites are the smoky cauliflower and sausage, polynesian pork, moo shu pork, and the infamous heroin wings. After nearly 4 months of low carbing, I forget to check the other cookbooks for new ideas, but I'm probably close to 100 recipes down from Dana's book already. I wish it came in a spiral binder, so it was a little easier to use, but that would make it more costly, and everyone should have this book!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Forget the Dr Atkins cookbooks - if you are looking for low-carb versions of simple, wholesome homecooking, then this is exactly the book for you. The recipes work, and they are well thought-out and explained. The section at the beginning explaining exactly what each low-carb ingredient really is is worth the purchase price alone. The baking section contains the best low-carb breads I have ever tried. An excellent aid to weight loss and healthier living."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Finally, a truly simple recipe book with easy to follow directions. Not to mention that the ingredients are few and mostly what you have in your refrigerator (really)! Since cooking with this book, my husband has lost 20 pounds and I have lost over 10 pounds! It is so easy to follow and the authors are humorous to boot! Cooking has never been more fun. Our kids even love my meals, and they are 4 and 2! I do not have them on a lo carb diet, but when they will eat salmon, I must be doing something right. We also LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the Fauxpototoes (cauliflower), I can't say that enough.

I like it so much that I bought a second copy for my mom, who is also low-carbing, because I wasn't willing to loan my copy out! Before I started on a low-carb way of life, I never cooked. Heating up a frozen pizza was about the extent of my cooking skills. With Dana's book, I get rave reviews from my husband (who is NOT low-carbing) on everything I make. My mom and I have so much fun cooking for family dinners - we made an entirely low-carb holiday meal last week using recipes from this book and everyone loved it! My personal favorite was the cauliflower kugel - I just finished the leftovers this morning, and now I have to make more because I CRAVE it!

I realize you can apply it to any written procedure for cooking, but I'm thinking more of the popular version of the word, and it strikes me that a recipe containing two ingredients (a steak and some butter) and one step (fry the steak) doesn't quite reach the mark. I mean, doesn't everyone know they can toss a steak in a pan with some butter and fry it? And don't you think that those who don't probably won't be in the market for a cookbook? Filler, in other words, and not the kind you roll into a freshly-pounded pork loin. Still, there's enough substance here to make it worth checking out of the library and seeing if you want to add it to the permanent collection. ***"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"This book is great! It has really good recipes that are fairly easy, it also has desserts, salad dressings, salads and really good marinades that are all low carb and healthy!

Makes it easy to stick to the Low Carb lifestlye"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I tried low-carb dieting about 10 years ago, and although it worked, I simply couldn't live on bacon and eggs and the like, as a regular diet. The research on low-carb has come a long way. Vitamin and mineral supplements, inclusion of vegetables during induction, and a thousand pieces of information were not obvious or known, in the revolutionary discovery of carbohydrates making you fat, and not fat making you fat.One of the most important things that kept me away from trying low-carb again, was that I love to eat. I love to cook. I love the creative aspect of dining. Well, for people who feel like I do, do not hesitate to try one more time. We now know so much more about the low-carb lifestyle. We know what is lacking, and we know what to expect. As well, there are many new products out in the market that give us safe, effective and tasty alternative that simply didn't exist 10 years ago.This book will introduce you to these alternative, as well as offer any professional or amateur chef the fun of creative new foods that not only appease what you no longer can have, but often surpass them so much that you wonder why you settled for such 'ordinary' food before.I love the recipes in this book, not only because they appeal to the creative side of dining, but because after a while you catch on to the tricks of converting regular recipes into low-carb, so that there is virtually nothing that you cannot have.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Great book with lots of good ideas and recipes. Only problem is that you will have to shop at a health food store for some of the ingredients, but its worth it if you are doing the low carb thing.

So far, so good!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I am back in the kitchen! I LOVED to cook at one time, then I became a \\"low-carber\\". For over 3 years now it has been an effort to produce meals my family would eat and I could eat. I dreaded the every afternoon because I had to rack my brain for appetizing menus that satisfied everyone. The books I had were okay but not great. Along came Dana. I saw her on the Today show; then tried a few of her recipes from the show and web site. WOW! I immediately bought this book. Cooking is fun again. There has not been one recipe tried that my family has not liked. They are fun to cook, extremely flavorful and even my 9-year-old likes them.4 stars, I wish I could give this book 5 stars. The folks-y format makes the book just fun to read but the unconventional cooking style could be a little confusing for non-cooks. An example one recipe calls for 8 chicken breasts; not really it is 4 chicken breasts split (into halves).I will say one thing, I will not share the recipes, BUY YOUR OWN BOOK!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I have 5 low-carb cookbooks and this one is the best! The ingredients are readily available and every recipe I've tried has been delicious. I thought I'd be giving up honey mustard salad dressing forever when I started my low-carb lifestyle, but Dana gives a recipe in this book that is better than any bottled honey mustard and it has no honey in it!! Burger Scramble Florentine is something my family has asked for more of and would probably eat it daily if I'd fix it. And it just doesn't get any better than Those Chicken Things.

I received this book for Christmas and immediately started cooking. I loved the food as well as the fact the recipes are easy to follow and have a range of cook times from: takes a while - done in no time at all. She has a fun way of titling her dishes and I enjoy the stories on where she came up with them. While the titles are strange the food is not. I am not pretentious and either was this food. It was classics made low carb. My family also loves the meals I cook even though none of them are low carb eaters. I have made the bake goods and brought them to work and people love them, they can't even tell they are low carb until I tell them. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys to cook.

If you, like me, have gotten low carb cookbooks with weird recipes of things you would never eat, then have no fear, Dana is here!

I can't say enough about this book - just buy it!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Not as good as I had hoped. I purchase this back when first began The South Beach Diet (During the low-carb phase), however when I recieved it I was dissappointed. It's a large book, with lots of recipies, and not single picture (that I can recall) of any of it's recipies. As a beginner to cooking healthier meals, it's more enticing for me to see some scrumptuous pictures of the some of the meals I'm going to be trying out as I head down the road of a healthier lifestyle.

Some of the things I've made are just plain terrible. Lemon Poppyseed Muffins used almost an entire bottle of lemon extract and a half bottle of poppyseeds...they were so bad I had to throw them out. I also just made the peanut butter protein bars and they are inedible. It's such a waste of pricey ingredients (like the protein powder, nuts, and Splenda). I like the Pecan Sandies but the recipe is flawed. Calls for so much butter that the butter oozed out of the cookies and all over the bottom of my oven. (Burning butter smells terrible!) The recipe also says to spray the pans with cooking spray. There was so much butter and grease that they slid off the cookie sheets and onto the kitchen counter. The recipe works better with half the butter but I still had to wipe the pan down between batches.Maybe the dinner recipes are better. But from experience the baked goods are lousy.I also bought The Good Carb Cookbook by Sandra Woodruff and those recipes have works wonderfully."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I'm new to the whole low carb thing but I enjoy the food immensely and feel great due to the changes I've made. But this book doesn't make it easy to locate the carb count for recipes, there are no photos of recipes, some ingredients are hard to find and questionable selections.The author writes about new low carb products early in the book. One such item is breakfast cereal. The author goes on to say they've never tried it but within the book is included at least one recipe that calls for the cereal. Apparently the author didn't bother to eat all foods or recipes in their own book.The author questions the safety of using soy flour but doesn't offer any info regarding the hesitation. Some articles on the internet claim soy is dangerous, info is provided only after you register for a, b and c. And another states that soy makes you gay. The info is absurd, bizarre and unsubstantiated by any credible organization. The fact that Soy's been used since before the written language, I'll stick with it until I get warnings from legitimate credible organizations.But the author does suggest using soy powder instead found at various health food stores. Soy powder (many supposed health powders) are not regulated by the FDA and certain brands have been recalled and or warned by the FDA for including other ingredient that have been scientifically identified as dangerous.The mentioned inconsistencies and others are why I won't be purchasing any more of this author's books. I'd prefer to use as much fresh local foods as possible and not run out to purchase ingredients because they are the latest buzz word on the internet. I was expecting a cook book not someone's unconfirmed interpretation of health foods.I'll stick with \\"Stella\\" books (cookies, cakes, faux pasta, faux potato salad, great protein enriched recipes, etc and delicious)....."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I enthusastically bought this book after reading the other reviews and I was very disappointed. Unlike most cookbooks, there isn't a single picture in this one, and it is printed on cheap paper. Many of the recipes call for expensive, speciality store ingredients.

However, there are some very annoying errors. I was just making the Sunshine Cheesecake only to find there is no oven temperature included and you can't really use other recipes as they vary in temp from 300 to 375 and none have the same mix of ingredients. I've also found that some of the other baked goods don't come out as delicious as promised. Warning, texture is definitely much different and may be off putting to some. I am an experienced cook so I don't feel as if I could have screwed up all the recipes. Of course that is possible once or twice, but not after several times. I have found a few other errors throughout the book. Most have been pretty easy to figure out as I have been cooking a long time, but for those less experienced in the kitchen they might have some head scratching. I also find Ms. Carpender's writing style a bit condescending. The definitions of some of the standard carb substitutes was a great help to me when I started on the low carb diet and helped me stock up on the correct supplies.

I'm thrilled with most every recipe I've tried and I use it most everday.Some of the best things about this book:~Recipes usually have few ingredients, with an average amount being 5-7 (it seems).~Those ingredients are things that are relatively easy to find or buy.~The book would cover all levels of low carb, from the beginner to the skilled low carber.As with everything, there are a few cons to the book, in my opinion.~She gives all accurate carb count and protein info, but doesn't include calories. There's a reason for this, I've come to believe. Her dishes are so very good which usually causes the calories to be a bit on the high side (for my own plan).~There aren't any pictures. This is a let down for me, but with the simplicity of the recipes, you can also picture the end result in your mind too.~Very few slow cooker recipes, which is something that I personally think all cookbooks need several of.If you buy any book for your collection, this would be the one I'd say don't miss. I don't think it's possible to be disappointed."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Don't even bother buying another low carb cookbook.

Those folks don't need this book. This book is geared toward people who have basic cooking ability, knowledge, and skill, and it is done beautifully - without being patronizing or dull. Ms. Carpender has a very accessible book, that can be enjoyed by MANY people, whether or not they are following a low-carb eating plan. I find her writing style extremely enjoyable, and her recipes are to die for. Millions of readers can't be wrong. I own a vast array of cookbooks, and this is one of the few that I have used regularly since I purchased it. My mom lost 70+ pounds on a low-carb plan, and I'm currently blending the teachings of low-carb with the methodology of Weight Watchers. During my first week, I lost nearly 6 lbs., and boy did that annoy the other &quot;newbies&quot;!!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"This book is a life-saver. Dana Carpender tells it like it is. If you're gonna do the low-carb lifestyle, unless you are extremely well-off and can afford lots of specialty foods like low-carb bread, you need to cook! And this book helps you do it. There are lots of great ideas in here, folks! This book is very informative and a great companion to her book &amp;quot;How I Gave Up My Low-Fat Diet and Lost 40 Lbs.&amp;quot; She starts out her cookbook with important information about ingredients and low-carbing in general. Of course she gives you the effective carb count in each serving, too. The only caveat, and the only reason I did not give it the full 5 stars, is that quite a few recipes seem to call for hard-to-find ingredients. That aside, I love this cookbook!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Dana Carpender, my husband and I love you!

It's a mish-mosh of recipes quickly thrown together to cash in on the popularity of lo-carb diets. The author is interested in making a few bucks, not in presenting you with good recipes.Some of the recipes are so basic and low-brow that they reminded me of my first days of cooking as a college student. Others were complete disasters. One of the reasons I bought the book was that it has several recipes for lo-carb breads. I went out and bought all the expensive, hard-to find ingredients and made them carefully according to the recipes.

There are many recipes that are cooking techniques, not a true recipe. For example, there are 25 recipes for omlettes/scrambles that can be summed up in one sentence: Try adding leftovers or classic combinations to an omlette or eggs (ie fajitas, mushroom scramble).For a well-written, professional cookbook with many great techniques and unique recipes, try The Low-Carb Cookbook by Fran McCullough."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I actually discovered this at a used bookstore (only $10), but it is the best cookbook I have ever found.Recently I discovered that I had severe insulin resistance and was limited to 30g carbohydrates per meal. This is painfully small, thus limiting my meal choices to a meat and a vegetable...or so I thought. Out of desperation and insatiable cravings for cookies and other foods, I found this at a bookstore.The recipes are extremely easy to understand and prepare. Through the Low-Carb Clam Chowder, I discovered that turnips actually are really good and have a similar texture to potatoes in soups. It is also really handy having tips on how to prepare the food (like how to keep turnips tasty and not bitter), what some of the specialty ingredients are (some of them I had never even hear of before), and an easy to read, concise description of the nutritional facts.This book is great for people who live on their own or busy families who need easy, simple recipes that are extremely delicious and uncomplicated.I recommend this for anyone who has diabetes, insulin resistance or just needs to cut back on carbs.

Both books are very comprehensive, although the latter does so in a shorter amount of time! Carpender literally covers everything in this book: fruit, vegetables, nuts, rice, soup, dessert! The best part is that Dana shows ways to vary regular dishes - stuff that you've made millions of times, but didn't realize how you could do so without all the carbs! I have tried literally dozens of other books with low-carb recipes, and none of them worked... because I couldn't stick with them - the recipes are so bland! Until I read Carpender's book.

To me, that is a great thing about it. I will occaissionally make something more involved, but most of the time I want easy. My problem is that sometimes I just can't think of things to make, so I get stuck doing the same things over and over. I will use this book for ideas for different foods and combinations of foods. Basically it is an idea generator, a memory jogger that I can look through to get me going. Often, with a book such as this, looking through it gets my creative juices going and I think of my own ideas from it. I am a good cook, and I don't mind changing or tweaking seasonings if I don't exactly like what is in the book. In fact, I rarely do exactly what any cook book says anyway. My husband says my tweaks always make the recipe better.This book is going to help me have more variety in my low carb lifestyle."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"This book has really good recipes and it tells you how many carbs per serving, however it does not tell you how many calories.

It is the best low carb cookbook out there and a more than solid cookbook in general. Sure I might add a little here and there and change it up a bit. However, these recipes are perfect on their own, and also an absolute perfect base for those of us that like to mix it up a bit and experiment. I throw carb caution to the wind on weekends when cooking for a dinner party but have now cooked low carb for dinner guests during the week when I am dieting. My weekday dinner guests cannot believe it is low carb and love it.

I have had great success with it and her diet/cook books have lots of great recipes (Actually, I have all four, and recommend them all). However, I have made very few of her recipes, as they seem like some effort to prepare. This is where Dana Carpender's &quot;500 Low-Carb Recipes&quot; comes in. Although not all of her recipes are &quot;Legal Level One&quot;, I would say 60-80 per cent of them are. And many of the recipes are simple, so simple that you can stay on Level One with a different menu every day of the week. I highly recommend it to Somersizers."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Following a low carb diet often results in eating the same foods over and over again.

I didn't need a recipe for mayonaise or instructions on how to cook shrimp. Instructions on how to make a chef salad?!?!? A whole chapter on different things you can put in an omelet?

Even though I own several low carb cookbooks, I can tell this one will be a favorite. I knew there would be 500 recipes, but didn't expect such a large cookbook. The variety is great! Although I am not a big bread eater, after three years of low-carbing I have missed an occasional piece of toast. Lots of low-carb loaves have been tossed to the dog, who didn't care much for them, either. The loaf of oatmeal molasses bread that I made from this book is a winner!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Glad I bought this recipe book before Thanksgiving. I made the pumpkin cheesecake and EVERYONE loved it. I must have spent a couple of hours putting little &quot;stickies&quot; on all the pages for the recipes I plan to make. I was an avid low fat/ high carb chef, so finding a book with all these great recipes will help insure that I continue finding success with my low carb food program.I also recommend buying Dana Carpender's book about her journey in losing 40 lbs and keeping it off. It's a great inspiration for helping me persist in my quest to get healthy and lose weight."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Three cheers for Dana Carpender! This book is loaded with USEFUL low-carb recipes that even cooking dunces such as myself can prepare with reasonable success. Every recipe is easy, made with just a few ingredients, and involves only a few steps to make. This is the key formula to low-carb success, as far as I'm concerned.I have tons of post-it stickies hanging out of this book, marking my favorite recipes. Some of the ones I like the most are &quot;Smoky Cauliflower and Sausage,&quot; &quot;Spicy Peanut Chicken,&quot; &quot;Instant Shrimp Stir-Fry,&quot; and &quot;Pork Chops and Sauerkraut.&quot; Whatever your tastes, there is something in here for you. Again and again, this is the recipe book I reach for.In addition to the wonderful recipes, Dana offers some great information about low-carb products on the market, and suggests which items to keep on hand in your pantry.I also recommend Dana's book &quot;15-Minute Low-Carb Recipes,&quot; which is almost as wonderful as this book!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I have NEVER had such a wonderful low-carb cookbook.

My husband really likes them too. I started writing notes in the index by the recipies that I thought were good, but since I haven't run into one that was bad, I quit writing the notes.A must have for your kitchen!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I have been low-carbing for almost two years now and have lost over 70 lbs. It has changed my life. But it was getting very OLD. I was having a lot of difficulty meshing my extremely limited grocery budget and my need to feed a family of five with my need to low carb and my desire for my family to also. Basically for the past two years I have been preparing an inexpensive meal for my family (you know, lots of rice, potatoes and pasta) while preparing something quick and easy for me (you know, hamburger patty, chicken and chef salad).I knew I was going to have to do SOMETHING about this in order to truly make low-carbing a way of life for me. I happened upon Dana's book and flipped through it expecting a bunch of high-cost, hard-to-make recipes like all the other recipe books I've looked at (low carb or not). I was pleasantly surprised to find that there were many inexpensive recipes in this book! Recipes that sounded really good. And on top of that there were many desert recipes. So I bought the book and brought it home with high hopes.What I have discovered in the three weeks since purchasing the book is that there are over 30 - yes, I said THIRTY - low cost main dishes in this book....and so far there is not one I haven't liked. When I say low cost I mean LOW COST. Our grocery budget allows me to only purchase the cheap 5 lb. packages of hamburger meat and the cheap 10 lb. bags of chicken legs and thighs. Being limited to just those two kinds of meat can get pretty boring even if you're not low-carbing. But for the past three weeks we have used our cheap meat - along with Dana's book - to create some fabulous, enjoyable meals with VARIETY!!!The best part is that the rest of my family has absolutely loved the recipes too!!!! So I'm getting my low-carb meals, my family is too, the recipes are easy to make, and they fit within my meager grocery budget. Can't ask for much more than that from a cookbook. A side benefit is that we've been trying - and enjoying - so many vegetables that I have never considered before because I just didn't know what to do with them.As other reviewers have said, there are plenty of recipes in here for more costly fare - steak, shrimp, lobster, pork, lamb, etc., but if you've been wondering how in the world you can afford to stay on a low carb diet and not be bored to tears with your food, you really need this book. It has revitalized my commitment to this way of living. Now I know that I really can do this for the long term - and enjoy every bite!I came here to write a review for this book because I couldn't find a website or email address for Dana Carpender to thank her. I do fully intend to write to her."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"have been doing locarb for a couple months and was getting REALLY bored with the meat,eggs,etc. Read the reviews for this book and ordered it immediately.

The bread recipes require a trip to the health food store and the purchase of a bread machine but I think in the long run it will pay off. A MUST HAVE book for anyone doing locarb!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"This is straight forward what it's title suggests-- lots of recipes, 500 of them, for low-carb eaters. It doesnt' give much of the background to low-carb eating, there are other books for that. What it does provide is a nice beginning chapter on ingredients and shopping tips for label reading, brands to look for, etc.Then, recipes. Lots of them in all categories, appetizers to desserts. This is where the book is a benefit. There are simply put an outstanding array of good, simple to fix, delight to eat recipes for family or couples or singles. From a neat &quot;English Muffin&quot; recipe to make from scratch that is outstanding to a great pizza crust, this book has it. She has compiled this collection from many sources, including her own reserach as well as from other's research and cookbooks.Try the likes of: Stewed Chicken With Moroccan Seasonings; Mexicali Meat Loaf; Mu Shu Pork with low carb tortillas; Asian Chicken Salad; Kathy's Peanut Butter Butter Protein Bars; Maria's Flan.Good resource for low-carb cook who wants to plan and prepare some new thing for a menu.

I picked up this book because one can only grill so many steaks and salmon fillets before one gets bored - I can only imagine what it'd be like if those were my only options every night!This book has been valuable for me. It's allowed some variety in what I cook for my friends and so far everything I've tried has turned out well. While I don't agree that mashed cauliflower is a perfect substitute for mashed potatoes, the recipe variations show that this is a pretty decent dish in its own right."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Well, thanks to Dana I now know that I hate blue cheese and don't particularly like guacamole. One of the cracker recipes - ICK! But the reason I know that is because I actually dared try the recipes in her book.She has an excellent writing style that makes you want to try out her recipes. I've eaten foods that I never even considered purchasing in the past. Dana has definitely opened my eyes and taken me beyond meat and potatoes suppers and turkey sandwich lunches!I've had a few total bombs from this cookbook - I've also had some huge hits. It is all about personal taste. I had tried low-carbing in the past and made it exactly 1 1/2 weeks until I couldn't take one more lettuce-wrapped chicken salad lunch. Dana has given me options and step by step instructions on how to cook low carb. She has taken me past the boring recipes I had tried in the past and opened up a whole new way of cooking.I wish she would have included calorie counts in this book but I'm still giving it 5 stars simply because it is a book I refer to every single day when planning out my meals.Seriously, this cookbook is excellent. Even though I didn't like some of the recipes, that is because of my own personal tastes. Buy this if you are are serious about low-carbing. Dana's variations will teach you how to low-carb to your own tastes."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"You wouldn't think breakfast would be a problem on the Atkins or any low-carb diet, but after weeks of eggs for brekkie, it gets a bit old. And if you are eating with non-low-carb family members who are chowing down stacks of fluffy pancakes, crunching toast, well, it gets a bit annoying. This book solves the issue of boredom with eggs, meat and fish. You get substitutes for ketchup, protein pancakes (thank heavens), a decent cinnamon raisin bread, peanut butter cookies, strawberry desserts and some entrees to spice up the fact you probably fell into the &quot;grilled meat and salad&quot; rut that I did. If you are on Atkins or other low-carb diets, this will keep you from getting annoyed at the very smell of someone else's toast in the morning."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I own this and cannot tell you how helpful it's been!!I think the best thing about this cookbook is that the recipes don't depend on soy.

I've just begun my low-carb lifestyle and I recommend this book if you are looking for lots of easy to make low-carb foods."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Dana Carpender is a freaking genius!!!!!!!! I made pancakes yesterday with ricotta cheese, eggs and vanilla whey protein powder (the kind you make shakes out of) They were WONDERFUL, and my husband pigged out on them. Dana Carpender has thought of EVERYTHING; the ingredients are easy to find and her recipes are simple and easy to make but they taste delicious!!! I KNOW I can now stay low-carb for the rest of my life as long has I have Dana's help in the kitchen. She has thought of everything, from bread, cakes, cookies, wonderful & creative veges from soup to nuts!!! This is the very best low carb cookbook on the market and I have about 10 others that I will never use again (anybody want them?) I love the part where she gives the breakdown of carbs and protein content in the food. ***Don't buy Rachel Ray's GET REAL MEALS - she uses honey, white pasta, bread, rolls and processed sauces that are sugar-laden; who is she kidding?!?!?! Rachel Ray's version of low-carb is a joke!!! Dana Carpender knows what she is doing!!!!! I highly recommend this book!!!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I cannot beging to tell you how great this recipe book is. I have been on a low carb diet for over ten years, but it wasn't until I got this book that I truly learned to cook low carb. The recipes are all so good, the ingredient that are needed that are out of the ordinary are expained fully, and thankfully are readily available. Whenever I feel myself getting stuck in a rut in cooking dinner, I reach for Dana's book and get re-inspired. An absolute MUST HAVE for any low carber, anyone trying to feed their kids less sugar and still put something on the table that everyone will eat, and anyone currently not inspired to cook."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"My husband and I decided to go low carb 2 months ago. I am a diabetic and need to lose over 100 pounds. He only needs to lose 50 or so. My Dr. recomended the South Beach Diet. I bought the South Beach books, then, I found this book. I am amazed that low carb can taste so good, and not much time to prepare. I have tried MANY times to stick with low carb diets, I've never made it past 3 weeks. But with this book, I have stuck to it! I re stocked my pantry, and made a new menu using the recipes from a few of Dana's books. My sugars have been so good, I had to stop taking my medications (not recommended without Dr approval). If you are planning on staying with a low carb way of life, I recommend you get this book, AND USE IT! I've lost 31 pounds, and it's so easy for me to stick to it.. even for a carb addict like myself."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I bought Dana's 15 minute low-carb cookbook first and was so impressed I just bought this one. I love them both!I've been on (and off) low carb for several years now. Actually, I had been more off than on for several months. I was just very bored with the food. These two cookbooks have inspired me and I've even started losing weight again.I'm an avid cookbook reader and collector but Dana's cookbooks contain ideas I haven't seen anywhere else. Yet, for the most part, I find them easy enough for weeknight cooking.If you're sick of eating low carb, YOU REALLY NEED THIS COOKBOOK!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I am a cookbook junkie. I'm sure I have in excess of 300, all kinds, and I have to say, this is one of my TOP favorites! Most cookbooks I will read through, then put on the shelf, and that's it. Not this one! I have cooked a number of recipes from Dana's 500 Low Carb Recipes and have been very happy with the results.In addition, Dana's anecdotes and amusing writing style really add to the enjoyment. I plan to buy her newest, &quot;15 Minute Low Carb Recipes&quot;, in the near future. I also own her &quot;How I Gave Up My Low Fat Diet and Lost 40 Pounds&quot; book and find it a great resource!If you're doing low carb, or just interested in watching your carb intake a bit, I'd recommend any of Dana's fine books."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I have bought a lot of books from Amazon.com, but this is the first review I have written. That in itself tells you how much I love this cookbook. I started my low-carb lifestyle armed with two other low-carb cook books before I found Dana's. If I had found hers first, I wouldn't have needed the other two. I've followed her advice, cooked her recipes and have lost weight without trying or going hungry, and best of all I feel great! Her recipes are delicious, quick and easy, and there are sooo many of them! You can find a recipe for just about anything you are in the mood for. My husband and I love every meal I have prepared from this book. And it reads as if a girlfriend wrote it just for you! I've recommended this cookbook to everyone I know, and I recommend it to you too! I can't wait for her new book, 15 Minute Low Carb Recipes. I will be first in line to buy a copy. Thanks Dana! You truly are the best!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I have probably most of the low carb books that Amazon[.com] sells. This one is the best. The hardest part of cooking low carb for me is all the recipes with soy. They are virtually tasteless and difficult to get use to. This book while it has some recipes requiring soy, has fantastic recipes without the soy. Many of the recipes are quick and easy but still worth serving to guests. What a treat the desert section is! And you haven't lived until you have Fried Cheese!!!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"This cookbook has no pictures, but you will not need them. This is one of the best cookbooks (of any kind) with easy to follow instructions and a wide variety of interesting foods. If you like eggs, you will appreciate the large collection of omelet and scrambles recipes. The collection of beef, pork and chicken recipes is somewhat smaller, but good. You will find how to create every kind of sauce, dressing, topping, plus many deserts. Some recipes are as simple as two ingredients and some are much more elaborate. It is a cookbook for the rest of us who are not professional gourmet cooks. The first part of the book before the recipes is almost worth the price of the whole book."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"After reading the other rave reviews, I decided to buy this book hoping for new ideas for some low-carb recipes. I thought that I would end up with both easy, whip-up-after-work recipes for dinner and some that I could spend an afternoon baking.I was not very pleased to see that all of the baking recipes require hard to find ingredients (unless you live in a town with some great health food stores or grocery stores that carry extensive health food lines), or that the bread recipes are all written for a bread machine. Being a baker, I have exiled my bread machine to the basement if only for the reason that I like the feeling of a bread dough blossoming under my hands. Yes, the recipes can be adapted, but I didn't buy a cookbook so that I would have to re-write everything myself.Also, if like me you have a family with picky eaters, I would think twice about buying this book. With a bunch of people who are big &quot;meat and potatoes&quot; fans and the &quot;ick factor&quot; is high with anything new, you might end up throwing away money on this cookbook and on the (higher priced) specialty items at the market. (Maybe I am wrong, but I can't imagine anyone in my family falling for pureed cauliflower as a substitute for mashed potatoes.)Many of the recipes look to be delicious. And plenty of them also look like they don't have a huge time commitment. When I get through weeding out the ones that I can find all of the ingredients for, perhaps I will have a small stash of low-carb recipes that will work for us."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"My only complaint about this book is that many recipes call for artificial sweetners, canned foods rather than fresh, and other un-natural additives such as whey protein powder."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"While there may be 500 recipies in this cookbook I only found a handful that interested me an most of those were less than edible.

This book is the answer you have been looking for in the realm of bringing that sweetness back into your life, without the evil carbs our society has us all addicted to. This book is a must. Also highly advised, the \\"New Sex Now\\" dvd."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"When I first came upon this book I was excited about what it offered - a pretty sure fire way to lose some weight. My husband had been \\"low carbing it\\" for a couple of years but I had always been concerned about this way of eating.I had been raised on more of a \\"Mediterranean\\" type of diet and didn't like the idea of eating a lot of meat. However, in the past few years I had been eating more processed foods and a lot of bakery items - and I do believe I had turned into a Carb \\"addict\\".I was about 20 lbs over and by utilizing the book's principles, I lost 10 lbs in a couple of weeks. This was very rewarding, but I still didn't like depending on mostly meat for my protein. The author does have a short chapter on vegetarianism, but it is not really supported much in the book.I've since done some further research and I now believe that one does NOT have to rely on meat for one's protein or to lose weight! A particularly enlightening and well written book is: THE NEW BECOMING VEGETARIAN by Vesanto Melina, MS, RD & Brenda Davis, RD. I believe it is well reviewed on Amazon. I've decided to be primarily vegetarian because of my love of animals and the very sad and disturbing way they are kept and killed. Even sea food, which I thought I'd eat, is well known now for the toxic elements, such a mercury.I can't stress this point enough - ONE DOES NOT NEED MEAT FOR PROTEIN!I have kept those 10 lbs off on my veggie diet, by not eating junk and simple carbs.I was really surprised by this, I had assumed that I'd gain it all back.Now I'm going for the next 10 lbs.By the way, my husband has just been diagnosed with gout (extremely painful) in his fingers - which is due to the high amount of URIC ACID that eating large amounts of meat can produce.He is now on my vegetarian diet, high in complex carbs, vegies, fruit, legumes, etc, and his gout is beginning to subside. I'm able to make wholesome desserts to satisfy my sweet tooth - a good cook book is: THE ESSENTIAL VEGETARIAN COOKBOOK by Diana Shaw - also available on Amazon.You can verify this info on Google, don't take my word for it........"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"This book is very complete and an awesome reference for anyone going low carb! That being said, it is not gluten free, so I do try to substitute when needed. However, it wasn't meant to be, so that's not really a negative. I'm glad to have this book on my shelf."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"This is my all-time favorite Dana Carpender's recipe books. It covers a wide gamut of recipes and has pretty much everything for every occasion, that's what I like most about it. Appetizers, main courses, desserts, something to nibble on, it has everything and mostly healthy too! There are some recipes that I wanted to try but couldn't find the ingredients locally in stores. I am waiting to try those but only once I can locate the ingredients."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"The item was exactly as described. It arrived on time and without hassel. Thank you for such an effortless transaction."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"While the book touts 500 recipes, many of them are incredibly basic. I feel like anyone that has spent time in a kitchen would have the capacity to throw a particular ingredient in a pan and saute it with some salt and butter. Unfortunately, basic recipes are the book's mainstay. This doesn't mean it is a complete failure. I know lots of people that would need a basic primer such as this to initiate any type of cooking activity and basic recipes provide the basis for more complex ones. Another problem I had with the book is that I eat food first with my eyes and I tend to make recipes first that are accompanied by pictures; this book had no photos to demonstrate that a low-carb recipe can look just as appetizing as a high-carb one. For individuals attempting to transition to low-carb diet, I think delicious and visually appealing foods are important."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Substantial index of recipes for a Low-Carb Diet. However, \\"The Whole Family Will Love\\" them, was not the case for our family...but perhaps it will be for yours. Our impressions were that the recipes ranged from overly simple, to simply not satisfying. No real complaints though, a good outing from the author, just perhaps not as well received as we had hoped. The book was \\"ok\\". Happy to share with friends of similar interest but we would not buy it again."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I bought this book in hopes I would finally find a cookbook that would help me in everyday cooking. The best thing about this book is her explanation of all the low carb terms and ingredients. The problem I have with this book and most low carb cookbooks is that they rely on too many weird ingredients that you can't get in your local grocery store but have to buy on line or in a health food store, and they are expensive. I have made a few recipes that were okay (Yankee pot roast is very good), but nothing over the top. Also, this is not an everyday cookbook, in my opinion. That being said, I would buy this cookbook for the \\"dictionary\\" of low carb terms."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Enjoying the low carb recipesMiss bread so love the other options the book sharessomething more that just cheese and eggs and meat"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Many diet cookbooks are primarily exotic recipes that are great to try once, but not the type of meal that you would prepare on a regular basis. This low-carb cookbook is loaded with excellent reasonable meals for continued use. We have used recipes from it on at least a weekly basis since it was purchased. All the recipes that we have tried have been great and we will reuse most if not all of them. Last, but not least, the book is very reasonably priced!

She is terrific, knowledgeable and comical. I have all her books and wouldn't part with any one of them. My favorite is 500 MORE LOW-CARB RECIPES.

If you are doing low carb.....you need these books."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Based on so many five-star reviews, I was very excited to receive this book and further my new low-carb lifestyle. The bread recipes in particular gave me hope that I could enjoy a few favorites without sacrificing my health. My low-carb journey began due to PCOS. I have lost over ten pounds in five weeks and really looked forward to some new ideas for low-carb cooking. I pride myself in being a very good cook. However, I have sampled six of the recipes in this cookbook, two of which were bread machine recipes, and only one has been even remotely edible. The Heroin wings were tasty but certainly not addictive as stated. The two bread attempts yielded something beyond words. The sour cream coffee cake was another recipe that spelled disaster. What is worse is that I sank nearly $100 into ingredients at a local health food store that I will probably NEVER use again. I am all for healthy but I can do low-carb and still enjoy the taste of food. This book has been a complete waste of money for my family. Maybe those five-star reviewers have never eaten a homecooked meal from scratch??? Or, maybe they simply have under-developed taste buds. If this was the only representation of low-carb recipes out there, it would seriously derail my efforts."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"my husband and i have been on the atkins diet for seven months and i've been through many low carb recipes that are tedious, difficult, and call for many ingredients that are hard to find. this cookbook is full of recipes that are easy and practical any night of the week. carpender puts a new spin on many of our favorite foods and makes them acceptable for our new diet. low carb cooking is now much easier thanks to her book!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"This book is such a disappointment if you have spent any time in a kitchen. Also, I'm not sure if this is a cultural issue because the author is from Indiana and I am from the South, but I found that the seasoning and taste of every recipe that I tried to be unappetizing. Her claims of liking things hot should not be believed. Because this book requires so much tinkering to get the flavors correct I can't even suggest it for someone who would benefit from directions on how to make omelets or deviled eggs. If you are looking to learn how to cook I say check out Mastering the Art of French Cooking. You will learn how to make eggs, sauces, meats and vegetables. I can also suggest George Stella's cookbooks for delicious low-carb cooking."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"This cookbook does have a ton of recipes, but without any pictures, much creativity or inspiration, it doesn't exactly make you want to cook or try most of them. If you are simply looking for a collection of recipes without much bang, this should do the job, but it's not going to make you want to eat any of them!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I'm new in trying a low-carb/low sugar diet as a lifestyle. I bought this book as a way to make sure I had enough variety to maintain an ongoing change. If you are single, not into cooking or work a lot of hours, this book is not as useful because you have to make so much (even ketchup) from scratch. Low-carb condiments would be worth buying to me even if pricier. I didn't expect to see as much cheese, heavy cream, nuts and Splenda but this must be the only way to really kill the monotony. You also need a lot of different spices, which seems to be the real trick (how many ways can you really cook eggs, beef, fish, chicken and the same few low-carb veggies?). She does mention a few online low-carb grocery stores but some have gone out of business since her printing so you'll need to Google. Also Google a list of low-carb veggies as a shopping list is not included (substitute cauliflower or turnips for potatoes, etc). The goal is to try to keep daily carbs anywhere from 20-100 grams per day depending on your weight-loss goal or metabolism. There is a chapter on making your own breads and desserts if you happen to bake. In summary, for my purposes, this isn't as useful, but there can be benefits for those with families where you have to cook and make more of an effort."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I have tried many recipes in this book now and they all taste great.

Plus it's very easy to read all the type (a problem with so many cookbooks that try to be &quot;artsy&quot;). I like it so much I've joined her &quot;lo-carbezine&quot; at holdthetoast.com. I've also bought the 15-Minute book though I haven't used it yet, but I'm positive it will be just as fabulous. If only she would come out with a book of just slow cooker recipes!

I don't deny that it is nice to have a a few favored dessert recipes. However it is also my own humble opinion that it is more important following this WOL, to learn how to souly return to the basic real foods, and be taught nice flavorable ways to jazz them up.

Mein gott!) and completely impossible-to-make recipes.I'm sorry, but I don't live somewhere where you can casually walk into a store and find yourself some vanilla whey protein/special protein mix that is required for 90% of the desserts in this book.Just get a real cookbook and substitute flour for soy flour/bake mix and sugar for splenda."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I think they tried a bit too hard to come up with a bunch of recipes. Some of them are great and the books is well worth the money but some of them are pretty bad. I think like many recipe books people try too hard to write tons of them instead of writing less recipes but make sure the ones are good. I think it is a good buy but not an awesome buy."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I've recently started a &quot;low carb&quot; diet; I'm loosely following the South Beach plan. I'm not a big meat eater and I really love sweets, therfore cutting carbs is proving to be very difficult! I was hoping this recipe book would help me out with some low carb sweet treats. However, I was very disappointed that all of the recipes include Splenda, which is an artificial sweetener. The jury's still out on whether this is a healthy additive, and I'm guessing that it will have the same bad reputation as aspartame as more is learned about it.I understand that some folks need to cut out sugar for health reasons and therefore replacements like Splenda are better than sugar. But for those who are just vain (like me!) and want to lose a few pounds, I think that Splenda is a bit of a high price to pay for that. So, sadly, there's no &quot;miracle&quot; recipe that allows you to have all of the joy of a sweet treat with none of the pain. Personally, I've decided to cut the carbs as much as I can, but to allow the occassional &quot;sugary&quot; snack.Although I won't be making use of the dessert recipes (or some of the sauce recipes either that include Splenda), there are many main course and side dish recipes that are Splenda free. I tried my first one this past weekend and it was DELICIOUS...Zucchini Meatloaf Italiano. I have always been quite proud of my traditional meatloaf (made with such evils as ketchup and barbeque sauce!), but I must say, this definitely gave it a run for its money.The author does a nice job of describing the various &quot;staple&quot; low carb components of her recipe book and I found that to be quite helpful. The recipes are easy to follow and although some of the ingredients may require a trip to a &quot;health food&quot; store, I am not intimidated by them even though I don't consider myself to be terribly skilled in the kitchen."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"There is only one reason I gave this book a 2 star review instead of 1 star. It is because of the intro section, where the author talks about a low carb diet. Overall, there are too many unappetizing recipes, such as the 'Hot Dog Scramble'. Yes, that's a hotdog with scrambled eggs on it....gross. sMost of the recipes have cheese, butter, or a lot of oil. She also likes to use Whey protein a lot. I figured that I could cut down on those things...then...The killer for me...the nail in the coffin....her use of SPLENDA. Why oh why do people use artificial sweeteners?!? I wish I had read more reviews, because I would't have purchased this book.Not all of the recipes sound bad, but for me, few sound good. If you're ok with artificial sweeteners and odd food combinations, then this book is for you. Otherwise, think twice about purchasing this book. It's really not worth the money."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I have not had a chance to actually try any of the recipes yet, since I just got the book, but I've read through a lot of them and it looks great. Real food for real people, with ingredients that are fairly easy to find, unlike so many of the diet cookbooks that seem to focus on items that are only available in certain parts of the country or require a good health food store to provide them. In a half-hour of skimming through the book, I managed to bookmark about 8 recipes for future reference, and will be trying the first of them within a few days. I hope they are as good as they look.

I literally ate eggs, cheese, lettuce and meat for a year! The weight fell off but I really hated that way of eating and even though ive kept the weight off, I did switch back to low fat/ low calorie eating which leaves me starving all the time.I bought Danas book in the hopes of finding \\"easy and practical\\" meals to prepare, not just for me, but for my husband and 3 kids who all had adapted a fairly unhealthy way of eating- out of convenience mostly. I am totally shocked at how easy, delicious, filling and satisfing these meals are! I work 40 hours a week, have 3 kids and never seem to stop and every LC book I have found requires soooo much time in the kitchen it just wasnt worth it!I have prepared full meals, snacks, lunches and breakfasts for all of us for 2 weeks now and havent even come close to getting bored nor scratched the surface of the countless \\"doable\\" recipes she provides. I simply sit down every saturday morning with this book, a notebook and a pen and start flipping through, putting together a main course and a side dish (dinner) for the next 5-6 days. I make sure and vary the ingredients from fish to pork to beef and then I work on what we will have with it! I plan out the meals and jot down the required ingredients (saving the more time consuming meals for the weekends) throwing in at least one \\"leftovers\\" night during the week and viola. Take off to the store, but it all and post the menu on the fridge. Its really that easy.Thanks Dana! I havent even gotten to crack the cover of the crockpot cook book yet, but I will!Noone in my house has even missed the mac and cheese, scalloped potatoes or garlic bread.(oh and between me, hubby and the kids, we have all lost a few lbs cutting out all those starchy carbs!)"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"This recipe book has plenty of variety.

But when I get in a rut of eating the same thing over and over it's nice to be able to look up something a bit different. If your serious low carb, hamburger and garlic salt can get a bit boring after a very short while.I would highly recommend this book to get some ideas of different spices and way of cooking things into your daily blah food.One thing I do agree with is that this is a \\"browsing\\" type of cookbook, be prepared to have many sticky notes because the index is horrible.I know there is a recipe for stuffed peppers in this book, but it is neither listed under stuffed or peppers, which is what prompted me to write this review.

I really wanted something that was not just a cookbook full of salads. This book is packed with recipes for good hearty food that you will really want to eat. The chicken wings, dips, crackers, and breads have all been a hit so far. It's also obvious that these recipes are from someone who is a real low-carber. There are heaps of great tips. The writing style is casual and friendly, which makes it very enjoyable to read - kind of like a friend is sitting down and telling you all her hard-learned low carb secrets. For me, the best thing about this book is that it puts the fun back into cooking low-carb. My only negative is that I really wish it had pictures - that would have made it a 5-star purchase."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I bought this cookbook when I decided to go low-carb (I lost 20 lbs in about 3 months low-carbing! ). It's been great! Most of the recipes I've tried I have liked a lot. Dana really has great taste in recipes! This is my go-to cookbook now. Everything just tastes great!One caveat: I'm not a fan of artificial sweeteners. I consider them about as evil as sugar- no- more evil than sugar. And Dana uses Splenda frequently in her recipes- and not just the desserts. I've learned to just leave it out and deal with the food being maybe a little more acidic than intended. (I don't even make the desserts.) It doesn't bother me as much as using Splenda would! : )Also, Dana uses guar/xanthan gum frequently also to give some thickening to the food. Again-I'm not interested in adding what I consider to be a non-food item to my food. So I leave it out and just deal with my food being runny. Maybe I'll try adding some beef gelatin if it ever really bothers me...Overall, I highly recommend this cookbook!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Bought this book for my wife as a present.

Without the book we would not have continued to follow it. We have our favorites and some we didn't really like. That is always true of any recipe book. Very ingenious approach to making recipes low-carb.Recommend her new book 1001 Low-Carb Recipes instead of this book.

It was easy then...low-carb products filled the store shelves. There were bars, shakes, candy, low-carb meals, and low-carb selections at almost every restaurant! I lost lots of weight and felt better than I had in years! But, suddenly, it all went away and I was forced go it alone! I struggled, going back and forth between low-fat and low-carb. I had almost given up completely when I found this book accidentally online. This book has truly made the low-carb lifestyle easy for me AND kept it interesting. There are enough simple, rich, delightful recipes in this book for one to NEVER go back to low fat. My favorite is Burger Scramble Florentine, a delicious one-skillet meal made with real cream cheese. I use ground chicken, which is even tastier than ground meat! I plan our family's meals out of this book every week. You've GOT to own this one (and \\"500 More Low Carb Recipes\\") to stay on low carb. Thanks to Dana Carpender! I can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I have several low-carb cookbooks on my shelf. This cookbook is the most comprehensive, varied and is the easiest to use. 1. There are many recipes for delicious meals, snacks and desserts that I'd never thought of. 2. The ingredients are not hard to find to make these dishes. It is important not to keep eating the same low carb foods over and over again, because it can lead to boredom, and that can lead to slipping. In this sense this recipe book can get the low-carber to think &quot;outside of the box,&quot; when it comes to what we eat. For the number of recipes and the price, this can't be beat. Here are some examples of great tasting meals for you and your family that are in it: mouth-watering marinades, vegetable lasagna, pizza with without the crust, all-meat chili, cheesecakes, and even coffee cakes. Spaghetti squash to chicken wings, it's written in a friendly easy to read style set in the kitchen.

This has some great recipes and they are easy to prepare. No matter what low carb plan you are on, this book will fit in with it.I am a Somersizer and I have allergies; but I don't find it at all difficult to make substitutions or deletions. These recipes are what real people make at home. I have all of Suzanne Somers' books and credit her with a 70 pound weight loss. I will buy every book that she publishes- they are visually beautiful, and have some terrific ideas. But Suzanne's books are the ones I read like novels, and to get ideas from. Somers' recipes are tricky- the directions are not always good at producing the expected results. You sometimes end up going to her web site to find out what others have changed to get the desired results. In some cases, it's more time and more steps.Even though I am an experienced cook, I like something I know I won't have trouble with. This book is perfect for me and for everyone else. It's everyday food that you can serve to your family and guests with confidence. My husband was flipping through this right after I got it, and he was impressed. He even picked out some recipes for me to make. That's unusual for him! He doesn't usually show any interest in my cookery books. Or in any of my books. The cover is eye-catching and inviting, the writing style is homey, chatty, and informative. If you only buy one low carb book, buy this one.I also bought her first book, How I Gave Up My Low Fat Diet And Lost Forty Pounds. It is a nice companion piece to this book, and very informative. It isn't necessary to have both of the books, but I'm betting that if you buy one, you will want the other. I wish I had bought Dana's books a long time ago. There are some fabulous recipes in every category. Give this book a try, and a place of honor on your book shelves. It's a keeper.

Well, your low-carb diet just got a whole lot easier to maintain and much tastier than you ever knew it could be. &quot;500 Low-Carb Recipes From Snacks to Dessert,That the Whole Family Will Love&quot; by Dana Carpender, has delicious recipes from soup to nuts. You will find satisfying main courses, refreshing salads, yummie desserts and YES..EVEN BREADS that will curb your carb cravings, and lots more!Variety IS the spice of life, and you get tons of it in this cook book.Recipes for 'Greek Roasted Chicken','Cinnamon Raisin Bread','Coleslaw Italiano','Zesty Seafood Soup','Peanut Butter Cookies' and 'Strawberries in Wine&quot; are just a small sampling of the culinary treats you will find here. Most of the ingrediants are easily found, for some you will have to start shopping at a health food or specialty store. The recipes are clearly explained and Ms. Carpender has also done her homework as with each recipe you will get the yields and a breakdown of carbs and fiber per serving.The only thing you will not find, that I thought may have been a time saver while shopping for the ingrediants is a breakdown of cholestrol per serving for those of us that need to keep on eye on that. But as she reminds us over and over....always read the labels!There are also a few tips for reducing cholestrol levels, included in the first 40 pages of the book, which covers everything you need to know about low-carb diets. Here you can find out what exactly 'Usabale Carbs' are, how the carb counts are calculated,ingrediants you should know about, including fats and oils, and yikes...it's okay to use butter...liquid ingrediants used,what to use for sweetners, and many other useful tips and valubale information.Another nice feature you'll find is 'A Refresher on Measurements', which even includes some metric conversions and oven tempatures(in Celsius) for those living outside of the United States. There is a nice table of contents, and index to look up your favorites as well.The bread recipes are used with a bread machine, and if you think you may be making alot of the bread recipes you may want to consider investing in one. I have found a lo-carb bread at my local market, but...yuck...these are much better!So no pretty pictures taking up alot of space in this book, just cover to cover(nearly 500 pages)of lo-carb recipes and useful information.I love it and as the title says...the whole family does too!Go for it...and thanks...Laurie"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I have now had several months with this cookbook and I often plan all of our meals around recipes that I find.

Dana Carpender writes in a way that makes cooking approachable by anyone, and most especially to someone who is completed befuddled at how to make low-carb a successful life style choice, not just how to jump on the latest diet bandwagon.What makes low-carb a lot easier to manage is that you don't count calories. As Dr. Atkins wrote in &quot;Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution&quot; &quot;... people who follow the Atkins Nutritional Approach may eat fewer calories than before, it certainly is not because the program limits calorite intake. People doing Atkins may end up eating fewer calories because they are generally less hungry and no longer obsessed with food&quot;So, the point is that to make low-carb a healthy lifestyle choice you need help to overcome your obsessions with the wrong ways of dieting, like counting calories. That's where 500 Low Carb Recipes comes into play.Some of the ingredients may be a little tougher to find at mass-market groceries, but if you have a good chain like Whole Foods, you'll have no trouble finding these ingredients. Best of all, the recipes result in really tasty meals - the kind of food you'll enjoy eating and you won't feel like you're eating rabbit food and punishing yourself.I became addicted when I found the recipe for Oatmeal Cookies. Yeah, really! Low carb oatmeal cookies!If you just want to jump on the latest bandwagon, or want a book that does all your thinking for you - maybe this isn't for you. But once you've found how well low carb works for you, you need stimulation to make it a life style. That's what this book does for you.In the end, that's what makes the difference between yo-yo fad dieting and really successful weight management.Great job, Dana!

The recipes are fantastic! My husband says he has never eaten better, and he isn't even on the diet with me.So far I've tried about 20 different recipes and I've only found one that I wouldn't bother making again. There are several in the book, like the Apple-Glazed Pork Chops, that we will use even when I'm off the diet--It's just that good!Most recipes are very simple to throw together and use common ingredients. All give carb, protein, and fiber counts with each serving. A few recipes are more difficult (mainly the baked goods)and require special flour and I haven't tried any of those yet. One of my favorite recipes is the Peanut Butter Protein Bars. I just can't stomach eggs or meat in the morning, so this was a great one for me. One small bar has 31 grams of protein. It tastes so good, my kids are always stealing them on me.If you are low-carbing, this is the best cookbook out there."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"This is a great book that contains wonderful ideals for quick, easy, healthy meals. Although the recipes sometimes require 40-50 minutes to prepare, I have never been disappointed with one yet. I admittedly don't like to cook, and find it easy to avoid cooking altogether by eating unhealthy fast-food, but this book has definitely helped me avoid the temptations of easy, low-prep., unhealthy eating that has become the staple of my diet. This book will definitely make it easier to make healthy eating more consistent, but I'm convinced that the only way to really stick to any diet is to make it part of your routine by making it a habit. A friend of mine who is a clinical dietitian gave me an amazing book entitled The Power of Habit. It explains how our eating (when we eat, what we eat, and how much we eat) is all habit. It teaches you how to change your eating habits to make healthy eating a permanent, automatic part of your lifestyle. 500 Low-Carb Recipes gives you healthy, easy, low-hassle recipes, and The Power of Habit teaches you how to stick to them.

The diet was so hum-drum, with absolutely no variety.

With 500 recipes to choose from, no one will get bored with the Low-Carb \\"diet.\\" I assure you, anyone can eat well, and Enjoy meals, while losing weight and avoiding the sugary and starchy foods we all crave. Unlike most \\"diets,\\" this is a rational system of eating Good Food, that isn't as bad for us as our usual fare. No need to give up \\"Chocolate\\" or other pleasant dessert items...just a readjustment to our usual \\"Seefood Diet.\\"The author is a Terrific Cook & a Wonderful Hostess ( and she looks great ! ). I can speak from first-hand experience (and second-hand, via my wife and friends), when I say that this lady can Cook ! We have dined with her and when we discovered we were eating \\"Low Carb,\\" we were very surprised to say the least!You will not starve eating Low-Carb. The recipes are to drool for.Not only is the author is a Terrific Cook, but she & her husband look great & they have a lot energy ( ! ), so I think her work speaks for itself. See her previous book : \\"How I Gave Up My Low Fat Diet and Lost Forty Pounds! ,\\" by Dana Carpender (Paperback)My local public library just ordered 3 copies of the \\"500 Low-Carb Recipes\\" book, and the author was recently pictured on the front page of her own local newspaper's \\"Region\\" section making Cookies, in her kitchen.Word is spreading fast, here in Indiana (it is a much-needed book in our area), and the libraries have a difficult time keeping her book in stock.Better buy a copy, fast, before Indiana purchases them all.Please, see Linda Carroll's review, below, for more information."},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"Well, if you're interested in this book, you've decided to go low-carb. Good for you. But if you're like me, you still want delicious food to eat besides broccoli and steak for a meal. This is a great cookbook, easy to follow, with all kinds of recipes for every kind of meal. Recipes for delicious bread (5g of carbs per slice.. less than Atkins Bread you buy at the store, I'm pretty sure, and tastes much better!), cookies, protein bars, mayonnaise, even granola, brownies... also what to do with green beans and broccoli (again!), chicken and everything else. Be prepared to go to your health food store for some of the ingredients, or to order them online. I'm not a great cook, but I didn't have any trouble at all making delicious food with this book. She explains the ingredients you'll be using in the book, and how flour is replaced with low-carb ingredients. She also lets you know how many carbs are in each serving of the recipe, along with how much fiber and protein. Just be careful, if you're on the South Beach Diet, a lot of these recipes are NOT low fat, and are calorie dense. A lot of them are phase 3. Definitely get this book if you want a variety of delicious recipes. I also highly recommend The Low-Carb Comfort Food Cookbook to go with it. These 2 cookbooks keep my husband and I happily on the diet. And, believe it or not, we had a low-carb holiday season and didn't gain a single pound. And it was easy and delicious!"},{"Title":"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","review":"I love this cookbook. There is a huge variety of recipes in all categories. I haven't made a recipe that I don't like.

The low carb breads that I have tried are great and fill that void extremely well. The hot almond cereal is divine. I was very tired of eggs for breakfast and really missed oatmeal.

It is true that ingredients to make low-carb breads and desserts are no so easy to get your hands on, but well worth the effort.

My husband doesn't really like hot and sour soup in restaurants, but loved the batch I made from the recipe in this book! I have made two of the low carb breads (I did have to purchase some ingredients online) and both were delicious. The texture is a little chewier than bread made from flour, but toasted it is great -especially for about 5 carbs per slice vs. over 20 in a normal piece of bread!! This book is SO worth the money!!

The cheesecake was not as good as the real thing, which is, alas, made with sugar, but it was close enough that I'll never miss the flour-crusted version.I can't wait to make the coconut shrimp and the scallops wrapped in bacon on spinach with walnut sauce.

This isn't an in-depth discussion of why one should use C#'s \\"as\\" keyword for safe casting, nor will you find details on asynchronous communication. What you will find is a quick coverage of enough basics to enable testers to start hitting web services, Windows and ASP forms, and even deal with basic COM interoperabilityThe book is well-written, concise, and in a good voice. The authors carry a common project through much of the book, using the development of a bug reporting system to lay out .NET fundamentals. They use a nice building block approach along the way, starting out sections with the extreme basics and moving on to mid-level topics. (You won't find anything particularly advanced in the book, but again, the focus isn't on pointy-headed developers, it's on pointy-headed testers.)There are several things I don't care for in the book, mostly from a software engineer's viewpoint. One thing would be the authors' notion of code reuse via copying in code or classes vice simply referencing a different assembly and keeping code in one central spot, but that's from a SE's viewpoint...This isn't a book for any developer to fool with, but it's an invaluable book for testers looking to learn programming in .NET, specifically tailored for their work as a tester."},{"Title":"A Tester's Guide to .NET Programming (Expert's Voice)","review":"I can't say enough nice things about this book.

If you are developing .NET software or testing it, you should stop what you are doing until you get your hands on a copy of this book and read every word.

This (apparently) unedited book is written in the self-confident style of a hard-bitten New Englander, full of pithy observations and unsatisfactorily explained personal successes. I for one would fascinated to know more about Crandon's insanely successful drug store company - e.g. his business model, his management philosophy, and the way in which he resurrected its almost complete financial demise. I am also intrigued by his public policy successes - the peaks of which he describes in annoyingly simple glimpses, the travails of which he explains not at all. However, this slim book does remind one that each public works project - be it a bridge, concert hall, or park - is the culmination of an entire life's work, and we would do well to document and remember the labor represented by each."},{"Title":"Visions of the daughters of Albion","review":"Deftly edited by Robert N. Essick (Professor of English, University of California - Riverside), Visions of the Daughters of Albion is a full color reproduction of William Blake's classic literary blend of verse and art, which was first printed in 1793. Enhanced with a straightforward, easy-to-read, separate transcription of Blake's poem, drawings from Blake's sketchbook related to the final work, and an extensive and erudite literary commentary on the images plate-by-plate, Visions Of The Daughters Of Albion is the definitive edition of a timeless classic and would grace the collection of any academic reference library or William Blake enthusiast."},{"Title":"Visions of the daughters of Albion","review":"I originally ordered this book in order to do a presentation for a graduate course at a local university. It worked out perfectly for the presentation as the pictures are beautiful and the editor, Robert Essick, does a marvelous job describing each picture and even transcribing the notes and illustrations from Blake's own notebook. Further, Essick adds a section entitled \\"Commentary\\" which I relied on heavily to explain certain aspects of Blake's life to the students. Essick's writing reads easily and beautifully, so there is never a dull moment, even though it is a scholarly work. If you are interested at all in William Blake and his works, I believe you will enjoy this book very much."},{"Title":"Hey Ya!: The Unauthorized Biography of Outkast","review":"Don't be deceived by the subtitle which says that \\"Hey Ya!...\\" is the \`unauthorized' biography of the visionary Atlanta Hip-Hop group, OutKast. Don't expect any Kitty Kelley-style revelations. This is only unauthorized because it wasn't written in direct cooperation with the band and to attract buyers with enticing \`unauthorized' label. In truth, \\"Hey Ya!\\" is nothing more than a 190 page glowing review of OutKast. None of this, however, is a knock against the book because, at its core, it's a fascinating look at the beginnings and evolution of one of the true landmark groups in music today.From their earliest days after meeting in high school, Andre Benjamin (Andre 3000) and Antwan Patton (Big Boi) set out to make music on their own terms, seeking to be evolutionary and revolutionary. Whereas most hip hop acts were sticking to tired formulas and unoriginal beats and techniques, this duo (which quickly adopted the appropriately title name, OutKast) kept pushing the envelope and trying create something new. This biography deconstructs the group by showing some of their earliest musical influences like, understandably, Run-DMC and George Clinton and the more unlikely Kate Bush (a personal favorite of Big Boi's). It reveals how the two principles disparate styles didn't disrupt the music, but rather enhanced. It gives a nod a to OutKast's earlier supports like Atlanta's Dungeon Family studios and the Organized Noise studios. Most importantly, the author, Chris Nickson, spends most of his effort analyzing how OutKast evolved musically (and stylistically) with each progressive album. Instead of resting on what worked before, OutKast kept taking risks and it made a difference in how they were viewed and in their legacy.While \\"Hey Ya!...\\" may not be a packed with amazing revelations, it still gives fans a good opportunity to get inside this seminal hip hop act. The information is strong and gives fans a stronger connection with this OutKast."},{"Title":"Hey Ya!: The Unauthorized Biography of Outkast","review":"I always been a fan to Outkast since I first got introduced to them back in '01 (now makes my 4th yr. as a Outkast fan), I know they had albums put out back then be4 the 2 big breaktroughs of STANKONIA and SPEAKERBOXXX (2 of my best favorites to incl. along in my CD collection or music collection for example). They were the 1st rap songs to bring a lotta songs that deals w/ the cities of Atlanta and Jonesboro for example.I once dubbed them as the Steely Dan of Hip-Hop b/c of the rock group back in the '70s (alongside Donald Fagen and Walter Becker). They a varied mix of jazz, R&B;, funk, gospel, blues, funk, Latin, electronic, etc. They can do it all kinds. Believe I'm a real fan of music of all kinds myself. This will get you in the groove if u grab this if u're a fan to rap, R&B;/old school, jazz, and/or other types of music.If u're a fan to Marvin Gaye, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday, Barry White, Luther Vandross, Aretha Franklin, Quincy Jones, Charlie Parker, Steely Dan, John Mayer, The Roots, Tribe Called Quest, The Neptunes, Jay-Z, Goodie Mob, Kanye West, Nelly, Alicia Keys, Patti Labelle, Prince, Jimi Hendrix, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, N.W.A., Twista, Cee-Lo, R.

His commentary on the Cantos are lucid and insightful and as one of his former students, I can attest that his work will leave you with a favorable impression and perhaps a desire to further scholarship.

This is a book written by an expert with high pedagogic skills. I found not only the whys of registry but a number of tips that helped resolving my issues. Reading this book felt me more in control of the machine.Also useful are some of the freeware and shareware described in the book, like regmon. To be frank, however, I didn't find much use for the featured software that come with the book's CD.The book offered a lot more than my immediate needs requested. For instance, as a programmer I found it may be a powerful reference tool for those needing to write code accessing the registry.As a hint for the next edition I suggest increasing anedotical contents for troubleshooting application entries and other heavy user issues."},{"Title":"Using the Windows 98 Registry with CDROM (Using ...

(Que))","review":"This book is excellent for understanding the &quot;theory&quot; of the Win 98 registry, but I have not found it very useful for guidance in the practical aspects of actually tweaking registry settings. It usually contains enough information about a particular registry section to know if it is not worth editing, but it often does not give enough coverage to important keys. It would definitely benefit a lot from input by a person who commonly solves problems using the registry. That said, I have sometimes found it helpful when trying to find which key contains a given piece of info that I am interested in tweaking."},{"Title":"Using the Windows 98 Registry with CDROM (Using ...

Jerry Honeycutt has done a masterful job of dissecting the Registry and explaining what it is piece by piece and how you can change it to make your system better, faster, stronger. There's even information for system administrators for remotely editing workstation Registries. The Powertools software on the CD it comes with makes a nice companion to Tweak UI, although it's not robust enough to replace it.

The book is exceptionally well-designed. Not only is the materially organized in a useful fashion, the page-layout makes things easy to read. The author's writing style is crisp and engaging, and that which he is trying to teach is genuinely useful.

In &quot;The Honey Badger&quot;, first published(posthumously) in 1965, Ruark - thru his hero -searches for a purpose to his existence in a tapestry encompassing the restaurants of New York, thru wartime London to the plains of Africa.And just what isa honey badger? A mean little animal which, when cornered, attacks straight for the balls!!Immensely readable."},{"Title":"Honey Badger","review":"Ruark wrote what he lived, nothing more. Do not look for psychological sophistication or fiction that operates on more than one level. Ruark was the epitome of the soldier of fortune most men dream about in their Mitty-like fantasies. Alive and healthy today, he would be in Afganistan as a correspondent looking for the head of bin Laden while making Geraldo look like an even bigger fool. The Honey Badger aptly describes Ruark's relationships with women and is a good read for insight into the '50s macho mentality.

The indepth details and the look into the past of Afra and Damia was wonderful. You saw things from both perspectives. The twists and turns of the emotions were unbelieveable and kept you on the edge of your emotional plain. I found myself crying and upset sometimes at the way things played out but it made the end seem that much more pleasant. Truly a work of art by AM. I found the life of Damia, the Rowan's daughter truly unexpected and full of twists unlike her mothers. I highly reccomend the interspace thriller if you like to see a few surprises. I'd tell more but I don't want to ruin the experience. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Damia","review":"Damia could be a biography. Were it not for the fact that it is the sequel to one of Anne Mccaffrey's most popular science-fiction books Damia could very well be about a real person in another time. Damia is that real. The reader is instantly captivated: Damia's little adventures when she is little, from innocent things like running around the Callisto Moon Base to getting caught inside a capsule at the worst possible moment draw from the reader everything from humor to even apprehension. As the story matures so does Damia, and her roles become more than that of a mischievious child-she is a heroine, an average woman, and a phenomenon all in one. Anne Mccaffrey was also careful to make sure that while the story centered on Damia, the other characters, some designed to stand on the sidelines until they recieved the spotlight and limelight, developed as well, so the overall impression one gets is of a wonderful tale that is so intricate and rapturous you'd be hard pressed to put the book down. There are more dangers to Damia than a pool and growing up, though-alien species are focusing on her world, and not all have benign intentions. Her wrenching battle with a terrible, malignant mind erodes a great deal of her, more than just her mental powers. Fortunately she eventually emerges, fully recovered, to deal with a new species, one whose intentions are to ally with the Humans and to project both of them into a new era of peace and triumph.I must admit I was rather put-off by the novel when I saw it on the shelf: the Greek Damia ate her children, so I did not look forward to reading the tale, even if it were by Anne Mccaffrey. But when I read the Rowan, and then started on Damia, I realized the instant I opened up the book this is not that Damia: the heroine I read was a brave, compassionate, and human character, and I'm certain you will agree."},{"Title":"Damia","review":"No really! It's hard to find books where the sequel is better than the original but each book I pick up in this series is better than the last.Only Anne McCaffrey could manage to make a princess into an underdog as sweetly as this story does. Damia is even deeper than her mother Rowan and even more trapped by her talents. Even with a strong mother, Damia has to struggle to find herself before she can become more than a liability to her talents.A story where a mother does everything right and her daughter still has trouble because she's smarter and stronger than her peers."},{"Title":"Damia","review":"Damia Raven is the third of the five immensely Talented children of Jeff Raven and the Rowan, and she may be the most gifted of them all, as becomes apparent to everyone on Callisto Station before she's three years old. The first 90-odd pages of the book retell the events ofThe Rowanfrom the viewpoint of Afra Lyon, who is ten years younger than the Rowan and 24 older than Damia, whom he helps to raise while her parents try to keep up with the demands of their duties in telekinetically flinging freight from the Sol system to its distant colonies. Worshipping the Rowan secretly yet knowing that he can never be what Jeff is to her, Afra resigns himself to a life of silent service as \\"l.p.\\"--in loco parentis--to her children. And in fact he seems better able to control Damia than her parents are, instilling control and manners in her and keeping her from becoming the overbearing tyrant that an unchecked psychic could all too easily be. Yet even Afra can't keep her from the pains of emotional isolation that are her legacy from her mother. At barely 18 she's assigned to Iota Aurigae, the latest of Earth's colonies, when she receives a telepathic message from an entity calling itself Sodan. Against the advice of Afra and her beloved younger brother Larak, she seeks closer contact with it and suffers a devastating trauma when she learns the truth about the being she has almost fallen in love with. But it's an ill wind that blows no good, as both she and Afra discover in trying to console each other that they are as truly mind-mates as ever Jeff and the Rowan were. Then a series of strange dreams begin to trouble her nights, leading to a First Contact with yet another alien species which may prove to be valuable allies against the still-threatening Beetles.McCaffrey's skilfull throwaway makes her future seem very real: though humanity has been in space probably no more than a couple of centuries, we learn early on (and very casually) that several of the colonies' environments have caused rather radical mutations in their people, as for example Afra's native Capella, where the people have a \\"slightly greenish\\" skin tone. She also has, as a mother, a good understanding of how children grow and develop, and has extrapolated from her own experience to paint a convincing picture of what a powerful telepath/teleport/telekinetic's infancy and childhood might be like. One thoroughly delightful aspect of the story are the \\"Coonies,\\" favorite pets at the Towers, which are described as cats but share many traits with raccoons (the one on the front cover actually looks most like a red panda). Another thing I particularly like is the new first names she invents for many of her characters, keeping in mind that in the 23rd century there will certainly be many that are strange to us, just as we in the 20th and 21st centuries have many that were unknown in the 17th and 18th. Like the preceding volume, this one has elements of both romance and science fiction, but is sufficiently non-gooey to suit those who think the former is a waste of time."},{"Title":"Damia","review":"This was the first Anne McCaffrey book I ever picked up, and I loved it! Ten years after I'd originally read it, I sought it out and re-read it, and I enjoyed it just as much as I had the first time. The characters are completely believable, and one can sympathize with them quite easily. I would recommend starting with The Rowan (the first book in the series), but Damia is also a good stand-alone novel.McCaffrey's mastery of characters is evident, and she weaves a rich environment for them. This is one of those books I didn't want to be ejected from on the last page, I just wanted to stay immersed in the fantasy and see how the characters developped further. Definitely high on my list of fantasy favorites."},{"Title":"Damia","review":"This book first tells the story of Afra, who we met in The Rowan, and then goes on to tell Damia's story. I don't think that this book has the same plot as The Rowan at all, although there are a few similarities. If you were intrigued by Afra in the first book, you'll love him in this book. It was wonderful to find out more about him. Damia's childhood makes for an entertaining read, moreso, I think than the Rowan's. However, the Rowan was much more mature as a teenager and young woman than Damia. Teenage Damia is spoiled and annoying, and it's a wonder Afra could ever put up with her. That was one of the reasons I gave this book a four instead of a five. The other reason is that the whole Damia and Afra relationship seemed very strange. Afra never seemed to be very upset by the fact that he was falling in love with the same person he used to babysit. However, in spite of those two things, I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Damia","review":"This book is great!Reading about Rowan and how her children grew up is really interesting.Reading about Afra's childhood and his life afterwards,as a work partner with Rowan,is captivating,and makes one identify with him in all he went through.Damia's childhood fit in very well with Afra's story(or maybe I should say it the other way around),and the life and adventures of Damia hold one's attention.Damia's quick and painful maturity leads into a whole new story,both personally for her and for the humans of the Nine Star League.(I am not giving away the plot!)All in all,a great book about the heroes and their relationships.Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Damia","review":"I purcahsed the audio book through audible.com. The narrator did a great job, good character differentiation, inflection and pacing. Even the few animal noises were done well. :)I found this book an enjoyable listen, and I've read it before in paperback form. Both times, I was not dissatisfied, but both times I was a little bored. I read the book because there are a few key things that happen, and its part of the series as a whole. But, it could have honestly be about half the length. There is so much that doesn't pertain to the plot at all, through the point of view of characters who aren't really the main focus of the plot. All that, I could have done without. When reading the paperback, I skipped much of it. On the audio version, I did use the fast forward a few time, through parts that lagged on and on without real purpose. Like the recovery phase, yes, there is an important relationship development here, but I don't need thirty minutes of listeing to these two take walks and stare at each other googoo eyed. Or most of the begining with Afra's history. It could have been summed up in a few paragraphs. I must have listened to an hour and a half of Afra and his childfood and his upbringing and his career choice . . . And Damia herself, yes I got to see how she starts out and matures, but I didn't really need hours of it either. In the end, when we finally get to the climax of the book, and meet the aliens, the whole thing is seriously over in twenty minutes. I listened through the while rest of the book for about a half an hour of really pertinent information.SPOILER-------------------------------------------------------------------------And finally, I found the main romance development a little creepy. And, I don't have anything against a 25 year age difference. What creeped me out, was that the guy basically raised the girl from a baby. Seriously. That romantic and sensual feelings should develope out of a uncle/father figure and the girl just struck me wrong. And the girl's parent's were far more accepting than I found beleivable."},{"Title":"Damia","review":"I give it to Anne for her wonderful ability to weave such a beautiful and detailed story of one girl, the daughter of the most influencial and powerful psionics in the terran galaxy, into something that captures the readers attention like no other. Damia is a beautiful character, both in soul, and apparently in body. It is hard not read this and not feel the rebel inside you again as Damia begins her childish exploits, or not feel the ache of parenthood wrenching upon you as you see the point of view of Afra. As if the magic doesn't end, Anne spins a furious web with the way she handles the love in the novel.....it is hard not to feel part of this novel......it's awakening."},{"Title":"Damia","review":"I found this to be disappointing as sequels go mainly for what it did for the other characters in the novel. It is very hard to believe that the extremely strong-willed (and very maternal) Rowan would have shipped her older children off to be raised by their grandmother. It is also find unlikely that Damia's parents would so readily accept her relationship with a man old enough to be her father regardless of their friendship with said person. Basically an OK novel but not one of her best."},{"Title":"Damia","review":"The Lyon family of &quot;methody&quot; Capella are Talented folk. This means that they possess telepathic and telekinetic abilities in varying degrees and combinations, although none has the power of a &quot;Prime.&quot; Young Afra chafes under the emotional repression and strict propriety of his home-world, and delights in his beloved older sister Goswina's brief apprenticeship to the Rowan - the most powerful Prime Talent known to FT&amp;T.As a young man, Afra has his own chance to work with the Rowan. He and that lonely woman strike up a rare and wonderful friendship, destined to endure throughout their lifetimes. But romance isn't part of their synergy, and both yearn to find it with other partners. Which the Rowan does, eventually, with an equally powerful but untrained telepath from Deneb: Jeff Raven. Whom she marries, and partners with when FT&amp;T's &quot;Talents&quot; are the only viable defense against an alien invasion.The Rowan and Jeff Raven produce a family of Talented children, including a daughter named Damia. From childhood, this third in their brood proves herself the most Talented human yet born. She's also temperamental, strong-willed, and unpredictable; and the most important person in her life, from its earliest hours, proves to be her mother's friend and colleague Afra.Although this book includes some thrilling passages of interstellar conflict carried out by telepathic and telekinetic means, the romance of Damia Gwyn-Raven and Afra Lyon forms its heart and occupies most of its pages. I'm not quite sure how I feel about this romance. The author handles Afra's transition from parental figure to suitor in Damia's life well enough, and there is certainly nothing wrong with a grown woman (even a rather young one) choosing to marry an older man. Nevertheless I came away with residual discomfort, because even McCaffrey couldn't quite convince me that this close friend of Damia's mother (in an emotional sense, her uncle) had any business sharing her bed.I loved the &quot;coonies&quot; and the Barque Cats, though! And since I've read the rest of the Talent series already, I know that Damia and Afra's marriage is destined to mature into a genuine and healthy partnership. So I would advise other readers to be forewarned that &quot;Damia&quot; may disturb them a little, but I recommend it just the same."},{"Title":"Damia","review":"I noticed the rather scathing review from Kirkus (above), and have note the complaints about plot, etc. I especially agree with the &quot;token monster&quot; comment one of the reviwers made. However, DAMIA should be understood as not so much hard-core sci-fi, but panders to a totally different market niche. It is very feel-good, and very enjoyable feel-good, by the way. It focuses very much on relationships, family, power and privilage. The FT&amp;T universe is fun, even if improbable at this point in time (and I mean imprabable in the sci-fi sense - that is, mind power is not within the 'probable' spectrum that serious sci-fi writers pick from). Depending on what you are looking for though, DAMIA, and the other books in this series can be very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Damia","review":"I have read may books by Anne McCaffrey and I thought that the &quot;Rowan&quot; series is one of the best yet besides the &quot;Dragonriders of Pern&quot; series. This series has the potential to be in the same league as Dragonriders. Lots of action and the story keeps you going."},{"Title":"Damia","review":"Yet another McCaffrey book where I just fall in love with the characters and identify with their desires and dreams, in spite of the fantasy/sci fi elements. Beautifully written scenes between characters, building tension between them over the years, with tear-wrenching scenes and resolutions, both happy and sad. And as always, McCaffrey weaves her wonderful sense of humor and her sensuality throughout the story and characters."},{"Title":"Damia","review":"Out of all McCaffery's works, this is the crowning jewel of her collection. I especially like the scenes of Damia as a bright and adventurous baby. I wish McCaffrey would concentrate on writing more FT&amp;T series because they have a lot more undiscovered potential while her Pern series seems played out."},{"Title":"Damia","review":"This is a very realistic book. With each chapter the Damia got more real. I am a McCaffery fan and out of all her books the &quot;Rowan&quot; seires is the most real and the most interesting."},{"Title":"Damia","review":"I am a big fan of McCaffrey's work. I have read all the Dragonrider books, the Crystal Singer's trilogy, Acorna, the first two of the Freedom series, and both THe Rowan and Damia. I believe that Damia holds a certain charm that is reflected in all of the books she has written. It holds enough action to hold the reader and a subtle romance. The book when it focases on Afra shows that the tight fisted second in command of Calisto station is fully capable of loving. It also show that love knows no barriers. This means that even though Afra is near a quater of a century older than Damia they can love each other. I can't wait to read the last two of the series. So give this book a break."},{"Title":"Damia","review":"I LOVED the dragon rider series. 20 years ago I had read everything that McCaffery had ever written. Lately it seems like each McCaffery book I read is more of a disappointment than the last. This book is nearly identical to The Rowan. The plot is recycled. The characters are two dimensional. McCaffery doesn't put any effort into her writing anymore."},{"Title":"Damia","review":"I read damia and I thought that it was absolutely GREAT. It made me want to go out and get the other books of this series. It's very delightful and great for people of maturity that understand things, for this book has great details that a 4th or 5th grader would not understand."},{"Title":"Damia","review":"I find that Damia is a sexy look at a talented young prime with a more vivacious way to look at life. I enjoyed the book very much and give it an 8 out of 10. Thanks!!!!!"},{"Title":"Damia","review":"Again, McCaffrey has written a marvelous new series. I have read her whole Pern series and loved it. Now this! Its just perfect! The characters are so realistic! I recomend this series a thousand times!!"},{"Title":"Damia","review":"SHe takes the story of The Rowan and entertines it with Damia. Although the times are different, Damia and her mother are alike in many ways and shares the lonlyness of runmimg a tower. And once Damia and Afra start dreaming with the Dinis, the pages practaclly turn themselves."},{"Title":"Damia","review":"Anne McCaffrey travels back into the world of Talented individuals, begun in &quot;To Ride Pegasus&quot;. &quot;The Rowan&quot; marked the beginning of a series of books about one extremely talented family. &quot;Damia&quot;, the second book, looks at one of the Rowan's children, the beautiful and powerful Damia. Damia falls into many misadventures, as any normal kid who could do stuff with her mind would, but matures into a brilliant young lady.&quot;Damia&quot; has everything a good Anne McCaffrey book has--suspense, drama, a beautiful heroine, and love. I highly recommmend this book to any Anne McCaffrey fan."},{"Title":"Damia","review":"The next generation of the Rowans family.Can talent be spread gerationally? You willhave to read this book and find out for yourself."},{"Title":"Damia","review":"Loved it. Just bought the next book in the series. Ten more words are required for me to post this."},{"Title":"Damia","review":"I have been an Anne McCaffrey (and Todd McCaffrey) fan for many years. It is interesting to come into closer contact with them with this book."},{"Title":"Damia","review":"I like almost everything Ann does and this is no exception. This fleshes out a multi generational family so well it is hard to put down, and you feel you really know the characters. It also creates a rather unusual universe using her favorite tactic of mind powers, but in a different and more potent form than her popular dragon series. I bought this book from one of the Amazon used book merchants and got great service there, as well."},{"Title":"Damia","review":"Great book from a great series by a great author. She writes in a clear style that draws you in with intriguing story lines and appealing characters."},{"Title":"Damia","review":"I believe that this book is one of a kind. Very rarely do we find the second book of a trilogy with equal (if not greater) quality. Anne McAffery not only tells us about descendants of the great and powerful Rowan, but of one of the charachters that we hardly knew anything about, Afra."},{"Title":"Damia","review":"This book it just basically a retelling of part of the Rowan with a bit of love and the token monster thrown in at the end. If you like romance,you'd like this book, but personally I think it dosen't hold up to the 'Dragonrider' series."},{"Title":"PICTORIAL ANATOMY OF THE CAT: REVISED EDITION","review":"I am a graduate teaching assistant at Old Dominion University and we use this book extensively as a reference for muscles and blood vessels. The drawings are very accurate and the text is easy to read and flows well from a dissector's viewpoint. In addition, there are simplified \\"road-map\\" type sketches to aid in understanding the branching patterns of the major blood vessels. This \\"catlas\\" has proven to be quite indispensable for our purposes."},{"Title":"PICTORIAL ANATOMY OF THE CAT: REVISED EDITION","review":"This lab dissection guide was written over 40 years ago, but it is still the single best guide to cat anatomy. Cats haven't changed, but modern textbook manufacturers think that their thick glossy expensive books are more appealing to today's students. They are wrong. This simple guide is filled with beautiful hand drawn illustrations that are more helpful than any photograph. I only wish it was spiral bound so I could leave it open flat while dissecting. Check out Gilbert's guide to the dogfish anatomy as well. Together they make a great set of manuals for any comparative anatomy course."},{"Title":"PICTORIAL ANATOMY OF THE CAT: REVISED EDITION","review":"I am an anatomy and physiology professor who purchased this book as my own reference!
