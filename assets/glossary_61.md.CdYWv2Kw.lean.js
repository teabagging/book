These  special task forces,  organized by Heinrich Himmler to follow the German army as it advanced into eastern Poland and Russia, were the agents of the first phase of the Final Solution. They murdered more than 1.5 million men, women, and children between 1941 and 1943, often by shooting them into killing pits, as at Babi Yar. These massive crimes have been generally overlooked or underestimated by Holocaust historians, who have focused on the gas chambers. In this painstaking account, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Richard Rhodes profiles the eastern campaign s architects as well as its  ordinary  soldiers and policemen, and helps us understand how such men were conditioned to carry out mass murder. Marshaling a vast array of documents and the testimony of perpetrators and survivors, this book is an essential contribution to our understanding of the Holocaust and World War II.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SAQ94hR-YxQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hilarity of Community: Romans 12 and How to Be the Church","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Workers Write!

Japan's neutrality had enabled Stalin to move Far Eastern forces to the German front where they contributed significantly to Soviet victories from Moscow to Berlin. Slavinsky suggests that Stalin's agreement with Churchill and Roosevelt to attack Japan after Germany's surrender allowed him to keep Japan in the war until he was ready to attack and thus avenge Russia's defeat in the war of 1904-1905. The Soviet Union's violation of the pact and the detention of Japanese prisoners for up to ten years after the end of the war created a sense of victimization in Japan to the extent that there is still no formal Peace Treaty between the two countries to this day. Slavinsky draws on recently opened Russian archival material to demonstrate that the Soviet Union was passing information about the Allies to Japan during the Second World War. He also persuasively argues that vengeance and the (re)acquistion of land were the primary motives for the attack on Japan. The book contains empirical data previously unavailable in English and will fascinate anyone with an interest in the history of Japan, the Soviet Union and the events of the Second World War.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rddhxSKGQ9oC&dq=Japanese-Soviet+Neutrality+Pact+(Nissan+Institute/Routledge+Japanese+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Weather the Cuckoo Likes (Over the Edge Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Fr2cAAAACAAJ&dq=Weather+the+Cuckoo+Likes+(Over+the+Edge+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pocket PC Handbook","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Planned Society,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Concepts of the True Position Dimensioning System","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dilmun and its Gulf Neighbours","description":"A scholarly account of the archaeology of the Arabian Gulf from c.4500-1500 BC.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2BevKadehakC&dq=Dilmun+and+its+Gulf+Neighbours&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"North Carolina: Facts and Symbols (The States and Their Symbols)","description":"Presents information about the state of North Carolina, its nickname, flag, motto, and emblems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zmtytAMBtUYC&dq=North+Carolina:+Facts+and+Symbols+(The+States+and+Their+Symbols)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Henry David Thoreau: American Naturalist, Writer, And Transcendentalist (The Library of American Thinkers)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Test of Time","description":"An eccentric writer is finishing a manuscript about a rebellious boy named Huck when it suddenly disappears and in its place appears a strange contraption--a college student's laptop that has traveled through time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yXBjtHrHcDwC&dq=Test+of+Time&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Son of the Martini Cookbook","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Eisenstaedt: Remembrances","description":"A collection of work by the legendary American photographer presents photographs dating from his life in Germany in the 1930s, through his long career with \\"Life\\" magazine","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gBtrQgAACAAJ&dq=Eisenstaedt:+Remembrances&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Movement","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y4M8rgEACAAJ&dq=The+Movement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Uncle Arthur's Bible book: Seventy-one choice stories from the world's best book","description":"Copy 1.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HjFqcgAACAAJ&dq=Uncle+Arthur%27s+Bible+book:+Seventy-one+choice+stories+from+the+world%27s+best+book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cyber Spying Tracking Your Family's (Sometimes) Secret Online Lives","description":"Cyber Spying Tracking Your Family's (Sometimes) Secret Online Lives shows everyday computer users how to become cyber-sleuths.

No matter where you live, what job you hold, or what industry you work in, you wake up every morning with a blank slate and you can make your business and your life anything you choose!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UykFAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Fred+Factor:+Every+Person%27s+Guide+to+Making+the+Ordinary+Extraordinary!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"79 PARK AVENUE","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sibling reveries","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Let's Review Math B","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"After The Beginning: A Cosmic Journey Through Space And Time","description":"\\"In a brilliant flash about fourteen billion years ago, time and matter were born in a single instant of creation.

This collection covers a huge range of topics, featuring nearly ninety of the discipline's most widely read works. TheReader's90 extracts are designed to introduce the major issues and debates in the field of post-colonial literary studies. This field itself, however, has become so varied that no collection of readings could encompass every voice which is now giving itself the name \\"post-colonial.\\" The editors, in order to avoid a volume which is simply a critical canon, have selected works representing arguments with which they do not necessarily agree, but rather which above all stimulate discussion, thought and further exploration. Post-colonial \\"theory\\" has occurred in all societies into which the imperial force of Europe has intruded, though not always in the official form oftheoretical text. Like the description of any other field the term has come to mean many things, but this volume hinges on one incontestable phenomenon: the \\"historical fact\\"of colonialism, and the palpable consequences to which this phenomenon gave rise. The topic involves talk about experience of various kinds: migration, slavery, suppression, resistance, representation, difference, race, gender, place, and reaction to the European influence, and about the fundamental experiences of speaking and writing by which all these come into being. In compiling this reader, the editors have sought to stimulate people to ask: \\"How might a genuinely post-colonial literary enterprise proceed?\\" The fourteen sections include: Issues and Debates; Universality and Difference; Textual Representation and Resistance; Postmodernism and Post-Colonialism; Nationalism; Hybridity; Ethnicity and Indigenity; Feminism and Post-Colonialism; Language; The Body and Performance; History; Place; Education; and Production andConsumption. Contributors include many of the leading post-colonial theorists and critics--such as Franz Fanon, Chinua Achebe, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Homi Bhabba, Derek Walcott, Edward Said, and Trinh T. Minh-ha--in addition to a number of the discourse's newer voices.The Post-Colonial Studies Readerwill prove an authoritative compilation, representing an invaluable contribution to the study of post-colonial theory and criticism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PuJJSvnNwSYC&dq=The+Post-Colonial+Studies+Reader&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good Mousekeeping - A Parody (Cat Humor)","description":"A feline spoof of Good Housekeeping includes such zany articles as Garfield's \\"Up Close and Purrsonal,\\" \\"At Home with Mouser Stewart,\\" Morris the cat's account of his rise to fame and fortune, and \\"Cats Who Ignore Women and the Women Who Love Them.\\" Original. 100,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jhINAAAACAAJ&dq=Good+Mousekeeping+-+A+Parody+(Cat+Humor)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Flowers of the Field","description":"The million copy internationally bestselling novel of one family and the devastating effects of the First World War.

Containing music and text of 201 carols, many in more than one setting, the book is organized in two sections: composed carols, ranging from medieval Gregorian chants to modern compositions, and folk carols, including not only traditional Anglo-American songs but Irish, Welsh, German, Czech, Polish, French, Basque, Catalan, Sicilian, and West Indian songs as well. Each carol is set in four-part harmony, with lyrics in both the original language and English. Accompanying each song are detailed scholarly notes on the history of the carol and on performance of the setting presented. The introduction to the volume offers a general history of carols and caroling, and appendices provide scholarly essays on such topics as fifteenth-century pronunciation, English country and United States primitive traditions, and the revival of the English folk carol. The Oxford Book of Carols, published in 1928, is still one of Oxford's best-loved books among scholars, church choristers, and the vast number of people who enjoy singing carols. This volume is not intended to replace this classic but to supplement it. Reflecting significant developments in musicology over the past sixty years, it embodies a radical reappraisal of the repertory and a fresh approach to it. The wealth of information it contains will make it essential for musicologists and other scholars, while the beauty of the carols themselves will enchant general readers and amateur songsters alike.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hksJAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+New+Oxford+Book+of+Carols&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Signature Classics - Great Expectations (Signature Classics Series)","description":"One of the finest novels by iconic British author Charles Dickens, this Victorian tale follows the good-natured orphan Pip as he makes his way through life.

It's a story of intrigue, lying, timing, friendships made and broken along with costly arousing outbursts, all based on extensive and detailed research.David Young is a practicing physician in Holland, Michigan. He grew up in East Lansing. While attending Notre Dame in the mid 1970s, his next door neighbor, Jack Breslin, shared a story with him about the special relationship between Michigan State and the University of Notre Dame. The 1946 Spartan graduate and executive vice president of MSU noted that the Irish administration had played a prominent role in Michigan State College's evolution into a major land-grant research institution. It all had to do with aiding a Spartan application for membership in the \\"Western Conference\\" during the late 1940s. Mr. Breslin also offered comment on the University of Michigan's role in that transition. Unfortunately, while walking back to the Yardboy to finish mowing his lawn, those words were muffled by the idling engine. \\"And if Michigan had its way....\\"Three decades later, Dr. Young decided to investigate what his alma mater did to assist Michigan State's grand vision as crafted by a far-sighted president. He also wanted to find out what Breslin intended to say about the Wolverine's involvement in the application process. What he discovered, hidden within the stacks of 13 university archives, has now dispelled a popular myth. In its place, the amateur historian reveals the true story--an extensively cited account of John Hannah's quest for membership in the Big Nine and Michigan Law Professor Ralph Aigler's obsession with impeding that relentless pursuit. Intertwined in the complex tale are the fascinating roles played by two commissioners as well as various leaders at Minnesota, Ohio State, Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Northwestern, Purdue, Pittsburgh and the University of Chicago.Though this account focuses on a unique intrastate rivalry, the book remains a must read for anyone interested in the evolution of the modern game of college football. And for alumni/fans of the many schools involved with either aiding or hindering Hannah's quest, the story will explore what now appears to be a very controversial decision in May of 1949 to accept Michigan State College into the Western Conference.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DSOmuAAACAAJ&dq=Arrogance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens Creative American Quilting","description":"As always, Better Homes and Gardens offers the most up-to-date, accurate information on their topics covered.

Monsoon Diary is populated with characters like Raju, the milkman who named his cows after his wives; the iron-man who daily set up shop in Narayan s front yard, picking up red-hot coals with his bare hands; her mercurial grandparents and inventive parents. Narayan illumines Indian customs while commenting on American culture from the vantage point of the sympathetic outsider. Her characters, like Narayan herself, have a thing or two to say about cooking and about life. In this creative and intimate work, Narayan s considerable vegetarian cooking talents are matched by stories as varied as Indian spices at times pungent, mellow, piquant, and sweet. Tantalizing recipes for potato masala, dosa, and coconut chutney, among others, emerge from Narayan s absorbing tales about food and the solemn and quirky customs that surround it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=X2r0OCDouCgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Animal Farm","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Underworld (Nexus)","description":"Part - I: Looking Back","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ENqDmiSAPAwC&dq=Underworld+(Nexus)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pageant of Europe: sources and selections from the Renaissance to the present day","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vnOFswEACAAJ&dq=Pageant+of+Europe:+sources+and+selections+from+the+Renaissance+to+the+present+day&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Social Management of Genetic Engineering","description":"First published in 1998, this volume why and how genetic engineering has emerged as the technology most likely to change our lives, for better or worse, in the opening century of the third millennium.

Featured here are gems by once-popular but now-forgotten 19th-century masters of the supernatural like Amelia Edwards, Barry Pain, and Florence Marryat, alongside contributions by totally obscure authors like James Skipp Borlase, a writer of penny dreadfuls who specialized in lurid Christmas horror stories, and Harry Grattan, who made history by writing the first ghost story recorded by Edison for the phonograph. Also included are an introduction and bonus materials, such as 19th-century news articles and advertisements related to Christmas ghosts. \\"I endeavoured to call out; I could not utter a sound.

Broussard argues, the liberal, progressive image of San Francisco was largely a facade. In this book, he challenges the rhetoric of progress and opportunity with evidence of the reality of inequality and shows how black San Franciscans struggled for equality in the same manner as their counterparts in the Midwest and East. Understanding the texture of the racial caste system in the city prior to 1954, he contends, is critical to understanding why blacks made so little progress in employment, housing, and politics despite the absence of segregation laws. Reconstructing the plight of San Francisco's black citizens, Broussard reveals a population that, despite its small size before 1940, did not accept second-class citizenship passively yet remained nonviolent into the 1960s. He also shows how World War II and the defense industry brought thousands of southern black migrants to the bay area. Ultimately, he demonstrates, these newcomers and native black residents formed coalitions with white liberals to attack racial inequality more vigorously and successfully than at any previous time in San Francisco's history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jgwVAAAAYAAJ&dq=San+Francisco+Black&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Words of Selves: Identification, Solidarity, Irony (Atopia: Philosophy, Political Theory, Ae)","description":"Marlene Dietrich had the last line in Orson Welles s A Touch of Evil:  What does it matter what you say about other people?  The author ponders the question: What does it matter what you say about yourself? She wonders why the requirement to be a something-or-other should be so hard to satisfy in a manner that rings true in the ears of its own subject. She decides that some hesitations and awkwardness in inhabiting many categories of the person including those celebrated by what is sometimes termed identity politics need not evidence either psychological weakness or political lack of nerve. Neither an  identity  nor a  nonidentity  can quite convince. But if this discomfort inhering in self-characterization needs to be fully admitted and registered as something that is simultaneously linguistic and affective it can also be cheerfully tolerated. Here language is not treated as a guileful thing that leads its speakers astray. Though the business of being called something, and of being positioned by that calling, is often an unhappy affair, irony can offer effective therapy. Even if uncertain and volatile categorizations do trouble the politics that they also shape, they hardly weaken the empathetic solidarity that is distinct from identification. The verbal irony of self-presentation can be politically helpful. Questioning the received diction of the self cannot be dismissed merely as a luxury of those in secure positions, but instead can move toward a conception of a constructive nonidentity. This extended meditation on the language of the self within contemporary social politics also considers the lyrical  I  and linguistic emotionality, the historical status of irony, and the possibilities of a nonidentitarian solidarity that is unapologetically alert to the affect of language.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8xOAkQwIOsIC&dq=The+Words+of+Selves:+Identification,+Solidarity,+Irony+(Atopia:+Philosophy,+Political+Theory,+Ae)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Betsy-Tacy and Tib,","description":"The first four books in the beloved Betsy-Tacy series are ready to delight a new generation ofreaders and to bring a grownup generation of readers back to the engrossingstories of their youth.

Lord Chaitanya transformed the face of India in four respects: philosophically, by encountering, defeating and converting the greatest philosophers and thinkers of His day; religiously, by organizing the largest, most widespread theistic movement in India's history; socially, by His strong challenges to the religious inequities of the caste system; politically, by His organization of a massive civil disobedience movement in Bengal, more than four centuries before Gandhi.

Authors come from a variety of backgrounds and perspectives, though all affirm the inerrancy and inspiration of Scripture. United in their high view of Scripture, and in their belief in the underlying unity of Scripture, which is ultimately grounded in the unity of God himself, each author explores the contribution of a given book or group of books to the theology of Scripture as a whole. While conceived as stand-alone volumes, each volume thus also makes a contribution to the larger whole. All volumes provide a discussion of introductory matters, including the historical setting and the literary structure of a given book of Scripture. Also included is an exegetical treatment of all the relevant passages in succinct commentary-style format. The biblical theology approach of the series will also inform and play a role in the commentary proper. The commentator permits a discussion between the commentary proper and the biblical theology that it reflects by a series of cross-references. The major contribution of each volume, however, is a thorough discussion of the most important themes of the biblical book in relation to the canon as a whole. This format allows each contributor to ground Biblical Theology, as is proper, in an appropriate appraisal of the relevant historical and literary features of a particular book in Scripture while at the same time focusing on its major theological contribution to the entire Christian canon in the context of the larger salvation-historical metanarrative of Scripture. Within this overall format, there will be room for each individual contributor to explore the major themes of his or her particular corpus in the way he or she sees most appropriate for the material under consideration. This format, in itself, would already be a valuable contribution to Biblical Theology. But there are other series that try to accomplish a survey of the Bible's theology as well. What distinguishes the present series is its orientation toward Christian proclamation. This is the Biblical Theologyfor Christian Proclamation commentary series! As a result, the ultimate purpose of this set of volumes is not exclusively, or even primarily, academic. Rather, we seek to relate Biblical Theology to our own lives and to the life of the church. Our desire is to equip those in Christian ministry who are called by God to preach and teach the precious truths of Scripture to their congregations, both in North America and in a global context. It is our hope and our prayer that the 40 volumes of this series, once completed, will bear witness to the unity in diversity of the canon of Scripture as they probe the individual contributions of each of its 66 books. The authors and editors are united in their desire that in so doing the series will magnify the name of Christ and bring glory to the triune God who revealed himself in Scripture so that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved to the glory of God the Father and his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, under the illumination of the Holy Spirit, and for the good of his church. To God alone be the glory: soli Deo gloria. In his volume on Hebrews, Thomas R. Schreiner says, \\"The words of Jesus on the cross, 'it is finished' (John 19:30) capture the theology of Hebrews. \\"My aim in this commentary is to focus on the biblical theology of the letter. The emphasis on biblical theology shows up especially in the introduction and conclusion where theological structures and themes are considered. In the introduction I will examine four different structures that are woven into the entire letter: 1) promise/fulfillment; 2) eschatology; 3) typology; and 4) spatial orientation (which can also be described as the relationship between heaven and earth i","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GgEgBgAAQBAJ&dq=Hebrews+(Focus+on+the+Bible+Commentaries+Ser)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Utopia Guide to Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar & Vietnam: the Gay and Lesbian Scene in Southeast Asia Including Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City & Angkor","description":"The updated and expanded 2nd Edition of the Utopia Guide to Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar & Vietnam offers a remarkable insider's glimpse at the gay and lesbian scene in 18 cities including Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City/Saigon, Vientiane, Luang Prabang, Yangon/Rangoon, Phnom Penh, and Angkor Wat/Siem Reap.

From systems analysis to reconnaissance satellites to think tanks, these innovations did not remain exclusive accessories of the defense establishment. Instead, they readily found civilian applications in both the private and public sector. City planning and management were no exception. Jennifer Light argues that the technologies and values of the Cold War fundamentally shaped the history of postwar urban America. From Warfare to Welfare documents how American intellectuals, city leaders, and the federal government chose to attack problems in the nation's cities by borrowing techniques and technologies first designed for military engagement with foreign enemies. Experiments in urban problem solving adapted the expertise of defense professionals to face new threats: urban chaos, blight, and social unrest. Tracing the transfer of innovations from military to city planning and management, Light reveals how a continuing source of inspiration for American city administrators lay in the nation's preparations for war.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Tc1fcJ8m_Q8C&dq=From+Warfare+to+Welfare:+Defense+Intellectuals+and+Urban+Problems+in+Cold+War+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The No Diet Diet: Healthy Meals in 5 Minutes","description":"Spiral bound book, easy to flip, easy to use.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lnkXAAAACAAJ&dq=The+No+Diet+Diet:+Healthy+Meals+in+5+Minutes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Recollections of President Lincoln and his administration","description":"Recollections of L.E.

Forsyth","description":"George A. Forsyth took a determined stand against Sioux and Cheyenne Indians at the Battle of Beech Island in 1868 and in the process transformed this minor frontier skirmish into a legendary symbol of the American West. This engagement helped mold popular conception of Indian warfare and provided Forsyth with the reputation of being an intrepid Indian fighter like George Custer and Buffalo Bill. Although this image of Forsyth is not necessarily incorrect, it is certainly incomplete. Forsyth began his military career with the firing on Fort Sumter in 1861. Like many other officers who would subsequently gain distinction in the Indian campaign of the West, he learned the art of warfare in the great battles of the Civil War. His ascendancy through the ranks paralleled the rise of the Union cavalry as an effective combat arm during the war, and his education as a cavalryman came under the watchful eye of Phil Sheridan, one of America's most compelling soldiers. The Forsyth-Sheridan relationship began on the Virginia battlefields and continued until 1881. During this long period George Forsyth was one of Sheridan's most trusted aides, serving as the general's eyes and ears in countless military missions that took him from the banks of the Yellowstone to the sacred Black Hills and from the bayous of Reconstruction Louisiana to the palaces of Europe and Asia. Forsyth's varied military career was truly reflective of the army's role in the second half of the nineteenth century. In addition to serving as an instrument of government Indian policy, the army carried out other important missions designed to foster internal development in the United States. These activities included exploring and mapping the remnants of the uncharted West: escorting railroad survey and construction crews and building forts along the major lines of commerce. As a staff officer, George Forsyth played an important part in all of these activities and more. Therefore, while this biography chronicles the life and military career of a remarkable soldier, it also provides fresh insight into the role that the United States Army played during the post-Civil War period.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AohoktJT5qAC&dq=Hero+of+Beecher+Island:+The+Life+and+Military+Career+of+George+A.+Forsyth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I am also a you;: A book of thoughts with photographs","description":"Collection of photographs and quotations on themes such as peace and truth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9hQ5AQAAIAAJ&dq=I+am+also+a+you%3B:+A+book+of+thoughts+with+photographs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Get Out of Bed!","description":"What will get sleepy Amy out of bed?

It analyzes a number of fast-moving trends in the behaviors of national taxation authorities, web-based companies, VoiP, certain low-tax (or no-tax) jurisdictions, and international organizations that have significant bearing on the future development of the taxation of e-commerce. These trends include the following: how United States domestic and international tax rules are being interpreted in the effort to accommodate e-commerce; the powerful retailers' lobby against the moratorium on U.S. state and local sales tax on Internet transactions; how VAT rules in EU countries and other jurisdictions are being restructured to accommodate international e-commerce; new theories of income and payment characterization, and in particular the influential OECD ongoing study; and the crucial discussion over what constitutes a permanent establishment for tax purposes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TQl0QgAACAAJ&dq=Electronic+Commerce+and+International+Taxation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Legal Landmines in E-Commerce","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=E2LqAAAACAAJ&dq=Legal+Landmines+in+E-Commerce&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Against Democracy and Equality (American University Studies Series X, Political Science)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Don't Look Back","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Diana: A Commemorative Biography","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Thaddeus Stevens: Scourge of the South","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Deadly Appearances (Joanne Kilbourn Mysteries)","description":"Andy Boychuk is a successful Saskatchewan politician  until one sweltering August afternoon when the party faithful gather at a picnic.

Here is an extensively revised edition of the acclaimed translations of Edmund Keeley and Philip Sherrard, which capture Cavafy's mixture of formal and idiomatic use of language and preserve the immediacy of his frank treatment of homosexual themes, his brilliant re-creation of history, and his astute political ironies. The resetting of the entire edition has permitted the translators to review each poem and to make alterations where appropriate. George Savidis has revised the notes according to his latest edition of the Greek text. About the first edition: \\"The best [English version] we are likely to see for some time.\\"--James Merrill, The New York Review of Books \\"[Keeley and Sherrard] have managed the miracle of capturing this elusive, inimitable, unforgettable voice. It is the most haunting voice I know in modern poetry.\\"--Walter Kaiser, The New Republic ?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1sJdkbffT0kC&dq=C.+P+Cavafy+Selected+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fonda, Johnstown & Gloversville Railroad, The (NY) (Images of America)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Catch This!: Going Deep With the NFL's Sharpest Weapon","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2wAizwEACAAJ&dq=Catch+This!:+Going+Deep+With+the+NFL%27s+Sharpest+Weapon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sleeping with the Devil: How Washington Sold Its Soul for Saudi Crude","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Themen neu 1, 2 CDs (Hoertexte)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qzBcDCVgCtEC&dq=Themen+neu+1,+2+CDs+(Hoertexte)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gay Skins: Class, Masculinity and Queer Appropriation (Sexual Politics)","description":"Since their birth in the late 1960 s as a working class subcultural response to what was seen as a feminised, bourgeois-hippy parent culture, the skinhead has since held a semi-mythological status amongst the UK s street tribes. But from the off, queer undercurrents inevitably ran through skinhead culture, as shaven heads, shiny DMs and tight Levis fed inevitably into fantasies and fetishes based around notions of ultra-masculinity. In this updated 1996 mini classic, Murray Healy looks into the myths and misapprehensions surrounding Gay Skins, exploring fascism, fetishism, class , sexuality and gender.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PWpvCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"WESTWARD EDEN","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Gracious Lily Affair","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iVeMngEACAAJ&dq=The+Gracious+Lily+Affair&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Promised Passion","description":"Raised among eleven boisterous brothers, Islaen MacRoth knows little of the ways of love, but an arranged marriage to a man sworn never to wed again teaches her much about passion","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yaQ5AAAACAAJ&dq=Promised+Passion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Well Logging in Nontechnical Language","description":"Those in the petroleum industry as well as secondary users in banking, geology, and related fields for the logs created of oil wells will find this a useful guide.

Beginning with setting up the boat, Davison takes you through your early sailing experiences and caring for your Laser. Developing your skills on all points of sailing, you will then be introduced to race tuning and racing itself. This is detailed for all three Laser rigs, including the new Mk2 Standard sail. Over 350 photographs show you exactly how it's done and 50 diagrams illustrate key boat parts, the different points of sailing and complex on-the-water scenarios with clarity. Whatever your background, your current level or the extent of your ambition, this book gives you all the tools you need to get out on the water and improve your Laser sailing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pNagswEACAAJ&dq=The+Laser+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Leviathan, or Man, Society, Civilisation and Barbarism.","description":"The New Leviathan, originally published in 1942, a few months before the author's death, is the book which R. G. Collingwood chose to write in preference to completing his life's work on the philosophy of history. It was occasioned by the Second World War and the threat which Nazism and Fascism constituted to civlization. The book draws upon many years of work in moral and political philosophy and attempts to establish the multiple and complex connections between the levels of consciousness, society, civilization, and barbarism. Collingwood argues that traditional social contract theory has failed to account for the continuing existence of the non-social community and its relation to the social community in the body politic. He is also critical of the tendency within ethics to confound right and duty. The publication of 120 pages of additional manuscript material in this revised edition demonstrates in more detail how Collingwood was determined to show that right and duty occupy different levels of rational practical consciousness. The additional writings also contain Collingwood's unequivocal rejection of relativism. David Boucher's introduction shows that The New Leviathan and The Idea of History are integrally related and that neither can be properly understood independently of the other. He is also concerned to show how many of Collingwood's ideas have a contemporary relevance, and that his ideas on barbarism are not so unusual as they might at first appear. 'A strange and fascinating book . . . The publication of this handsome new edition of The New Leviathan . . . is a welcome event.' Political Studies 'In his respectful and informative introduction David Boucher shows how The New Leviathan and the additional material appended to it fit in with Collingwood's thought as a whole.' History of Political Thought 'Throughout, the Introduction displays Boucher's usual mastery of the material, serious and probing approach, and judicious appraisal.'

As a result of this revolution our species spread and eventually replaced all existing archaic Homo species, ultimately leading to the superiority of modern humans. Or so we thought. As Clive Finlayson explains, the latest advances in genetics prove that there was significant interbreeding between Modern Humans and the Neanderthals. All non-Africans today carry some Neanderthal genes. We have also discovered aspects of Neanderthal behaviour that indicate that they were not cognitively inferior to modern humans, as we once thought, and in fact had their own rituals and art. Finlayson, who is at the forefront of this research, recounts the discoveries of his team, providing evidence that Neanderthals caught birds of prey, and used their feathers for symbolic purposes. There is also evidence that Neanderthals practised other forms of art, as the recently discovered engravings in Gorham's Cave Gibraltar indicate. Linking all the recent evidence, The Smart Neanderthal casts a new light on the Neanderthals and the 'Cognitive Revolution'. Finlayson argues that there was no revolution and, instead, modern behaviour arose gradually and independently among different populations of Modern Humans and Neanderthals. Some practices were even adopted by Modern Humans from the Neanderthals. Finlayson overturns classic narratives of human origins, and raises important questions about who we really are.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7hqJDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book of Reuben","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The rose and the ring;","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9jl5PwAACAAJ&dq=The+rose+and+the+ring%3B&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The scout riddle book: A collection of jokes and riddles related to scouting, camping, and hiking (Scout fun books)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Muslims in the Philippines","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1GVxAAAAMAAJ&dq=Muslims+in+the+Philippines&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DEEP WATERS Volume One","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Taproots: Where ideas are born","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"People Who Led To My Plays","description":"A revealing collection of words, memories and pictures-an autobiographical scrapbook--by an outstanding contemporary playwright.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nKkQZ7Ny4wEC&dq=People+Who+Led+To+My+Plays&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Theories of Human Learning: What the Old Woman Said","description":"Both a serious academic text and a delightful story, this book offers a clear, readable look at a full range of learning theories from behavioral to cognitive.

Fans raced to buy copies of their own, only to find out that the beautiful book didn't actually exist. However, since all of the letters referenced in the film did exist, we decided to publish this gorgeous keepsake ourselves. Love Letters of Great Men follows hot on the heels of the film and collects together some of history's most romantic letters from the private papers of Beethoven, Mark Twain, Mozart, and Lord Byron. For some of these great men, love is \\"a delicious poison\\" (William Congreve); for others, \\"a nice soft wife on a sofa with good fire, & books & music\\" (Charles Darwin). Love can scorch like the heat of the sun (Henry VIII), or penetrate the depths of one's heart like a cooling rain (Flaubert). Every shade of love is here, from the exquisite eloquence of Oscar Wilde and the simple devotion of Robert Browning, to the wonderfully modern misery of the Roman Pliny the Younger, losing himself in work to forget how much he misses his beloved wife, Calpurnia. Taken together, these letters show that perhaps men haven't changed all that much over the last 2,000 years--passion, jealousy, hope and longing still rule their hearts and minds. In an age of e-mail and texted \\"i luv u\\"s, this timeless and unique collection reminds us that nothing can compare to the simple joy of sitting down to read a letter from the one you love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1_ll1lXPY0MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Atlas of North American Railroads","description":"America's long romance with the train has been the subject of many books, but none has used contemporary maps to comprehensively illustrate the story.

Colorful and informative, the book covers a vast range of topics and offers an impressive array of types of railroad map, from the purely utilitarian to the gorgeously promotional. Nearly 400 old railroad maps, most in full color, plus many historical photos, brochures, and posters, combine to provide a new perspective on the North American railroad.

In Seven Against Thebes a royal family is cursed with self-destruction, in a remorseless tragedy that anticipates the grandeur of the later Oresteia. Suppliants portrays the wretched plight of the daughters of Danaus, fleeing from enforced marriage; as refugees they seek protection and must plead a moral and political case to gain it.

Davis Reader","description":"For three decades, Angela Y. Davis has written on liberation theory and democratic praxis. Challenging the foundations of mainstream discourse, her analyses of culture, gender, capital, and race have profoundly influenced democratic theory, antiracist feminism, critical studies and political struggles. Even for readers who primarily know her as a revolutionary of the late 1960s and early 1970s (or as a political icon for militant activism) she has greatly expanded the scope and range of social philosophy and political theory. Expanding critical theory, contemporary progressive theorists - engaged in justice struggles - will find their thought influenced by the liberation praxis of Angela Y. Davis. The Angela Y. Davis Reader presents eighteen essays from her writings and interviews which have appeared in If They Come in the Morning, Women, Race, and Class, Women, Culture, and Politics, and Black Women and the Blues as well as articles published in women's, ethnic/black studies and communist journals, and cultural studies anthologies.

For several months he drove the empty highways of Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and California, transfixed by the vastness of a country saturated with light and color and energized by the American cowboy mystique. Even in the twentieth century, it was a landscape that had lost none of its evocative, mythic power. This collection of lush, colorful photographs magnificently displays what Wenders' practiced eye sought out: dramatic and visually arresting images, haunting vistas, and the poetic dilapidation of a country touched by man but ruled by nature. An enlightening interview with the photographer reveals the many ways that Wenders, a European traveling in a distinctly American landscape, was both moved by and bemused by what he considers the heartland of the American Dream. It is this sensibility, along with Wenders enormous photographic talents, that lend this collection a unique quality, and that allow us to experience the West in a whole new, brilliantly colorful light.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Rxc5AQAAIAAJ&dq=Written+in+the+West&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cheiro's Language of the Hand: A Complete Practical Work on the Sciences of Cheirognomy and Cheiromancy, Containing the System, Rules, and Experience (Collector's library of the unknown)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mrs. McGinty's dead","description":"In Mrs. McGinty s Dead, one of Agatha Christie s most ingenious mysteries, the intrepid Hercule Poirot must look into the case of a brutally murdered landlady.

Then Kathleen is drugged and awakens to find herself in a cave with a man named Guerriro who claims to be the Jaguar Man. He warns her to leave before it's too late. When morning arrives, Kathleen's back in camp and convinces herself the man and the cave were only a dream. However, her guides find a jaguar's skull on a pole, which is the Jaguar Man's warning that to stay means death. The frightened natives abandon Kathleen. Stranded in a rainstorm that quickly escalates into a flood, Kathleen fights for her life. She's saved by a black jaguar and again finds herself in Guerriro's cave. But as the days pass, Kathleen begins to wonder if Guerriro, who is both her captor and her savior, is really cursed to live his life as a black jaguar by day and a man by night. All Kathleen knows for sure is that Guerriro's ensnared her heart, and she'll do anything she can to stay by his side, even if doing so means she must...Hold Onto the Night.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=44rOklcK5kMC&dq=Hold+Onto+the+Night&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Jewish Songbook: The Definitive Collection of Jewish Songs","description":"Religious Piano/Vocal/Guitar","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=znMWAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Jewish+Songbook:+The+Definitive+Collection+of+Jewish+Songs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Everything Giant Sudoku Book: Over 300 Puzzles with Instructions for Solving (Everything: Sports and Hobbies)","description":"Everything? puzzlemaster Charles Timmerman has put together an inspired new collection!

Bridget Lederle resides in the lighthouse she s tended since her father died. Here, on the rocky shore of Lake Suprior, she s alone with the bitter ignominy of her birth, the shame of her love child s death, and the ghost of a mother she never really knew... That all changes on the wintry night she rescues a mysterious, charismatic stranger whose boat is nearly dashed upon the rocks. After she s nursed him back to health, he tells her a fantastical tale...of another world, where somehow only she can save the beleaguered Empress from sorcerous plottings to usurp the throne. His tale is wildly fanciful, yet Bridget feels somehow drawn to his world, to the empire of Isavalta. Kalami, her handsome, charming patient, transports her with him from Lake Superior to a dazzling world that seems like a dream... But if Isavalta is a dream, Bridget s new life is a nightmare. Caught in a magical crossfire between the powerful Dowager Empress, her daughter-in-law, an the sorcerers who serve their mistresses and other more subtle ends, she doesn t know whom to trust, whom to beware...With the fate of an empire at stake and her heart torn by conflicting desires, she becomes a reluctant player in a deadly game of politics and magic with rules as hard to untangle as the knots in a silken tassel or the threads of a woven rug. As she attempts to see beyond the masks of power and discover truth in a world where magical spells can take almost any form, each hour she spends in the luxury of Isavalta s court bunds her more tightly in the seductive embrace of secrets from her own past and of unfulfilled yearnings she can t deny.

Author Michael Sokoloff's primary source is, of course, the Babylonian Talmud, one of the most important and influential works in Jewish literature. Unlike the authors of previous dictionaries of this dialect, however, he also uses a variety of other sources, from inscriptions and legal documents to other rabbinical literature. A Dictionary of Jewish Babylonian Aramaic also differs from earlier lexographic efforts in its focus on a single dialect. Previous dictionaries have been composite works containing various Aramaic dialects from different periods, blurring distinctions in meaning and nuance. Sokoloff has been able to draw on the most current linguistic and textual scholarship to ensure the complete accuracy of his lexical entries, each of which is divided into six parts: lemma or root, part of speech, English gloss, etymology, semantic features, and bibliographic references. Another important feature in this invaluable reference work is its index of all cited passages, which allows the reader of a given text to easily find the semantics of a particular word. In addition to linguists and specialists in Jewish Aramaic literature, lay readers and students will also find this comprehensive, up-to-date dictionary useful for understanding the Babylonian Talmud.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WdNOtHEPlf4C&dq=Dictionary+of+Jewish+Babylonian+Aramaic+of+the+Talmudic+and+Geonic+Periods&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Geometry of Sheet Metal Work","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Crime Prevention for Houses of Worship","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Madwoman Can't Speak: Or Why Insanity is Not Subversive (Reading Women Writing)","description":"In this work, the subversive madwoman first appropriated by feminist theorists and critics is re-evaluated.

Sigerist on the History of Medicine","description":"In the first half of this century, Henry Ernest Sigerist was widely regarded as the world's leading historian of medicine. A brilliant teacher and lecturer, Sigerist made medical history exciting and relevant for a whole generation of young physicians, medical students, historians, and the general public. A Marxist sympathizer and advocate of socialized medicine, he also had an enormous and controversial influence on the medical politics of his time. In Making Medical History historians Elizabeth Fee and Theodore M. Brown bring together individuals from various disciplines, many of whom knew Henry Sigerist, all of whom help to illuminate why, thirty-five years after his death, he continues to be revered by many public health professionals and medical historians. Sigerist came to the Johns Hopkins Institute of the History of Medicine in 1932, arriving from Leipzig to succeed William Henry Welch as director. During Sigerist's tenure at Hopkins, his many accomplishments included founding the leading scholarly journal in the field, the Bulletin of the History of Medicine; transforming the American Association for the History of Medicine into a professional organization; and recruiting and mentoring such luminaries as Owsei Temkin, Ludwig Edelstein, and Erwin Ackerknecht. Organized into three main sections--biographical, historiographical, and political--Making Medical History includes discussions of Sigerist's influence on the history of medicine, medical sociology, and health policy. Today, as the American health care system undergoes tremendous structural changes, Sigerist's work and vision are newly relevant, and his dramatically effective presentation of medical history willcome as a revelation to a new generation of readers.

International terrorism the victimization of unarmed civilians in an attempt to affect their support for the government that leads them is a phrase with which Americans have become all too familiar recently. Yet while at first glance terrorism seems a relatively modern phenomenon, Carr illustrates that it has been a constant of military history. In ancient times, warring armies raped and slaughtered civilians and gratuitously destroyed property, homes, and cities; in the Middle Ages, evangelical Muslims and Christian crusaders spread their faiths by the sword; and in the early modern era, such celebrated kings as Louis XIV revealed a taste for victimizing noncombatants for political purposes. It was during the Civil War that Americans themselves first engaged in  total war,  the most egregious of the many euphemisms for the tactics of terror. Under the leadership of such generals as Stonewall Jackson, the forces of the South tried to systematize this horrifying practice; but it fell to a Union general, William Tecumseh Sherman, to achieve that dubious goal. Carr recounts Sherman s declaration of war on every man, woman, and child in the South a policy that he himself knew was badly flawed, had nothing to do with his military successes (indeed, it hampered them), and brought long-term unrest to the American South by giving birth to the Ku Klux Klan. Carr s exploration of terror reveals its consistently self-defeating nature. Far from prompting submission, Carr argues, terrorism stiffens enemy resolve: for this reason above all, terrorism has never achieved nor will it ever achieve long-term success, however physically destructive and psychologically debilitating it may become. With commanding authority and the storyteller s gift for which he is renowned, Caleb Carr provides a critical historical context for understanding terrorist acts today, arguing that terrorism will be eradicated only when it is perceived as a tactic that brings nothing save defeat to its agents.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-_xrMEtsub0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Procedure under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy code (LoPucki's bankruptcy visuals)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Haight-Ashbury: A History","description":"2005 marks the 40th anniversary of San Franciscos Haight-Ashbury district.

In the last decade, impotent antimicrobial drugs have compromised the treatment of many deadly diseases in poor countries. More recently, negligent production at a Massachusetts compounding pharmacy sickened hundreds of Americans. While the national drugs regulatory authority (hereafter, the regulatory authority) is responsible for the safety of a country's drug supply, no single country can entirely guarantee this today. The once common use of the term counterfeit to describe any drug that is not what it claims to be is at the heart of the argument. In a narrow, legal sense a counterfeit drug is one that infringes on a registered trademark. The lay meaning is much broader, including any drug made with intentional deceit. Some generic drug companies and civil society groups object to calling bad medicines counterfeit, seeing it as the deliberate conflation of public health and intellectual property concerns. Countering the Problem of Falsified and Substandard Drugs accepts the narrow meaning of counterfeit, and, because the nuances of trademark infringement must be dealt with by courts, case by case, the report does not discuss the problem of counterfeit medicines.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oBB1AgAAQBAJ&dq=2010+Nevada+School+Law+for+Teachers+(Study+Guide+for+Neveda+Teacher+Licensure+Examinations)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Southern Living Christmas Book: Over 400 Ways to Celebrate the Season - Southern Living Style","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Etched in Stone","description":"Etched in Stone: Archeological Discoveries that Prove the Bible is a quick, easy guide to archeological proofs to bolster one's faith and encourage believers of all ages.

Clericalism divides the church into two unequal classes, betraying the gospel, which teaches that all people are equal. Clerical privilege makes the sexual abuse of children more likely, and has led most bishops to conceal it. Clerical Errors begins by examining the trials and acquittal of Cardinal Pell. Was it the jury who made a grave error or was it the cardinal? Other chapters look at worldwide sexual abuse of children by Catholic clergy and traumatic impacts on survivors.

In her first novel, The Quilter's Apprentice, Jennifer Chiaverini wove quilting lore with tales from the World War II home front. Now, following Round Robin and The Cross-Country Quilters, Chiaverini revisits the legends of Elm Creek Manor, as Sylvia Compson discovers evidence of her ancestors' courageous involvement in the Underground Railroad. Alerted to the possibility that her family had ties to the slaveholding South, Sylvia scours her attic and finds three quilts and a memoir written by Gerda, the spinster sister of clan patriarch Hans Bergstrom. The memoir describes the founding of Elm Creek Manor and how, using quilts as markers, Hans, his wife, Anneke, and Gerda came to beckon fugitive slaves to safety within its walls. When a runaway named Joanna arrives from a South Carolina plantation pregnant with her master's child, the Bergstroms shelter her through a long, dangerous winter -- imagining neither the impact of her presence nor the betrayal that awaits them. The memoir raises new questions for every one it answers, leading Sylvia ever deeper into the tangle of the Bergstrom legacy. Aided by the Elm Creek Quilters, as well as by descendants of others named in Gerda's tale, Sylvia dares to face the demons of her family's past and at the same time reaffirm her own moral center. A spellbinding fugue on the mysteries of heritage, The Runaway Quilt unfolds with all the drama and suspense of a classic in the making.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ef-LFscKLcAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Shining Reader (Starmont Studies in Literary Criticism)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Minor tactics of the chalk stream and kindred studies","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Rosary for Episcopalians/Anglicans","description":"A guide and interpretation to the use of the Rosary in prayer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-SgJAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Rosary+for+Episcopalians/Anglicans&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Half Empty, Half Full: Understanding the Psychological Roots of Optimism","description":"The author, a renowned research psychoanalyst, challenges the idea that optimism is genetic, arguing instead that experiences in the first three years of life often shape the neural pathways in the brain.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=anQQAQAAIAAJ&dq=Half+Empty,+Half+Full:+Understanding+the+Psychological+Roots+of+Optimism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cinderellie!","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Glass Menagerie (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (New Directions Books)","description":"Illus. in full color. \\"A comedy about a menagerie of barnyard animals who mistakenly think the sun has forgotten to rise.

In The Bible Jesus Read, Yancey challenges the perception that the New Testament is more important than the Old, that the Hebrew Scriptures aren't worth the time they take to read and understand them. Writing as always with keen insight into the human condition and God s provision for it, Yancey debunks this theory once and for all. Yes, he agrees, the Old Testament can be baffling, boring, and even offensive to the modern reader. But as he personally discovered, the Old Testament is full of rewards for the one who embraces its riches. With his candid, signature style, Yancey unfolds his interactions with the Old Testament from the perspective of his own deeply personal journey. From Moses, the amazing prince of Egypt, to the psalmists' turbulent emotions and the prophets' oddball rantings, Yancey paints a picture of Israel's God--and ours--that fills in the blanks of a solely New Testament vision of the Almighty. As he reconnects for us the strong, sinuous chords that bind the Old and New Testaments, Yancey reclaims the Reformers' deep sense of unity between the two.

A Smuggler's Bible marked the debut of one of contemporary fiction's most compelling and original authors. Upon its first publication in 1966, it drew a chorus of critical acclaim and comparisons to William Gaddis's The Recognitions and Malcolm Lowry's Under the Volcano. Used once upon a time to convey contraband, the familiar hollowed-out bible reappears transformed as a metaphor for the earnest attempt, perhaps futile, by David Brooke to project his life into the lives of those who have affected him to varying degrees of residual puzzlement, fascination, profit, frustration, and damage. These people -- a reserved English bookseller in Brooklyn Heights, the bizarre tenants of a Manhattan rooming house, his mother on a day of haunting insight, a mercurial and narcissistic professor of history, and finally his own father confronting death -- are the subject of David's vaunted \\"projections,\\" the eight pseudo-autobiographical manuscripts he has written, now housed safely aboard a transatlantic liner on their way to a mysterious old man in London. David is the reader of his life, and as he broods over the stories, attempting to conjure his identity from its disjointed parts, yet another voice intercedes, a cunning interlocutor who alternately guides and thwarts his attempts to find a pattern of meaning in the profuse details of life.

This completely revised edition brings the story up to the 1990s with new text, 280 illustrations and 16 color plates. Fashion in this century has ceased to be the private domain of the wealthy. The era when such names as Worth, Paquin and Sciaparelli could dominate has given way to one where style and 'look' can be taken from a host of various sources: designers and manufacturers, department and chain stores, the boutiques or the streets. This established reference work looks behind the scenes for an understanding of the social, economic and technical changes that have caused this revolution. It is a story of fashion shocks: two world wars, the impact of new fibers and manufacturing techniques, and the succession of youth explosions: mini-skirts, punk and sportswear. The narrative is based on research into the history of couture houses, retailers and manufacturers and the authors' experience and contact with the fashion business.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DkwmEAAAQBAJ&dq=History+of+20th+Century+Fashion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Perfect Wedding (Arabesque)","description":"Presents a comprehensive guide for librarians and readers' advisors, provides a brief history of the romance novel, and offers reading lists and subgenre definitions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_Sryts4_A2QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Folk Music of the Hungarians","description":"In 1900, Zolt n Kod ly was studying modern languages at the University of Sciences in Budapest, when the call of music eventually proved too strong.

Underneath there are traces of the Dutch and English colonists who arrived in the area in the seventeenth century, as well as of the Africans they enslaved. And beneath all these layers is the land that Native Americans occupied for hundreds of generations from their first arrival eleven thousand years ago. Now two distinguished archaeologists draw on the results of more than a century of excavations to relate the interconnected stories of these different peoples who shared and shaped the land that makes up the modern city. In treating New York's five boroughs as one enormous archaeological site, Anne-Marie Cantwell and Diana diZerega Wall weave Native American, colonial, and post-colonial history into an absorbing, panoramic narrative. They also describe the work of the archaeologists who uncovered this evidence--nineteenth-century pioneers, concerned citizens, and today's professionals. In the process, Cantwell and Wall raise provocative questions about the nature of cities, urbanization, the colonial experience, Indian life, the family, and the use of space. Engagingly written and abundantly illustrated, Unearthing Gotham offers a fresh perspective on the richness of the American legacy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-b3IU_iWZ6kC&dq=Unearthing+Gotham:+The+Archaeology+of+New+York+City&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Storm over Savannah: The story of Count d'Estaing and the siege of the town in 1779","description":"Storm Over Savannah: The Story of Count d'Estaing and the Siege of the Town in 1779 tells the story of France's attempt to take down Savannah, the center for Britain's military power in the colonies in 1779.

Yet studies of his thought in Western languages have tended to overlook two key areas: first, the influence of the generation of Japanese philosophers who preceded Nishida; and second, the logic of basho (place), the cornerstone of Nishida s mature philosophical system. The Logic of Nothingness addresses both of these topics. Robert Wargo argues that the overriding concern of Nishida s mature philosophy, the attempt to give a reasonable account of reality that includes the reasonableness of that account itself or what Wargo calls \\"the problem of completeness\\" has its origins in Inoue Enryo s (18581919) and Inoue Tetsujiro s (18551944) preoccupation with \\"the problem of standpoints.\\" A translation of one of Nishida s most demanding texts, included here as an appendix, demonstrates the value of Wargo s insightful analysis of the logic of basho as an aid to deciphering the philosopher s early work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QZcBEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elementary Number Theory and Its Applications","description":"This text blends classical theory with modern applications and is notable for its comprehensive exercise sets.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tI7tPAAACAAJ&dq=Elementary+Number+Theory+and+Its+Applications&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good Sex: Perspectives on Sexual Ethics","description":"Rules about sexuality, written and unwritten, have existed in every culture as have disagreements over what is and isn't acceptable.

International terrorism the victimization of unarmed civilians in an attempt to affect their support for the government that leads them is a phrase with which Americans have become all too familiar recently. Yet while at first glance terrorism seems a relatively modern phenomenon, Carr illustrates that it has been a constant of military history. In ancient times, warring armies raped and slaughtered civilians and gratuitously destroyed property, homes, and cities; in the Middle Ages, evangelical Muslims and Christian crusaders spread their faiths by the sword; and in the early modern era, such celebrated kings as Louis XIV revealed a taste for victimizing noncombatants for political purposes. It was during the Civil War that Americans themselves first engaged in  total war,  the most egregious of the many euphemisms for the tactics of terror. Under the leadership of such generals as Stonewall Jackson, the forces of the South tried to systematize this horrifying practice; but it fell to a Union general, William Tecumseh Sherman, to achieve that dubious goal. Carr recounts Sherman s declaration of war on every man, woman, and child in the South a policy that he himself knew was badly flawed, had nothing to do with his military successes (indeed, it hampered them), and brought long-term unrest to the American South by giving birth to the Ku Klux Klan. Carr s exploration of terror reveals its consistently self-defeating nature. Far from prompting submission, Carr argues, terrorism stiffens enemy resolve: for this reason above all, terrorism has never achieved nor will it ever achieve long-term success, however physically destructive and psychologically debilitating it may become. With commanding authority and the storyteller s gift for which he is renowned, Caleb Carr provides a critical historical context for understanding terrorist acts today, arguing that terrorism will be eradicated only when it is perceived as a tactic that brings nothing save defeat to its agents.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-_xrMEtsub0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mechanisms and Dynamics of Machinery.","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Worst Band in the Universe","description":"On Planet Blipp, beyond the stars, beyond the sun and moon, The world was ruled by music - but tradition called the tune.

Winner of an AudioFile Earphones Award The 2020 NAACP Image Award-winning poet makes her fiction debut with this National Book Award-longlisted, magisterial epic an intimate yet sweeping novel with all the luminescence and force of Homegoing; Sing, Unburied, Sing; and The Water Dancer that chronicles the journey of one American family, from the centuries of the colonial slave trade through the Civil War to our own tumultuous era. The great scholar, W. E. B. Du Bois, once wrote about the Problem of race in America, and what he called  Double Consciousness,  a sensitivity that every African American possesses in order to survive. Since childhood, Ailey Pearl Garfield has understood Du Bois s words all too well. Bearing the names of two formidable Black Americans the revered choreographer Alvin Ailey and her great grandmother Pearl, the descendant of enslaved Georgians and tenant farmers Ailey carries Du Bois s Problem on her shoulders. Ailey is reared in the north in the City but spends summers in the small Georgia town of Chicasetta, where her mother s family has lived since their ancestors arrived from Africa in bondage. From an early age, Ailey fights a battle for belonging that s made all the more difficult by a hovering trauma, as well as the whispers of women her mother, Belle, her sister, Lydia, and a maternal line reaching back two centuries that urge Ailey to succeed in their stead. To come to terms with her own identity, Ailey embarks on a journey through her family s past, uncovering the shocking tales of generations of ancestors Indigenous, Black, and white in the deep South. In doing so Ailey must learn to embrace her full heritage, a legacy of oppression and resistance, bondage and independence, cruelty and resilience that is the story and the song of America itself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5VH1DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Focus on Contemporary Arabic (Conversations with Native Speakers)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Why Terrorism Works","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Christ in All the Scriptures","description":"The Gospels tell us about Jesus' life on earth, but we are missing out on the big picture if we only look for Him there.

Images of happy people stare out at us from magazine pages and television screens; they are successful and busy, hurrying from the office to the opera, eating healthfully and acting responsibly. We are a nation of achievers but, as Dr. Edward Hallowell makes clear in Connect, what sustains us emotionally, psychologically, physically is connectedness, the feeling that we are part of something that matters, something larger than ourselves that gives life its meaning, direction, and purpose. Hallowell examines the real life most of us lead overwhelmed, harried, pressured and outlines the steps we can take to connect ourselves to the people and things that matter to us. He elevates the simplest forms of communication, understanding, and self-knowledge as examples of the human moment: the basis for the bridges we build to one another. He tells stories of personal growth one woman's plan to bring a neighborhood together, another woman's assembling of a makeshift family, a real estate developer's institution of company-wide weekly pizza dinners and identifies in them twelve vital ties to a more connected life. Hallowell concludes that within each of us exists the capacity to connect with the people around us our parents, spouses, children, friends, and colleagues to become who we want to be and to be happy with who we are.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3YRF9MmwnBkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Leonardo: Up Close and Personal","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mWatugEACAAJ&dq=Leonardo:+Up+Close+and+Personal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chatting with Mother Mary: Meditations on the Mysteries of the Rosary","description":"Readers looking for informal and heartfelt reflections on the mysteries of the gospel, will love Chatting with Mother Mary.

In this book, Janneke Adema proposes that we reimagine the scholarly book as a living and collaborative project--not as linear, bound, and fixed, but as fluid, remixed, and liquid, a space for experimentation. She presents a series of cutting-edge experiments in arts and humanities book publishing, showcasing the radical new forms that book-based scholarly work might take in the digital age. Adema's proposed alternative futures for the scholarly book go beyond such print-based assumptions as fixity, stability, the single author, originality, and copyright, reaching instead for a dynamic and emergent materiality. Adema suggests ways to unbind the book, describing experiments in scholarly book publishing with new forms of anonymous collaborative authorship, radical open access publishing, and processual, living, and remixed publications, among other practices. She doesn't cast digital as the solution and print as the problem; the problem in scholarly publishing, she argues, is not print itself, but the way print has been commodified and essentialized. Adema explores alternative, more ethical models of authorship; constructs an alternative genealogy of openness; and examines opportunities for intervention in current cultures of knowledge production. Finally, asking why it is that we cut and bind our research together at all, she examines two book publishing projects that experiment with remix and reuse and try to rethink and reperform the book-apparatus by taking responsibility for the cuts they make.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=g_gLEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Phoenix Cards: Reading and Interpreting Past-Life Influences With the Phoenix Deck/Book and Cards","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=teYUAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Phoenix+Cards:+Reading+and+Interpreting+Past-Life+Influences+With+the+Phoenix+Deck/Book+and+Cards&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Psychoanalytic Case Formulation","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Fabulous Fins of the Fifties","description":"The car designs of the 1950s are among the most startling, extraordinary, outrageous, and amusing ever to come out of the American automobile industry.

Born into a Hungarian Jewish family which later converted to Christianity, he received a Catholic education and was later ordained priest after the turmoil of the War.

His first days begin in the Jewish city of Lucena at the beginning of the second millennium and ends in Israel and in Spain. He meets his descendant in a hotel in Malaga, while the young adolescent is trying to find his place in life and family, writing science-fiction short stories and fighting with his parents.

Thus, because self at its deepest center is a run-on with the divine, I had never found any true self apart from God, for to find the One is to find the other. Because this was the limit of my expectations, I was all the more surprised and bewildered when many years later I came upon a permanent state in which there was no self, no higher self, true self, or anything that could be called a self. Clearly, I had fallen outside my own, as well as the traditional frame of reference, when I came upon a path that seemed to begin where the writers on the contemplative life had left off. But with the clear certitude of the self's disappearance, there automatically arose the question of what had fallen away--what was the self? What, exactly, had it been? Then too, there was the all-important question: what remained in its absence? This journey was the gradual revelation of the answers to these questions, answers that had to be derived solely from personal experience since no outside explanation was forthcoming.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hWxGAAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Experience+of+No-Self:+A+Contemplative+Journey,+Revised+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Johnson-Pederson family tree","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Midnight Gamble","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Webster's Medical Speller, Second Edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The wanderings of an elephant hunter (The African collection)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Locked in the Family Cell: Gender, Sexuality, and Political","description":"Locked in the Family Cell is the first book on Ireland to provide a sustained and interdisciplinary analysis of gender, sexuality, nationalism, the public and private spheres, and the relationship between these categories of analysis and action. Kathryn Conrad examines the writers and activists who are resistant to simplistic nationalist constructions of Ireland and its subjects. She exposes the assumptions and the effects of national discourses in Ireland and their reliance on a limited and limiting vision of the family: the heterosexual family cell. By actively situating theoretical readings and concerns in practice, Conrad follows the lead of scholars such as Lauren Berlant, Gloria Anzaldua, Ailbhe Smyth, and others who have encouraged dialogue not only among scholars in different academic disciplines but between scholars and activists. In doing so she provides not only a critique of interest to scholars in a variety of fields but also a productive political intervention.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Blg-LIOZJvEC&dq=Locked+in+the+Family+Cell:+Gender,+Sexuality,+and+Political&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Helmet of Horror: The Myth of Theseus and the Minotaur","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Intelligence Matters: The CIA, FBI, Saudi Arabia, and the Failure of America's War on Terror","description":"In this explosive, controversial, and profoundly alarming insider s report, Senator Bob Graham reveals faults in America s national security network severe enough to raise fundamental questions about the competence and honesty of public officials in the CIA, the FBI, and the White House. For ten years, Senator Graham served on the Senate Intelligence Committee, where he had access to some of the nation s most closely guarded secrets. Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, Graham co-chaired a historic joint House-Senate inquiry into the intelligence community s failures. From that investigation and his own personal fact-finding, Graham discovered disturbing evidence of terrorist activity and a web of complicity: ? At one point, a terrorist support network conducted some of its operations through Saudi Arabia s U.S. embassyand a funding chain for terrorism led to the Saudi royal family. ? In February 2002, only four months after combat began in Afghanistan, the Bush administration ordered General Tommy Franks to move vital military resources out of Afghanistan for an operation against Iraqdespite Franks s privately stated belief that there was a job to finish in Afghanistan, and that the war on terrorism should focus next on terrorist targets in Somalia and Yemen. ? Throughout 2002, President Bush directed the FBI to limit its investigations of Saudi Arabia, which supported some and possibly all of the September 11 hijackers. ? The White House was so uncooperative with the bipartisan inquiry that its behavior bore all the hallmarks of a cover-up. ? The FBI had an informant who was extremely close to two of the September 11 hijackers, and actually housed one of them, yet the existence of this informant and the scope of his contacts with the hijackers were covered up. ? There were twelve instances when the September 11 plot could have been discovered and potentially foiled. ? Days after 9/11, U.S. authorities allowed some Saudis to fly, despite a complete civil aviation ban, after which the government expedited the departure of more than one hundred Saudis from the United States. ? Foreign leaders throughout the Middle East warned President Bush of exactly what would happen in a postwar Iraq, and those warnings went either ignored or unheeded. As a result of his Senate work, Graham has become convinced that the attacks of September 11 could have been avoided, and that the Bush administration s war on terrorism has failed to address the immediate danger posed by al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Hamas in Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, and Somalia. His book is a disturbing reminder that at the highest levels of national security, now more than ever, intelligence matters.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HI1zkhz9H9kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Atlantis;: A novel","description":"Bestselling author Gregory Mone takes readers back to Atlantis in this action-packed sequel to Atlantis: The Accidental Invasion!

Appalled by the punishment of her rebellious friend Nazrah, youngest and most petulant wife of Prince Bawad of Wasabia, Florence Farfarletti decides to draw a line in the sand. As Deputy to the deputy assistant secretary for Near East Affairs, Florence invents a far-reaching, wide-ranging plan for female emancipation in that part of the world. The U.S. government, of course, tells her to forget it. Publicly, that is. Privately, she's enlisted in a top-secret mission to impose equal rights for the sexes on the small emirate of Matar (pronounced \\"Mutter\\"), the \\"Switzerland of the Persian Gulf.\\" Her crack team: a CIA killer, a snappy PR man, and a brilliant but frustrated gay bureaucrat. Her weapon: TV shows.

When she went to senior management at Depository Trust Company (DTC), then and still the largest securities depository in the world, they brushed it off saying,  You can t balance the world.  Ten years later, a lawyer from Texas would tell her that the same problem was about to blow up the financial markets: Wall Street brokers are using short sales and fails to deliver to grab the assets of American entrepreneurs. This is a cautionary tale. What started as a regulatory failure turned into a regulatory crisis. Shareholder democracy is in shambles.

Now McMullen delivers Voyage of the Shadowmoon, a fantasy epic of daunting skill and scope. The Shadowmoon is a small, unobtrusive wooden schooner whose passengers and crew are much more than they seem: Ferran, the Shadowmoon's lusty captain who dreams of power; Roval, the warrior-sorcerer; Velander and Terikel, priestesses of a nearly extinct sect; and the chivalrous vampire Laron, who has been trapped in a fourteen-year-old body for seven hundred years. They sail the coast, gathering useful information, passing as simple traders. But when they witness the awful power of Silverdeath, an uncontrollable doomsday weapon of awesome destructiveness, they realize they must act. But every single king, emperor, and despot covets Silverdeath's power. It will take all of their wits and more than a little luck if they hope to prevent one of these power-hungry fools from destroying the world. Their only advantage? The Shadowmoon. While it seems to be little more that a small trading vessel--too small for battle, too fat for speed it is actually one of the most sophisticated vessels in the world, one that allows them to travel to places where no others would dare. They can only hope it will be enough to save them all before Silverdeath rains destruction across their entire world.

Vital to the development of user-friendly health care systems is an understanding of the vastly different lives of this second wave of HIV-infected persons.\\"You're the First One I've Told\\" offers a view into the lives of men and women infected with HIV. The experiences of twenty-five people living with this disease in rural eastern North Carolina serve as the foundation of this book, which also draws upon unique HIV/AIDS survey data collected by the authors and statistics from the Southeastern United States. This combination of qualitative and quantitative information provides readers with a vivid description of how people live with HIV/AIDS in the midst of their often traumatic lives, and why they manage their illness in ways that seem to contradict mainstream medical and social wisdom. The people interviewed represent a variety of races, genders, professions, family lives, and medical and social service access and utilization.This book is the first to address a history of racism, distrust of formalized medical systems, homophobia, trauma and their interplay with HIV treatment, particularly in the South. It is an indispensable read for students needing to understand health care for the disenfranchised, as well as any provider, policymaker, or researcher involved in HIV service provision.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bWyH0xjmANIC&dq=%22You%27re+the+First+One+I%27ve+Told%22:+New+Faces+of+HIV+in+the+South&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arabian Knight","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The call of the wild","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Journal to the Soul for Teenagers (Heart & Star Books)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Funinbed.com's Top 100 Lovemaking Techniques of All Time","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Camille's Crossroad","description":"Camille, age 12, is visited by an angel and taken to the Land of the Prince of Peace where she learns how to make the very best decisions in life.

She highlights the differences between ancient and modern assumptions about Plato's ethics and stresses the need to be more critical about our own. One of these modern assumptions is the notion that the dialogues record the development of Plato's thought. Annas shows how the Middle Platonists, by contrast, viewed the dialogues as multiple presentations of a single Platonic ethical philosophy, differing in form and purpose but ultimately coherent. They also read Plato's ethics as consistently defending the view that virtue is sufficient for happiness, and see it as converging in its main points with the ethics of the Stoics. Annas goes on to explore the Platonic idea that humankind's final end is \\"becoming like God\\" an idea that is well known among the ancients but virtually ignored in modern interpretations. She also maintains that modern interpretations, beginning in the nineteenth century, have placed undue emphasis on the Republic, and have treated it too much as a political work, whereas the ancients rightly saw it as a continuation of Plato's ethical writings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MS9bDwAAQBAJ&dq=Platonic+Ethics,+Old+and+New+(Cornell+Studies+in+Classical+Philology,+V.+57.)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life against death: The psychoanalytical meaning of history","description":"A shocking and extreme interpretation of the father of psychoanalysis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3vWuM3tKsR4C&dq=Life+against+death:+The+psychoanalytical+meaning+of+history&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Somewhere in Ireland, A Village is Missing an Idiot","description":"\\"Golf is not a game, it's a punishment.\\" -David Feherty \\"If you're one of those people who think golf is a religion, prepare for some seriously funny blasphemy.\\" --Troon McAllister, author of The Green Somewhere in Ireland, A Village is Missing an Idiot is a collection of Feherty's most popular Golf Magazine columns, intermingled with his most outrageous work from Golfonline.com.

And their dream was only beginning. Alvin won an Olympic gold medal in the 4 x 400-meter relay in 1996, and four years later in Sydney, Australia, the identical twin brothers each ran a leg on the gold-medal-winning 4 x 400-meter relay team. All told, the Harrisons have won three Olympic gold medals and a silver despite a shared life marked by tragedy and misfortune. Together, Alvin and Calvin persevered and are now poised to become the greatest tandem in the history of international track and field. Their story starts in an Orlando hospital room with a teenage mother giving birth to premature twins. Alvin Harrison came first, followed by his identical twin brother, Calvin, two minutes later. By the time Calvin passed into the world, doctors had pronounced his older brother dead. At that instant, and with a cry Calvin later described as a call to God, Alvin started breathing again and a remarkable story of courage, tenacity and spirit began to take shape. They recall \\"playing with the wind\\" as children and waking up with their grandmother Lucille, praying over them. Despite a house full of uncles, aunts, sisters and the occasional parent, Alvin and Calvin were drawn to the strong presence of their grandmother, who passed her spirituality on to them. Their \\"visions\\" of future events and situations have been a part of their lives for as long as they can remember, their ability to communicate with each other non-verbally is as natural to them as walking or talking. Though they would bounce between Florida and Northern California for more than 10 years starting at age 12, Alvin and Calvin never lost touch with each other. And once they were able to finally live with their father, Albert, in Salinas, California, he provided stability and support that they hadn't known while growing up in a crime-ridden Orlando ghetto. When their father returned to Florida, the twins stayed in California and became high school track and field phenoms despite living on their own and spending most days looking for a place to sleep. Then in 1995, while living in their car on a hill in the Northern California town of Hollister for more than three months, Alvin and Calvin read the entire Bible. When they emerged, the brothers decided to make a run for the 1996 United States Olympic Team. Incredibly, after more than a year of inactivity, Alvin qualified for the team with Calvin missing by only 7/1000ths of a second. Four years later -- and against the backdrop of the tragic loss of loved ones -- the brothers qualified for the 2000 U.S. Olympic Team. Alvin won a silver medal in the 400 meters, and the brothers brought home gold with each running a leg on the 4 x 400-meter relay. Alvin and Calvin Harrison now tell the story of a run -- equal parts inspiring and unbelievable -- that started at birth and may well end as the greatest duo in the history of international track and field.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zMYAAAAACAAJ&dq=Go+to+Your+Destiny&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A doctor discusses headaches: Causes, cures","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aw-zHAAACAAJ&dq=A+doctor+discusses+headaches:+Causes,+cures&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Preparing for Terrorism: A Property Manager's Guide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MbYjAAAACAAJ&dq=Preparing+for+Terrorism:+A+Property+Manager%27s+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Who will fill our shoes?: Thirteen dramatic sketches for missions awareness","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aMDJAAAACAAJ&dq=Who+will+fill+our+shoes%3F:+Thirteen+dramatic+sketches+for+missions+awareness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Integration : Princeton Mathematical Series","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Tp7HzgEACAAJ&dq=Integration+:+Princeton+Mathematical+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Something Gorgeous","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"How to Master Change in Your Life: 67 Ways to Handle Life's Toughest Moments","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Crossed Bones","description":"Haunted by a busybody ghost and constantly nagged about finding a husband, thirtysomething Mississippi private detective Sarah Booth Delaney investigates the murder of a black blues-club owner and finds herself caught in the middle of a town torn apart by racial prejudice when the victim's white protg becomes the prime suspect in the killing.

To create a fair electoral system, we must deliberate together about these principles and take greater control of the procedures that govern our elections.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5TE-8LCD4CQC&dq=Just+Elections:+Creating+a+Fair+Electoral+Process+in+the+United+States&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Henry V (REV.

Each model was selected for its appropriateness for asking a given class of questions, and each spawned its own community of investigators.

'As though walking through a deep dream, I saw steel helmets approaching through the craters. They seemed to sprout from the fire-harrowed soil like some iron harvest.' A memoir of astonishing power, savagery and ashen lyricism, Storm of Steel depicts Ernst J nger's experience of combat on the front line - leading raiding parties, defending trenches against murderous British incursions, and simply enduring as shells tore his comrades apart. One of the greatest books to emerge from the catastrophe of the First World War, it illuminates like no other book not only the horrors but also the fascination of a war that made men keep fighting for four long years. Ernst J nger (1895-1998) the son of a wealthy chemist, ran away from home to join the Foreign Legion. His father dragged him back, but he returned to military service when he joined the German army on the outbreak of the First World War. Storm of Steel (Stahlgewittern) was J nger's first book, published in 1920. Greatly admired by the Nazis, J nger remained at a distance from the regime, with books such as his allegorical work On the Marble Cliffs (1939) functioning as a covert criticism of Nazi ideology and methods. If you enjoyed Storm of Steel, you might like Edward Blunden's Undertones of War, also available in Penguin Modern Classics. 'To read this extraordinary book is to gain a unique insight into the compelling nature of organized, industrialized violence' Niall Ferguson, author of War of the World 'Hofmann's interpretation is superb' The Times 'Unique in the literature of this or any other war is its brilliantly vivid conjuration of the immediacy and intensity of battle' Telegraph 'Storm of Steel is what so many books claim to be but are not: a classic account of war' Evening Standard","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q-LjDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pemberley","description":"In a marvellous, thrilling re-creation of the world of Pride and Prejudice, P.D. James fuses her lifelong passion for the work of Jane Austen with her own great talent for writing crime fiction. The year is 1803, and Darcy and Elizabeth have been married for six years. There are now two handsome, healthy sons in the Pemberley nursery, Elizabeth's beloved sister Jane and her husband, Bingley, live within seventeen miles, the ordered and secure life of Pemberley seems unassailable, and Elizabeth's happiness in her marriage is complete. But their peace is threatened and old sins and misunderstandings are rekindled on the eve of the annual autumn ball. The Darcys and their guests are preparing to retire for the night when a chaise appears, rocking down the path from Pemberley's wild woodland, and as it pulls up, Lydia Wickham, an uninvited guest, tumbles out, screaming that her husband has been murdered. Death Comes to Pemberley is a powerful work of fiction, as rich in its compelling story, in its evocation of place, and its gripping psychological and emotional insight, as the very best of P. D. James. She brings us back masterfully and with delight to much-loved characters, illuminating the happy but threatened marriage of the Darcys with the excitement and suspense of a brilliantly crafted mystery.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BJoUoAEACAAJ&dq=Pemberley&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blind Alley","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Family: The Real Story of the Bush Dynasty","description":"Presents a portrait of the Bush political dynasty and their influence on twentieth- and twenty-first century America, from Connecticut senator Prescott Bush, through his grandson, George W., the forty-third president of the United States.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ntSVV9xOViMC&dq=The+Family:+The+Real+Story+of+the+Bush+Dynasty&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life Exposed: Biological Citizens after Chernobyl (In-formation)","description":"On April 26, 1986, Unit Four of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded in then Soviet Ukraine.

Jon Lee Anderson s biography traces Che s extraordinary life, from his comfortable Argentine upbringing to the battlefields of the Cuban revolution, from the halls of power in Castro s government to his failed campaign in the Congo and assassination in the Bolivian jungle. Anderson has had unprecedented access to the personal archives maintained by Guevara s widow and carefully guarded Cuban government documents. He has conducted extensive interviews with Che s comrades some of whom speak here for the first time and with the CIA men and Bolivian officers who hunted him down. Anderson broke the story of where Guevara s body was buried, which led to the exhumation and state burial of the bones. Many of the details of Che s life have long been cloaked in secrecy and intrigue. Meticulously researched and full of exclusive information, Che Guevara illuminates as never before this mythic figure who embodied the high-water mark of revolutionary communism as a force in history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aCw19CUXpqkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Salmon P.

Upon completing this work, you will have a better understanding of the social causes of the violence epidemic and concrete suggestions for its long-term control. Bearing Witness addresses the cycle of violence by discussing some of the biological, psychological, social, and moral issues that go into determining whether a person will end up as a victim, perpetrator, or bystander to violent events and what happens to us when we are in one or all three of these roles. The authors look at a number of intersecting factors that play interdependent roles in creating a culture that promotes, supports, and even encourages violence. Specifically, you ll gain invaluable insight into: trauma theory and traumatogenic forces--backdrops against which the chances of exposure to violence and the use of violence as a problemsolver are increased normal human development in the context of attachment theory and what occurs as a result of disrupted attachment bonds how rapid changes in modern society and the breakdown of the traditional family structure contribute to a level of social stress that promotes violence violence in the family, in the workplace, and in the schools--all places to which people turn for security social responses to violence--the ways in which certain responses decrease or increase the likelihood of violence the unhealthy balance of power between the genders and how violence or the threat of violence maintains this imbalance how our cultural standard of disavowing our normal emotional experience sets the stage for repeated and regular empathic failure, which leads to violence A framework for understanding the various aspects of the problem of violence, Bearing Witness delves into the various aspects of trauma--what trauma does to the body, the mind, the emotions, and relationships--before beginning to formulate proposals for initiating processes that lead to problemsolving.

As Jack Shulimson shows, only a century ago the Corps' identity and existence were much in question. Although the Marines were formally established by Congress in 1798 and subsequently distinguished themselves fighting on the Barbary Coast, their essential mission and identity remained unclear throughout most of the nineteenth century. In this enlightening study, Shulimson argues that the Marine Corps officers' inextricable ties to the Navy both hampered and aided their attempt to define their own special jurisdiction and professional identity. He reveals the processes, politics, and personalities that converged to create tense relations before Marine officers (with the Navy's blessing) eventually transcended their second-class role.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oZ3fAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Marine+Corps+Search+for+a+Mission,+1880-1898+(Modern+War+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Magic Glasses","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Blue Remembered Hills a Recollection (Oxford Paperbacks)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vdhCPAAACAAJ&dq=Blue+Remembered+Hills+a+Recollection+(Oxford+Paperbacks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mystic Coast: A Photographic Portrait","description":"Presents many color photographs submitted as part of a photograph contest held in the greater Mystic area and judged by professional photographers familiar with the area.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WUqrswEACAAJ&dq=The+Mystic+Coast:+A+Photographic+Portrait&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Choice and Consequence","description":"In Choice and Consequence, Thomas Schelling ventures where rationality is ambiguous, exploring topics as awesome as nuclear terrorism, as sordid as blackmail, as ineffable as daydreaming, as intimidating as euthanasia.

Even better, many of them are absolutely free. There's only one problem: who has time to track them all down, sort through them for the best ones for a particular purpose, or figure out how to use them?Network Troubleshooting Tools does the work for you--by describing the best of the freely available tools for debugging and troubleshooting. You can start with a lesser-known version of ping that diagnoses connectivity problems, or take on a much more comprehensive program like MRTG for graphing traffic through network interfaces. There's tkined for mapping and automatically monitoring networks, and Ethereal for capturing packets and debugging low-level problems.This book isn't just about the tools available for troubleshooting common network problems. It also outlines a systematic approach to network troubleshooting: how to document your network so you know how it behaves under normal conditions, and how to think about problems when they arise, so you can solve them more effectively.The topics covered in this book include: Understanding your network Connectivity testing Evaluating the path between two network nodes Tools for capturing packets Tools for network discovery and mapping Tools for working with SNMP Performance monitoring Testing application layer protocols Software sources If you're involved with network operations, this book will save you time, money, and needless experimentation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VADbJowCwEQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Milwaukee Bike Map: And Southeast Wisconsin","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9buXAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Five Hundred Years of Printing","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Seizure of the Gilberts and Marshalls","description":"A study in amphibious warfare that describes how the imperfections of American amphibious doctrine, first revealed at Tarawa and Makin, were corrected in the highly successful landings on Kwajalein and Roi-Namur.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qHfNJdZFZnEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The geography and geology of Alaska: A summary of existing knowledge (Geological Survey)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"X-Men #1 (Cover D Magneto) Vol. 1 October 1991","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Holy Bible in the Language of Today: An American Translation","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DN18AAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Holy+Bible+in+the+Language+of+Today:+An+American+Translation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Energy and Security: Toward a New Foreign Policy Strategy (Woodrow Wilson Center Press)","description":"For more than a century, energy and its procurement have been central to the U.S. position as a world power.

The high point of that backlash is the Republican Party's success in building the most unnatural of alliances: between blue-collar Midwesterners and Wall Street business interests, workers and bosses, populists and right-wingers. In asking \\"what 's the matter with Kansas?\\" how a place famous for its radicalism became one of the most conservative states in the union Frank, a native Kansan and onetime Republican, seeks to answer some broader American riddles: Why do so many of us vote against our economic interests? Where's the outrage at corporate manipulators? And whatever happened to middle-American progressivism? The questions are urgent as well as provocative. Frank answers them by examining pop conservatism the bestsellers, the radio talk shows, the vicious political combat and showing how our long culture wars have left us with an electorate far more concerned with their leaders' \\"values\\" and down-home qualities than with their stands on hard questions of policy.

For this country s 145,892,494 (give or take) suburbanites, Mark Falanga is an utterly deadpan (and thoroughly entertaining) spokesman. Mark Falanga is a slick urban dweller, at the top of his game professionally, with a gorgeous corporate executive wife and a hip coterie in the coolest neighborhood in the city. But when baby makes three, Mark and his family enter the twilight zone called the suburbs, where public schools are good, many wives stay home, and children ride their tricycles in the driveway. Nothing is the same ever again. With the dry wit of David Sedaris, and Dave Barry s love of the absurd, Falanga details his new, suburban landscape from the point of view of a bewildered but gung-ho everyman.

Four of Dressler's old gangster colleagues have put together a national tour of once-popular rock bands they own a piece of: three nights of concerts by guys (and a few gals) who were big shots back in the 1960s and 1970s, and who are now hoping for one more gasp of glory with this nostalgia exhibition. The Rock of Ages tour has proved itself to be anything but a love fest: plenty of the bandmates have been feuding for forty years, and perhaps unsurprisingly drugs and bad behavior have created health, wellness, and legal problems for the musicians and managers. Plus there have been two near-fatal accidents that might have been attempted murders. But they're not what Irwin Dressler is concerned about. It's that someone one of his own colleagues is using the tour as a front to steal Dressler's money. And that simply cannot be allowed. Now the tour has pulled into LA, and Junior has one weekend to figure out who's to blame a weekend that begins with his tires being slashed, threatening notes left on his car, and a theatrical backdrop falling on a drummer during the truly terrible first set of the first concert. To make things worse, Junior is saddled for the weekend with his teenage daughter, Rina, who lately has been much, much too interested in how her father earns his living. Can Junior recover Dressler's money, prevent a murder, talk his daughter out of pursuing a life of crime, and somehow survive all that bad music?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-GY7EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Differential and Integral Calculus (2 Volume Set)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Costumes & featherwork of the Lords of Chimor: Textiles from Peru's north coast","description":"Draping Period Costumes provides you with the skill set you need to break away from two-dimensional patterns to drape three dimensional costumes.

Information Retrieval, Image Analysis, Speech Recognition and Biology. - Accessibility: the definitions are easy to locate by subject or, in Index, by alphabetic order; the introductions and definitions are reader-friendly and maximally independent one from another; still the text is structured, in the 3D HTML style, by hyperlink-like boldfaced references to similar definitions. * Covers a large range of subjects in pure and applied mathematics * Designed to be easily applied--the distances and distance-related notions and paradigms are ready to use * Helps users quickly locate definitions by subject or in alphabetical order; stand-alone entries include references to other entries and sources for further investigation","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=I-PQH8gcOjUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hack Proofing Windows 2000 Server","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Traveller's History of Greece","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Okinawa: The Last Battle","description":"The story of one of the bloodiest battles in history, told by World War II veterans-turned-historians.

Okinawa was the intended base for the planned invasion of Japan. The Japanese, however, were entrenched, and the US and Allied forces found themselves in one of the bloodiest battles of World War II. More than 100,000 Japanese soldiers, 50,000 US and Allied troops, and 100,000 civilians lost their lives during this epic 82-day battle.

This pervasive yet little- examined obsession with bargains is arguably the most powerful and devastating market force of our time, having fueled an excess of consumerism that blights our land-scapes, escalates personal debt, lowers our standard of living, and even skews of our concept of time. Spotlighting the peculiar forces that drove Americans away from quality, durability, and craftsmanship and towards quantity, quantity, and more quantity, Ellen Ruppel Shell traces the rise of the bargain through our current big-box profusion to expose the astronomically high cost of cheap.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-wDkR4Jt1FcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Big Sky Country","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Baby Magnet (Romance Ser.)","description":"Owen Corporate Raider, Ruthless, Devil in a Three-Piece Suit.

In this unique perspective on Einstein the man, sociologist of science Gerhard Sonnert argues that both popular images are simplistic and misleading because they fail to account for the impact of culture. In this scholarly yet accessible book, Sonnert examines major features of German Kultur, showing how powerful cultural influences helped to shape Einstein's life and science.Starting with a review of the evidence supporting Einstein's rebel image, Sonnert confronts it with counterevidence that suggests his traditionalist side. The apparent contradiction is resolved through an extensive study of the cultural landscape of nineteenth-century Germany. Sonnert takes a close look at the German concept of Kultur, laying special emphasis on the related ideas of Weltanschauung and Weltbild, two German terms representing particular types of worldviews.Einstein and Culture demonstrates how strongly Einstein's physical research program was driven by a pivotal cultural goal: the quest for the synthesis of a scientific worldview (Weltbild). His was the rebellion of the idealistic radical in the name of Kultur against its perceived failings and shortcomings. Sonnert also shows that Einstein's quest was deeply motivated by a broadly defined religious impulse. Here again, the physicist reveals himself to be a true creature of Kultur, epitomizing the German scientist-priest.In conclusion, Sonnert argues that the mass exodus during the Nazi regime of German scientists and intellectuals, including Einstein, marked a demise of Kultur. However, this cataclysm also resulted in a fertile synthesis between the German Kultur-inspired science and the quite different American scientific tradition.Einstein and Culture is a fascinating, insightful, and original study of a neglected aspect of Einstein's life and work.Gerhard Sonnert (Cambridge, MA), a research associate in the department of physics at Harvard University, is the coauthor with G. Holton of Ivory Bridges: Connecting Science and Society, Gender Difference in Science Careers, and Who Succeeds in Science?

She was a very sickly child who did not walk until she was almost three and then went on to walk the world. This is a book about travel that is not a travel book. It is a book about walking and hiking, but it is not about leisure. These activities provide the context within which the author examines and comments on issues in today's world. The approach is a provocative blend of the personal and the political, offering a different view of today's worldscape as seen through the eyes of a black woman sociologist, traveller and hiker. The result is a book which it will be difficult to put down. And which the reader will want to return to time and again. From Barbados to Bhutan, from Grenada to Guatemala, from Africa to Australia, China to Christchurch (Barbados and New Zealand) Maureen has been there, walking, observing, and listening. From the foothills of the Himalayas to the Old Man of Coniston she tells of encounters with men and women, and presents and discusses the issues and problems of today. In letters to her 'sisters around the world' and through conversations with her brothers, her travels and experiences are recounted. From the personal to the political she moves, sometimes with humour, always with painful honesty. She writes with a dash of Caribbean humour, a good helping of European sociology, and a flavouring of Eastern philosophy. This book is for Everywoman and Everyman who, if they look close enough, will find something of themselves within these pages. 'Black Woman Walking' travels a road worth following.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R-8XAQAAMAAJ&dq=Black+Woman+Walking&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Country House Murders","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"To Love, Honor And Betray","description":"Tabitha, Curtis's long-time mistress and mother of his illegitimate two-year-old child, Curtina, has died, and Curtina must now move in with them permanently.

Curtis quickly notices and when he finally confronts her about her cruel and selfish behavior, Charlotte makes it very clear that Curtina is his baby, not hers. Charlotte begins spending more time away from home and after a chance meeting, begins hanging out with Michael Porter, an old boyfriend she'd dated briefly just before reconnecting with Curtis eight years ago. During this same period, Curtis is very focused on the new and much larger church they are building, but he is also having to fight his own battles with temptation: at least three of his female parishioners are trying with all their might to lure him into bed. Curtis and Charlotte find themselves slipping into the worst scenario imaginable, and no amount of money, not even the seven figures Curtis earns annually, will be enough to prevent it from happening.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a3T4kQAACAAJ&dq=To+Love,+Honor+And+Betray&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Religion, Race, and Reconstruction: The Public School in the Politics of the 1870s (Suny Series, Religion and American Public Life)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must): The World According to Ann Coulter","description":"The conservative columnist shares her thoughts on topics from political correctness and foreign policy to the media, in a collection of her commentaries accompanied by responses from readers on both sides of the political spectrum.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=glYJC_8WQxEC&dq=How+to+Talk+to+a+Liberal+(If+You+Must):+The+World+According+to+Ann+Coulter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sunset Awakening","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Revelation (Everyman's Bible commentary)","description":"Not to mystify, but to clarify. According to Dr. Charles C. Ryrie, the book of Revelation was not designed to confuse or mystify its readers, but to enlighten them about future events. Revelation, the only major prophetic book in the New Testament, was written by the apostle John while in exile on the island of Patmos. John was commanded by God not to seal the book (22:10), and those who read it are promised a special blessing (1:3). Apparently, therefore, the book was expected to be intelligible and helpful to those who read it. This refreshing, concise new edition with helpful charts and graphs is written especially for those who want to understand what lies ahead in God's plan. Dr. Ryrie's careful attention to detail and understandable explanations will not only help to clear some of the mystery surrounding the book of Revelation, but heighten your confidence that God's victory over Satan, death, and sin is only a matter of time. \\"Blessed is the one who reads the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it, because the time is near\\" (Revelation 1:3, NIV).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VvAAXAvE2w8C&dq=Revelation+(Everyman%27s+Bible+commentary)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hot!

An expansion team in a city that had sought a pro grid franchise since 1979, its concentration had been on signing young athletes, with the expectation that they would be ready to make a major move in three years. And, although coach and general manager Tom Coughlin had gotten off to a bad start with the team members, he was an important contributor because he judged players solely on their ability and drive and not on their press clippings, according to the authors. In his first year, Coughlin's coaching reflected more of his college than his pro background: gradually he relaxed many of his rules, and the team was better for it. Most amazing was the record, since, after 11 games, it stood at 4-7; then came five straight wins in the regular season and play-off victories against highly favored Buffalo and Denver.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ttDrAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Palm OS Programming","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Sweet Potato Queens' Field Guide to Men: Every Man I Love is Either Married, Gay, or Dead","description":"The author turns her attention to the pursuit of men, marriage, and great sex in a humorous handbook that addresses all matters of the heart.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T2uMDQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Sweet+Potato+Queens%27+Field+Guide+to+Men:+Every+Man+I+Love+is+Either+Married,+Gay,+or+Dead&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Miracles: Exploring the Mystery of Jesus's Divine Works","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Evolution of Mozart's Pianistic Style","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Santitos (Spanish Edition)","description":"Esperanza's Box of Saints is a magical, humorous, and passion-filled odyssey about a beautiful young widow's search for her missing child -- a mission that takes her from a humble Mexican village to the rowdy brothels of Tijuana and a rarely seen side of Los Angeles.

Designing effective interactivity, however, can be a challenge for even the most experienced game developer. This is especially true in the design process of multiplayer online games, so it is critical that developers have a solid understanding of game design and interactivity. Online Game Interactivity Theory is about online game design?its concepts, techniques, and tools. It guides you through the design process for multiplayer online games, beginning with discussions of online game history, the differences between single-player games and online games, and how the various categories of online games affect design. The emphasis throughout the process is on interactivity?how to define it, how to cope with its complexity, and how to integrate it into your designs. Online Game Interactivity Theory defines interactivity on three different levels: player-to-computer, player-to-player, and player-to-game. By understanding the key factors of the three types of interactivity, you will gain insights into how a game?s level of interactivity can influence its potential for success, and what you can do to improve it. Methods for applying interactivity to your online game designs are discussed, and techniques for \\"designing\\" it into your games are provided. Details on multiplayer game design issues are also discussed along with guidelines and suggestions for integrating these issues into your games.

These societal gains, however, have also helped fuel a surge in narcissistic and misguided intellectual egalitarianism that has crippled informed debates on any number of issues. Today, everyone knows everything: with only a quick trip through WebMD or Wikipedia, average citizens believe themselves to be on an equal intellectual footing with doctors and diplomats. All voices, even the most ridiculous, demand to be taken with equal seriousness, and any claim to the contrary is dismissed as undemocratic elitism. Tom Nichols' The Death of Expertise shows how this rejection of experts has occurred: the openness of the internet, the emergence of a customer satisfaction model in higher education, and the transformation of the news industry into a 24-hour entertainment machine, among other reasons. Paradoxically, the increasingly democratic dissemination of information, rather than producing an educated public, has instead created an army of ill-informed and angry citizens who denounce intellectual achievement. When ordinary citizens believe that no one knows more than anyone else, democratic institutions themselves are in danger of falling either to populism or to technocracy or, in the worst case, a combination of both. An update to the 2017breakout hit, the paperback edition of The Death of Expertise provides a new foreword to cover the alarming exacerbation of these trends in the aftermath of Donald Trump's election. Judging from events on the ground since it first published, The Death of Expertise issues a warning about the stability and survival of modern democracy in the Information Age that is even more important today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ttf_DQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Reading Woman: A Journal","description":"A 84 Day Journal for Body, Mind & Spirit.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kFfVjwEACAAJ&dq=The+Reading+Woman:+A+Journal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Pot Dinner, The","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Jennifer: The Special One","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Kiya the Gull","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Casino Surveillance and Security: 150 Things You Should Know","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Handbook of Soil Science","description":"An evolving, living organic/inorganic covering, soil is in dynamic equilibrium with the atmosphere above, the biosphere within, and the geology below. It acts as an anchor for roots, a purveyor of water and nutrients, a residence for a vast community of microorganisms and animals, a sanitizer of the environment, and a source of raw materials for construction and manufacturing. To develop lasting solutions to the challenges of balanced use and stewardship of the Earth, we require a fundamental understanding of soil from its elastic, porous three-phase system to its components, processes, and reactions. Handbook of Soil Sciences: Properties and Processes, Second Edition is the first of two volumes that form a comprehensive reference on the discipline of soil science. Completely revised and updated to reflect the current state of knowledge, this volume covers the traditional areas of soil science: soil physics, soil chemistry, soil mineralogy, soil biology and biochemistry, and pedology. Contributors discuss the application of physical principles to characterize the soil system and mass and energy transport processes within the critical zone. They present significant advances in soil chemistry; describe how minerals are formed and transformed; and provide an introduction to the soil biota. They also examine geomorphology, land use, hydropedology, and subaqueous soils as well as the classification and digital mapping of soil. Critical elements addressed in each section include: Descriptions of concepts and theories Definitions, approaches, methodologies, and procedures Data in tabular and figure format Extensive references This cohesive handbook provides a thorough understanding of soil science principles and practices based on a rigorous, complete, and up-to-date treatment of the subject matter compiled by leading scientists. It is a resource rich in data, offering professional soil scientists, agronomists, engineers, ecologists, biologists, naturalists, and students their first point of entry into a particular aspect of the soil sciences.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9BJlVxJLNO8C&dq=Handbook+of+Soil+Science&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Problem of Knowledge : Philosophy, Science, and History Since Hegel","description":"\\"Cassirer employs his remarkable gift of lucidity to explain the major ideas and intellectual issues that emerged in the course of nineteenth century scientific and historical thinking.

When she stumbles upon a recent skeleton among the ancient bones, she starts asking questions. She s the expert they might have called in, but lucky for the local police she's already there. The skeleton leads her to a free street clinic where patients have begun to go missing, and some have wound up dead. What is going on and who is to blame? The charismatic televangelist who oversees the clinic? The shady doctor who practices there? Or is it the clinic staff? Ryan is in Montreal, though he may come down for a visit. If he does, Tempe will have to juggle him and Detective Galiano, an old flame, who is in town investigating the disappearance of wealthy young woman. This is a phenomenally high stakes business where one dead body can save a couple of lives, maybe more. Along with the corpses, Tempe investigates the sick moral logic of the mastermind behind the operation.
