From the Introduction:  The challenges we face today are not in essence different from those of our ancestors: relationships, love, knowledge, work, and purpose still claim our main attention. Yet the implications of these challenges for the survival of humanity and the planet seem more acute. We seem to know more, yet our consciousness has evolved in such a way that makes it difficult to see what the purpose of life really is. How do we live more fully in the moment, solving the problems before us?  Jesus s teachings have been used historically to fuel what became modern Western culture, with all its pluses and minuses. At the same time, viewed through his native language, the same teachings provide a solution to our culture s greatest challenges, pointing the way toward a proper use of our human individuality and will.  Through expansions of Aramaic s multiple meanings as well as guided contemplations, Revelations of the Aramaic Jesus provides a guide to transformation through the way of the prophet of Nazareth. It shows how Jesus s deepest teachings address contemporary challenges, such as our relationships with nature and each other, as well as the purpose of life itself. Revelations of the Aramaic Jesus looks at frequently asked questions such as: Is Jesus talking about a personal God or an impersonal one? Or both? What did the words blessing, grace, and happiness mean to Yeshua, and what do they mean for us today? How do evil and injustice fit into Jesus s view of life? And what is his remedy? Revelations of the Aramaic Jesus is a guide to living an authentic interior life without dogma and a spiritual path that makes you more comfortable in your own, providing a sense of meaning and purpose.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=edNgEAAAQBAJ&dq=Syriac+New+Testament-FL-Peshitta&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE PROFIT (Albran's Serial)","description":"A moving and thought-provoking adaptation of Kahlil Gibran s classic poem.

Lilith, the ages-old mother of the dying race of vampires, has been forced to come out of her cave deep in the Egyptian desert in search of food -- human blood. But she knows nothing about the modern world. She can't drive a car, rent a room, turn on a TV. She struggles to New York, penniless, vulnerable, and starving, protected only by her beauty and her power to capture men with desire...especially certain very special men. The instant she sees young Ian Ward, she knows that he is part vampire himself. She knows that Ian, if he ever tastes human blood, will belong to her forever. And she needs him desperately, to help her survive and live in this harsh new world of jets and credit cards and guns. She sets out on a campaign of seduction -- as sensuous as it is terrifying -- to touch human blood to Ian's lips, which will then become for him a drug a thousand times more addictive than heroin. Ian's father, Paul Ward, part vampire turned expert and obsessive hunter of vampires, knows that if the blood transforms Ian, Paul will have to kill his own son. The titanic conflict between father and son and seductress, hunter and hunted and huntress, comes to its surprise conclusion in the secret chambers beneath the great pyramids, where the hidden truths of all human history are stored. From its beginning in the dark back alleys of Cairo to its totally unexpected ending, Lilith's Dream draws the reader down seductive new paths of discovery, into places where no novel has ever before. With Lilith's Dream Whitley Strieber has created a vampire so original and a story so new that he has virtually invented a new genre.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wR8BpGc9ERMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Der Weg zur Mitte: Wandlungssymbole in tibetischen Thangkas (German Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5YcnAQAAIAAJ&dq=Der+Weg+zur+Mitte:+Wandlungssymbole+in+tibetischen+Thangkas+(German+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bread Machine Gourmet","description":"Automatic bread machines take the work out of making fresh, hot, nutritious bread.

What makes his work strikingly original is the way in which his contemplative approach is centered on the sacraments. Sometimes one gets the impression that certain mystics have found a way to God that bypasses these channels of grace, but for Juan de los Angeles, the mystical union of the human soul with our Lord is precisely a Eucharistic one; the individual believer in fact builds up the Church by his participation in this union with the One Body of Christ. Juan de los Angeles (1532-1609) also teaches the accessibility of holiness: the universal call to contemplation of the divine mysteries. He did not place too much weight on scholarship, after all: the book ends with the charming story of Brother Giles telling the idiotic old women that if they love God they will be holier than St. Bonaventure. Holiness has never been reserved for the learned and the clever: It belongs to all those who struggle to love.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Sl4IAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Loving+Struggle+Between+God+and+the+Soul+(Honeycomb)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"LIVING IN SIN : A Bishop Rethinks Human Sexuality","description":"Is celibacy the only moral alternative to marriage?

But they don t always know how to care for them. Hardly anyone is happy with American healthcare these days. Patients are getting sicker and going bankrupt from medical bills. Doctors are burning out and making dangerous mistakes. Both parties blame our nation s outdated and dysfunctional healthcare system. But that s only part of the problem. In this important and timely book, Dr. Robert Pearl shines a light on the unseen and often toxic culture of medicine. Today s physicians have a surprising disdain for technology, an unhealthy obsession with status, and an increasingly complicated relationship with their patients. All of this can be traced back to their earliest experiences in medical school, where doctors inherit a set of norms, beliefs, and expectations that shape almost every decision they make, with profound consequences for the rest of us. Uncaring draws an original and revealing portrait of what it s actually like to be a doctor. It illuminates the complex and intimidating world of medicine for readers, and in the end offers a clear plan to save American healthcare.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2b37DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Taino Revival: Critical Perspectives on Puerto Rican Identity and Cultural Politics","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Downright Dangerous: The Protectors (Silhouette Intimate Moments No. 1273)","description":"She had always been the good girl, putting her family first, never thinking of herself.

Sandy Hook. Columbine. The list of school shootings gets longer by the day, and it often seems like no school is safe. Over the last decades, school shootings have decimated communities and terrified parents, teachers, and children in even the most family friendly American towns and suburbs. We talk about these tragedies as the spontaneous acts of disconnected teens, but this important book argues that the roots of violence are deeply entwined in the communities themselves. Drawing on more than 200 interviews with town residents, sociologist Katherine Newman and her co-authors take the reader inside two of the most notorious school shootings of the 1990s, in Jonesboro, Arkansas, and Paducah, Kentucky. In a powerful and original analysis, she demonstrates that the organizational structure of schools encourage administrators to \\"lose\\" information about troubled kids, and the very closeness of these small rural towns restrained neighbors and friends from communicating what they knew about their problems. Rampage challenges the \\"loner theory\\" of school violence and shows why so many adults and students miss the warning signs that could prevent it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FcS6tAEACAAJ&dq=Rampage:+The+Social+Roots+of+School+Shootings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Statistical physics, (Their Course of theoretical physics)","description":"A lucid presentation of statistical physics and thermodynamics which develops from the general principles to give a large number of applications of the theory.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VzgJN-XPTRsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Murderer Next Door: Why the Mind Is Designed to Kill","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"S/Z: An Essay","description":"The essays in this volume were written during the years that its author's first four books were published in France.

Yet too many dying people suffer unnecessarily. While an \\"overtreated\\" dying is feared, untreated pain or emotional abandonment are equally frightening. Approaching Death reflects a wide-ranging effort to understand what we know about care at the end of life, what we have yet to learn, and what we know but do not adequately apply. It seeks to build understanding of what constitutes good care for the dying and offers recommendations to decisionmakers that address specific barriers to achieving good care. This volume offers a profile of when, where, and how Americans die. It examines the dimensions of caring at the end of life: Determining diagnosis and prognosis and communicating these to patient and family. Establishing clinical and personal goals. Matching physical, psychological, spiritual, and practical care strategies to the patient's values and circumstances. Approaching Death considers the dying experience in hospitals, nursing homes, and other settings and the role of interdisciplinary teams and managed care. It offers perspectives on quality measurement and improvement, the role of practice guidelines, cost concerns, and legal issues such as assisted suicide. The book proposes how health professionals can become better prepared to care well for those who are dying and to understand that these are not patients for whom \\"nothing can be done.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=klluAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The life and times of the Empress Pulcheria, A.D. 399- A.D. 452,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9k5oAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Underground Atlanta","description":"Atlanta Underground presents a city history through the lens of its buried and paved-over urban landscape. Atlanta has been built, rebuilt, destroyed and rebuilt so many times that it has created an artificial surface dozens of feet above the original ground plane, leaving room to explore the stories that lie below. Clues and paved-over evidence of the original streetscape are still accessible, but only to those who know where to look. The story begins with the railroads that brought people and business to Atlanta, and the intersections of transportation that Atlanta eventually outgrew. This tour of the city's history include the former sites of Union Station, Underground Atlanta and the Zero Milepost, and the unusual attempts to fill the void they left behind (a wax museum, musical instrument museum, a skating rink). Contemporary photos of this urban spelunking landscape will illustrate this telling of Atlanta s history: how it came to be where it is, how it acquired its unique name, and how its colliding street grids were established. The rapid growth and change of Atlanta s many lives has led to some downright interesting hidden locations and architectural curiosities, and AtlantaUnderground will reveal them one by one.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MFCwDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No One Noticed the Cat","description":"After the death of wise old Mangan, the Regent of Esphania, many of the regent's skills and qualities seem to have been transferred to his beautiful and intelligent cat, Niffy, who at once attaches herself to the new ruler, Prince Jamas.

But loving involves exposure, and to love she must expose the very things which protected her all her life - the masks she has hidden behind, the patchwork creations which stood in place of self. In Donna's relationship with Ian, a man with difficulties related to her own, we watch the two of them break through their rock-solid emotional barriers and dare to defy all the rules imposed by the autistic condition of 'exposure anxiety'. Their struggle is told with Donna's characteristic humour, insight and sense of fragility. Like Colour to the Blind is also the story of Alex, who was misdiagnosed as 'retarded' as well as autistic, and so gripped by 'exposure anxiety' that he has been virtually non-communicative all his life.

The product of a most unconventional education, Gabrielle is now more hoyden than lady. Her powerful captor doesn t frighten her with his threats. But, his commanding kiss sends shivers of desire through her body. The tenderness beneath his pride and arrogance, however, warns her that she is far too vulnerable. In the dark of night, she longs to understand the secret her enigmatic captor hides behind his mask of indifference. But by day, she plots her escape, fearing her heart and her will to resist him will soon be lost forever.  A joy to read!   RT Book Reviews  I consider Elizabeth Thornton a major find.

Democratic revolutions and the doctrine of universal human rights have captured the imagination of large sectors of humanity, while major advances in science and technology continue to conquer disease and extend life, contributing to rising standards of living, affluence, and cultural freedom on a worldwide basis. Paradoxically, at the same time ancient authoritarian fundamentalist religions have grown in vitriolic intensity along with bizarre New Age, media-driven paranormal belief systems. Also surprising is the resurgence of primitive tribal and ethnic loyalties, unleashing wars of intolerance and bitterness. In Skepticism and Humanism, Paul Kurtz locates these threatening developments within a long-standing and largely unchallenged theological worldview. He proposes, as an alternative to religion, a new cultural paradigm rooted in scientific naturalism, rationalism, and a humanistic outlook. An estimated 60 percent of scientists are atheists or agnostics. However, the skeptical world view has been given little currency even in advanced societies, because of a cultural prohibition against the criticism of religion. At the same time, science has become increasingly narrow and specialized so that few people can draw on its broader intellectual and cultural implications. Skepticism and Humanism attempts to meet this need. It defends skepticism as a method for developing reliable knowledge by using scientific inquiry and reason to test all claims to truth. It also defends scientific naturalism-an evolutionary view of nature, life, and the human species. Kurtz sees the dominant religious doctrines as drawn from an agricultural/nomadic past, and emphasizes the need for a new outlook applicable to the postindustrial information age. At the same time, he rejects postmodernism for abandoning science and embracing a form of nihilism. There can be no doubt that as a new global civilization emerges, scientific naturalism, rationalism, and secular humanism have something significant to say about the meaning of life. Skepticism and Humanism shows how they can to foster democratic values and social prosperity. The book will be important for philosophers, scientists, and all those concerned with contemporary issues. Paul Kurtz taught at Trinity College, Vassar College, and State University of New York at Buffalo. He is founder of Prometheus Books, a major publisher of philosophical works. He is the author of some thirty books including Toward a New Enlightenment (available from Transaction) Humanist Manifesto 2000, and A Secular Humanist Declaration. He is chairman of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, and editor-in-chief of Free Inquiry magazine.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q34zdaoq0xIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Life of Saint Nicholas","description":"Retells the story of the life of Saint Nicholas, from his miraculous birth and generous nature to the many miracles he performed during his life and after his death.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T1o6BAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Life+of+Saint+Nicholas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Macario (Cervantes & Co) (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b1BSPwAACAAJ&dq=Macario+(Cervantes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Persian Grammar: Students Edition","description":"The grammar in this book is comprehensive, and contains all that is necessary for the student to become thoroughly familiar with the language.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BrczxkTlZfgC&dq=Persian+Grammar:+Students+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Art Deco: Architecture and Regionalism","description":"A stunning, illustrated survey of Art Deco architecture throughout America celebrates sevety-five innovative guilding that reveal not only the finest principles of Deco design but also a regional individualism that typifies the best in Art Deco style.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fFYl779DJUYC&dq=American+Art+Deco:+Architecture+and+Regionalism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mastering MATLAB 6","description":"Suitable for undergraduate courses in MATLAB, or as a reference for any course where MATLAB is used.

In this history of aural culture in early-twentieth-century America, Emily Thompson charts dramatic transformations in what people heard and how they listened. What they heard was a new kind of sound that was the product of modern technology. They listened as newly critical consumers of aural commodities. By examining the technologies that produced this sound, as well as the culture that enthusiastically consumed it, Thompson recovers a lost dimension of the Machine Age and deepens our understanding of the experience of change that characterized the era. Reverberation equations, sound meters, microphones, and acoustical tiles were deployed in places as varied as Boston's Symphony Hall, New York's office skyscrapers, and the soundstages of Hollywood. The control provided by these technologies, however, was applied in ways that denied the particularity of place, and the diverse spaces of modern America began to sound alike as a universal new sound predominated.

With minerals accounting for 60% of business, discovery of iron ore in the area of the line brought major expansion, not only of local branches but also the north-south Newark-Melton and Leicester routes. This book gives a fascinating insight into the lines as they were originally built, the effect of the major expansion and traffic volumes, wartime traffics, and also covers the decline and closure of much of the system in the 50s and 60s. Modernisation and current operation of the Nottingham-Grantham line is also covered, with a review of the closed lines remaining features that today's visitors can find.

Or so it seems. Vice President Charlie Haskell, who will travel anywhere for a photo op, is about to cut the ribbon for the just-completed American Moonbase. The first Mars voyage is about to leave high orbit, with a woman at the helm. Below, the world is marveling at a rare solar eclipse. But all that is right is about to go disastrously wrong when an amateur astronomer discovers a new comet. Named for its discover, Tomikois a \\"sun-grazer,\\"an interstellar wanderer with a hundred times the mass and ten times the speed of other comets. And it is headed straight for our moon. In less than five days, if scientists' predictions are right, Tomiko will crash into the moon, shattering it into a cloud of superheated gas, dust, and huge chunks of rock that will rain down on the earth, causing chaos and killer storms, possibly tidal waves inundating entire cities...or worse: a single apocalyptic worldwide \\"extinction event.\\" In the meantime, the population of Moonbase must be evacuated by a hastily assembled fleet of shuttle rockets. There isn't room, or time enough, for everyone. And the vice president, who rashly promised to be last off (\\"I will lock the door and turn off the lights\\"), is trying to figure out how to get away without eating his words. In Moonfall,McDevitt has created a disaster thriller of truly epic proportions, featuring a cast of unforgettable characters: the reluctant Russian rocket jockey entrusted with the lives of squabbling refugees; the woman chosen to be first on the moon; the scientist who must deflect the \\"possum\\" (POSSible IMpactors) knocked from orbit or witness the end science itself. And at the center of it all is Charlie Haskell, the career politician who discovers his own unexpected reserves of only himself and his country, but for all humankind. Moonfall,is a spellbinding tale of heroism and hope, cowardice and passion played against the awesome spectacle of human history's darkest night.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y7xXdz_jcQkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Interiors","description":"Energetic, exuberant, personality-filled spaces from a 20-year interior design veteran.

Most trips were completed without incident. However, there were occasional mishaps, including derailments and collisions with other trains or highway vehicles. Most accidents were minor, while others made the national news, such as the October 30, 1972, collision of two commuter trains in Chicago that killed 45 passengers. The IC frequently had to deal with flooding, for the railroad ran in close proximity to several major rivers. In January and February 1937, much of the southern half of the railroad was shut down because of flooding on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. This book depicts many of the accidents that have taken place along the Illinois Central through the years.

Evil Hour in Colombia shows how patterns of political conflict, from the mid-nineteenth century to today s guerilla narco-traffickers and paramilitaries, explain the wear currently destroying Colombian lives, property, communities and territory. In doing so, it traces how Colombia s  coffee capitalism  gave way to the cattle and cocaine republic of the 1980s, and how land, wealth and power have been steadily accumulated by the light-skinned top of the social pyramid through a brutal combination of terror, expropriation and economic depression.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WOpOEAAAQBAJ&dq=Evil+Hour+in+Colombia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lessons That Change Writers: Lessons with 3-Ring Binder (Firsthand)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Strategies for Modern Living","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=21-nAAAACAAJ&dq=Strategies+for+Modern+Living&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Putting Humans First: Why We Are Nature's Favorite (Studies in Social, Political, and Legal Philosophy)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Wilderness in the Bible (Studies in Biblical Literature)","description":"Wilderness in many parts of the globe is under considerable threat from human development.

Authors James Kennedy and Caroline Simon track Hope College's responses to various social and intellectual challenges through careful analysis of school records, newspaper stories, extant histories, and interviews with faculty members and past presidents. Hope's history reveals that the school is exceptional, having followed the predictable trajectory, yet changing course in some ways. Given this unusual history, the story of why and how Hope College moved toward reestablishing the role of religion in its institutional life yields important lessons for other schools facing the same challenges. Neither an attack on Hope College nor the kind of celebratory institutional history that so many schools have authorized, this book is instead a thoughtful, instructive study written by two professors who have witnessed firsthand many of Hope's struggles to retain its identity and purpose. The book's narrative is enriched by the \\"binocular vision\\" provided by a professional historian and a professional philosopher, and collaboration has afforded Kennedy and Simon the critical distance necessary to ask hard questions about Hope and, by extension, other institutions like it. \\"Can Hope Endure?\\" will be of realinterest not only to readers associated with Hope College but also to those following or participating in the ongoing conversation about Christianity and higher education.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g8JLwNH_ZtUC&dq=Can+Hope+Endure%3F:+A+Historical+Case+Study+In+Christian+Higher+Education+(The+Histotical+Series+of+the+Reformed+Church+in+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rush to judgment","description":"Rush to Judgment is Mark Lane's seminal work on the assassination of President John F.

By interviewing witnesses throughout the country, comparing each of the Report's conclusions with its own corresponding evidence, and searching through the 26 volumes of evidence the President's Commission collected and thousands of documents found only in the National Archive in Washington, D.C., Lane truthfully investigates the assassination.

She also recalls her father telling her about Theodor Herzl's book Altneuland, literally \\"old-new land,\\" a prophetic vision of the future state of Israel.\\" \\"The author is as gifted with words and pen as she is with paints and brush, and she has composed a lively memoir filled with colorful images of a country and its people while revealing intimate glimpses of her quick humor and the love she shared with her husband.\\" \\"Israeli Journal is a bold and powerful piece of writing for Bernstein, illuminated by her painting and poetry. The author tells her readers that she \\"became imbued with feeling for the heritage the Jews had fought and died for,\\" and she could not write Israeli Journal without laying down the foundation of her own perceptions on the history and politics of Israel as she has come to understand them. As a result, this account is Bernstein's most exciting and complex literary endeavor.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Looking at the ways in which the poetry of Sappho, Alcaeus, Ibycus, Anacreon, and Simonides was preserved, edited, and read by Hellenistic scholars and poets, the book shows that Archaic poets often look very different in the new social, cultural, and political setting of Hellenistic Alexandria. For example, the Alexandrian Sappho evolves from the singer of Archaic Lesbos but has distinct associations and contexts, from Ptolemaic politics and Macedonian queens to the new phenomenon of the poetry book and an Alexandrian scholarship intent on preservation and codification. A study of Hellenistic poetic culture and an interpretation of some of the Archaic poets it so lovingly preserved, Arion's Lyre is also an examination of how one poetic culture reads another--and how modern readings of ancient poetry are filtered and shaped by earlier readings.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5ZGm9MhhdDgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Komikwerks, Volume 1","description":"Explore more of the dark and gritty history of America known as the Wild West!

These enigmatic, elusive images have had a profound and compelling impact on our visual reality, both feeding into and drawing from mainstream America's fascination with the subversive, the disowned, and the disillusioned. This innovative volume, a visual response to Chris Carter's dark, uneasy creation, collects the works of more than sixty cutting-edge artists. Representing a cross section of contemporary visual arts, these photographers, painters, scultptors, graphic designers, and digital media artists have produced works that reflect their personal interpretation of The X-Files: as a cultural phenomenon, as a new chapter in television history, as an engrossing cosmic conspiracy. Many pieces are accompanied by a statement from the artist, explaining the inspiration behind his or her contribution--ranging from an episode to a line of dialouge, form a particular incident to a theme within the entire series. Illustrated with video stills from the episodes, this volume shows the strong influence of The X-Files imagery on the artistic mind. In this introduction to this powerful collection of images, acclaimed writer William Gibson noted that The X-Files \\"is a disturbing and viscerally satisfying expression of where we've come from, where we are today, and all those places we simultaneously yearn and dread to go.\\" Starling, beautiful, and thought-provoking, this unusual volume expands the creative vision of The X-Files, and of contemporary art itself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y542HAAACAAJ&dq=Art+of+the+X-Files,+The&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PALGUE 1 2 3 OF TAE KWON DO HYUNG","description":"Nearly 200 illustrations delineate the first three forms required for brown belt as practiced by the Korean Taekwondo Association.

It represents an attempt at systematizing historical events. Other scholars have sought to employ similar approaches and methods. This has led in political science to the development of a series of theories and classificatory schemas for revolutions, wars, political systems, etc. The parallelistic approach assumes that such processes can not only be understood but manifestly justified and exposed through the use of predictive power. Currently this approach has identified two macro-historical patterns. The first is Revolution Pattern Type A, the second, Paternalistic Regime/Hegemonic War Pattern Type A.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r2ZYb4GkF9UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Road to Science Fiction Volume 4: From Here to Forever","description":"Now in Paperback! The Road to Science Fiction is a six-volume anthology that covers the development of this genre from its earliest prototypes to the current day. Created originally to provide anthologies for use in classrooms in the late 1970s, these volumes became mass-market sellers. Between an ancient Roman's trip to the moon and the fantastic tales of H.G. Wells lies a journey through time and space and an awesome evolution in scientific thinking. From Gilgamesh's search for immortality to Edgar Allan Poe's balloon trip in the year 2848 these and other key works are gathered together for the first time in one anthology, complete with revealing commentary on the authors, their eras, and the role each played in establishing what we today recognize as science fiction. Volume 4 From Here to Forever covers the period from 1950-1992, illustrating how science fiction can be as concerned with language and character as much as traditional fiction and anything in the mainstream. Includes stories by Jorge Luis Borges, Richard Matheson, C. M. Kornbluth, Jack Vance, and Pamela Zoline.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ABOdi6e5OiUC&dq=The+Road+to+Science+Fiction+Volume+4:+From+Here+to+Forever&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cybernetic Brains","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Cave-In","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Civil War Regiments from New Jersey, 1861-1865","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Alan Moore: Portrait Of An Extraordinary Gentleman","description":"Alan Moore: Portrait of an Extraordinary Gentleman contains comic strips, illustrations, essays, articles, anecdotes and other pieces contributed by top American, English, and international comics creators paying tribute to the master of comic book writing, Alan Moore (creator of Watchmen and From Hell), as he celebrates his 50th year.

He also believes that campaigns work. Even as television coverage, political ads, and opinion polls turn elections into field days for marketing professionals, Hart argues convincingly that campaigns do play their role in sustaining democracy, mainly because they bring about a dialogue among candidates, the press, and the people. Here he takes a close look at the exchange of ideas through language used in campaign speeches, political advertising, public debates, print and broadcast news, and a wide variety of letters to the editor. In each case, the participants choose their words differently, and this, according to Hart, can be a frustrating challenge to anyone trying to make sense of the issues. Yet he finds that the process is good for Americans: campaigns inform us about issues, sensitize us to the concerns of others, and either encourage us to vote or at least heighten our sense of the political world. Hart comes to his conclusions by using DICTION, a computer program that has enabled him to unearth substantive data, such as the many subtle shifts found in political language, over the past fifty years. This approach yields a rich variety of insights, including empirically based explanations of impressions created by political candidates. For example, in 1996 Bill Clinton successfully connected with voters by using many human-interest words--\\"you,\\" \\"us,\\" \\"people,\\" \\"family.\\" Bob Dole, however, alienated the public and even undermined his own claims of optimism by using an abundance of denial words--\\"can't,\\" \\"shouldn't,\\" \\"couldn't.\\" Hart also tracks issue buzzwords such as \\"Medicare\\" to show how candidates and voters define and readjust their positions throughout the campaign dialogue. In the midst of today's increased media hype surrounding elections, Americans and the candidates they elect do seem to be listening to each other--as much as they did in years gone by. Hart's wide-ranging, objective investigation upends many of our stereotypes about political life and presents a new, more bracing, understanding of contemporary electoral behavior.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2Y9PxY5wZZgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Real-time computing: With applications to data acquisition and control (Van Nostrand Reinhold electrical/computer science and engineering series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_dxTAAAAMAAJ&dq=Real-time+computing:+With+applications+to+data+acquisition+and+control+(Van+Nostrand+Reinhold+electrical/computer+science+and+engineering+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Long Way Home: The Unseen Trilogy, Book 3 (Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel crossover)","description":"As Buffy and Angel discover a link between their separate investigations into the disappearances of missing teenagers, rogue scientists discover how to open dimensional portals in Sunnydale, research that could have unexpected consequences.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F2wnzAUXKWcC&dq=Long+Way+Home:+The+Unseen+Trilogy,+Book+3+(Buffy+the+Vampire+Slayer+and+Angel+crossover)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Having Fun in Grandma's Day","description":"Each of the books in this series present 20th-century history for the very young through a personal account of a real life Grandma's experiences in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.

It sounds simple enough--only Kim can't. Because she doesn't have one. I Don't Have a Happy Place is an exploration of Kim's oftentimes irrational, at times self-induced, and nearly perpetual state of unhappiness, told through a series of humorous, autobiographical essays. Beginning with her childhood in the 1970s and extending through first jobs, first loves, marriage,and motherhood, Kim tries to explain why she's happiest at her most unhappy--and why she's completely fine with that. But, determined to change her ways for her children if nothing else, Kim moves her family from Brooklyn to southern Vermont to see if she can find happy for the first time in her life. Rife with evocative and nostalgic observations, unapologetic realism, and razor-sharp wit, I Don't Have a Happy Place is sure to make you laugh, nod your head compulsively in agreement, and ultimately feelempowered to ask: \\"Happy?

Once in America, he started his own business, fell in love, married, and bought a house. But he did not forget the country he left behind. In 1996, when one of his cousins helped start the Kosovo Liberation Army in the hope of securing Kosovo's independence, Florin chipped in to help. Over the next two years, Florin helped direct a network of Albanian  migr s across the U.S., raising millions of dollars for the rebel force. Soon he began visiting gun shows across America and running weapons and other supplies to the rebels. All the while he was also lobbying some of Washington's most powerful politicians. Eventually he helped recruit American volunteers, some of whom left schools and colleges in the New York area to fight for a homeland they hardly knew. Be Not Afraid, For You Have Sons in America tells the remarkable story of how a small group of young men in Kosovo backed by a network of  migr s in the United States started a guerrilla army that lured the world's most powerful military alliance into fighting their war and changed the course of history in the Balkans forever.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zZ9hmAEACAAJ&dq=Be+Not+Afraid,+for+You+Have+Sons+in+America:+How+a+Brooklyn+Roofer+Helped+Lure+the+U.S.+into+the+Kosovo+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"junket","description":"WHAT IS JUNKET?

Roberts argues that Nietzsche's conceptualization and cultivation of an affirmative self require that we interrogate the ambiguities that mark his criticisms of asceticism and mysticism. What emerges is a vision of Nietzsche's philosophy as the enactment of a spiritual quest informed by transfigured versions of religious tropes and practices. Nietzsche criticizes the ascetic hatred of the body and this-worldly life, yet engages in rigorous practices of self-denial--he sees philosophy as such a practice--and affirms the need of imposing suffering on oneself in order to enhance the spirit. He dismisses the \\"intoxication\\" of mysticism, yet links mysticism, power, and creativity, and describes his own self-transcending experiences. The tensions in his relation to religion are closely related to that between negation and affirmation in his thinking in general. In Roberts's view, Nietzsche's transfigurations of religion offer resources for a postmodern religious imagination. Though as a \\"master of suspicion,\\" Nietzsche, with Freud and Marx, is an integral part of modern antireligion, he has the power to take us beyond the flat, modern distinction between the secular and the religious--a distinction that, at the end of modernity, begs to be reexamined.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pmAD2KsqauQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quiet Diplomat: A Biography of Max M.

His troubled, tempestuous life paralleled the upheavals in American society during the 1960s and 1970s, and his desperate quest to prove his manhood was uncomfortably akin to the macho image projected by three successive presidents in their \\"tough\\" policy in Southeast Asia. Looking for a Hero extracts the real Joe Hooper from the welter of lies and myths that swirl around his story; in doing so, the book uncovers not only the complicated truth about an American hero but also the story of how Hooper's war was lost in Vietnam, not at home. Extensive interviews with friends, fellow soldiers, and family members reveal Hooper as a complex, gifted, and disturbed man. They also expose the flaws in his most famous and treasured accomplishment: earning the Medal of Honor. In the distortions, half-truths, and outright lies that mar Hooper's medal of honor file, authors Peter Maslowski and Don Winslow find a painful reflection of the army's inability to be honest with itself and the American public, with all the dire consequences that this dishonesty ultimately entailed. In the inextricably linked stories of Hooper and the Vietnam War, the nature of that deceit, and of America's defeat, becomes clear.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FdwBEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"National Geographic, Trails Illustrated, Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, USA (Trails Illustrated - Topo Maps USA)","description":"National Geographic's Trails Illustrated Maps are the most detailed and up-to-date topographic recreation maps available for US National Parks, National Forests and other popular outdoor recreation areas.

And like any harbinger of ill, he is sometimes mistaken for its creator. But he is not. He is clearing out space that has been polluted for too long. His acts of literary terrorism are acts that reclaim literature and art fiction from its cooption by fast-food-wielding advocates of disposability: what has been disposed by the dominant political culture has too often been literary artists. Those who have benefited have seldom been literary artists. Jaffe has worked brilliantly to save literature from its unwitting complicity in the elimination of readers who dare question authority.

Gilles Villemure was part of that transformation. The little goaltender had a long wait to make it to the National Hockey League, which had only six teams until after the middle of the decade. Eventually Villemure joined Eddie Giacomin to give the Rangers a strong 1-2 goaltending tandem. The Vezina Trophywinning twosome was a fixture for the Rangers, threatening to end the franchise s long Stanley Cup drought, only to come up short. Now, forty years later, Villemure writes about his days with the Rangers in the newly updated Tales from the Rangers Locker Room. Villemure tells stories about old pals like Rod Gilbert, Vic Hadfield, Brad Park, Jean Ratelle and his boss, Emile  The Cat  Francis. The Rangers finally won that Stanley Cup in 1994, ending over fifty years of frustration, but it was those Francis-led teams the ones with Villemure and Giacomin in the goal that brought New York s Blueshirts, Madison Square Garden s finest, to the top of the NHL. It is their influence that has continued to propel the Rangers forward even today, with a conference championship win in 2014 and the President s Trophy in 2015. Fans young and old will want to hear Villemure s stories come to life.

A New York Times Notable Book America's first frontier was not the West; it was the sea, and no one writes more eloquently about that watery wilderness than Nathaniel Philbrick. In his bestselling In the Heart of the Sea Philbrick probed the nightmarish dangers of the vast Pacific. Now, in an epic sea adventure, he writes about one of the most ambitious voyages of discovery the Western world has ever seen the U.S. Exploring Expedition of 18381842. On a scale that dwarfed the journey of Lewis and Clark, six magnificent sailing vessels and a crew of hundreds set out to map the entire Pacific Ocean and ended up naming the newly discovered continent of Antarctica, collecting what would become the basis of the Smithsonian Institution. Combining spellbinding human drama and meticulous research, Philbrick reconstructs the dark saga of the voyage to show why, instead of being celebrated and revered as that of Lewis and Clark, it has until now been relegated to a footnote in the national memory.

Roosevelt Naval History Prize","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0qOMDQAAQBAJ&dq=Sea+of+Glory:+America%27s+Voyage+of+Discovery:+The+U.S.+Exploring+Expedition,+1838-1842&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wake Up and Smell the Coffee","description":"The popular newspaper advice columnist shares anecdotes, advice, answers, and columns dealing with such issues as marital infidelity, AIDS, and homosexuality","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8rIuw5hrWEoC&dq=Wake+Up+and+Smell+the+Coffee&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crusade for conformity: The Ku Klux Klan in Texas, 1920-1930 (Texas Gulf Coast Historical Association. Publication series)","description":"Official Texas Ranger Bicentennial? Publication Newly rich in oil money, and all the trouble it could buy, Texas in the years following World War I underwent momentous changes and those changes propelled the transformation of the state s storied Rangers. Charles H. Harris III and Louis R. Sadler explore this important but relatively neglected period in the Texas Rangers  history in this book, a sequel to their award-winning The Texas Rangers and the Mexican Revolution: The Bloodiest Decade, 19101920. In a Texas awash in booze and oil in the Prohibition years, the Rangers found themselves riding herd on gamblers and bootleggers, but also tasked with everything from catching murderers to preventing circus performances on Sunday. The Texas Rangers in Transition takes up the Rangers  story at a time of political turmoil, as the largely rural state was rapidly becoming urban. At the same time, law enforcement was facing an epidemic of bank robberies, an increase in organized crime, the growth of the Ku Klux Klan, Prohibition enforcement new challenges that the Rangers met by transitioning from gunfighters to criminal investigators. Steeped in tradition, reluctant to change, the agency was reduced to its nadir in the depths of the Depression, the victim of slashed appropriations, an antagonistic governor, and mediocre personnel. Harris and Sadler document the further and final change that followed when, in 1935, the Texas Rangers were moved from the governor s control to the newly created Department of Public Safety. This proved a watershed in the Rangers  history, marking their transformation into a modern law enforcement agency, the elite investigative force that they remain to this day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7ZWSDwAAQBAJ&dq=Crusade+for+conformity:+The+Ku+Klux+Klan+in+Texas,+1920-1930+(Texas+Gulf+Coast+Historical+Association.+Publication+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deus Ex Machina (German Edition)","description":"Roland Huntford's brilliant history begins 20,000 years ago in the last ice age on the icy tundra of an unformed earth.

That it has developed into the leisure and sporting pursuit of choice by so much of the globe bears testament to its elemental appeal. In polar exploration, it has changed the course of history.

Born and raised in Drumheller and now living in Calgary Webber has a palpable connection to the places he photographs. His interpretations are direct, sincere and invested with a sense of history and intimacy that imbues his photographs with a heightened, surreal sense of colour and ambiguity that moves them from the ordinary into the realm of the extraordinary. Haunting, touching, evocative and enigmatic, these images occupy a place somewhere between everywhere and nowhere.\\" --Tobi Bruce, Curator at the Art Gallery of Hamilton The 200 colour photographs assembled in Webber's latest portfolio, Alberta Book, have been selected from an archive of work spanning nearly 40 years. In this collection viewers will find deteriorating signage that remains almost garishly bright; chrome details from vintage automobiles that still sparkle in the sun; forgotten buildings that have fallen into gentle disrepair; hand-painted window lettering that goes unread; and abandoned landscapes that echo with the whispers of residents long gone. Set against the bright blue Alberta sky or rolling clouds bursting with prairie thunder, these images glow with warm affection for the humble and reticent structures of Alberta's past. With narrative appreciations from award-winning Alberta writer Fred Stenson and acclaimed Alberta poet Rosemary Griebel, Alberta Book captures and preserves an important part of the province's visual heritage.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PRMstQEACAAJ&dq=Alberta&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Figure Piping Ideas for Cupcakes & Larger Cakes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C0mZAAAACAAJ&dq=Figure+Piping+Ideas+for+Cupcakes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Geometric Constructions (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Primer on Working with Resistance","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Confessio Amantis, Vol. 1: Prologue, Book 1, Book 8","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"CUMBERLAND ROAD (Can You Find?

This does not mean that life will be easy, in fact living in your purpose can be exactly the opposite. Filled with pain and struggles and doing things that you don't want to do, but there is purpose in your pain. Just as our DNA and our fingerprints are unique to each one of us, we are also unique beings when it comes to our journey, purpose, and destiny. God has a specific plan and purpose for each one of us. Our life, circumstances, physical features, and personality have all been put in place for us to fulfill our purpose. God is intentional and makes no mistakes. Romans 8:28 says \\"And we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them.\\" NLT Unfortunately, we often lose sight of this and become frustrated when life happens. The struggles, hardships, loses, and pain we experience begin to weigh us down. We lose hope and want to throw in the towel, but it is when we are at our weakest that God does his best work. It is often through the trials and tribulations that we begin to walk in our purpose. These situations build character and strength, but more importantly it builds our Faith. When we develop a relationship with our Father and seek his will in our lives we will find ourselves walking in our purpose.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vPyUtAEACAAJ&dq=Finding+Purpose+in+Your+Pain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"simple's uncle sam","description":"Hughes's most beloved character--Jesse B.

Alec Wilder is a rare example of a composer who established a reputation both as a prolific composer of concertos, sonatas, and operas, and as a popular songwriter [including the hit I'll Be Around]. He was fearsomely articulate and had a wide and varied circle of friends ranging from Graham Greene to Frank Sinatra and Stan Getz. Letters I Never Mailed, hailed at its first publication [in 1975, by Little, Brown], tells the story of Wilder's musical and personal life through unsent letters addressed to various friends. In it, he shares his insights -- and sometimes salty opinions -- on composing, musical life, and the tension between art and commercialism. Thisnew, scholarly edition leaves Wilder's original text intact but decodes the mysteries of the original through an annotated index that identifies the letters' addressees, a biographical essay by David Demsey, and photographs by renowned photographer and lifelong friend of Wilder, Louis Ouzer. David Demsey is Professor of Music and coordinator of jazz studies at William Paterson University and an active jazz and classical saxophonist.

By the end it had become one of the central components of contemporary thought. The growth of science as a profession began taking shape in the Victorian period and was due to the influence of just a small group of men. Who these men were and how they created the foundations of the modern scientific community we recognize today is revealed, in this thought-provoking book by Jack Meadows, through the individual experiences of figures such as Darwin, Huxley, and Faraday, as well as lesser-known scientists of the time. Set against the backdrop of a changing world of improved communication and travel, Meadows uncovers how these scientists fought against the limitations of an education in the classics and strove to develop their scientific interests into a profession. The Victorian Scientist tracks the growth of laboratories and research groups, and the importance that new scientific societies, journals, and lectures played in making Victorian science an essential stage in the evolution of scientific communication today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-doQAQAAIAAJ&dq=Victorian+Scientist:+The+Growth+of+a+Profession&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond the Random Walk: A Guide to Stock Market Anomalies and Low Risk Investing","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Silent Partner","description":"At a party for a controversial Los Angeles sex therapist, Alex Delaware encounters a face from his own pastNSharon Ransom, an exquisite, alluring lover who left him more than a decade earlier.

Nowadays they are making a celebrated comeback with all of the big car manufacturers featuring at least one flagship small car, from DaimlerChrysler's Smart and BMW's Mini to Nissan's Micra. But what are the factors, now and then, that turned the microcar into a viable alternative to the 'normal' car? How have the aspirations and ideas behind the microcar changed over the decades? The cars themselves have undoubtedly undergone a radical transformation. Whereas the current trend in small cars is led by environmental concerns, the first phase of the microcar phenomenon was determined by economic necessity: many manufacturers of planes, trains, and white goods had to re-invent themselves as producers of automobiles. The result was a proliferation of small, cheap and extraordinary looking three- and four-wheeled vehicles. This book looks at the social and cultural conditions behind the rise, the fall and the ultimate resurrection of the small car, and features some of the most fascinating and best-loved examples. With the debate over transport, sustainability, congestion, fuel consumption, taxation and the environment high on the agenda, there has never been a better time than now to examine the role of the microcar.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=66sfAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Macro+World+of+Micro+Cars&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dimension Thirteen (Ballantine SF, 01601)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nkE6AQAAIAAJ&dq=Dimension+Thirteen+(Ballantine+SF,+01601)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Essential Spanish Grammar Pb","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Grapes of Ralph: Wine According to Ralph Steadman","description":"Through pictures and prose, readers look at the great wines of the world and the people who make them, including an often humorous view of the world of vineyards, presses, and wine tasting","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SWTgPQAACAAJ&dq=The+Grapes+of+Ralph:+Wine+According+to+Ralph+Steadman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PDQ Statistics","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"365 Adventures: Explore, Discover, Try Something New Every Day","description":"From Discovery Kids* comes a year's supply of ideas for children to experiment with and be thrilled by the real world.

Rich with powerful never-before-published details from the author s interviews with more than 150 U.S. soldiers who liberated the Nazi death camps, The Liberators is an essential addition to the literature of World War II and a stirring testament to Allied courage in the face of inconceivable atrocities. Taking us from the beginnings of the liberators  final march across Germany to V-E Day and beyond, Michael Hirsh allows us to walk in their footsteps, experiencing the journey as they themselves experienced it. But this book is more than just an in-depth account of the liberation. It reveals how profoundly these young men were affected by what they saw the unbelievable horror and pathos they felt upon seeing  stacks of bodies like cordwood  and  skeletonlike survivors  in camp after camp. That life-altering experience has stayed with them to this very day. It s been well over half a century since the end of World War II, and they still haven t forgotten what the camps looked like, how they smelled, what the inmates looked like, and how it made them feel. Many of the liberators suffer from what s now called post-traumatic stress disorder and still experience Holocaust-related nightmares. Here we meet the brave souls who now in their eighties and nineties have chosen at last to share their stories. Corporal Forrest Robinson saw masses of dead bodies at Nordhausen and was so horrified that he lost his memory for the next two weeks. Melvin Waters, a 4-F volunteer civilian ambulance driver, recalls that a woman at Bergen-Belsen  fought us like a cat because she thought we were taking her to the crematory.  Private Don Timmer used his high school German to interpret for General Dwight Eisenhower during the supreme Allied commander s visit to Ohrdruf, the first camp liberated by the Americans. And Phyllis Lamont Law, an army nurse at Mauthausen-Gusen, recalls the shock and, ultimately,  the hope  that  you can save a few.  From Bergen-Belsen in northern Germany to Mauthausen in Austria, The Liberators offers readers an intense and unforgettable look at the Nazi death machine through the eyes of the men and women who were our country s witnesses to the Holocaust. The liberators  recollections are historically important, vivid, riveting, heartbreaking, and, on rare occasions, joyous and uplifting. This book is their opportunity, perhaps for the last time, to tell the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J0ESOgh7xv4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mountain interval,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=j6auAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Tale of the Scale: An Odyssey of Invention","description":"In the mid-1980s, Solly Angel had a technological mini-vision. He saw in his mind's eye a quarter-inch thick personal scale weighing a pound--a travel scale--and he decided to make it a reality, to bring it to market. The Tale of the Scale is a rare first-person account of the process of invention and design as it unfolds in the remaking of the familiar bathroom scale. It is rare because inventors seldom have the inclination to articulate their thought processes and to recount their experiences in great detail. Written by an inventor, the book stands apart from recent books about inventors. Angel, an urban planner by profession, had no mechanical skills as he embarked on his journey. The Tale records his transformation, over the course of a decade, from a bungling ignoramus to an expert on thin scales. Readers know as much about scales--or about invention for that matter--as Angel does at the beginning of the journey. Listening to Angel's unfolding story, they learn about the intricacies of invention and design as Angel finds out about them. The Tale of the Scale is truly an odyssey of invention. The pursuit of the thin scale takes readers to fascinating places--from Bangkok to Rolling Hills, California, from Groningen in the Netherlands to Murrhardt in Germany, and from New York to Tokyo. But the places Angel explores are not only visually different. They are realms of knowledge inhabited by people with diverse yet complementary outlooks on the invention process--engineers, designers, lawyers, product development specialists, corporate functionaries, and friends who philosophize on the deeper meanings of one's life pursuits.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NZv3Y1mWjyYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dreadmire [Spellbinder Games, d20]","description":"This highly detailed Dungeons & Dragons swamp module can be adapted for any campaign setting.

Foreword by Daniel Goleman, author of Emotional Intelligence ? Is there a memory that torments you, or an irrational fear you can't shake? ? Do you sometimes become unreasonably angry or upset and find it hard to calm down? ? Do you ever wonder why you can't stop behaving the way you do, no matter how hard you try? ? Are you and your child (or parent, partner, or boss) locked in a seemingly inevitable pattern of conflict? What if you could escape traps like these and live a fuller, richer, happier life? This isn't mere speculation but the result of twenty-five years of careful hands-on clinical work by Daniel J. Siegel, M.D. A Harvard-trained physician, Dr. Siegel is one of the revolutionary global innovators in the integration of brain science into the practice of psychotherapy. Using case histories from his practice, he shows how, by following the proper steps, nearly everyone can learn how to focus their attention on the internal world of the mind in a way that will literally change the wiring and architecture of their brain. Through his synthesis of a broad range of scientific research with applications to everyday life, Dr. Siegel has developed novel approaches that have helped hundreds of patients. And now he has written the first book that will help all of us understand the potential we have to create our own lives. Showing us mindsight in action, Dr. Siegel describes ? a sixteen-year-old boy with bipolar disorder who uses meditation and other techniques instead of drugs to calm the emotional storms that made him suicidal ? a woman paralyzed by anxiety, who uses mindsight to discover, in an unconscious memory of a childhood accident, the source of her dread ? a physicianthe author himselfwho pays attention to his intuition, which he experiences as a \\"vague, uneasy feeling in my belly, a gnawing restlessness in my heart and my gut,\\" and tracks down a patient who could have gone deaf because of an inaccurately written prescription for an ear infection ? a twelve-year-old girl with OCD who learns a meditation that is \\"like watching myself from outside myself\\" and, using a form of internal dialogue, is able to stop the compulsive behaviors that have been tormenting her These and many other extraordinary stories illustrate how mindsight can help us master our emotions, heal our relationships, and reach our fullest potential.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gXf2aZitl9wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wee Sing and Learn ABC","description":"Uses songs, simple text, and illustrations to introduce the alphabet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HI_Do3jgfzwC&dq=Wee+Sing+and+Learn+ABC&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Disciplines of a Godly Woman (Paperback Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"African American Lives: The Struggle for Freedom, Combined Volume","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Student Solutions Manual to Accompany Physics, 5th Edition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MKIJAAAACAAJ&dq=Student+Solutions+Manual+to+Accompany+Physics,+5th+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Foreign military sales: Course manual","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The cruise of the Nona;: The story of a cruise from Holyhead to the Wash, with reflections and judgments on life and letters, men and manners,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"HIGHPOCKETS","description":"Cecil  Highpockets  McDade is known for his ego, his ambition, and his batting average but a freak accident may help him discover what s really important A rookie right fielder for the Brooklyn Dodgers, Cecil  Highpockets  McDade shows plenty of promise.

Here on Roanoke Island in the 1580s, the first English colony in the New World was established.

But this assumption is far from accurate. Throughout history the style and subject matter of sermons have repeatedly changed to meet the shifting needs of congregations molded by contemporary events. \\"A Mirror for the Church\\" explores this dynamic as it developed in the early church. In examining sermons preached during the first five centuries of church history, David Dunn-Wilson answers some important questions: Who were the first preachers? What did they preach about, and what methods did they use? What kinds of people made up the first congregations, and how did they relate to the world around them? In the process, Dunn-Wilson uncovers the homiletic themes that remained constant in early church history and shows how preachers and their churches adapted to waves of social change. He also suggests ways in which the priorities of the early church might inform preaching and Christian practice today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ym4S7g78V5MC&dq=A+Mirror+for+the+Church:+Preaching+in+the+First+Five+Centuries&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The expression of the emotions in man and animals,","description":"Published in 1872, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals was a book at the very heart of Darwin's research interests - a central pillar of his 'human' series.

In this book a teenager tenderly washes her mother's body, a community organizer cries outrage over his blood-soaked comrade, a father builds a coffin for his infant son, martyrs are honored by a former political prisoner, a young scholar's experiences in Palestine shape her reading of the Exodus narrative, and a community of gardeners plant trees at urban-core murder sites. Drawing from sources such as the peace movement, the Catholic Worker, and Occupy, these stories make connections between medicine delivery, labor picket lines, and PICC-lines; between jazz funeral secondlines and the front lines of countless struggles. Part pastoral theology, part movement history, this book powerfully demonstrates that resisting the power of death is at the heart of Christian discipleship, and that in a culture that fears death, we will only find resurrection in facing it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=s2dNAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PEARLHANGER.","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Good Ol' Southern Gospel: Easy Piano","description":"(Easy Piano Songbook).

Editor Gesa Elsbeth Thiessen has taken a careful, inclusive approach to the book, including articles and extracts that are diverse and ecumenical as well as representative of gender and ethnicity. The book is organized chronologically, and each historical period begins with commentary by Thiessen that sets the selections in context. These engaging readings range broadly over themes at the intersection of religion and the arts, including beauty and revelation, the vision of God, artistic and divine creation, God as artist, images of God, the interplay of the senses and the intellect, human imagination, mystical writings, meanings of signs and symbols, worship, liturgy, doxology, the relationship of word and image, icons and iconoclasm, the role of the arts in twentieth-century theology, and much more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NPNXzBLMg5YC&dq=Theological+Aesthetics:+A+Reader&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Situationist International: A User's Guide","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Step-by-Step Wiring (Better Homes & Gardens Step-By-Step)","description":"Features more than forty basic wiring projects for repairing or improving home wiring, discussing tools, materials, and troubleshooting","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ujtufp5K8HsC&dq=Step-by-Step+Wiring+(Better+Homes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Unc' Billy Possum","description":"When Unc' Billy Possum learns how easy it is to get into trouble, it takes some doin' to get himself out of his predicament.

In Analytic Narratives, five senior scholars offer a new and ambitious methodological response to this important question. By employing rational-choice and game theory, the authors propose a way of extracting empirically testable, general hypotheses from particular cases. The result is both a methodological manifesto and an applied handbook that political scientists, economic historians, sociologists, and students of political economy will find essential. In their jointly written introduction, the authors frame their approach to the origins and evolution of political institutions. The individual essays that follow demonstrate the concept of the analytic narrative--a rational-choice approach to explain political outcomes--in case studies. Avner Greif traces the institutional foundations of commercial expansion in twelfth-century Genoa. Jean-Laurent Rosenthal analyzes how divergent fiscal policies affected absolutist European governments, while Margaret Levi examines the transformation of nineteenth-century conscription laws in France, the United States, and Prussia. Robert Bates explores the emergence of a regulatory organization in the international coffee market. Finally, Barry Weingast studies the institutional foundations of democracy in the antebellum United States and its breakdown in the Civil War. In the process, these studies highlight the economic role of political organizations, the rise and deterioration of political communities, and the role of coercion, especially warfare, in political life. The results are both empirically relevant and theoretically sophisticated. Analytic Narratives is an innovative and provocative work that bridges the gap between the game-theoretic and empirically driven approaches in political economy. Political historians will find the use of rational-choice models novel; theorists will discover arguments more robust and nuanced than those derived from abstract models. The book improves on earlier studies by advocating--and applying--a cross-disciplinary approach to explain strategic decision making in history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WF3sDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brave New Voices: The YOUTH SPEAKS Guide to Teaching Spoken Word Poetry","description":"Utilizing student examples from their spoken word poetry workshops, Weiss and Herndon present their methods and outline a practical five-week course that fosters poetic awareness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eP95AAAAIAAJ&dq=Brave+New+Voices:+The+YOUTH+SPEAKS+Guide+to+Teaching+Spoken+Word+Poetry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Virginia & the Capital Region Smithsonian Guides (Smithsonian Guide to Historic America)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Cleopatra in the Night: Poems","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wpbN8hAhcrkC&dq=Cleopatra+in+the+Night:+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Transforming Care: A Christian Vision Of Nursing Practice","description":"Nursing involves skill, judgment, compassion, and respect for human life whether or not the nurse is a Christian.

Suggesting that such faith entails something more essential than evangelism or a certain position on moral dilemmas, they deal with the ordinary, everyday nature of nursing practice. The first part of the book articulates the relationship between Christian faith and nursing practice while analyzing the concepts of nursing, person, environment, and health common to nursing literature. The second part describes and evaluates nursing practice in three different health care contexts: acute care settings, mental health facilities, and community care contexts. Sidebars throughout the book offer thought-provoking quotations from well-known authors and nursing experts. Contributors: Cheryl Brandsen Bart Cusveller Mary Molewyk Doornbos Mary Flikkema Ruth E.

Not surprisingly, therefore, Christine de Pizan's The Book of Deeds of Arms and of Chivalry, written around 1410, has often been regarded with disdain. Many have assumed that Christine was simply copying or pilfering earlier military manuals. But, as Sumner Willard and Charity Cannon Willard show in this faithful English translation, The Book of Deeds of Arms and of Chivalry contains much that is original to Christine. As a military manual it tells us a great deal about the strategy, tactics, and technology of medieval warfare and is one of our most important sources for early gunpowder weapon technology. It also includes a fascinating discussion of Just War. Since the end of the fifteenth century, The Book of Deeds of Arms and of Chivalry has been available primarily through Antoine V rard's imprint of 1488 or William Caxton's 1489 translation, The Book of the Order of Chivalry. V rard even suggested that the work was his own translation of the Roman writer Vegetius, making no mention of Christine 's name. Caxton attributed the work to Christine, but it is impossible to identify the manuscript he used for his translation. Moreoever, both translations are inaccurate. The Willards correct these inaccuracies in a clear and easy-to-read translation, which they supplement with notes and an introduction that will greatly benefit students, scholars, and enthusiasts alike. Publication of this work should change our perception both of medieval warfare and of Christine de Pizan.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8E2UzgEACAAJ&dq=The+Book+of+Deeds+of+Arms+and+of+Chivalry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"3-D Cake Cartooning","description":"Cartoon Cakes is the eagerly awaited book from Debbie Brown, the UK's best-selling author of character and novelty cake books.

An epic unlike any other, it rejects point by point the aesthetics of Vergil's Aeneid and describes a society and a cosmos plunged into anarchy. Language was a casualty of this anarchy. All terminological certitudes were lost, including those that traditionally attach to the Latin word virtus: heroism on the battlefield, rectitude in the conduct of life. The Taste for Nothingness traces Lucan's own analytical method by showing how virtus and related concepts operate--or rather, fail to operate--in Lucan's appropriations and distortions of the traditional epic-battle narrative; in the philosophical commitment of Cato the Younger; and in the personalities of the two antagonists, Pompey and Caesar. Much recent scholarship has reached a consensus that Lucan's literary method is mimetic, that his belief in a chaotic cosmos produces a poetics of chaos. While accepting many of the recent findings about Lucan's view of language and the universe, The Taste for Nothingness also allows an even bolder Lucan to emerge: a committed aesthete who regards art as the only realm in which order is possible.

The story recounted the success of the Weigh Down Workshop, the nation's largest Christian diet corporation and the subject of extensive press coverage from Larry King Live to the New Yorker. In the United States today, hundreds of thousands of people are making diet a religious duty by enrolling in Christian diet programs and reading Christian diet literature like What Would Jesus Eat? and Fit for God. Written with style and wit, far ranging in its implications, and rich with the stories of real people, Born Again Bodies launches a provocative yet sensitive investigation into Christian fitness and diet culture. Looking closely at both the religious roots of this movement and its present-day incarnations, R. Marie Griffith vividly analyzes Christianity's intricate role in America's obsession with the body, diet, and fitness. As she traces the underpinning of modern-day beauty and slimness ideals as well as the bigotry against people who are overweight Griffith links seemingly disparate groups in American history including seventeenth-century New England Puritans, Progressive Era New Thought adherents, and late-twentieth-century evangelical diet preachers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dGtHZImY4lcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prayers of a God Chaser: Passionate Prayers of Pursuit","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The French cat (A Fireside book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YrL0AAAACAAJ&dq=The+French+cat+(A+Fireside+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rick Steves' Venice 2004","description":"Updating this guide for 2004, Steves covers all the top sights of the water-logged, history-filled city, including St. Mark's Basilica, the Doge's Palace, the Rialto Bridge, and the Peggy Guggenheim Collection.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ihm3GwAACAAJ&dq=Rick+Steves%27+Venice+2004&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Resurrection Eggs (Parenting)","description":"Miss Pattycake recites a rhyme about many colored eggs, each of which contains something which helps to tell the story of Easter and Jesus' resurrection.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=42YBtBI3BaAC&dq=Resurrection+Eggs+(Parenting)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Angel in the Darkness","description":"Tales of alpha angels...from four alpha authors.

Sophie Gordon didn't let her epilepsy get in the way of her life as a teacher of deaf children. But without her trusty canine companion, an indispensable service dog named Blanche, she wouldn't be nearly as well-off. A service dog that can perform the difficult tasks that epilepsy requires--sensing when a seizure is about to occur and fetching life-saving medication--is extremely rare, so when a veterinarian's office promises that they can clone Blanche, Sophie jumps at the opportunity. Her former worries can now be put to rest, knowing that now she'll have a replacement for Blanche when the time comes. But the puppy they provided didn't have what it takes to be a service dog, and when Sophie visits the vet to alert them of the problem, none of the staff is anywhere to be found--they've disappeared without a trace. To get to the bottom of this clone-by-night operation, Sophie hires P.I. Rachel Alexander and Dash, her pit bull partner. And two days after meeting with Rachel, Sophie is found dead, apparently of a seizure, but it didn't take Dash's sensitive nose to tell that something doesn't smell right, and that the missing vets definitely need further examination.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xudrdGbR9eYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Write What I Like","description":"On 12th September 1977, Steve Biko was murdered in his prison cell.

This book by Wiktor Marek and Miroslaw Truszczynski is an elegant treatment of a large body of these results. It provides the first comprehensive treatment of two influen tial nonmonotonic logics - autoepistemic and default logic - and describes a number of surprising and deep unifying relationships between them. It also relates them to various modal logics studied in the philosophical logic litera ture, and provides a thorough treatment of their applications as foundations for logic programming semantics and for truth maintenance systems. It is particularly appropriate that Marek and Truszczynski should have authored this book, since so much of the research that went into these results is due to them. Both authors were trained in the Polish school of logic and they bring to their research and writing the logical insights and sophisticated mathematics that one would expect from such a background. I believe that this book is a splendid example of the intellectual maturity of the field of artificial intelligence, and that it will provide a model of scholarship for us all for many years to come.

Elegant, noble, and spiritual, the sandhill crane is one of the most ancient of all birds. More than a half-million strong, flying in squadrons, these majestic creatures point northward to their Arctic and sub-Arctic breeding ranges. Theirs is an epic story of endurance through the ages. With 153 stunning color photographs, On Ancient Wings presents sandhill cranes in their wild but increasingly compromised habitats today. Over the course of five years, Michael Forsberg documented the tall gray birds in habitats ranging from the Alaskan tundra, to the arid High Plains, from Cuban nature preserves to suburban backyards. With an eye for beauty and an uncommon persistence, the author documents the cranes  challenges to adapt and survive in a rapidly changing natural world. Forsberg argues that humankind, for its own sake, should secure the cranes  place in the future. On Ancient Wings intertwines the lives of cranes, people, and their common places to tell an ancient story at a time when sandhill cranes and their wetland and grassland habitats face daunting prospects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lVxGAQAAMAAJ&dq=On+Ancient+Wings:+The+Sandhill+Cranes+of+North+America+(Natural+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fast Sketching Techniques: Capture the Fundamental Essence of Elusive Subjects","description":"It can happen at any moment - A powerful light effect.

What was it like to hear the biblical proclamation of this coming for the first time in a cultural, political, and religious context very different from our own? How did early Christians think about the imminence of the promised day of the Lord? What difference did this message make to how they thought, lived, and spread the gospel message? This book engages the minds of jaded twenty-first-century postmoderns who have heard it all before. By seeing the fulfilment of much of New Testament apocalyptic in events of the first centuries, Perriman proposes that in some important sense we have moved beyond eschatology--into an age of renewed community and mission that is creational in its scope. The Coming of the Son of Man is important reading for those who want to engage in the debate concerning what church is--and will be.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=15hNAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The End of the Rainbow (Hudson Family, Book 4)","description":"Final haunting novel in the national bestselling Hudson series!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3j0-PgAACAAJ&dq=The+End+of+the+Rainbow+(Hudson+Family,+Book+4)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE BOYS OF '76; A HISTORY OF THE BATTLES OF THE REVOLUTION.

While that earlier work took as its starting point the biblical proclamation of God's authority, The Ways of Judgment approaches political theology from the political side. Responsive to developments such as the uncertain role of the United Nations after the Cold War and the expansion of the European Union, O'Donovan also draws on the extensive tradition of Christian political thought and a range of contemporary theologians. Rather than supposing, as does some political theology, that the right political orientations are well understood and that theological beliefs should be renegotiated to fit them, O'Donovan considers contemporary social and political realities to be impenetrably obscure and elusive. Finding the gospel proclamation luminous by contrast, O'Donovan sheds light from the Christian faith upon the intricate challenge of seeking the good in late-modern Western society. Pursuing his analysis in three movements, O'Donovan first considers the paradigmatic political act, the act of judgment, and then takes up the question of forming political institutions through representation. Finally, he tackles the opposition between political institutions and the church, provocatively investigating how Christians can be the community instructed by Jesus to \\"judge not.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tOZdcOl4UaAC&dq=The+Ways+Of+Judgment:+The+Bampton+Lectures,+2003&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clan Novel: Brujah (Vampire: The Masquerade)","description":"The Vampire the Masquerade Clan Novel Saga is a thirteen-volume masterpiece, presenting the war between the established Camarilla leadership and the growing power of the brutal Sabbat on the East Coast of the United States.

Of special interest is the complex relationship between indigenous ecological practices and other ways of interacting with the environment, particularly regional and national programs of natural resource management. Focusing primarily on the northwest coast of North America, scholars look at the challenges and opportunities confronting the local practice of indigenous ecological knowledge in a range of communities, including the Tsimshian, the Nisga a, the Tlingit, the Gitksan, the Kwagult, the Sto:lo, and the northern Dene in the Yukon. The experts consider how traditional knowledge is taught and learned and address the cultural importance of different subsistence practices using natural elements such as seaweed (Gitga a), pine mushrooms (Tsimshian), and salmon (Tlingit). Several contributors discuss the extent to which national and regional programs of resource management need to include models of TEK in their planning and execution. This volume highlights the different ways of seeing and engaging with the natural world and underscores the need to acknowledge and honor the ways that indigenous peoples have done so for generations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0l5YfKgEV_wC&dq=Traditional+Ecological+Knowledge+and+Natural+Resource+Management&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Conquer Fear!","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"For Solo Violin: A Jewish Childhood in Fascist Italy","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Reading Don't Fix No Chevys: Literacy in the Lives of Young Men","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The House of Wisdom, a Pilgrimage","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Fun With Next To Nothing","description":"Step-by-step instructions explain how to use odds and ends to make models of items such as a covered wagon, a Viking ship, an igloo, a chariot, and a castle.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8NQEAQAAIAAJ&dq=Fun+With+Next+To+Nothing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Squaring the Circle (Circle of Light, Book 4)","description":"Welcome to Atlanton Earth!

An  outstanding new intellectual biography of John Maynard Keynes [that moves] swiftly along currents of lucidity and wit  (The New York Times), illuminating the world of the influential economist and his transformative ideas  A timely, lucid and compelling portrait of a man whose enduring relevance is always heightened when crisis strikes.  The Wall Street Journal WINNER: The Arthur Ross Book Award Gold Medal ? The Hillman Prize for Book Journalism FINALIST: The National Book Critics Circle Award ? The Sabew Best in Business Book Award NAMED ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY PUBLISHERS WEEKLY AND ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY Jennifer Szalai, The New York Times ? The Economist ? Bloomberg ? Mother Jones At the dawn of World War I, a young academic named John Maynard Keynes hastily folded his long legs into the sidecar of his brother-in-law s motorcycle for an odd, frantic journey that would change the course of history. Swept away from his placid home at Cambridge University by the currents of the conflict, Keynes found himself thrust into the halls of European treasuries to arrange emergency loans and packed off to America to negotiate the terms of economic combat. The terror and anxiety unleashed by the war would transform him from a comfortable obscurity into the most influential and controversial intellectual of his day a man whose ideas still retain the power to shock in our own time. Keynes was not only an economist but the preeminent anti-authoritarian thinker of the twentieth century, one who devoted his life to the belief that art and ideas could conquer war and deprivation. As a moral philosopher, political theorist, and statesman, Keynes led an extraordinary life that took him from intimate turn-of-the-century parties in London s riotous Bloomsbury art scene to the fevered negotiations in Paris that shaped the Treaty of Versailles, from stock market crashes on two continents to diplomatic breakthroughs in the mountains of New Hampshire to wartime ballet openings at London s extravagant Covent Garden. Along the way, Keynes reinvented Enlightenment liberalism to meet the harrowing crises of the twentieth century. In the United States, his ideas became the foundation of a burgeoning economics profession, but they also became a flash point in the broader political struggle of the Cold War, as Keynesian acolytes faced off against conservatives in an intellectual battle for the future of the country and the world. Though many Keynesian ideas survived the struggle, much of the project to which he devoted his life was lost. In this riveting biography, veteran journalist Zachary D. Carter unearths the lost legacy of one of history s most fascinating minds. The Price of Peace revives a forgotten set of ideas about democracy, money, and the good life with transformative implications for today s debates over inequality and the power politics that shape the global order.

It must also take into account peoples' ability to weigh options carefully and act prudently. Understanding one's own intellectual shortcomings, and learning how to overcome, is as important as developing one's strengths. Sternberg develops a vision of human intelligence that is far more nuanced and accurate than anything previously offered.

But the challenge of unifying climate control and building functionality, of securing a managed environment within a natural setting--and combating the harsh forces of wind, water, and sun--presented a new set of obstacles to architects and engineers in the mid-twentieth century. First published in 1963, Design with Climate was one of the most pioneering books in the field and remains an important reference for practitioners, teachers, and students, over fifty years later. In this book, Victor Olgyay explores the impact of climate on shelter design, identifying four distinct climatic regions and explaining the effect of each on orientation, air movement, site, and materials. He derives principles from biology, engineering, meteorology, and physics, and demonstrates how an analytical approach to climate management can merge into a harmonious and aesthetically sound design concept. This updated edition contains four new essays that provide unique insights on issues of climate design, showing how Olgyay's concepts work in contemporary practice. Ken Yeang, John Reynolds, Victor W. Olgyay, and Donlyn Lyndon explore bioclimatic design, eco design, and rational regionalism, while paying homage to Olgyay's impressive groundwork and contributions to the field of architecture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fuOyMgEACAAJ&dq=Design+with+climate:+Bioclimatic+approach+to+architectural+regionalism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Komikwerks Presents: Thrills & Chills","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mallorca Travel Map","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"How we got the Bible (The living word series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2LokngEACAAJ&dq=How+we+got+the+Bible+(The+living+word+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Microwave Antenna Theory and Design (MIT Radiation Laboratory Series 12)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A History of Medieval Christianity: Prophecy & Order.","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"William Faulkner (Writers and Critics)","description":"Few twentieth-century writers are as revered as William Faulkner.

Though often somber, \\"Sword of Honor\\" is also a brilliant comedy, peopled by the fantastic figures so familiar from Waugh's early satires. The deepest pleasures these novels afford come from observing a great satiric writer employ his gifts with extraordinary subtlety, delicacy, and human feeling, for purposes that are ultimately anything but satiric.\\"Sword of Honor\\" comprises the three acclaimed novels \\"Men at Arms, Officers and Gentlemen, \\"and\\" Unconditional Surrender.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Lb3yAAAAMAAJ&dq=Sword+of+Honour+Trilogy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Visual Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs","description":"Updated with the latest discoveries about the prehistoric world!

In this book we are concerned with the construction of the former. Our intent is to provide the reader with a firm theoretical basis for compiler construction and sound engineering principles for selecting alternate methods, imple menting them, and integrating them into a reliable, economically viable product. The emphasis is upon a clean decomposition employing modules that can be re-used for many compilers, separation of concerns to facilitate team programming, and flexibility to accommodate hardware and system constraints. A reader should be able to understand the questions he must ask when designing a compiler for language X on machine Y, what tradeoffs are possible, and what performance might be obtained. He should not feel that any part of the design rests on whim; each decision must be based upon specific, identifiable characteristics of the source and target languages or upon design goals of the compiler. The vast majority of computer professionals will never write a compiler. Nevertheless, study of compiler technology provides important benefits for almost everyone in the field . ? It focuses attention on the basic relationships between languages and machines. Understanding of these relationships eases the inevitable tran sitions to new hardware and programming languages and improves a person's ability to make appropriate tradeoft's in design and implementa tion .","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0u3pBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The inner life, (His Theosophical talks at Adyar)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1QUJmwEACAAJ&dq=The+inner+life,+(His+Theosophical+talks+at+Adyar)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dos and Don'ts in the Philippines","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Medieval People","description":"This vintage book contains a series of sketches that aim to illustrate various aspects of social life in the Middle Ages.

Banned by the Spanish Inquisition after publication in 1554, Lazarillo was soon translated throughout Europe, where it was widely copied. The book is a favorite to this day for its vigorous colloquial style and the earthy realism with which it exposes human hypocrisy. The bastard son of a prostitute, Lazarillo goes to work for a blind beggar, who beats and starves him, while teaching him some very useful dirty tricks. The boy then drifts in and out of the service of a succession of masters, each vividly sketched and together revealing the corrupt world of imperial Spain. Its miseries are made all the more apparent by the candor and surprising good cheer with which young Lazarillo recounts his ever more curious fate. This version of Lazarillo, by the prizewinning poet and translator W.S. Merwin, brings out the wonderful vitality and humor of this universal masterwork.

Following the venues in Aachen, Germany (1996) and Hamburg, Germany (1998), this event in Munich considers the trend towards a Universal Service Market  USM 2000. The trend towards a universal service market has many origins, e.g., the integration of telecom and data communications, the deregulation e?orts with respect to telco markets, the globalization of information, the virtualization of companies, the requirement of a short time-to-market, the advances in network technologies, the increasing acceptance of e-commerce, and the increase in - bility. This leads to new business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-customer (B2C) environments that o?er both challenges and opportunities to enterprises and end-users. There is the need for ubiquitous services, trading, brokering and information management, for service market and business models, and for ?e- ble infrastructures for dynamic collaboration. Researchers, service vendors, and users must cooperate to set up the app- priate requirements for a universal service market and to ?nd solutions with respect to supporting platforms, middleware, distributed applications, and m- agement. The basis for these solution is a common understanding of means for de?ning, creating, implementing, and deploying the service market. Then, s- vice market makers, service aggregators, service auctioneers, ISP, ASP, BPO, and customers can freely interact in a dynamic, open, and universal market place.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cFlqCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miss Flora McFlimsey's Valentine","description":"Miss Flora McFlimsey makes and sends surprise cards to her friends for Valentine's Day, although her lazy cat Pookoo almost causes her plans to fail.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oJ4UuxjI2bsC&dq=Miss+Flora+McFlimsey%27s+Valentine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of College Physics, 10th edition (Schaum's Outline Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Margaret Cape: A Novel","description":"Traces sixty years in the life of a woman from the Mississippi Delta who marries her stepson, finds herself isloated from her community on a large plantation, and comes to depend on her own sons for meaning","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=87f8oYnbGqQC&dq=Margaret+Cape:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Man Of Property","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yL_LatrOa1sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ancient Macedonians: Differences Between The Ancient Macedonians and The Ancient Greeks","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Quantico Rules (Puller Monk)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Rick Steves' Amsterdam, Bruges, and Brussels 2004","description":"Combining current trends, academic theories, and historical insights, this travel guide brings both lesser-known and famous European spiritual locales into perspective by explaining the significance of each sacred site.

We have been fighting without being clear for what. We have been waging war without using the full resources we need to win. With the publication of \\"War Footing\\", Frank Gaffney and his colleagues make it clear not only whom the enemy is and how high the stakes are, but also how we can prevail. Their book explains that we are engaged in nothing less than a War for the Free World - a fight to the death with Islamofascists who adhere to a political ideology bent on our destruction. It then offers ten specific steps that Americans, as individuals and as communities, can take to ensure our way of life and the safety and well-being of our children. These steps include specific recommendations about how to know the enemy, support our troops, provide for our energy security, stop investing in terror, equip the country for war at home, counter an EMP attack, secure our borders and interior against illegal immigration, wage political warfare, launch regional initiatives, and wield effective diplomacy. This definitive, highly readable \\"owner's manual\\" for the War for the Free World has been written by one of the most prominent national security experts of our time, Frank J.

(Collected Angry Youth Comix, Vol. 1)","description":"From the creator of the cult favorite Angry Youth Comix: the one-man MAD magazine strikes again! The most acclaimed (and controversial) humor cartoonist to burst on the comics scene since Peter Bagge, Johnny Ryan mixes social satire with an absurdist sense of humor to come up with some of the most notoriously hilarious comics in the last five years, in the pages of his ongoing comic book series, Angry Youth Comix. It's almost impossible to explain what makes something funny, but whatever it is, fans and critics agree that Ryan has it in spades. The book includes several stories featuring Ryan's signature creation, Loady McGee (and straight-man Synus O'Gynus), a misanthropic, acne-scarred hustler who finds himself in scams that would make Wimpy proud, and responds to almost everything with an endless stream of wisecracks, puns, and X-rated double entendres. Loady's ridiculous crackpot schemesopening a brothel staffed by mutant lizards, get-rich-quick inventions like the \\"Pussy Hunter 6000,\\" founding a comic book school, and selling used toilet paper passed-off as new, just to name a fewserve as perfect comic set-ups, and Ryan's art is crammed with visual gags and existential asides that brings to mind the great Will Elder (MAD magazine). Needless to say, this is not politically-correct stuff, nor is it for children. Ryan's in-your-face humor spares no prisoners, as these stories indicate: \\"Hipler,\\" a riotous satire of our \\"extreme makeover\\" era and celebrity culture; \\"Islamic Terrorist Spring Break,\\" in which Ryan seemed to be single-handedly trying to counterbalance all of the self-censorship going on in the early post-9/11 media; and \\"Ku Klux Kuties,\\" which tests just how far the usual doe-eyed visual tropes can be taken and still make you go, \\"Aww.\\" The book also includes Ryan's most infamous strip to-date, \\"The Gaytriot,\\" which caused a PC-stir when it was included in The Comics Journal's otherwise-sincere and serious \\"Cartoonists on Patriotism\\" volume in 2002. The collection also features such absurdist classics as \\"Weight-Lifting Gophers,\\" \\"The Deaf Chef,\\" \\"Dolemite's Masters of the Universe,\\" \\"1976,\\" and a selection of single-panel gag cartoons titled \\"Johnny Ryan's 'Pukin's' and 'Spit-Ups.'\\" Find out why Ryan's work has been cited as a favorite of such luminaries as the late Edward Gorey, Simpsons producers George Meyer and Dana Gould, and cartoonists like Joe Sacco, Daniel Clowes, Peter Bagge, Coop, Gary Panter and many others. 152 pages including 16 pages in color.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Vl1QAAAAMAAJ&dq=What%27re+You+Lookin%27+At%3F+(Collected+Angry+Youth+Comix,+Vol.+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heraldry for Embroiderers","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Uncrowned King (The Sun Sword, Book 2)","description":"The second novel of the acclaimed Sun Sword series returns to a war-torn world of noble houses divided and demon lords unleashed... The King s Challenge it was a proving ground for warriors in the Essalieyan Empire, the hallowed contest that made legends of men. And for Valedan, last survivor of the ruling family of the Dominion, it was a declaration of his right to claim the throne stolen from the Leonne clan by treachery and assassination. Failure to earn the title of King s Champion would not deprive Valedan of either his Dominion or Essalieyan allies, but winning would announce to the world that he was no callow boy, no mere pawn in the games of power. And the games of power were indeed being played not only in the Empire and Dominion, but in the far more dangerous realm of the Lord of Night. As the time of the Challenge neared, Valedan and all those who guarded him would be hard-pressed to survive long enough for him to enter the competition. For the demon kin had been set to hunt him down and destroy him. They had failed before though many innocents had paid for the price.

By adding an ethnic dimension to the literature on homosexual conduct and identity, this book helps service providers improve services for men from all communities. It provides insightful implications for practice and programs, presenting valuable, practical information for planning services for African-, Asian-, Latino-, and Native Americans. Chapters in Men of Color gives you a context for working with homosexually active men of color, regardless of their specific service needs. This broad base is constructed by showing that the meaning of homosexual conduct and identity changes across cultures and generations; that the gay rights movement is having a profound impact on all ethnic/racial communities; that although the pull toward the gay community is strong, the pull to retain ethnic identities is equally strong; and that homosexuality varies culturally and historically. Contributors give: a cross-cultural comparison of identity, networks, and social support patterns among European-, African-, and Latino American men seeking services from an HIV prevention program. an ecological assessment model that can be used by social service professionals working with African American men. an historically-based description of Native American men that ends with their own special vision for clinical services. a review of the literature on Latin American and Filipino men. an historical examination of Korean norms and attitudes on homosexuality. a discussion of an applied research agenda for gay men of color that derives from the need to improve delivery of social services. Men of Color asserts that homosexually active men of color are often caught in a dilemma: they must choose between their ethnic and sexual identities, either putting their ethnicity before their gayness, or their gayness before their ethnicity. The book predicts that the lure of sexual freedom, coupled with the comfort of old traditions, will lead to a new synthesis of gay and ethnic identities and helps service providers facilitate this synthesis. Whether you re a social service provider, social work or health educator, or gay/lesbian studies educator, you will find Men of Color a superior guide for improving your services.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eKwuAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christianity and Liberalism","description":"Presents the issue of Christianity and Liberalism in such as way that the reader may be aided in deciding it for himself.

For example, he notes that despite much talk about instilling visual acuity and teaching technique, in practice neither teachers nor students behave as if those were their principal goals. He addresses the absurdity of pretending that sexual issues are absent from life-drawing classes and questions the practice of holding up great masters and masterpieces as models for students capable of producing only mediocre art. He also discusses types of art--including art that takes time to complete and art that isn't serious--that cannot be learned in studio art classes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_CgtD-dZyk4C&dq=Why+Art+Cannot+Be+Taught:+A+Handbook+for+Art+Students&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Monsieur Ibrahim Et les Fleurs Du Coran (French Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Essential Pit Bull (Essential (Howell))","description":"Owning a Pit Bull is rewarding and fun!

Decades before the American Revolution, Benjamin Franklin lamented that English settlers were constantly fleeing over to the Indians-but Indians almost never did the same. Tribal society has been exerting an almost gravitational pull on Westerners for hundreds of years, and the reason lies deep in our evolutionary past as a communal species. The most recent example of that attraction is combat veterans who come home to find themselves missing the incredibly intimate bonds of platoon life. The loss of closeness that comes at the end of deployment may explain the high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder suffered by military veterans today. Combining history, psychology, and anthropology, Tribe explores what we can learn from tribal societies about loyalty, belonging, and the eternal human quest for meaning. It explains the irony that-for many veterans as well as civilians-war feels better than peace, adversity can turn out to be a blessing, and disasters are sometimes remembered more fondly than weddings or tropical vacations. Tribe explains why we are stronger when we come together, and how that can be achieved even in today's divided world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VIl_CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Turkey From the Air","description":"Turkey is a vast and immensely varied country.

Something has gone very wrong in England. In a tunnel beneath Wales one man opens a crack in a mysterious stone wall, and all over the island of Britain people react with horror to perfectly normal machines. Abandoning their cars on the roads and destroying their own factories, many flee the cities for the countryside, where they return to farming and an old-fashioned life. When families are split apart and grown-ups forget how they used to live, young people face unexpected challenges. Nicola Gore survives on her own for nineteen days before she s taken in by a Sikh family that still remembers how to farm and forge steel by hand. Margaret and Jonathan brave the cold and risk terrible punishment in order to save a man s life and lift the fog of fear and hate that s smothering their village. And Geoffrey and his little sister, Sally, escape to France only to be sent back to England on a vital mission: to make their way north to Wales, alone, and find the thing under the stones that shattered civilization the source of the Changes.

All you have to do is step into the pulpit and talk for 20 minutes, right? Anyone who's ever stepped into that pulpit knows that preaching is anything but easy. Speaking a word from God that is grounded in the biblical witness, theologically responsible, and true to contemporary experience is one of the most difficult things one can do. Advice on how to do this is as old as preaching itself, and there are as many opinions on preaching as there are preachers. Where do those who have been called to the ministry of proclamation begin? What are the basic understandings and practices that anyone who proposes to preach should know? In this new addition to the Essential Guides series, Ronald Allen seeks to answer these basic questions about preaching. He does so through the use of an inductive method, which is simply to say that he starts with a sermon itself, and uses that sermon to illustrate the process of moving from the first thoughts about what one will preach to the delivery of an actual sermon itself. Each chapter will raise a question about the sample sermon that leads into a broader discussion of the practical and theoretical issues that this particular aspect of the sermon raises (e.g., What is the good news in this sermon? What is the significance of this news for the congregation? Does the preacher offer a clear and sensible interpretation of the biblical text or the topic?) Written with the needs of students in both traditional M. Div. classes and non-degree ministry training programs in mind, Preaching: An Essential Guide will be an indispensable companion for all the others who seek to \\"rightly explain the word of truth.\\" Ronald J.

The wardens have given the boy a light workload because he shows talent as a runner. But if he wins the national long-distance running competition as everyone is counting on him to do, Smith will only vindicate the very system and society that has locked him up.  The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner  has long been considered a masterpiece on both the page and the silver screen. Adapted for film by Sillitoe himself in 1962, it became an instant classic of British New Wave cinema. In  Uncle Ernest,  a middle-aged furniture upholsterer traumatized in World War II, now leads a lonely life. His wife has left him, his brothers have moved away, and the townsfolk treat him as if he were a ghost. When the old man finally finds companionship with two young girls whom he enjoys buying pastries for at a caf , the local authorities find his behavior morally suspect.  Mr. Raynor the School Teacher  delves into a different kind of isolation that of a voyeuristic teacher who fantasizes constantly about the women who work in a draper s shop across the street. When his students distract him from his lustful daydreams, Mr. Raynor becomes violent. The six stories that follow in this iconic collection continue to cement Alan Sillitoe s reputation as one of Britain s foremost storytellers, and a champion of the condemned, the oppressed, and the overlooked.

Herv  Guibert s brief, literary rumination on photography was written in response to Roland Barthes s Camera Lucida, but its deeply personal contents go far beyond that canonical text. Some essays talk of Guibert s parents and friends, some describe old family photographs and films, and spinning through them all are reflections on remembrance, narcissism, seduction, deception, death, and the phantom images that have been missed. Both a memoir and an exploration of the artistic process, Ghost Image not only reveals Guibert s particular experience as a gay artist captivated by the transience and physicality of his media and his life, but also his thoughts on the more technical aspects of his vocation. In one essay, Guibert searches through a cardboard box of family portraits for clues answers, or even questions about the lives of his parents and more distant relatives. Rifling through vacation snapshots and the autographed images of long-forgotten film stars, Guibert muses,  I don t even recognize the faces, except occasionally that of an aunt or great-aunt, or the thin, fair face of my mother as a young girl.  In other essays, he explains how he composes his photographs, and how in writing he seeks to escape and correct the inherent limits of his technique, to preserve those images lost to his technical failings as a photographer. With strains of Jean Genet and recurring themes that speak to the work of contemporary artists across a range of media, Guibert s Ghost Image is a beautifully written, melancholic ode to existence and art forms both fleeting and powerful a unique memoir at the nexus of family, memory, desire, and photography.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pQ0IngEACAAJ&dq=Ghost+Image&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Middle of the Night: A Comedy in Three Acts","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UrzPzgEACAAJ&dq=Middle+of+the+Night:+A+Comedy+in+Three+Acts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adventure At Astoria 1810-1814","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R2t6AAAAMAAJ&dq=Adventure+At+Astoria+1810-1814&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Earth Colors","description":"Asked to investigate a famed painting that may be a counterfeit, forensic geologist Em Hansen undertakes a journey through several states and discovers that she is on the trail of a murderer when her client begins to suffer the effects of poisoning.

Copies of this classified reference manual, The New Sectarianism, are smuggled to the West, where intellectuals attempt to assess the late-Soviet spiritual movements. A record of Gibaydulina's own spiritual quest is preserved in the notes and letters she writes during the post-Soviet years before her death in April 1997. Such is the form of Mikhail Epstein's fictional Cries in the New Wilderness, first published in Moscow during the last years of the Soviet Union and now available in English, in an expanded version. Drawing on his own participation in Moscow's intellectual associations and in expeditions to study popular religious beliefs in southern Russia and Ukraine, Epstein recreates the spiritual experience of an entire Russian generation. His is not a documentary book, however, but a \\"comedy of ideas,\\" in which he constructs from the voices he hears in the culture around him the bizarre religious and philosophical worldviews of Foodniks and Domesticans, Arkists and Bloodbrothers, Sinnerists and Good-believers, Steppies and Pushkinians. As a counterpoint to this medley of comic, grotesque, poetic, banal, poignant, and harrowing voices is the voice of the commentator, Professor Gibaydulina, who struggles to maintain her scientific atheism in the face of this startling variety of religious experiences. Gibaydulina's response to the crumbling of the Soviet Union and her quest for a new, creative atheism adds a tragic note to Epstein's polyphonic work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WRRgAAAAMAAJ&dq=Cries+in+the+New+Wilderness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Magnificent Marquess","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Consider the Lilies; Great Inspirational Verses From the Bible","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lALunQEACAAJ&dq=Consider+the+Lilies%3B+Great+Inspirational+Verses+From+the+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete (ACI 318-02) and Commentary (ACI 318R-02) (2002)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Lc5RAAAAMAAJ&dq=Building+Code+Requirements+for+Structural+Concrete+(ACI+318-02)+and+Commentary+(ACI+318R-02)+(2002)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Back from Betrayal: Recovering from His Affairs","description":"It's a loving spouse's worst nightmare: standing by, helpless, as your partner seeks sexual attention from others-a discovery that quickly turns to shame and regret. If only you were prettier or more exciting, maybe you could keep his attention. If only you earned more money, maybe she would be attracted to you. But the truth is that, for many, online and real-life infidelity is an addiction-a compulsive need for other sexual partners, as intoxicating as any bottle or pill. And with the rise of websites and smartphone apps, getting the next fix is often just a click or screen tap away. Author Jennifer P. Schneider, MD, broke new ground in Back from Betrayal as one of the first to address sex addiction in relationships, as well as the traumatic experiences faced by the partners of men and women who compulsively lie and cheat. Now in its fourth edition, the book is updated to reflect the latest knowledge regarding infidelity and contains chapters covering the unique challenges of sex addiction in the digital age. Now more than ever, Schneider provides a voice for those struggling with this devastating issue-and offers much-needed hope toward recovery and healing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GGeLrgEACAAJ&dq=Back+from+Betrayal:+Recovering+from+His+Affairs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Microsoft Visual C++ .NET Step by Step--Version 2003 (Step by Step (Microsoft))","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BuOgPwAACAAJ&dq=Microsoft+Visual+C+++.NET+Step+by+Step--Version+2003+(Step+by+Step+(Microsoft))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Old Jules (Armed Services edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Solved: The Riddle of Illness","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Records and badges of the British Army,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Contemporary Authors: Biography - Smith, (Charles) Page (1917-1995)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Accessing AutoCAD Architectural Desktop Release 2","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vRVpPwAACAAJ&dq=Accessing+AutoCAD+Architectural+Desktop+Release+2&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shih Tzu","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Portraits of the Past (The Tales from Grace Chapel Inn Series #6)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nEc2zwEACAAJ&dq=Portraits+of+the+Past+(The+Tales+from+Grace+Chapel+Inn+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miniature Pinscher: Reigning King of Toys (Best of Breed (Pets))","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Step-Up to USMLE Step 2 (Step-Up Series)","description":"NOTE:","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OyXJugEACAAJ&dq=Step-Up+to+USMLE+Step+2+(Step-Up+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Transformed by Light","description":"Millions of people throughout the world have had a near-death experience.

According to the standard interpretation, echoed by as lofty an authority as Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, the courts did little in the way of protecting property rights in the early years of our nation. Not only does Siegan find this accepted teaching erroneous, but he finds post-Colonial jurisprudence to be firmly rooted in English common law and the writings of its most revered interpreters. Siegan conducts an exhaustive examination of property rights cases decided by state courts between the time of the ratification of the U.S. Constitution in 1788 and the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868. This inventory, which in its sweep captures scores of cases overlooked by previous commentators on the history of property rights, reveals that the protection of these rights is neither a relatively new phenomenon nor a heritage with precarious pedigree. These court cases, as well as early state constitutions, consistently and repeatedly embraced key elements of a property rights jurisprudence, such as protection of the privileges and immunities of citizens, due process of law, equal protection under the law, and prohibitions on the taking of property without just compensation. Case law provides overwhelming evidence that the American legal system, from its inception, has held property rights and their protection in the highest regard. The American Revolution, Siegan reminds us, was fought largely to affirm and protect private property rights-that is, to uphold the \\"rights of Englishmen\\"-even if it meant that the colonists would cease being Englishmen. John Locke and other great theoreticians of property rights understood their importance, not only to individuals who happened to possess property, but to the preservation of a free society and to the prosperity of its inhabitants. Siegan's contribution to this venerable tradition lies in his faithful reconstruction of our legal history, which allows us to see just how central property rights have been to the American experiment in liberty-from the very beginning.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ugqGQgAACAAJ&dq=Property+Rights:+From+Magna+Carta+to+the+Fourteenth+Amendment+(New+Studies+in+Social+Policy,+3)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Skibber Bee Bye","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=apuRngEACAAJ&dq=Skibber+Bee+Bye&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The adventures of K'Ton Ton","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F5ucAAAACAAJ&dq=The+adventures+of+K%27Ton+Ton&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Can't Take My Eyes Off of You: One Man, Seven Days, Twelve Televisions","description":"Describes the experiences and observations of the author as he watched twelve televisions for sixteen hours a day for one week.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5sZkAAAAMAAJ&dq=Can%27t+Take+My+Eyes+Off+of+You:+One+Man,+Seven+Days,+Twelve+Televisions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"White Hibiscus (A Harlequin Romance)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Oscar Peterson Plays Duke Ellington: Piano Artist Transcriptions","description":"(Artist Transcriptions). 17 transcriptions of one of the greatest piano players of our time performing the works of one of the greatest composers of our time.

Incredibly, the abductors are a Hasidic rabbi and his zealous followers backed by top-dollar lawyers. Against these forces the boy's immigrant Israeli mother stands alone, ignored by an indifferent district attorney who, rumor has it, needs the Hasidic vote for his upcoming reelection. What are the motives of this sinister Hasidic underground? To her urgent queries the mother receives only a bizarre, cryptic response: The rabbi has detected in the boy a special light that has predestined the child to become a Zaddik, a man so righteous he will be privy to the will of God and be an inspirational leader to the Jewish people. But to fulfill this destiny the boy must be sequestered, removed from all outside influence including his mother's, to receive the special training that only this ultra-orthodox Hasidic community can provide.If this book were not based on actual events, the plot of Elaine Grudin Denholtz's gripping suspense story might seem preposterous. But her tale is all the more shocking because it is true. With a gift for realistic dialogue and sharply drawn characters, Denholtz creates a dramatic portrait of religious fanatics who arrogantly defy the law.Reported on Israeli television as well as in newspapers from the New York Times and Newsday to Israel's Maariv and Yediot Ahronot, the facts of this story have dramatic tension that keeps the reader both fascinated and horrified: false passports, hideouts in France, the boy's father wired by the New York police, a bloody knife fight outside a yeshiva, the brainwashed son testifying against his mother, two courageous lawyers who battle the system for four years pro bono, and a riveting jury trial.The Zaddik is more than a tale of kidnapping and the battle for a boy's soul. It invites us to ask ourselves, Where does religious devotion end and evil begin?Elaine Grudin Denholtz is an award-winning journalist, playwright, screenwriter, and the author of Having It Both Ways: A Report on Married Women with Lovers and Balancing Work and Love: Jewish Women Facing the Family/Career Challenge, among other books.

Is the Gulistan the most influential book in the Iranian world? In terms of prose, it is the model, which all writers of Persian seek to emulate. In terms of moral, philosophical or practical wisdom, it is endlessly quoted to either illustrate or prove a point. Sir John Malcolm even relates being told that it is the basis of the law of the Persians. It also travelled abroad. Voltaire, Goethe, Arnold, Longfellow, Emerson, Thoreau, Melville, and Franklin discovered, read, and took inspiration from the work. Moreover, travelers to Iran have often point out that to understand the mind of the inhabitants, one should read the Gulistan. Written some seven and a half centuries ago by Sa'di of Shiraz the Gulistan or Rose Garden is a collection of moral stories divided into eight themes: \\"The Conduct of Kings\\", \\"The Character of Dervishes\\", \\"The Superiority of Contentment\\", \\"The Benefits of Silence\\", \\"Love and Youth\\", \\"Feebleness and Old Age\\", \\"The Effects of Education\\", and \\"The Art of Conversation.\\" In each section stories are told from which the reader learns how to behave in a given situation. Sa'di can be moral. \\"Honesty gives God pleasure. I haven't seen anyone get lost on the right road.\\" He may be practical. \\"If you can't stand the sting, don't put your finger into a scorpion's hole.\\" He is philosophical in these lines which are engraved at the entrance of the United Nations: \\"The members of the human race are limbs one to another, for at creation they were of one essence. When one limb is pained by fate, the others cannot rest.\\" The Gulistan is considered the essence of elegant but simple Persian prose. For 600 years, it was the first book placed in the learner's hand. In Persian-speaking countries today, quotations from the Gulistan appear in every conceivable type of literature and is the source of numerous everyday proverbial statements, much as Shakespeare is in English. This is the first complete English translation of the Gulistan in more than a century. Wheeler M. Thackston, Professor of Persian at Harvard University, has faithfully translated Sa'di into clear contemporary English. To help the student, the original Persian is presented facing the English translation. A 3,600 word Persian-English and Arabic-English glossary is included to aide with the more difficult meanings. The Gulistan is imbued with a practical wisdom of life. Sa'di recognizes people for what they are. Every personality type that exists is found in the Rose Garden, the good, the bad, the weak, the strong, the pious, the impious, honest folk, and the most conniving of cheats. Hypocrites abound, foolish kings appear with their wily ministers, wise rulers vie with their malevolent courtiers, boastful young warriors turn tail and run. The beauty of Sa'di's wisdom is that it is timeless. What is expressed is in a setting so close and familiar to the modern experience that it is as relevant today as it was six hundred years ago.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KWkLAQAAMAAJ&dq=Rose+Garden+of+Sa%27di&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Kindness of Strangers (The Tales from Grace Chapel Inn Series #23)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GSDozgEACAAJ&dq=The+Kindness+of+Strangers+(The+Tales+from+Grace+Chapel+Inn+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"There's Always a Trail & Home in the Valley (Louis L'Amour)","description":"They tried to tell him that his father had killed himself, but Kearney McRaven knew better.

Each chapter dissects a different stage of the data modeling process, from requirements through implementation. For each stage, the authors cover workflow and participants' roles, key concepts, proven approach, practical design techniques, and more.

Yet it has been estimated that from 25 to 75 percent of top executives hired today fail. Such failures can cripple the organization and adversely affect its stakeholders. So how can senior-level positions be filled with leaders who fit the bill? The Center for Creative Leadership has studied executive selection for years. Its researchers have interviewed hundreds of executives, analyzed the decision-making styles of the people who make selections, and studied the latest management and psychological literature on the subject. Executive Selection draws on this research, and on the extensive experience of the authors in working with top-level management, to offer a series of steps that decision makers can follow to make better hiring decisions. After detailing who should be on the selection team, the book shows how this group of people can develop a systematic way to look at the organization, its environment, the open position, and the candidate requirements. The team thereby develops an image of the ideal candidate that can be used throughout the selection process. Next, advice is given on the best way to develop a good candidate pool and how to gather and use the right information to determine who should be hired. Finally, Executive Selection makes recommendations that will help ensure the new executive's successful transition into the organization and his or her continued development. In all, these steps represent a comprehensive, easy-to-follow system that takes the mystery out of selecting for success. The book's strategies for pinpointing the right person for the job apply to the selection of CEOs, officers, and others in the executive suite. Executives, boards of directors, and HR professionals can use these strategies to improve their selection processes. Investors can use them to assess the executive selections being conducted within companies of interest. And researchers can use them to garner ideas for additional work in the field.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kNJ9QgAACAAJ&dq=Executive+Selection:+Strategies+for+Success&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Campo Baeza (Contemporary World Architects)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sndQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Campo+Baeza+(Contemporary+World+Architects)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You Can't Meet Jesus Wearing Sneakers","description":"Kevin Watson's collection of eight short stories all take place in Morgan Grove, a small Ozark town built from bits and pieces of the many towns the author visited while fishing and canoeing the rivers and streams of the Missouri Ozarks.

Celebrated for his vivid depictions of the nineteenth-century American Midwest, Carl Sandburg brings unique insight to the life of Abraham Lincoln in this distinguished biography. He captures both the man who grew up on the Indiana prairie and the president who held the country together through the turbulence and tragedy of the Civil War. Based on a lifetime of research, Sandburg s biographywas originally published as a monumental, six-volume study.

It is the one branch of astronomy that requires only modest equipment and that can be pursued during the day. Peter Taylor, long-time chairman of the Solar Division of the American Association of Variable Star Observers, is a keen and highly experienced observer of the Sun. In this book he explains in a clear and practical way everything that a telescope user needs to know in order to make solar observations. The book deals with such topics as the historical background of solar observing, choice of equipment for the safe conduct of solar observations, observations of sunspots, and reporting observations. New techniques, such as electronic recording and the operations of radio telescopes, are also included. The level of presentation is understandable to anyone with basic astronomical knowledge and some experience in handling a small telescope.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wAq-Cdo6tK4C&dq=Observing+the+Sun+(Practical+Astronomy+Handbooks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Better to Reign in Hell: Inside the Raiders Fan Empire","description":"The silver-and-black-clad Oakland Raiders fans are the most notorious in American professional sports, with a mythic reputation for cursing, drinking, brawling, and generally wreaking mayhem. The devotion of the team s multiracial, largely blue-collar supporters runs deep, creating a profound sense of community. As Jim Miller and Kelly Mayhew reveal in this hair-raising and entertaining new book, the self-described Raider Nation, smitten with its outlaw mystique, provides a gritty alternative to California s sunshine-and-granola image. Over the course of the harrowing 2003 season, Miller and Mayhew explored the reality behind the myth and interviewed legions of rabid Raiders fans from suburban families to bikers while attending games in the  Black Hole  (the rowdiest section in Oakland s stadium), frequenting sports bars, and crashing tailgate parties. Featuring the extraordinary photography of Joseph A. Blum, Better to Reign in Hell is both a rollicking tale of obsessive fandom and a fascinating study of the intersection of class, race, gender, and community in professional sports.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mhueFdYQsRUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Come Not To Praise Dave","description":"What could be worse than knowing that someone is trying to kill you, but not knowing why?

What makes the work of Stephenson so unusual is his starting points: his frank willingness to adopt a \\"subjective \\"and \\"psychological \\"approach to the study of mass communication. In short, this is an internal analysis of how communication processes are absorbed by individuals. The theory of play is not a doctrine of frivolity, but rather a way in which Stephenson gets at such sensitive areas of communication theory as what is screened out and why. Without a notion of the play element in communication one would be led to imagine that every televised docudrama would be immediately lived out by every adolescent. Clearly, this is not the case. People can distinguish quite well between imaginary and real events in mass communication contexts. \\"The Play Theory of Mass Communication \\"is a work that studies subjective play, how communication serves the cause of self-enhancement and personal pleasure, and the role of entertainment as an end in itself. In short, for those who are tired of cliche-ridden volumes on the political hidden messages and meanings of communication, or the economic management of media decisions, this volume will come as a refreshment, a piece of entertainment as well as instruction. But with all the emphasis \\"on \\"aspects, Stephenson's volume is shrewdly political. He takes up themes ranging from the reduction! of international tensions to the happily alienated worker to such pedestrian events as the reporting of foreign Soviet dignitaries in their visits to democratic cultures. This is, in short, an urbane, wise book--sophisticated in its methodology and critical in its theorizing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SEo-HKL9quoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mesny's Chinese miscellany: A text book of notes on China and the Chinese","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2mGKuQAACAAJ&dq=Mesny%27s+Chinese+miscellany:+A+text+book+of+notes+on+China+and+the+Chinese&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sneakers","description":"An absolute necessity for design devotees and sneakerheads of all ages!

The reader is exhilarated, led on to agree with Mr. Jarrell joyfully, even to cap his opinions--and at last to grow reckless. . . . Poetry and the Age is enormously readable.\\"-- Louis Simpson, The American Scholar \\"The most powerful reviewer of poetry active in this country for the last decade. . . . Everybody interested in modern poetry ought to be grateful to him.\\" -- John Berryman, New Republic Randall Jarrell was the critic whose taste defined American poetry after World War II. Poetry and the Age, his first collection of criticism, was published in 1953. It has been in and out of print over the past 40 years and has become a classic of American letters. In this new edition, two long-lost lectures by Jarrell have been added. Recently discovered by critics, they speak to issues at the heart of Jarrell's criticism: the structure of poetry and the question \\"Is American poetry American?\\" One of the outstanding poets of the postwar generation, Jarrell was also celebrated for his extraordinary praise of some underappreciated older and younger poets and for his witty dismissals of current favorites he thought less qualified. Poetry and the Age includes groundbreaking considerations of Walt Whitman and Robert Frost as well as profound appraisals of Wallace Stevens, Marianne Moore, John Crowe Ransom, and William Carlos Williams. His early reviews that established the reputations of Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop are here, beside other enthusiastic discoveries that have withstood the test of time. Poetry and the Age also contains Jarrell's influential essays on the obscurity of poetry and on the age of criticism, essays that offer some of the most relevant and readable literary judgments of the 20th century. Randall Jarrell (1914-1965) wrote eight books of poetry, five anthologies, four children's books illustrated by Maurice Sendak, four translations, including Faust: Part I and The Three Sisters (performed on Broadway by the Actor's Studio), and a novel, Pictures from an Institution. He received the National Book Award for poetry in 1960, served as poet laureate at the Library of Congress in 1957 and 1958, and taught for many years at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro. He was a member of the American Institute of Arts and Letters.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cxOcQgAACAAJ&dq=Poetry+and+the+Age&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On the Bondage of the Will","description":"A thoughtful editing of the full text of The Bondage of the Will by Martin Luther (1525) based upon the 1823 translation from the Latin by Henry Cole.

Rhea continues his spectacular narrative of the initial campaign between Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee in the spring of 1864. May 13 through 25, a phase oddly ignored by historians, was critical in the clash between the Army of the Potomac and the Army of Northern Virginia. During those thirteen days -- an interlude bracketed by horrific battles that riveted the public's attention -- a game of guile and endurance between Grant and Lee escalated to a suspenseful draw on Virginia's North Anna River. From the bloodstained fields of the Mule Shoe to the North Anna River, with Meadow Bridge, Myers Hill, Harris Farm, Jericho Mills, Ox Ford, and Doswell Farm in between, grueling night marches, desperate attacks, and thundering cavalry charges became the norm for both Grant's and Lee's men. But the real story of May 13--25 lay in the two generals' efforts to outfox each other, and Rhea charts their every step and misstep. Realizing that his bludgeoning tactics at the Bloody Angle were ineffective, Grant resorted to a fast-paced assault on Lee's vulnerable points. Lee, outnumbered two to one, abandoned the offensive and concentrated on anticipating Grant's maneuvers and shifting quickly enough to repel them. It was an amazingly equal match of wits that produced a gripping, high-stakes bout of warfare -- a test, ultimately, of improvisation for Lee and of perseverance for Grant.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fHRegKgBPAkC&dq=To+the+North+Anna+River:+Grant+and+Lee,+May+13-25,+1864+(Jules+and+Frances+Landry+Award+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Counseling Package: Vital Information and Review Questions for the NCE Study Set","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Origins of the Korean War: Volume II: The Roaring of the Cataract, 1947-1950","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gIpdMQAACAAJ&dq=The+Origins+of+the+Korean+War:+Volume+II:+The+Roaring+of+the+Cataract,+1947-1950&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Just Enough Software Test Automation","description":"Offers advice on designing and implementing a software test automation infrastructure, and identifies what current popular testing approaches can and cannot accomplish.

During World War II, Riesen worked briefly for the Vichy government and, following liberation, received a 20-year prison sentence. He volunteered to serve in the  BILOM  (Bataillon Leger d Infanterie d Outre-Mer), where WWII political prisoners could redeem themselves. Arriving in Saigon in May 1950 as a Colonial Infantry  2eme Classe  soldier affected to the BILOM which by then had ceased to exist and most of its soldiers assigned to the BMEO ( Bataillon de Marche Extreme Orient ) created in January 1950 Riesen was assigned to the 1st Company, 4th BMEO at the outpost of Kon Plong, controlling access to the coastal plains of Son Ha and Ba To; this post was located about a day s travel away from Kontum, positioned on a 1,800m high peak, where the rainy season lasted about seven months, with thick fog present almost every day. In December 1950, the 4th BMEO was renamed to the 4th Montagnard battalion, and its HQ remained at Ban M  Thuot whilst its Battalions operated around Kontum. Riesen would go on to serve four years in the Kontum area and joined the GCMA after its formation, serving under Captain Hentic ( L action Hre ).

Sir John Hunt, author of The Conquest of Everest Known for his lyrical writing and his ability to convey not only the dangers of mountaineering but the pure exaltation of the climb, Gaston R buffat is among the most well-known and revered Alpinists of all time. He rose to international prominence in 1950 as one of the four principal stalwarts in the first ascent of Annapurna, the highest mountain climbed at that time. Yet his finest feat as a mountaineer was to be the first man to climb all six of the legendary great north faces of the Alps the Grandes Jorasses, the Piz Badile, the Dru, the Matterhorn, the Cima Grande di Lava-redo, and the Eiger. With this elegant book, first published in 1954, Gaston R buffat transformed mountain writing. His insistence on seeing a climb as an act of harmonious communion with the mountain, not a battle waged against it, seemed radical at the time, though R buffat s aesthetic has since won the day. Through storms, avalanches, rock fall, unplanned bivouacs, and even the deaths of companions, we follow the Chamonix guide to the altar of his communion, on dark, icy walls that struck terror into the hearts of Europe s finest mountaineers. Nor are these deft narratives mere recitations of dangers faced and obstacles overcome, for R buffat pays as keen attention to the joys of comradeship won on these faces as he does to the climbs themselves. In our own day of corporate sponsorships, online expeditions, and eco-vacations, the purity of R buffat s vision of the Alps as (in the epithet of the title of another of his books) an  enchanted garden  shines forth in prose as fresh and stylish as any ever lavished on mountaineering.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=58CGDwAAQBAJ&dq=Starlight+and+Storm+(Modern+Library+Exploration)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kahlil Gibran : A Self-Portrait","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eFTOAQAACAAJ&dq=Kahlil+Gibran+:+A+Self-Portrait&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Circles in a Forest","description":"Saul Barnard is a man with a self-imposed mission - to halt the wanton destruction of the Knysna Forest, home of wild elephants and the fiercely independent families of woodcutters.

Clan Novel Tremere is the twelfth novel in the series. Magic, manipulation, murder. With one foot firmly planted in the mythic and the other rooted in the unforgiving streets of New York City, Aisling Sturbridge, Regent of the besieged Chantry of the Five Boroughs, serves as leader, teacher, and guardian to the novices entrusted to her care. But if holding the front line against the Sabbat were not challenge enough, Sturbridge must struggle to unravel a murder in the very heart of her chantry; to upstage the manipulation of rival Tremere powerbrokers and to survive the escalating (and unwelcome) attention from the motherhouse in Vienna. All of these struggles, however, may prove to be in vain. If Sturbridge cannot find some answer to her own silent accusersthe faces of the Children down the Well.

Its place in the canon was contested by some early Christians, and the reformer Martin Luther called it an \\"epistle of straw\\". The sometimes negative view of the letter among modern theologians, however, is not shared by ordinary believers. Few books in the New Testament are better known or more often quoted, and because James is so concise, so intensely practical, and so filled with memorable metaphors and illustrations, it has become one of the two or three most popular New Testament books in the church. The highly original commentary on James by respected New Testament scholar Douglas Moo combines penetrating scholarship with the simplicity of style and pastoral tone characteristic of James itself. After discussing such background issues as authorship, genre, purpose, structure, and theology, Moo provides a verse-by-verse exposition of the text that leads readers to the heart of James's message - wholehearted commitment to Christ. In addition to expounding the meaning of James, Moo also takes care to provide practical insights for applying the meaning in the church today. A number of years in the making, interacting with the best and most recent works on James, and written for readers at all levels, this volume will quickly become a standard commentary on James.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vGfnDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Letter+of+James+(Pillar+New+Testament+Commentary)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ex-Files","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Weather or not","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Essential Poodle (Essential (Howell))","description":"Owning a Poodle is rewarding and fun!

Its view of the mind and its place in the world, paradoxically simple and profound, continue to perplex, excite and inspire today. The Tao Te Ching, also known as The Tao and its Characteristics or The Book of Tao, has traditionally been attributed to Lao Tzu, a Chinese philosopher of the 6th century BC. The ancient book s exact origins and authorship are still subject to debate, including some wondering if it was written by a single author or is the accumulated wisdom of many. The text seeks a peeling away of artificial constraints of society and the mind in order to return to the natural balance of the Tao, the essence of all things. This is described as  the way , an immersion in the present moment and a freedom from desire that liberates the self from purely selfish motivations, creating a balanced state of humble simplicity and peace of mind. Poetic and shot through with thought provoking paradox, the text invites absorption, consideration and interpretation. Ceaselessly influential across cultures and centuries, The Tao Te Ching has, at one time or another, impacted religious thought, political theory, philosophy and an array of artists working in everything from poetry to painting to music. Thousands of years old, the text and its message are truly timeless. With an eye-catching new cover, and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of The Tao Te Ching is both modern and readable.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xd4XEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Koi","description":"The Ultimate Koi * Anatomy and Physiology of Koi * Historical Background * Koi Varieties * Koi Ponds * What a Koi Must Accomplish * Pond Building * Buying Koi * Diet and Feeding * Disease and Parasites in Koi * Handling Koi * Showing Koi Find us online at http://www.idgbooks.com","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JfgI8wUC5JQC&dq=The+Ultimate+Koi&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Mexico Rocks and Minerals (Rock Collecting)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Stop Smoking, Stay Skinny","description":"Many smokers biggest fear of quitting smoking is weight gain.

Celebrated reporter Matt Taibbi turns a withering eye on the kissing contest of puffed-up martinets and egomaniacal fantasists more generally known as the 2004 Democratic primaries. Taibbi s contempt for the whole charade, and for most of those involved (including a generous helping of his fellow journalists), makes for a searing and highly entertaining account. His refusal to take the proceedings seriously leads him to volunteer for Wesley Clark s New Hampshire campaign in the guise of an adult-film director, while his take on a John Edwards press conference in New York City is filtered through the haze of hallucinogenic drugs. Taking up residence in slums and halfway houses as he follows the circus around the country, Taibbi juxtaposes an idiotic dog-and-pony show in which clashes of plainly identical candidates are presented as real controversies, with the quite separate concerns of the ordinary Americans whose lodgings he shares. The gap between the antiseptic exercise in faint patriotic optimism that is mainstream politics and the harsh realities of life for the millions of Americans that the electoral parade simply passes by has never been more sharply, or hilariously, sketched.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mSCDDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Precious Treasures","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dino Wars: Discover the Deadliest Dinosaurs, Bloodiest Battles, and Super Survival Strategies of the Prehistoric World","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dave Landry's 10 Best Swing Trading Patterns and Strategies","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"San Francisco Is Burning: The Untold Story of the 1906 Earthquake and Fires","description":"A detailed account of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake reveals how hasty and corrupt construction practices made the city more vulnerable to damage and relates the experiences of such survivors as a naval officer who helped save the city's piers and wharves, unscrupulous mayor Eugene Schmitz, and erudite city boss Abe Ruef.

Rarely mentioned anymore in the pulpit, it has faded through disuse among evangelicals and been attacked by liberal theologians. Hell is no longer only the target of those outside the church. Today, a disturbing number of professing Christians question it as well. Perhaps more than at any other time in history, hell is under fire. The implications of the historic view of hell make the popular alternatives, annihilationism and universalism, seem extremely appealing. But the bottom line is still God s Word. What does the Old Testament reveal about hell? What does Paul the apostle have to say, or the book of Revelation? Most important, what does Jesus, the ultimate expression of God s love, teach us about God s wrath?Upholding the authority of Scripture, the different authors in Hell Under Fire explore a complex topic from various angles. R. Albert Mohler Jr. provides a historical, theological, and cultural overview of  The Disappearance of Hell.  Christopher Morgan draws on the New Testament to offer three pictures of hell as punishment, destruction, and banishment. J. I. Packer compares universalism with the traditional understanding of hell, Morgan does the same with annihilationism, and Sinclair Ferguson considers how the reality of hell ought to influence preaching. These examples offer some idea of this volume s scope and thoroughness.Hell may be under fire, but its own flames cannot be quenched by popular opinion. This book helps us gain a biblical perspective on what hell is and why we cannot afford to ignore it. And it offers us a better understanding of the One who longs for all people to escape judgment and obtain eternal life through Jesus Christ.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rOYsSHCWV1gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Journey beyond tomorrow (A signet book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sxVMAQAAMAAJ&dq=Journey+beyond+tomorrow+(A+signet+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sound Advice: A Basis for Listening, Second Edition (Student Book)","description":"Sound Advice, Second Edition helps students understand rapid, relaxed English, starting at the word and sentence levels and expanding to short conversations.

Edgar Hoover reported to the Nixon White House in 1972 about the Bureau's surveillance of John Lennon, he began by explaining that Lennon was a \\"former member of the Beatles singing group.\\" When a copy of this letter arrived in response to Jon Wiener's 1981 Freedom of Information request, the entire text was withheld along with almost 200 other pages on the grounds that releasing it would endanger national security. This book tells the story of the author's remarkable fourteen-year court battle to win release of the Lennon files under the Freedom of Information Act in a case that went all the way to the Supreme Court. With the publication of Gimme Some Truth, 100 key pages of the Lennon FBI file are available complete and unexpurgated, fully annotated and presented in a \\"before and after\\" format. Lennon's file was compiled in 1972, when the war in Vietnam was at its peak, when Nixon was facing reelection, and when the \\"clever Beatle\\" was living in New York and joining up with the New Left and the anti-war movement. The Nixon administration's efforts to \\"neutralize\\" Lennon are the subject of Lennon's file. The documents are reproduced in facsimile so that readers can see all the classification stamps, marginal notes, blacked out passages and in some cases the initials of J. Edgar Hoover. The file includes lengthy reports by confidential informants detailing the daily lives of anti-war activists, memos to the White House, transcripts of TV shows on which Lennon appeared, and a proposal that Lennon be arrested by local police on drug charges. Fascinating, engrossing, at points hilarious and absurd, Gimme Some Truth documents an era when rock music seemed to have real political force and when youth culture challenged the status quo in Washington. It also delineates the ways the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton administrations fought to preserve government secrecy, and highlights the legal strategies adopted by those who have challenged it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FPPj3e_cQIcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Story of Astrology: The Belief in the Stars as a Factor in Human Progress,","description":"The actual beginnings of astrology are unknown and unknowable. The science emerges already highly refined from the utter obscurity of the pre-historic world. The ends of astrology are also unknown. There is already evidence that the perfection of this science will elevate man to an intellectual and social condition far beyond the limitations of our present consciousness. -from \\"Astrology's Place in the Modern World\\" In this concise book, one of the preeminent metaphysicists of the 20th century gives us an extraordinarily informative and entertaining survey of the astrological disciplines and beliefs of the ancient Chinese, Tibetans, HIndus, Greeks, Romans, Aztecs, and Arabians. Then, his discussions of astrology as science, religion, and philosophy bring this paranormal system into the contemporary world, and he explains how, in his estimation, that the heavenly bodies, acting as the \\"foci of intellectual energy,\\" dramatically sway the course of civilization itself. A classic of supernatural spirituality is a must-read for those fascinated by the influence of paranormal belief in the 20th century.

In this book, learn the unique astronomical factors that create eclipses and why some eclipses are total while others are not. Learn how the Chaldeans discovered the Saros cycle in the sixth century BC, which is still in use today. Learn how the Greeks discovered the Metonic cycle. Find out how the Saros cycle is used in forecasting the effects of eclipses. Jansky gives the astrological key for all 19 of the Saros series. The author uses his understanding of eclipse mechanics in analysis. He uses the twelve houses of the chart, planets conjunct and opposed, the Saros series, fixed stars conjunct the eclipse as well as stars rising or setting on the horizon (ascendant/descendant), the planetary ruler, and the path of the Moon's shadow (the umbra) as it races across the earth during the eclipse itself. Jansky's interpretation of eclipses is rooted in Transactional Analysis (what I do to you becomes what you do to me, etc.), which, astrologically, is the study of polarities, which is what lunar and solar eclipses literally represent, and how these polarities, expressed as opposing signs and houses, can be resolved in terms of human relationships. Jansky delves into the astrological duration of an eclipse, prenatal eclipses, eclipses in rectification and eclipses and health. For case studies he tells of an eclipse-driven corporate crisis at his employer and how it impacted him, his fellow employees, and the management. In the data section, solar eclipses for the 20th century: Date, degree of the zodiac, total, partial or annular, and the Saros number. Also, longitudes of major fixed stars and general and medical bibliographies. A comprehensive book on eclipses.

But simply because a novel showcases a Chicano protagonist in a barrio setting does not mean it is necessarily moving or powerful. Calle 10 introduces us to Zero, a college-educated 30-year-old headed nowhere in a rooming house on \\"Calle 10\\" -- Tenth Street -- in Ciudad Jimenez, near Oakland, Calif. With no prospects, drug-addled companions, addictive tendencies of his own and little hope for his own future, Zero often dreams of ways to escape his situation, but rarely does a thing, save ingesting drugs. Romero provides little insight into Zero's true motivations or lack thereof. It is both the lack of self-examination on Zero's part and the absence of a definitive conclusion to the work which makes Calle 10 a frustrating and disappointing novel. Despite some compelling writing, brazenly realistic at times, it reads like only a fraction of a much larger piece. As an author Romero has talent to spare, but one only wishes that in a novel-length book he had worked longer and more thoughtfully on his characterisations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ElFbAAAAMAAJ&dq=CALLE+10&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Entomology and the Law: Flies as Forensic Indicators","description":"Thorough analysis of the scientific and legal issues involved in using insects to help solve crimes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Kgc4mA7rWG8C&dq=Entomology+and+the+Law:+Flies+as+Forensic+Indicators&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guide To the Tarot of the Sephiroth","description":"Combining an annual Dubai lifestyle guidebook together with a complete step-by-step guide for getting things done, the Starter Kit is ideal for new or existing residents and business people.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k7vaAAAACAAJ&dq=Guide+To+the+Tarot+of+the+Sephiroth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Foam Book : An Easy Guide to Building Polyfoam Puppets","description":"Whether you're a beginner to the world of puppet making or an experienced professional puppeteer, The Foam Book was written with you in mind.

As a being of spirit, I must be the repetition of someone through whose biography mine can be explained. In each life the human spirit appears as a repetition of itself with the fruits of experiences during previous lives. -Rudolf Steiner Rudolf Steiner seldom spoke of himself in a personal way, but in his Autobiography we are offered a rare glimpse into some of the most intimate aspects of his inner life, his personal relationships, and significant events that helped to shape the philosopher, seer, and teacher he became. This edition restores the original format of seventy chapters, just as they were written for the Goetheanum weekly newsletter. This autobiography is not merely a narrative of Rudolf Steiner's successes and failures, but the story of a soul possessed of a precise, probing scientific mind and a natural clairvoyant ability to see into the spiritual world. Although naturally clairvoyant, Steiner always recognized the integrity and importance of modern scientific methods, and thus he developed a modern discipline he named Anthroposophy, or spiritual science. During the century that followed the events recorded in this autobiography, Rudolf Steiner's insights have touched and enriched numerous areas of life in ways that continue to transform people's lives in the twenty-first century. This illustrated, revised, updated, and expanded edition was the first volume to be released in The Collected Works of Rudolf Steiner. This series will eventually collect all of the English translations of Rudolf Steiner's works-including many never before in English-into an attractive and uniform set of his written and spoken words.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SPCTngEACAAJ&dq=Autobiography:+Chapters+in+the+Course+of+My+Life,+1861-1907+(Collected+Works+of+Rudolf+Steiner)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ENTOVERSE.","description":"As human society on Jevlen begins to crumble, sorcerers in another universe become unwitting participants in the seeming possession of the Jevlenese.

Over the centuries, Chan Buddhism grew from an obscure movement to an officially recognized and eventually dominant form of Buddhism in China and throughout East Asia. It has reached international popularity, its teachings disseminated across cultures far and wide. In Monks, Rulers, and Literati, Albert Welter presents, for the first time in a comprehensive fashion in a Western work, the story of the rise of Chan, a story which has been obscured by myths about Zen. Zen apologists in the twentieth century, Welter argues, sold the world on the story of Zen as a transcendental spiritualism untainted by political and institutional involvements. In fact, Welter shows that the opposite is true: relationships between Chan monks and political rulers were crucial to Chan's success. The book concentrates on an important but neglected period of Chan history, the 10th and 11th centuries, when monks and rulers created the so-called Chan \\"golden age\\" and the classic principles of Chan identity. Placing Chan's ascendancy into historical context, Welter analyzes the social and political factors that facilitated Chan's success as a movement. He then examines how this success was represented in the Chan narrative and the aims of those who shaped it. Monks, Rulers, and Literati recovers a critical period of Zen's past, deepening our understanding of how the movement came to flourish. Welter's groundbreaking work is not only the most comprehensive history of the dominant strand of East Asian Buddhism, but also an important corrective to many of the stereotypes about Zen.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0D0IUv8NeWMC&dq=Monks,+Rulers,+and+Literati:+The+Political+Ascendancy+of+Chan+Buddhism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Killing ground;: The Canadian Civil War","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ysCewwEACAAJ&dq=Killing+ground%3B:+The+Canadian+Civil+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Object-Oriented C++ Primer","description":"The new classic!

In early youth he became the disciple of a Buddhist Guru in a part of China near Tibet. His Guru sent him to Tibet to further his training. After eight years in Tibetan monasteries, six of them under one Guru, he went to school in the West to study animal husbandry and bring his knowledge hack to Tibet. The Communist victory in China and the Communist invasion of Tibet cut him off from returning. His devotion to Tibetan Buddhism is now expressed by translating into English its hitherto unknown teachings. This Book is an extremely concentrated introduction to the mental, physical, and spiritual exercises of Tibetan Buddhism, emphasizing the practice of Yoga exercises. The key to its understanding is the learning of Dumo the generating of internal heat in one s body. Dumo s special meaning for Tibetan Yoga flows from the profoundly anti-ascetic and anti-pessimistic doctrine of Tantric Buddhism. The author means precisely what he says when he explains that opposites are also inseparable unities and that the best example of this is that the human body-mind can be made into the body of Buddha. Sexual bliss can become divine bliss. This work will both introduce the reader to the tranquility of yoga and, at the same time, lead him to explorations in the field of erotic mysticism.

The two hundred illustrations most of them in full color are not simple embellishments, though they are beautiful. They emerge from the text, enrich the author's intention, and deepen the pleasure of reading this remarkable work. For this edition the text is reset in a spacious format, flowing around illustrations that range from paintings to line drawings, emblems, motifs, and symbols. The book incorporates freshly drawn maps, a revised preface, and a new index.

In Homeric Moments, she brilliantly conveys the unique delights of Homer's epics as she focuses on the crucial scenes, or moments, that mark the high points of the narratives: Penelope and Odysseus, faithful wife and returning husband, sit face to face at their own hearth for the first time in twenty years; young Telemachus, with his father Odysseus at his side, boldly confronts the angry suitors; Achilles gives way to boundless grief at the death of his friend Patroclus. Eva Brann demonstrates a way of reading Homer's poems that yields up their hidden treasures. With an alert eye for Homer's extraordinary visual effects and a keen ear for the musicality of his language, she helps the reader see the flickering campfires of the Greeks and hear the roar of the surf and the singing of nymphs. In Homeric Moments, Brann takes readers beneath the captivating surface of the poems to explore the inner connections and layers of meaning that have made the epics \\"the marvel of the ages.\\" \\"Written with wit and clarity, this book will be of value to those reading the Odyssey and the Iliad for the first time and to those teaching it to beginners.\\" Library Journal \\"Homeric Moments is a feast for the mind and the imagination, laid out in clear and delicious prose. With Brann, old friends of Homer and new acquaintances alike will rejoice in the beauty, and above all the humanity, of the epics.\\"  Jacob Howland, University of Tulsa, Author of The Paradox of Political Philosophy \\"In Homeric Moments, Eva Brann lovingly leads us, as she has surely led countless students, through the gallery of delights that is Homer's poetry. Brann's enthusiasm is as infectious as her deep familiarity with the works is illuminating.\\" Rachel Hadas \\"Brann invites us to enter a conversation [about Homer] in which information and formal arguments jostle with appreciations and frank conjectures and surmises to increase our pleasure and deepen the inward dimension of our humanity.\\" Richard Freis, Millsaps College \\"For anyone eager to experience the profundity and charm of Homer's great epic poems, Eva Brann's book will serve as a passionate and engaging guide. Brann displays a deep sensitivity to the cadence and flow of Homeric poetry, and the kind of knowing intimacy with its characters that comes from years of teaching and contemplation. Her relaxed but informative approach succeeds in conveying the grandeur of the great Homeric heroes, while making them continually resonate for our own lives. Brann helps us see that this poetry has an urgency for our own era as much as it did for a distant past.\\" Ralph M. Rosen, University of Pennsylvania, Author of Old Comedy and The Iambographic Tradition \\"The most enjoyable books about Homer are always written by those who have read and taught him the most. Eva Brann's collection of astute observations, unusual asides, and visual snapshots of the Iliad and the Odyssey reveals a lifelong friendship with the poet, and is as pleasurable as it is informative. Homeric Moments is rare erudition without pedantry, in a tone marked by good sense without levity.\\" Victor Davis Hanson, author of The Other Greeks and co-author of Who Killed Homer?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Tr0sHkgKBmUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ducklings Love","description":"With the help of her brother and the handsome group of neighbors she's come to call her friends, 220-pound Hitomi is well on her way to being fit and fabulous as she gradually drops the pounds!

Barker's stories often use wordplay and humor to stretch the boundaries of metaphor and reality as the outrageously original plots unfold. Through her confident and clever style, these short stories sling Barker to the forefront of fiction writing, as she is reminiscent of Martin Amis, Julian Barnes, and Margaret Atwood. The collection begins with a smart tale of a teenage girl whose obsession with the size of her nose dangerously compromises her relationships with her friends and her family. \\"Inside Information\\" is a pun of a title, describing how the protagonist's unborn fetus is the only one able to reform his mother's compulsive shoplifting by pulling the ultimate prank. \\"G-String\\" and \\"Symbiosis: Class Cestoda\\" detail women who gain self-esteem, albeit through quirky methods, despite the cowardly men who try to suppress them. The title story, \\"Three Button Trick,\\" is about a man who deliberately buttons his duffel coat incorrectly to attract sympathetic females. Carrie falls for this trick, and it takes twenty-one years, a curious friend, and an eighty-three-year-old widower for her to realize her mistake. Wesley is the protagonist of a three-part collection, \\"Blisters,\\" \\"Braces,\\" and \\"Mr. Lippy\\" who, traumatized by two unfortunate incidents as a young boy, is an eccentric obsessed with freedom and the sea. Barker skillfully intertwines humor with despair to stimulate any reader's interest; she taps into the psyches of her characters to create an authentic, original, and highly enjoyable read. The Three Button Trick and Other Stories is a resonant, audacious volume from a writer of immense talent and originality.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TDRkDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Communicating Sequential Processes","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Laserdisc Film Guide: Complete Ratings for the Best and Worst Movies Available on Disc, 1993-1994 Edition","description":"Reviews the movie and then critiques how the film has been translated to the disc","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eyGkMQEACAAJ&dq=The+Laserdisc+Film+Guide:+Complete+Ratings+for+the+Best+and+Worst+Movies+Available+on+Disc,+1993-1994+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Absolute Bliss: A Woman's Guide to Relationship Happiness","description":"Do you remember when you were single?

This makes him the perfect subject for red-hot biographer Alton Reece. Riding high on the wave of previous astonishing success, Reece sees Hughes as more than simply a name worth the seven-figure advance he's demanding from his publisher. He finds in Hughes a kindred spirit of greatness, a man misunderstood and beaten down by jealous inferiors. But even as Reece struggles to 'know' his subject, his own rapidly unravelling life keeps finding unexpected ways to intrude. With a deft comic touch and an astounding narrative style, Steven Carter's novel creates a picture of a Hughes who might have been, a biographer who can't separate his subject from his own visions of grandeur, and a public that demands its heroes be larger than life - if only so they can be more easily torn down.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zJ35mIL2yoAC&dq=I+Was+Howard+Hughes:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black Tie and Blue Jeans","description":"The formal and casual side of Texas cooking, 500 recipes","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qcINAAAACAAJ&dq=Black+Tie+and+Blue+Jeans&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Indians of Louisiana","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"All the Rage (Poets on Poetry)","description":"Early reviews by the author known as \\"the most dangerous poetry critic not dead\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NLJZAAAAMAAJ&dq=All+the+Rage+(Poets+on+Poetry)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Foster genealogy;","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aohMAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Legacy: The Search for Ancient Cultures","description":"Looks at the art, architecture, and value systems of ancient cultures, and describes their influence on Western civilization","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ma6hyFolSBsC&dq=Legacy:+The+Search+for+Ancient+Cultures&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Excerpts from his diaries (Jewish pocket library)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mission with LeMay: My Story","description":"Autobiography of the man who served on active duty as a 4-star general longer than anyone in the history of our country.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=khpCAAAAIAAJ&dq=Mission+with+LeMay:+My+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oops!

Presenting easy-to-follow recipes that can be prepared at home, this new edition of Donald Strombeck s classic handbook has been completely rewritten by new author Patricia A. Schenck to reflect the latest nutritional recommendations based on current research. New chapter topics include feeding the puppy and kitten; feeding the pregnant or lactating dog or cat; feeding the senior pet; feeding the performance dog; and the role of diet in pets with cancer. Diets are now listed together in a cookbook style for ease of use, and recipes are adjustable for any size dog or cat, allowing exact nutritional values to be calculated. Nutrient content for protein, fat, carbohydrate, and fiber have been provided for every diet, along with the nutrient density. A companion website features downloadable spreadsheets with complete nutritional breakdowns for each recipe. Useful for both veterinarians and pet owners alike, Home-Prepared Dog and Cat Diets, Second Edition is a unique handbook written by an expert in the field providing an introduction to the nutritional management of dogs and cats with easy-to-use recipes for home-prepared diets. Clarification: Calcium Carbonate We ve had some questions from readers regarding the use of the term  calcium carbonate,  which is listed as an ingredient in a number of the diets found in this book, and therefore wanted to clarify what is meant by this ingredient. Baking soda comes in two forms: sodium bicarbonate and calcium carbonate. The sodium bicarbonate version is widely available as  baking soda  and is commonly used in baking, but none of the recipes in this book use it as an ingredient. The calcium carbonate version of baking soda is sometimes sold as  baking soda substitute  and sometimes referred to as simply  baking soda.  To avoid confusing sodium bicarbonate and calcium carbonate, any time the calcium carbonate type of baking soda has been used in a diet in this book, the ingredient includes the specific term  calcium carbonate.  There are several manufacturers of calcium carbonate baking soda; for example, Amazon carries the Ener-G Foods product baking soda substitute. Calcium carbonate can also be sold for garden use, which is non-food-grade, so to avoid the use of the garden product in foods, the term  baking soda  was used in this book instead to indicate that readers should be sure to select a food-appropriate ingredient.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5c7DAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Shadow Box: A Drama in Two Acts","description":"Full Length, Drama Characters: 5 male, 4 female Interior Set In this compelling dramatic triptych, three terminal cancer patients dwell in separate cottages on a hospital grounds.

Readers who had never thought about Portuguese letters began to consume his books and, most importantly, opted for expanding their reading lists to include other important writers not only from Portugal, but from Portuguese-speaking well beyond the borders of Portugal. Global Impact of the Portuguese Language is a collection of Portuguese writing that is as rich in content and broad in scope as the diversity of its topics and writing modes of its contributors. The book is divided into three major parts. Part 1, \\"Different Cultural Perspectives of Portuguese Writing,\\" contains thirteen chapters in which the first and opening one, \\"Portugal: The New Frontier\\" ably sets the stage for the book by examining from a cultural perspective how Portugal, a peripheral country in the new world system, serves as a microcosm of the problems of cultural intercommunication in today's world. Subsequent chapters are grouped in three categories: \\"The Voices of the Writers,\\" \\"Critical Approaches to Cames,\\" and \\"Fictionalizing the Nation.\\" Part 2, \\"Portuguese Language and Literature Outside Portugal,\\" comprises one section devoted to the Portuguese language in Africa, followed by studies about Portuguese discoveries as part of the historical process of remembering and forging one's identity, and finally a comprehensive historical development of Portuguese writing, both in Portuguese and English, in the United States. Part 3, \\"Portuguese Literature and Criticism Available in English: Suggested Readings\\" details the recent literary happenings which point to a possible renaissance in Portuguese literary production. The concluding part of this volume offers a short, comprehensive listing of anthologies, general studies, and the most popular translations of the best of Portuguese writing from Portugal and Africa. This lively volume constitutes a first pioneering effort to contribute to a deepening appreciation and understanding of Portuguese writing. Anyone interested in ethnic writing will find this book an invaluable education resource with which to begin an exploration of Portuguese writing in the United States.

In looking at the developments since the late 1960s, Lehmann considers them in relation to dramatic theory and theatre history, as an inventive response to the emergence of new technologies, and as an historical shift from a text-based culture to a new media age of image and sound. Engaging with theoreticians of 'drama' from Aristotle and Brecht, to Barthes and Schechner, the book analyzes the work of recent experimental theatre practitioners such as Robert Wilson, Tadeusz Kantor, Heiner M ller, the Wooster Group, Needcompany and Societas Raffaello Sanzio. Illustrated by a wealth of practical examples, and with an introduction by Karen J rs-Munby providing useful theoretical and artistic contexts for the book, Postdramatic Theatre is an historical survey expertly combined with a unique theoretical approach which guides the reader through this new theatre landscape.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wXCBAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Don't Get Duped : A Consumer's Guide to Health and Fitness","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"QBVII","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Roosevelt's Secret War: FDR and World War II Espionage","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Bigger Bang","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FOgPzQEACAAJ&dq=The+Bigger+Bang&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Justice for Jordan","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SQYCaAEACAAJ&dq=Justice+for+Jordan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Truth on fire,","description":"Knowing God truly, experiencing Him deeply. What would it look like to genuinely love God with our head AND our heart? To have a faith marked by right thinking AND right feeling? To know God deeply AND worship him passionately? Too often, Christians act as though these things are at odds with one another. But what if God intends for us to possess a Christianity that is radically committed to biblical truth, in a way that did not diminish the life of the heart, but actually intensified it? Adam Ramsey invites us to engage both our minds and our emotions in our walk with God as we gaze at him until our hearts sing. He sums it up like this: \\"My hope in these following pages is to paint a biblical portrait of what God is actually like, so that we can gaze upon him together until our hearts can t help but sing. To behold him in such a way that our daily experience is transformed with a deepened awareness of who it is we pray to, who it is that is with us, and who it is that we are loved by. To let God s truth set our hearts on fire.\\" If you yearn for God but desire a clearer biblical picture of this God whom you love, or if you have been walking with God for a while now, but your experience of him has become settled or dry, then this book is for you.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2tBBEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"College Reading with the Active Critical Thinking Method: Book 2","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k_Klegn_AKwC&dq=College+Reading+with+the+Active+Critical+Thinking+Method:+Book+2&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tell Me No Lies","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The divine love and wisdom (Everyman's library [no. 635] Theology and philosophy)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-IQPAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+divine+love+and+wisdom+(Everyman%27s+library+%5Bno.+635%5D+Theology+and+philosophy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creative Tatting With Beads, Shuttle and Needle","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"THE EYE OF THE STORM.","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Disturbing Stranger","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The knave of diamonds,","description":"\\"The Knave of Diamonds\\" by Ethel M.

ASHLEY MONTAGU S book possesses two great merits rarely found in current discussions of human problems. Where most writers over-simplify, he insists on the principle of multiple and interlocking causation. And where most assume that  facts will speak for themselves,  he makes it clear that facts are mere ventriloquists  dummies, and can be made to justify any course of action that appeals to the socially conditioned passions of the individuals concerned. These two truths are sufficiently obvious; but they are seldom recognized, for the good reason that they are very depressing. To recognize the first truth is to recognize the fact that there are no panaceas and that therefore most of the golden promises made by political reformers and revolutionaries are illusory. And to recognize the truth that facts do not speak for themselves, but only as man s socially conditioned passions dictate, is to recognize that our current educational processes can do very little to ameliorate the state of the world. In the language of traditional theology (so much more realistic, in many respects, than the  liberal  philosophies which replaced it), most ignorance is voluntary and depends upon acts of the conscious or subconscious will. Thus, the fallacies underlying the propaganda of racial hatred are not recognized because, as Dr. Montagu points out, most people have a desire to act aggressively, and the members of other ethnic groups are convenient victims, whom one may attack with a good conscience. This desire to act aggressively has its origins in the largely unavoidable frustrations imposed upon the individual by the processes of early education and later adjustments to the social environment. Dr. Montagu might have added that aggressiveness pays a higher dividend in emotional satisfaction than does co?peration. Co?peration may produce a mild emotional glow; but the indulgence of aggressivness can be the equivalent of a drinking bout or sexual orgy. In our industrial societies, the goodness of life is measured in terms of the number and intensity of the excitements experienced. (Popular philosophy is moulded by, and finds expression in, the advertising pages of popular magazines. Significantly enough, the word that occurs more frequently in those pages than any other is  thrill. ) Like sex and alcohol, aggressiveness can give enormous thrills. Under existing social conditions, it is therefore easy to represent aggressiveness as good. Concerning the remedies for the social diseases he has so penetratingly diagnosed, Dr. Montagu says very little, except that they will have to consist in some process of education. But what process? It is to be hoped that he will answer this question at length in another work.

A Muslim meditating on a busy sidewalk; the mysterious offerings of a local botanica; the comings and goings of harried executives; the events of September 11, 2001; all provide an opportunity to reflect on the varied ways God is at work in our lives. The underlying theme in his reflections is how to balance our desire to be in control with the gospel's call to risk everything and let God be in charge. Father Al finds beauty and hope in the people and events he encounters, whether at a street fair, wandering past an excavation site, waiting for a drawbridge to come down, or visiting the performing arts center. He deftly applies the insights of St. Benedict and other monastic writers to his observations and meditations, and provides reflection questions at the end of each chapter. Beautifully and thoughtfully written, spiritually rich, this book will delight and inspire all who long to connect with God in their everyday lives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dD6wIYoa5PEC&dq=Street+Wisdom:+Connecting+with+God+in+Everyday+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Into This World We're Thrown","description":"\\"Riders on the stormRiders on the stormInto this house we're bornInto this world we're thrownLike a dog without a boneAn actor out on loanRiders on the storm\\"- The Doors","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EX6oxQEACAAJ&dq=Into+This+World+We%27re+Thrown&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Government Project","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"PingLongevity: The Complete Way of Life for Young, Healthy and Long Lasting Spirit and Body","description":"A book about staying young --a breakthrough system of longevity combining the state of art modern medicine with 5000 year time proven Taoist methods.

All the key psychological issues in sport are explored, and difficult questions are raised: are athletes born or made? Does playing sport affect personality? What effect do cultural beliefs have on personal sporting development? Matt Jarvis has substantially revised and expanded his original coverage of the subject from the highly successful first edition (Sport Psychology (1999) in the Routledge Modular Psychology series). Here he provides a succinct but comprehensive account of major theory and research in sport psychology, whilst maintaining the readable style and student-centred approach which made the previous book so successful. Key issues covered include: Personality and sport Attitudes to sport Aggression Social factors affecting performance Arousal and anxiety Motivation and skill acquisition.

The headline stories of Cold War spies and surveillance by the secret police, of political repression and corruption, do not tell the whole story. After the unification of Germany in 1990 many East Germans remembered their lives as interesting, varied, and full of educational, career, and leisure opportunities: in many ways  perfectly ordinary lives.  Using the rich resources of the newly-opened GDR archives, Mary Fulbrook investigates these conflicting narratives. She explores the transformation of East German society from the ruins of Hitler's Third Reich to a modernizing industrial state. She examines changing conceptions of normality within an authoritarian political system, and provides extraordinary insights into the ways in which individuals perceived their rights and actively sought to shape their own lives. Replacing the simplistic black-and-white concept of  totalitarianism  by the notion of a  participatory dictatorship,  this book seeks to reinstate the East German people as actors in their own history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YNkv4kwf7F8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seinfeld: The Making of an American Icon","description":"The never-before-told story of how Jerry Seinfeld made his dream come true -- of how this very ambitious, extremely driven, compulsively perfectionistic carefully worked his way up through the knock-down-drag-out world of stand-up comedy as it began to explode in the mid-1970s, & how he went on to co-create in the late 80s what is considered to be the most successful TV sitcom in its history.

She offers a startlingly original solution to the problem that brought about the collapse of modern philosophy: the problem of universals.

Sallustius Crispus or Sallust (86-35/34 B.C.) recounts the dramatic events of 63 B.C., when a disgruntled and impoverished nobleman, L. Sergius Catilina, turned to armed revolution after two electoral defeats. Among his followers were a group of heavily indebted young aristocrats, the Roman poor, and a military force in the north of Italy. With his trademark archaizing style, Sallust skillfully captures the drama of the times, including an early morning attempt to assassinate the consul Cicero and two emotionally charged speeches, by Julius Caesar and Cato the Younger, in a senatorial debate over the fate of the arrested conspirators. Sallust wrote while the Roman Republic was being transformed into an empire during the turbulent first century B.C. The Bellum Catilinae is well-suited for second-year or advanced Latin study and provides a fitting introduction to the richness of Latin literature, while also pointing the way to a critical investigation of late-Republican government and historiography. Ramsey's introduction and commentary bring the text to life for Latin students. This new edition (updated since the 2007 printing) includes two maps and two city plans, an updated and now annotated bibliography, a list of divergences from the 1991 Oxford Classical Text of Sallust, and revisions in the introduction and commentary.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=U3QqCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Seed & the Giant Saguaro","description":"Winner of the American Horticultural Society Award for Excellence In Garden Book Publishing Winner of the Silver Medal for Best Reference from the Garden Writer s Association Filled with advice for the home gardener and the more seasoned horticulturist alike, The Seed Garden: The Art and Practice of Seed Saving provides straightforward instruction on collecting seed that is true-to-type and ready for sowing in next year s garden. In this comprehensive book, Seed Savers Exchange, one of the foremost American authorities on the subject, and the Organic Seed Alliance bring together decades of knowledge to demystify the time-honored tradition of saving the seed of more than seventy-five coveted vegetable and herb crops from heirloom tomatoes and long-favored varieties of beans, lettuces, and cabbages to centuries-old varieties of peppers and grains. With clear instructions, lush photographs, and easy-to-comprehend profiles on individual vegetable crops, this book not only teaches us how to go about conserving these important varieties for future generations and for planting out in next year s garden, it also provides a deeper understanding of the importance of saving these genetically valuable varieties of vegetables that have evolved over the centuries through careful selection by farmers and home gardeners. Through simple lessons and master classes on crop selection, pollination, roguing, and the processes of harvesting and storing seeds, this book ensures that these time-honored traditions can continue. Many of these vegetable varieties are treasured for traits that are singular to their strain, whether that is a resistance to disease, an ability to grow well in a region for which that crop is not typically well suited, resistance to early bolting, or simply because it is a great-tasting variety. In an age of genetically modified crops and hybrid seed, a growing appreciation for saving seeds of these time-tested, open-pollinated cultivars has found a new audience from home vegetable gardeners and cooks to restaurant chefs and local farmers. Whether interested in simply saving seeds for home use or working to conserve rare varieties of beloved squashes and tomatoes, this book provides a deeper understanding of the art, the science, and the joy of saving seeds.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xr7yDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Seed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Climbers guide to Montana","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-b_dPgAACAAJ&dq=Climbers+guide+to+Montana&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Magazine","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Blood Ties: The Life and Loves of Grant Mitchell (Eastenders)","description":"A novel which chronicles facts about the character Grant Mitchell that are already known to viewers of the television soap opera, EastEnders.

Taylor Jenkins Reid, New York Times bestselling author of The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo When she was twenty-six and broke, Skye didn t think twice before selling her eggs and happily pocketing the cash. Now approaching forty, Skye still moves through life entirely and unrepentantly on her own terms, living out of a suitcase and avoiding all manner of serious relationships. Maybe her junior high classmates weren t wrong when they voted her  Most Likely to Be Single  instead of  Most Ride-or-Die Homie,  but at least she s always been free to do as she pleases. Then a twelve-year-old girl tracks Skye down during one of her brief visits to her hometown of Philadelphia and informs Skye that she s  her egg.  Skye s life is thrown into sharp relief and she decides that it might be time to actually try to have a meaningful relationship with another human being. Spoiler alert: It s not easy. Things get even more complicated when Skye realizes that the woman she tried and failed to pick up the other day is the girl s aunt, and now it s awkward.
