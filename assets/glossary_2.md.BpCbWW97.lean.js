He is tangled in a web of forced sex, coerced into robbery, and it is only a short step to killing as a choice. At the center of the book is a sensational murder trial, which oddly resembles the O. J. Simpson case. The cast features an abrasive, starstruck female judge, blundering prosecuting attorneys, a nerdy defendant who reserves his right to silence, and Rona Horowitz, a pint-size ball of fire of a defense lawyer. The defendant may be guilty, but energetic Rona tries one outrageous legal stunt after another in order to exonerate her client. Drenched in the glamour and the sleaze of highline and lowlife Hollywood, this satirical and entertaining look at the criminal justice system, turned inside out and upside down by showbiz at its best and worst, is a panorama of crime, corruption, and violence delivered with grim authenticity and hilarious awfulness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wdzsDAAAQBAJ&dq=Sex+and+Violence+in+Hollywood&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Orpheus' Blues","description":"A novel of self-discovery about Jack Stewart, a jazz musician.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cyIMAAAACAAJ&dq=Orpheus%27+Blues&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"English-Tagalog Visayan Dictionary -- Philippine Books","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qdPFPgAACAAJ&dq=English-Tagalog+Visayan+Dictionary+--+Philippine+Books&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jbuilder 2 Bible (Bible Series)","description":"An A-to-Z tutorial/reference to programming Java in the Borland JBuilder programming environment, this text follows the Bible guidelines, using user-functions rather than product features as a basis for organization and tutorial.

Health law policy researcher Timothy Caulfield finds out in this thoroughly unique, engaging, and provocative book about celebrity culture and its iron grip on today s society. Over the past decade, our perceptions of beauty, health, success, and happiness have become increasingly framed by a popular culture steeped in celebrity influence and ever more disconnected from reality. Research tells us that our health decisions and goals are influenced by celebrity culture and endorsements, our children's ambitions are now overwhelmingly governed by the fantasy of fame, and the ideals of beauty and success are mediated through a celebrity-dominated worldview. But while much has been written about the cause of our obsession with the rich and famous, Caulfield argues that not enough has been done to debunk celebrity messages and promises about health, diet, beauty, or happiness. From super-thin models to Gwyneth Paltrow s endorsement of a gluten free-diet for almost anyone, celebrity opinions have the power to dominate our conversations and outlooks. In this book, Caulfield provides an entertaining look into the celebrity world, including vivid accounts of his own experiences trying out for American Idol, having his skin resurfaced, and doing the cleanse; interviews with actual celebrities; thought-provoking facts, and a practical and evidence-based reality check on our own celebrity ambitions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CP8BDAAAQBAJ&dq=The+8-Day+Detox+Breakthrough&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vagus Nerve Stimulation, Second Edition","description":"This second edition presents a timely and practical discussion of vagal nerve stimulation in a clear and well-illustrated format.

Fluent in twenty-nine languages, he found it easy to pass himself off as a native, thereby gaining unique insight into societies otherwise closed to Western scrutiny. He followed service as an intelligence officer in India by a daring penetration of the sacred Islamic cities of Mecca and Medina disguised as a pilgrim. He was the first European to enter the forbidden African city of Harar, and discovered Lake Tanganyika in his search for the source of the Nile. His fascination with, and research into, the intimate customs of ethnic races (which would eventually culminate in his brilliant Kama Sutra) earned him a racy reputation in that age of sexual repression. Little surprise, then, that Isabel Arundell's aristocratic mother objected to her daughter's marriage to this most notorious of figures. Isabel, however, was a spirited, independent-minded woman and was also deeply, passionately in love with Richard. Against all expectations but their own, the Burtons enjoyed a remarkably successful marriage.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xe_mKejCFuIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The River Road","description":"Dertien jaar geleden verliet Lucy Sheridan Summer River, nadat Mason Fletcher haar redde uit de handen van Tristan.

Because even when hours pass without a bite, nothing beats the rugged beauty of the surroundings.

Through in-depth interviews with the sport's acknowledged gurus, author Chris Santella goes beyond standard guides to convey the very essence of the recommended locations. Readers can vicariously cast mouse pattners to fifty-pound taimen in the wilds of Mongolia, wrangle with wily permit off the Florida Keys, and match the hatch on Montana's Armstrong's Spring Creek.

Hull argues that the routines and practices of the Imperial German Army, unchecked by effective civilian institutions, increasingly sought the absolute destruction of its enemies as the only guarantee of the nation's security. So deeply embedded were the assumptions and procedures of this distinctively German military culture that the Army, in its drive to annihilate the enemy military, did not shrink from the utter destruction of civilian property and lives. Carried to its extreme, the logic of \\"military necessity\\" found real security only in extremities of destruction, in the \\"silence of the graveyard.\\" Hull begins with a dramatic account, based on fresh archival work, of the German Army's slide from administrative murder to genocide in German Southwest Africa (19047). The author then moves back to 1870 and the war that inaugurated the Imperial era in German history, and analyzes the genesis and nature of this specifically German military culture and its operations in colonial warfare. In the First World War the routines perfected in the colonies were visited upon European populations. Hull focuses on one set of cases (Belgium and northern France) in which the transition to total destruction was checked (if barely) and on another (Armenia) in which \\"military necessity\\" caused Germany to accept its ally's genocidal policies even after these became militarily counterproductive. She then turns to the Endkampf (1918), the German General Staff's plan to achieve victory in the Great War even if the homeland were destroyed in the process a seemingly insane campaign that completes the logic of this deeply institutionalized set of military routines and practices. Hull concludes by speculating on the role of this distinctive military culture in National Socialism's military and racial policies. Absolute Destruction has serious implications for the nature of warmaking in any modern power. At its heart is a warning about the blindness of bureaucratic routines, especially when those bureaucracies command the instruments of mass death.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=V_4rITDiSWgC&dq=Absolute+Destruction:+Military+Culture+and+the+Practices+of+War+in+Imperial+Germany&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Bear and the Missing Pie (Maurice Sendak's Little Bear) (Festival Reader)","description":"Little Bear and his friends look for clues to the mystery of the missing pie.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zIf8wAEACAAJ&dq=Little+Bear+and+the+Missing+Pie+(Maurice+Sendak%27s+Little+Bear)+(Festival+Reader)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Capital Budgeting: Planning and Control of Capital Expenditures","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CZgpAQAAMAAJ&dq=Capital+Budgeting:+Planning+and+Control+of+Capital+Expenditures&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Child's Machiavelli : A Primer on Power","description":"Illustrated with images appropriated from children's classics, a tongue-in-cheek primer shows readers how to use strategies of manipulation and domination in the style of Machiavelli","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JnwNAAAACAAJ&dq=A+Child%27s+Machiavelli+:+A+Primer+on+Power&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Korean In Plain English De Mente","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tVzSAQAACAAJ&dq=Korean+In+Plain+English+De+Mente&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Battle Royale Vol. 8","description":"Reads from back to front and from right to left.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=C9edMIPfd50C&dq=Battle+Royale+Vol.+8&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"77th Art Directors Annual (No. 77)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Rsl8ePy53zMC&dq=77th+Art+Directors+Annual+(No.+77)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Why The Sky Is Far Away: A Nigerian Folktale","description":"The sky was once so close to the Earth that people cut parts of it to eat, but their waste and greed caused the sky to move far away.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YewxPwAACAAJ&dq=Why+The+Sky+Is+Far+Away:+A+Nigerian+Folktale&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Tennis Doctor RX - The essential courtside companion","description":"Rachel wekt als advocate in Manhattan.

The companion text, EXPLORACIONES (Explorations), can also be used in class, if time permits, or be assigned to students to complete for homework. EXPLORACIONES expands on the material presented in INTERACCIONES and contains detailed grammar explanations and grammar practice along with reading, writing, and listening exercises. PARA EMPEZAR has a greatly reduced grammar syllabus from most other introductory Spanish texts, to the benefit of both student and instructor. With PARA EMPEZAR, instructors can easily complete the text in one year and students can truly master the most important basic grammar structures, giving them a stronger foundation for upper level courses. PARA EMPEZAR provides students with unique cultural coverage as well, as the text tells the story of a trip through Mexico.

It was through the efforts of the Peacemaker that the warring tribes of the Northeast joined together to form the Iroquois Confederacy over 500 years ago. The Peacemaker's work is preserved in the legend and history retold here and in the Confederacy's traditional constitution, which now influences many Native American governing systems throughout the United States. It also has had a major -- and rarely acknowledged -- impact in shaping the American Bill of Rights and the U. S. Constitution. The Iroquois Confederacy itself remains united under Deganawidah's unbroken spiritual lineage -- today represented by Chief Sidney I Hill, the Tadodaho, who is the temporal and spiritual leader of the Six Nations. Chief Hill has provided a message for this edition. The late Chief Leon Shenandoah, former Tadodaho, wrote the foreword. In an epilogue, historian John Mohawk takes up the story where Paul Wallace left off, chronicling the Confederacy's struggles to preserve its lands and sovereign dignity since the eighteenth century. The teachings of the Peacemaker remain vital today, offering an inspired model for consensus-building among nations and peoples throughout the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SY6WPwAACAAJ&dq=White+Roots+of+Peace:+Iroquois+Book+of+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Merde!","description":"What are the French really like?

It holds the vast wealth of past inhabitants, a wealth extending back to the birth of civilization. Vivid photographs reveal the temples and tombs of the pharaohs, the desert monasteries of the early Christians, the mosques and palaces of caliphs, sultans, khedives, kings, and presidents. Seen from the air, their grandeur comes fully alive; the pyramids, after all, are the sole survivors of the seven wonders of the Greek world. Beyond the valley and its man-made splendors lie unspoiled and inaccessible natural phenomena. Luminous colorplates uncover an extraordinary variety of landscapes in the endless sands, from sensuous dunes to ragged cliffs to gem-like oases. The soft light of early morning reveals the somber desert blossoming into color: the mountains of Sinai turn red, black, green, and yellow. Along the Red Sea the startling beauty of rich coral reefs stops abruptly at the barren shore. Few places areas alive in the collective imagination as Egypt. But the cacophony of modern Cairo has all but drowned ancient rhythms, and roads, factories, and oil fields have befouled the pristine desert. From the ground, among throngs of tourists and teeming millions of Egyptians, it is easy to lose sight of the past. Only when seen from the air do Egypt's mystery and magic come completely to life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GUFjQgAACAAJ&dq=Egypt:+Gift+of+the+Nile:+An+Aerial+Portrait&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Snowbound (Baby-Sitters Club Super Special, 7)","description":"When Stoneybrook is paralyzed by a massive blizzard, Dawn and her mother get stranded at the airport, Jessi is snowed in at her dance school, and Kristy's boyfriend gets stuck overnight at her house.

In Breakthrough Swimming, legendary swimming coach and researcher Cecil Colwin provides a rich perspective on the development of the sport and explains major advances in stroke mechanics, training methods, and racing techniques. Accompanied by richly detailed illustrations, this engaging text is one of the most insightful written works on the sport. It makes clear sense out of the scientific principles and puts into context the historical changes in the sport. Not only will you gain a greater understanding of competitive swimming through its origins and evolution, but you'll also gain these valuable skills: - Improve your stroke technique, starts, and turns. - Improve your feel of the water by learning to anticipate and effectively manipulate the reacting flow of the water. - Understand the hydrodynamics of swimming and learn how water reacts to the forces you apply with each swimming stroke. - Improve your conditioning and develop a better training program by understanding the principles of training. - Learn how to design different types of workouts to produce specific physiological effects. - Learn how to plan a seasonal program and how to relate your training to the pace of the race you intend to swim. The book includes a chapter contributed by Dr. David Pyne, sport physiologist to the 2000 Australian Olympic swimming team. Pyne covers the physiology of modern swimming training and the preparation of swimming teams for top-flight international competition. Breakthrough Swimming covers every aspect of competitive swimming from its spawning ground in early 19th-century England to the present day, including the profound changes that occurred in the last decade of the 20th century. The book also explains the societal changes of recent years, such as the advent of professional swimming and the specter of performance-enhancing drugs. Combining history with the latest innovations, Breakthrough Swimming is the definitive work on the past, present, and future of competitive swimming.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ikv9cLfBsNMC&dq=Breakthrough+Swimming&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Faulkner in the University","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=I4ZBAAAAIAAJ&dq=Faulkner+in+the+University&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Attack and Defense (Elementary Go, Vol 5)","description":"Attack and Defense lays down a few clear principles, then goes through a wealth of applications: examples, problems, and case studies from professional play.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=U461AAAAIAAJ&dq=Attack+and+Defense+(Elementary+Go,+Vol+5)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"E.I.L.

The meeting was organised by the Agricultural Research Institute in Nicosia, Cyprus in collaboration with the Seed and Plant Genetic Resources Service of the FAO. In line with the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action, the meeting recognised that one of the major challenges facing most countries in the Near East and North Africa is the need to invest significant resources in strengthening their capacity to increase the availability of good quality seeds of a wider range of plant varieties. This will contribute to the maximisation of both agrobiodiversity and productivity, in order to achieve national food security while reducing environmental degradation and the depletion of natural resources. The meeting proposed and agreed to establish a Regional Consultative Forum on Seed Policy and Programmes for the Near East and Africa (CFS-NENA). The forum will facilitate intercountry scientific and technical co-operation on seed production and supply, and promote crop genetic resources evaluation, conservation and utilisation in the region.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TxrhqkRZlvEC&dq=The+Seed+from+the+East&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Morrissey - In His Own Words","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=USStQgAACAAJ&dq=Morrissey+-+In+His+Own+Words&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sometimes I Work in New York","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IE_IAPh3zx4C&dq=Sometimes+I+Work+in+New+York&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How Much Land Does a Man Need?","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=of7BswEACAAJ&dq=How+Much+Land+Does+a+Man+Need%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book on The Book: A Landmark Inquiry into Which Strategies in the Modern Game Actually Work","description":"Diehard fanatics will enjoy this comprehensive collection of groundbreaking baseball strategies, analyses, statistics, and studies Baseball fans all across America will delight in this fascinating analysis of strategies and statistics.

NPR would offer programming that promoted empowerment and social change, appeal to the broad spectrum of U.S. society, and serve communities traditionally ignored by commercial broadcasting. This book tells the story of how NPR has tried to embody these ideals and the extent to which the network has reached its goals. Michael P. McCauley describes NPR's evolution from virtual obscurity when it was riddled with difficulties - political battles, unseasoned leadership, funding problems - to a first-rate broadcast organization. McCauley's work draws on a wealth of primary sources, including dozens of interviews with people who have been central to the NPR story. He examines various internal debates about the direction of NPR and the content of its programming. McCauley also places the development of NPR within the historical context of the wider U.S. radio industry, the ideological and political conflicts of postwar America, and contemporary debates about the ways in which mass media can better serve the citizens of a democracy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XVyImUj6AGkC&dq=NPR:+The+Trials+and+Triumphs+of+National+Public+Radio&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The affluent society","description":"A leading economist discusses his theories on social disequilibrium and suggests ways of restoring the economic balance","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=buihYlwXhuwC&dq=The+affluent+society&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"POLYWATER.","description":"Popular Science gives our readers the information and tools to improve their technology and their world.

They tell you what to feed your child, how to get your child to sleep, and even how to raise your child to be a responsible and ethical adult. Yet each day spent as a family brings new challenges, questions, and wonder at the task of parenting. Our Share of Night, Our Share of Morning, like parenting, is filled with everyday moments that evoke laughs, smiles, a lump in the throat - and eye-opening perspectives on life, love, and spirituality. At once wise, funny, lyrical, and down-to-earth, Nancy Fuchs explores the transformative spiritual adventure that parents experience while bringing up their children. Through the lives of the many parents she interviews, Fuchs explores how children provide a crash course in love, grace, forgiveness, and mystery. Beautifully written, Our Share of Night, Our Share of Morning is about how parenting opens us up to a much experienced but little talked about spiritual journey; it is about elation and exhaustion, wonderment and wondering, and the discovery that parenting is a spiritual path that \\"raises\\" the souls of both parent and child in often unexpected ways.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=M11UHQAACAAJ&dq=Our+Share+of+Night,+Our+Share+of+Morning:+Parenting+As+a+Spiritual+Journey&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shakespeare Planet","description":"After a thousand years in space the earth vessel lands on a remote planet capable of supporting human life, Shakespeare's Planet.

This report summarizes a three-phase research project undertaken by the USAF Institute for National Security Studies on behalf of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency to forecast long-range global trends affecting arms control technologies. The report projects the international political, economic, and scientific environments to the year 2015. It posits economic and technological drivers as shaping the system, including its military and political dimensions. The result will be a two-tiered system, with great danger arising from significant proliferation in the second tier and the transition zone between tiers. The report next draws conclusions from this likely future for the scope, value, and practice of arms control. Arms control will be focused less on limitation and reduction of existing weapons, although the endgame between the United States and Russia will remain a significant effort. The focus will shift to the less well-defined realm of counterproliferation, and to marginal, failing, and failed states as well as nontraditional and non-state actors. New dimensions will be added, including control efforts toward small arms, advanced conventional weapons, military space, and information operations. The report then extrapolates from this future to assess the likely arms control technology requirements in cooperative, noncooperative, intrusive, and nonintrusive regimes. The projection here is continuing requirements for each of these specialized sets of technologies, with particular emphasis on multiple-use technologies for remote arms control compliance and verification monitoring as well as for intelligence detection and collection.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8jIZc144mgMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"101 Career Alternatives for Teachers: Exciting Job Opportunities for Teachers Outside the Teaching Profession","description":"TheJob-Search Resource for Teachers Considering a New Career Teachers, are you ready for a career change?

He is trapped; he goes nowhere. He is a modern day hysteric, a psychoanalyst's dream. He writes the same thing over and over, runs the same spinning track, as if somehow, through the repetition of extremes, he could eliminate the trauma, break its foul-smelling, icy-fingered spell. Only it is a spell of beauty --the beauty that comes from devastation, from the constant struggle to rise again in that roaring fire's shouldered wake. You will find no plot or answers here, only the unbearable loss of abandonment and grief. Make no mistake: Doug Rice kills us again and again and he does not want us to survive it, for he has been burned at the stake and is burning still. He is a ghost who can do nothing but plead with his bones and remind us with the choking beauty ghosts bring. Despite his pleas, you will not like him. You will not like him, and yet . . .Skin Prayer is the power of redemption in the word when life has failed us. It has no inside or outside, it is only itself. It is the self-enclosed, hermetic world of obsessive need, a space where one can't breath. And yet it is breath. In its own suffocated space, if we survive it, or are patient enough not to throw it aside, it gives us insufferable hope.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VzcGAAAACAAJ&dq=Skin+Prayer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Between","description":"Liz Valchar - mooi, populair en rijk - wordt in de nacht van haar achttiende verjaardag wakker van een hardnekkig gebonk.

The caddy sees everything - the ambition, the strategy, the rivalries, the jealousies - that occurs behind the scenes. Award-winning John Feinstein, America's favourite sportswriter, got one of golf's legendary caddies to reveal the secrets behind the most popular sport of our time. Bruce Edwards was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease in January 2003, a progressive disease that attacks nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord, but he dominated coverage of the 2003 US Open. This is a position not usually bestowed on a caddy, but Edwards was no ordinary caddy. In 1973, after forgoing college, Edwards walked on the course behind a young Tom Watson and never looked back. Watson would go on to win eight major titles with Bruce Edwards by his side. Edwards continued to do the job he had dedicated more than half his life to right up to his death in April 2004, aged 49. This is a moving, dramatic and thoughtful book about a life devoted to sports.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=scI2AQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heart of Wisdom: The Essential Wisdom Teachings of Buddha","description":"Heart of Wisdom is based on an oral commentary to the Essence of Wisdom Sutra (the Heart Sutra), which was given by the author at Manjushri Mahayana buddhist Centre in England. The Heart Sutra, one of the best known and most popular of Mahayana Buddhist scriptures, contains the essence of Buddha\`s teachings on emptiness and the methods to develop the wisdom that understands this ultimate reality. In this highly acclaimed explanation of the Sutra, Geshe Kelsang reveals its explicit and implicit meanings with both clarity and authority, and relates them to the five Mahayana paths that lead to full enlightenment. Seen in modern light, Buddha had been able to perceive, even see the vast spatial distances between atoms and between sub-atomic particles filled with electrons and even sub-eletrons in a state of high vibration. This atomic condition corresponds to a similar pattern in the brains of living beings and to interstellar and interplanetary gaps. The subject of emptiness as the author explains deals with perceptions leading to concept of formation and creation of a world of sense ideas which is merely a random arranging of material resources in an otherwise empty space filled with vibrations of these very particles. This is a rather difficult subject handled facilely by the author.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1pGS7_1HoXIC&dq=Heart+of+Wisdom:+The+Essential+Wisdom+Teachings+of+Buddha&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Christmas Tree","description":"Mr. Forgetful is not at all good at remembering things, so it is hardly surprising that this Christmas he has forgotten to buy a tree.

One of the most radical designs of the post-war era, the propeller-driven YB-35 bomber's all-wing design minimized drag and promised maximum payload capacity and terrific endurance. The YB-49, a turbojet powered variant built on the YB-35 airframe, forever altered aviation history and inspired the design of the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. Originally printed by Northrop Aircraft in 1948, the YB-49 Flying Wing Pilot's Flight Operating Manual taught pilots everything they needed to know before entering the cockpit. Originally classified \\"Restricted,\\" the manual was declassified long ago and is here reprinted in book form.

The importance of sisters has been even more marginalized. Sue A. Kuba explores this omission in The Role of Sisters in Women's Development, seeking to broaden and enrich current understanding of the psychology of women. This unique work is distinguished by Kuba's phenomenological method of research, rooted in a single prompt: \\"Tell me about your relationship with your sister.\\" Rich in detail, the responses (many of which are reproduced at length within the book) provide a complex picture of sister relationships across the lifespan. Integrating these stories with current literature about gender and family composition for sisters of difference (disabled and lesbian sisters) and ethnic sisters, this book provides useful recommendations for therapeutic understanding of the significance of sisters in everyday life, integrating diverse perspectives in order to address the ways clinicians can enhance psychological work with women clients. A valuable contribution to the field of mental health, The Role of Sisters in Women's Development is highly recommended for therapists who wish to broaden their inquiry into the sister connection, as well as anyone who wants to further understand the importance of sisterhood.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=N3ASDAAAQBAJ&dq=Sisters+Helping+Sisters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My folks and the Civil War: A treasury of Civil War stories shared by Capper's and Grit readers","description":"From quotes by Jack Nicklaus and Jack Lemmon to Tiger Woods and Bob Hope, this is the first sophisticated, literate book about golf by golfers themselves.

This book is designed for students who plan to specialize in logic, as well as for those who are interested in the applications of logic to other areas of mathematics. Used as a text, it could form the basis of a beginning graduate-level course. There are three main chapters: Set Theory, Model Theory, and Recursion Theory. The Set Theory chapter describes the set-theoretic foundations of all of mathematics, based on the ZFC axioms. It also covers technical results about the Axiom of Choice, well-orderings, and the theory of uncountable cardinals. The Model Theory chapter discusses predicate logic and formal proofs, and covers the Completeness, Compactness, and Lowenheim-Skolem Theorems, elementary submodels, model completeness, and applications to algebra. This chapter also continues the foundational issues begun in the set theory chapter. Mathematics can now be viewed as formal proofs from ZFC. Also, model theory leads to models of set theory. This includes a discussion of absoluteness, and an analysis of models such as H( ) and R( ). The Recursion Theory chapter develops some basic facts about computable functions, and uses them to prove a number of results of foundational importance; in particular, Church's theorem on the undecidability of logical consequence, the incompleteness theorems of Godel, and Tarski's theorem on the non-definability of truth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_B_oQQAACAAJ&dq=The+axiom+of+choice+(Studies+in+logic+and+the+foundations+of+mathematics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Health Disparities Myth","description":"The authors of this book conclude that differences in treatment vary by race but not because of it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Kz4fAQAAIAAJ&dq=Health+Disparities+Myth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Monstrosities: Bodies And British Romanticism","description":"Paul Youngquist reveals the cultural politics of embodiment in Britain in the late 18th & early 19th centuries.

Was it their fear of Caesar's tyrannical power? Or were these aristocratic senators worried that Caesar's land reforms and leanings toward democracy would upset their own control over the Roman Republic? Parenti (History as Mystery, etc.) narrates a provocative history of the late republic in Rome (100-33 B.C.) to demonstrate that Caesar's death was the culmination of growing class conflict, economic disparity and political corruption. He reconstructs the history of these crucial years from the perspective of the Roman people, the masses of slaves, plebs and poor farmers who possessed no political power. Roughly 99% of the state's wealth was controlled by 1% of the population, according to Parenti. By the 60s B.C., the poor populace had begun to find spokesmen among such leaders as the tribunes Tiberius Gracchus and his younger brother, Gaius. Although the Gracchi attempted to introduce various reforms, they were eventually murdered, and the reform movements withered. Julius Caesar, says Parenti, took up where they left off, introducing laws to improve the condition of the poor, redistributing land and reducing unemployment. As Parenti points out, such efforts threatened the landed aristocracy's power in the Senate and resulted in Caesar's assassination. Parenti's method of telling history from the ''bottom up'' will be controversial, but he recreates the struggles of the late republic with such scintillating storytelling and deeply examined historical insight that his book provides an important alternative to the usual views of Caesar and the Roman Empire.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PuwDLlf6OXAC&dq=History+of+Julius+Caesar&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Instructions in rifle and carbine firing for the United States Army","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BdVCAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"McSe Core Requirements Study Kit (Mcse Certification Series (Core Edition Study Guide))","description":"Here's the book you need to prepare for the Implementing and Managing Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 exam (70-284).

Met felle kleuren, zwarte contouren en een eenvoudig expressieve tekenstijl wordt zijn werk door grote directheid en een sterke intu?tie gekenmerkt. Het raadsel van de natuur met haar kracht van schepping maar ook vernieling, is voor hem van voortdurende fascinatie. Tegelijkertijd stond Chaissac, vooral via intensieve correspondentie, in contact met bekende kunstenaars in Parijs als Otto Freundlich en Jean Dubuffet, die zijn werk waardeerden en bekend maakten. 0Dit boek laat voor het eerst een representatief overzicht van Chaissacs werk zien in dialoog met bekende kunstenaars van de COBRA-groep. In de ruwe en snel gemaakte manier van schilderen en beeldhouwen, in het gebruik van motieven als de slang of de totemfiguur worden de energie en zoektocht naar een oerkracht van kunst en schepping, die Chaissac en de COBRA kunstenaars deelden, duidelijk zichtbaar. Het boek presenteert een weinig bekend hoofdstuk in de Europese kunstgeschiedenis in het eerste decennium na het einde van WOII.00Exhibition: Kunstmuseum, The Hague, The Netherlands (08.05.-19.09.2021).","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=EHF6zgEACAAJ&dq=Chaissac&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chinese Characters: A Genealogy and Dictionary (English and Mandarin Chinese Edition)","description":"\\" ... over 4000 characters in this dictionary back to less than 200 pictographs and ideographs [by the radical system].\\"--Foreword.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=f6tQSAAACAAJ&dq=Chinese+Characters:+A+Genealogy+and+Dictionary+(English+and+Mandarin+Chinese+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eighteenth-Century Decoration: Design and the Domestic Interior in England","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Rx5oQgAACAAJ&dq=Eighteenth-Century+Decoration:+Design+and+the+Domestic+Interior+in+England&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Watercolor: Project Book for Beginners","description":"'This comprehensive Walter Foster Publishing and Reeves book is the perfect introductory guide for anyone who wants to learn the captivating art of watercolor painting.

Jurists elaborated the common law of torts. Workingmen's organizations founded a widespread system of cooperative insurance. Leading employers instituted welfare-capitalist accident relief funds. And social reformers advocated compulsory insurance such as workmen's compensation. John Fabian Witt argues that experiments in accident law at the turn of the twentieth century arose out of competing views of the loose network of ideas and institutions that historians call the ideology of free labor. These experiments a century ago shaped twentieth- and twenty-first-century American accident law; they laid the foundations of the American administrative state; and they occasioned a still hotly contested legal transformation from the principles of free labor to the categories of insurance and risk. In this eclectic moment at the beginnings of the modern state, Witt describes American accident law as a contingent set of institutions that might plausibly have developed along a number of historical paths. In turn, he suggests, the making of American accident law is the story of the equally contingent remaking of our accidental republic. Table of Contents: Introduction 1. Crippled Workingmen, Destitute Widows, and the Crisis of Free Labor 2. The Dilemmas of Classical Tort Law 3. The Cooperative Insurance Movement 4. From Markets to Managers 5. Widows, Actuaries, and the Logics of Social Insurance 6. The Passion of William Werner 7. The Accidental Republic Conclusion Notes Acknowledgments Index John Witt paints his portrait of industrializing America with the subtlety of a master and on an immense canvas. His magisterial history is much more than an account of the rise of workers compensation, still one of our greatest social reforms. Witt vividly recreates the social context of the late 19th century industrial world - workers' appalling injury and death rates, their mutual help and insurance associations, mass immigration, the rise of Taylorist management, the struggles to give new meaning to the free labor ideal, the encounter between European social engineering and American anti-statism and individualism, and the politics and economics of labor relations in the Progressive era. Out of these materials, Witt shows, the law helped fashion a new social order. His analysis has great contemporary significance, revealing both the alluring possibilities and the enduring limits of legal reform in America. It is destined to become a classic of social and legal history. --Peter H. Schuck, author of Diversity in America: Keeping Government at a Safe Distance John Witt shows us the power of perceptive legal history at work. Within the tangle of compensation for industrial accidents, he discovers not only a legal struggle whose outcome set the pattern for many 20th century interventions of government in economic life, but also a momentous confrontation between contract and collective responsibility. Anyone who finds American history absorbing will gain pleasure and insight from this book. --Viviana Zelizer, Princeton University, author of The Social Meaning of Money: Pin Money, Paychecks, Poor Relief, and Other Currencies In 1940 Willard Hurst and Lloyd Garrison inaugurated modern socio-legal studies in the United States with their history of workers' injuries and legal process in Wisconsin. Two generations later, John Fabian Witt's The Accidental Republic marks the full maturation of that field of inquiry. Deftly integrating a legal analysis of tort doctrine, a history of industrial accidents, and a fresh political-economic understanding of statecraft, Witt demonstrates the significance of turn-of-the-century struggles over work, injury, risk, reparation, and regulation in the making of our modern world. Sophisticated, comprehensive, and interdisciplinary, The Accidental Republic is legal history as Hurst and Garrison imagined it could be. --William Novak, The University of Chicago, author of The People's Welfare: Law and Regulation in Nineteenth-Century America","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tFDGpJpIWjMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Glory Enough for All: A Novel of the Civil War","description":"July 1864.

He worked in banking and other financial endeavors in the years after college, then signed on in 1922 as an adviser to the brokerage firm Low, Dixon & Company. While there, he later recounted in his Harvard class s 50th reunion yearbook,  I tried to write a pamphlet on why bonds were the best form of long term investment. But supporting evidence for this thesis could not be found.  This discovery led to the 1924 publication of  Common Stocks as Long Term Investments.  The book was widely reviewed and praised, and became a key intellectual support for the 1920s stock market boom. Its success enabled Smith to launch a mutual fund firm,  Investment Managers Company.  It also garnered him an invitation from the economist John Maynard Keynes, who had favorably reviewed the book in  The Nation , to join the Royal Economic Society.

One wrote highbrow music, the other lowbrow. Yet the two sides complemented each other. Neither could function without the other. Born and classically trained in imperial Russia, Vladimir Dukelsky (19031969) fled the Bolshevik Revolution with his family, discovered American popular music in cosmopolitan Constantinople, and pursued his budding interest to New York before his passion for classical music drew him to Paris, where the impresario Serge Diaghilev hired him to compose a ballet for the Ballets Russes. Taking a Chance on Love immerses us in Duke s dizzying globe-hopping and genre-swapping, as financial concerns and musical passions drive him from composing symphonies to writing songs, from brilliant successes to Broadway flops, and from performing with classical performers to writing books and articles. Throughout, as he crisscrosses the landscape of American music, collaborating with lyricists such as Howard Dietz, Ira Gershwin, and Sammy Cohn, the incomparable Vernon Duke emerges clearly from these pages: sometimes charming, sometimes infuriating, always entertaining. Although Vernon Duke has entered the canon of American standards with such songs as  Taking a Chance on Love,   I Can t Get Started,  and  April in Paris,  little is known about the composer with two personas. Taking a Chance on Love brings the intriguing double life of Dukelsky/Duke back into the spotlight, restoring a chapter to the history of the Great American Songbook and to the story of twentieth-century music.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=sX6mDwAAQBAJ&dq=TAKING+A+CHANCE+ON+LOVE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"So, You Want To Be Like Christ?: Eight Essentials to Get You There","description":"Inspired by the acts of sacrifice and discipline exemplified by the D-Day generation as well as the current generation of young American soldiers, many Christians today are looking for an obedient, disciplined approach to faith.

Short Fiction.","description":"In the Land of Dreamy Dreams, Ellen Gilchrist's acclaimed 1981 debut collection of short stories, introduced readers to a remarkable Southern voice which has sustained its power and influence through her more than 20 subsequent books. Gilchrist has a distinctive ear for language, and a deep understanding of her flawed, sometimes tragic characters. These fourteen stories, divided into three sections -- There's a Garden of Eden, Things Like the Truth, and Perils of the Nile -- are about mostly young, upper-class Southern women who are bored with the Junior League and having babies, and chafe against the restrictions of their sheltered lives. Talented and bright, but living in the shadow of men -- their husbands and fathers -- they resort to outrageous actions in pursuit of freer lives and uncompromised love, despite the consequences. This collection first introduced readers to some of Gilchrist's most beloved characters, such as Rhoda Manning and Nora Jane Whittington. PRAISE: \\"It's difficult to review a first book as good as this one without resorting to every known superlative clich ...Gilchrist is the real thing.\\"  Washington Post  A sustained display of delicately and rhythmically modulated prose and an unsentimental dissection of raw sentiment. Her stories are perceptive, her manner is both stylish and idiomatic  a rare and potent combination.   Times Literary Supplement  Witty, concise and wonderfully varied.

The secret of the missionary passion. If the Cross of CHRIST is anything to the mind, it is surely everything -- the most profound reality and the sublimest mystery. One comes to realize that literally all the wealth and glory of the Gospel centres here. The Cross is the pivot as well as the centre of New Testament thought. It is the exclusive mark of the Christian faith, the symbol of Christianity and its cynosure. The more unbelievers deny its crucial character, the more do believers find in it the key to the mysteries of sin and suffering. We rediscover the apostolic emphasis on the Cross when we read the Gospel with Moslems. We find that although the offence of the Cross remains, its magnetic power is irresistible. The following chapters are the result of meditations on the passion of our Lord and His Death on the Cross in the midst of men who deny the historicity of the crucifixion and the necessity of the atonement. But the Moslem is not alone in his denial. The message of the Cross has always been an outrage and a scandal, a superfluity of foolishness to the worldly-wise. Yet it is CHRIST on the Cross who will finally draw all men to Himself. Under the shadow of the Cross is rest and peace. The glory of the Cross is as real as its shame; and to meditate on the shame is to see the glory. The Cross interprets sin and righteousness and love. It is the power of GOD and the wisdom of GOD. Its shadow is the longest shadow in the world, because it fell even on the Resurrection morning. \\"He showed them His hands and His side.\\" Did He ever show them to you? Then were the disciples glad when they saw the scars of the Risen Lord. \\"But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world\\" (Galatians 6:14). Samuel Marinus Zwemer, [1867-1952] Samuel Zwemer was called to preach the Gospel to Muslims, and he is without doubt the greatest missionary to the Islamic world. On June 28, 1890, he began his mission, sailing from the United States on a Dutch liner the Obdam. Zwemer stopped in Europe to meet with other evangelical groups and then traveled to Beirut. Zwemer traveled throughout much of the Muslim world proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus including the Balkans, India, China, Africa, the Middle East.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HDFRMwEACAAJ&dq=The+Glory+of+the+Cross&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Selected Clarinet Solos with Piano Accompaniment (Everybody's Favorite Series, No. 43)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZUYhAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cicero and the Roman Republic,: With 56 illustrations in photogravure and 15 isotype charts in colour (Measure of the ages)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZEZVNJ2-DOwC&dq=Cicero+and+the+Roman+Republic,:+With+56+illustrations+in+photogravure+and+15+isotype+charts+in+colour+(Measure+of+the+ages)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From the Horse's Mouth","description":"A professional animal communicator shares her method for fostering communication between animals and humans, filling her book with poignant tales from her practice highlighting successful interactions between species.

This book uses that electronic music subculture as a route into an analysis of these principally literary representations of a music culture: why such secondary artefacts appear and what function they serve. The book conceives of a new literary genre to accommodate these stories born of the dancefloor - 'dancefloor-driven literature'. Using interviews with Irvine Welsh, author of Trainspotting (1994), alongside other dancefloor-driven authors Nicholas Blincoe and Jeff Noon as case studies, the book analyzes three separate ways writers draw on electronic dance music in their fictions, interrogating that very particular intermedial intersection between the sonic and the linguistic. It explores how such authors write about something so subterranean as the nightclub scene, and analyses what specific literary techniques they deploy to write lucidly and fluidly about the metronomic beat of electronic music and the chemical accelerant that further alters that relationship.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bo_WDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Murder at Gettysburg","description":"Historian Miranda Lewis is invited to a Civil War reenactment at Gettysburg by her old college friend Ginny and her father, a distinguished Virginian.

More than a million were written about him, many of which, Mencken liked to remark, were highly condemnatory. He was called, with good reason, the most powerful private citizen in America during the 1920s.This lively introduction to Mencken's life and work begins with a concise biographical portrait before proceeding to a consideration of the five major periods of the renowned Baltimorean's career: his literary apprenticeship; the growth of his national reputation; his fame and unprecedented popularity during the 1920s (when college students would flash the Paris-green cover of the American Mercury as a badge of sophistication); the decline of his reputation during the Depression; and his renewed popularity during the 1940s, with the publication of his autobiographical trilogy, the Days books. In discussing this varied career, Vincent Fitzpatrick touches upon all the roles that Mencken played: journalist; editor; redoubtable critic of literature, culture, and politics; philologist; and autobiographer. Drawing upon Mencken's extensive correspondence of more than 100,000 letters, the book stresses his unflagging belief in the need for free speech (up to the limits of common decency). Indeed, in the end Mencken proved a significant American civil libertarian.Iconoclast, critic, satirist, \\"individualist,\\" H. L. Mencken offered unique insights into American life. His lifelong celebration of the freedom to dissent marks his most enduring contribution to a nation that gave him such a wealth of material and so much delight.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_qRlBdd8J7cC&dq=Menckeniana:+A+schimpflexikon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blizzards (Forces of Nature)","description":"Elaborate on the concept of forces in nature using this science inquiry card and lesson.

The emphasis throughout is on understanding the behaviour of concrete and relating it to physical and chemical phenomena involved in the performance of the material in service.

This poignant, darkly comic debut novel establishes John P. McAfee as an extraordinary new voice in wartime fiction. The story begins in Special Forces A Camp, number 413, twenty miles from the Cambodian border. The camp's Green Berets, dividing their time between boredom and terror, are ostensibly led by a captain, the narrator of the story. But the officer actually takes his cue from an aggressive sergeant named Shotgun who is alternately crazy and wise, but always irresistibly, frighteningly dangerous. The altogether appropriate motto of A Camp is \\"Normal is a cycle on a washing machine.\\" Commanding officers issue orders that have no meaning; weapons are used in ways that are the grotesque opposite of their original design. And in an experience that has a real-life counterpart, the Green Berets stumble on a shocking alliance between the CIA and North Vietnam, something they realize they must destroy -- even at the cost of bringing both sides down on them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0eg-PgAACAAJ&dq=Slow+Walk+in+a+Sad+Rain:+The+Catch-22+of+Vietnam&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beatles (U.S.A.)

Using interdisciplinary methods of family history, anthropology, ethnography, and women's studies, Christine Worobec explores the world of peasant households and communities, elements of which live on in today's Soviet Union. In full detail she shows how peasant Russia retained its traditional institutions and customary practices in the face of the economic changes associated with industrialization and urbanization. The book draws on previously unexamined judicial, folklore, and household records to assess the durability of the extended Russian peasant family and the customs linking it to the community. The Russian peasants portrayed here actively shaped their society, developing a variety of economic and social strategies to cope with their harsh environment and the demands of the state. Discussing their efforts to safeguard their way of life through courtship and marriage rituals and through such social restrictions as property devolution practices, a misogynist patriarchalism, and severe penalties for deviant behavior, Worobec reveals that peasant traditionalism impeded the impact of modernization and cushioned its effects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LQwfHQAACAAJ&dq=Peasant+Russia:+Family+and+Community+in+the+Post-Emancipation+Period&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seneca (White Indian (Americana))","description":"This work is a comprehensive encyclopedia of Indian removal that accurately presents the removal process as a political, economic, and tribally complicit affair. * Contains insightful information from 16 contributors * Presents Georgia Laws in 1828 and 1830 * Provides a chronological timetable of Indian removal * Includes an annotated bibliography of Indian removal to facilitate further research","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Yx46lWJKphEC&dq=Seneca+(White+Indian+(Americana))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"San Diego: Views of Past and Present","description":"Georgeous photographic and narrative book chronicling the growth and changes over time of this picturesque Southern California city.

Like a ghostly specter he centers Van Gogh's canvas, locked forever in the endless task of harvesting the fruit of the land. He appears to be a farmer, maybe Amish, with his large, rough hands and a back permanently stooped from years of hard labor. This story releases the image from its canvas prison. It gives life to the man, however temporary, and allows him to end his labor. True to the sketch, the story maintains his nameless and faceless persona, allowing that void to be filled by the unique experiences of each reader. The story is inspired by the Van Gogh sketch, Peasant with Sickle, Seen from the Back.

Following the publication of Position of the Day, Nerve was bombarded with reader comments: Do any of the positions work better with equipmentsay, a six-pack and a helmet? And, hey, do I still need to go to the gym if I'm regularly having sex upside down with my head on a chair and my feet wrapped around my lover's neck? Nerve has tried to address these concerns and others in this latest edition. A team of nimble, limber, and extremely attractive volunteers selflessly ventured to the laboratory for months of researchthe results of those experiments are now available for only $12.95! Each sexual position comes with an estimated caloric expenditure (for each person involved), a list of possible side effects (leg cramp, lawsuit), and equipment recommendations (hanging bar, stethoscope, cowboy hat).

This legal precedent for bringing a former head of state to trial outside his home country signaled that neither the immunity of a former head of state nor legal amnesties at home could shield participants in the crimes of military governments. It also allowed victims of torture and crimes against humanity to hope that their tormentors might be brought to justice. In this meticulously researched volume, Naomi Roht-Arriaza examines the implications of the litigation against members of the Chilean and Argentine military governments and traces their effects through similar cases in Latin American and Europe. Roht-Arriaza discusses the difficulties in bringing violators of human rights to justice at home, and considers the role of transitional justice in transnational prosecutions and investigations in the national courts of countries other than those where the crimes took place. She traces the roots of the landmark Pinochet case and follows its development and those of related cases, through Spain, the United Kingdom, elsewhere in Europe, and then through Chile, Argentina, Mexico, and the United States. She situates these transnational cases within the context of an emergent International Criminal Court, as well as the effectiveness of international law and of the lawyers, judges, and activists working together across continents to make a new legal paradigm a reality. Interviews and observations help to contextualize and dramatize these compelling cases. These cases have tremendous ramifications for the prospect of universal jurisdiction and will continue to resonate for years to come. Roht-Arriaza's deft navigation of these complicated legal proceedings elucidates the paradigm shift underlying this prosecution as well as the traction gained by advocacy networks promoting universal jurisdiction in recent decades.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7xQKjLLxU1gC&dq=The+Pinochet+Effect+Transnational+Justice+In+The+Age+Of+Human+Rights&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Picture Palaces: The Architecture of Fantasy","description":"Looks at the era of movie house splendor and their architects, from the grand old film emporiums like Radio City Music Hall to hundreds of American Main Street theaters","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2jBUAAAAMAAJ&dq=American+Picture+Palaces:+The+Architecture+of+Fantasy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Where Does It Go?","description":"The book offers variety as it \\"lifts the lid\\" on mediumship - a peek behind the scenes.

Is there an afterlife or is death the end? The read is compelling, chapter after chapter of people's experiences such as astral journeys to other parts of the country and even to the Spirit world itself. Mediumship in children, and accounts of visual phenomena are fascinating, whilst the chapters describing poltergeist activity, premonitions about disasters and amorous spirits may leave you with a tingle down your spine!

People who have \\"lost\\" someone this way know how they feel about it, through her spiritual encounters during the course of her work, she is able to put across the feelings of the Spirits who committed suicide and find out what they have to say.

For Eric Metaxas, the answer is Fish Out of Water: A Search for the Meaning of Life a poetic and sometimes hilarious memoir of his early years, in which the Queens-born son of Greek and German immigrants struggles to make sense of a world in which he never quite seems to fit. Renowned for his biographies of William Wilberforce, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and Martin Luther, Metaxas is the author of five New York Times bestsellers, the witty host of the acclaimed Socrates in the City conversation series, and a nationally syndicated radio personality. But here he reveals a personal story few have heard, taking us from his mostly happy childhood and riotous triumphs at Yale to the nightmare of drifting toward a dark abyss of meaninglessness from which he barely escapes. Along the way he introduces us to an unforgettable troupe of picaresque characters who join this quintessentially first-generation American boy in what is both bildungsroman and odyssey and which underscores just how funny, serious, happy, sad, and ultimately meaningful life can be.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1mIXEAAAQBAJ&dq=A+Fish+in+the+Water:+A+Memoir&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mujer En Guerra (Spanish Edition)","description":"Dit is geen feelgoodboek. (Maar ik weet zeker dat je je goed voelt nadat je dit boek hebt gelezen.) Dit is geen motivatieboek. (Maar ik beloof je dat je als je het boek uit hebt gemotiveerd zult zijn om te bereiken wat je wilt.) Het uiteindelijke doel van het boek is vrouwen strategie?n aan te reiken die ze nodig hebben om alles te bereiken wat ze willen. Chin-Ning Chu De klassieker De kunst van het oorlogvoeren van de tao?stische filosoof-generaal Sun Tzu is veelgelezen, maar weinig begrepen. Het wordt al honderden jaren bestudeerd door militair leiders, politici en zakenmensen. Eigenlijk gaat het boek helemaal niet over oorlogvoeren, maar leert je hoe je je doelen kunt bereiken op de effici?ntste manier. De adviezen van Sun Tzu zijn er altijd op gericht om met zo min mogelijk conflict het beste resultaat te behalen. Het is geen boek waar een set regels wordt gegeven die je in een bepaalde situatie moet toepassen. De strategie?n van Sun Tzu vereisen een diep begrip van de mensen en de omgeving waar je mee te maken krijgt. Maar nog belangrijker is dat je jezelf kent je sterktes en zwaktes, doelen en angsten. De kunst van het oorlogvoeren voor vrouwen is het eerste boek waarin het meesterwerk van Sun Tzu specifiek voor vrouwen wordt uitgelegd en ge?nterpreteerd. In korte hoofdstukken met onderwerpen als Eerst winnen, dan vechten en Verander je zwakheden in je sterke punten en aan de hand van voorbeelden uit het dagelijks leven laat Chin-Ning Chu zien hoe iedere vrouw kan bereiken wat ze wil. Chin-Ning Chu is een nakomeling van de bedelaar die de eerste keizer van de Ming-dynastie werd. Op haar tiende begon haar vader haar les te geven over de klassieke Chinese teksten. Als student werkte ze als televisieactrice en later als marketeer voor Taiwanese en Europese farmaceutische bedrijven. Momenteel is ze een veelgevraagd spreker over de toepassing van de inzichten uit De kunst van het oorlogvoeren van Sun Tzu. Ze werkt als consultant voor overheden en internationale bedrijven en ze is directeur van het Strategic Learning Institute en Asian Marketing Consultants. Regelmatig wordt ze door de media gevraagd als expert over de politieke situatie in Azi?.

The myriad facets of the composer's personality sparkle and flash as the author reminisces about his brilliant and magnetic friend. Puccini: simple and earthy, a man who liked driving fast, bird shooting and flirting with pretty girls; a man who drew strength from his beloved Tuscan soil, and fell head-over-heels in love with the heroines created by his imagination. The author recalls Puccini's wild adolescence, his love affairs, his stormy life with Donna Elvira, and the tragedy of the innocent Doria. Here is Puccini celebrating the success of La Bohemne by buying an expensive bicycle, Tosca by the largest and noisiest automobile he could find, and his American triumph with an imported speedboat. You see Puccini in love with a story, flinging himself passionately into creative activity; other times having to be prodded by his patient publisher. You see him enjoying the hunt, basking in the convivial companionship of bohemian friends, and incessantly quarreling with poets and librettists. You learn of his violent quarrels with the musician he respected most, Toscinini, to whom he entrusted his final and incomplete opera, Turnadot.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vYstAAAAMAAJ&dq=Immortal+Bohemian%3B+an+intimate+memoir+of+Giacomo+Puccini&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Traveller's Wine Guide to Italy (The Traveller's Wine Guides)","description":"Italy has probably the richest variety of wines of any country in the world.

For the first time, carrier-based air strikes and long-range bombing attempted to destroy an enemy air force at the beginning of a war. The attacks did not succeed until land bases had been secured, but the military goals of the Japanese Navy in 1937 were similar to our own in the Persian Gulf War of 1991. Also, for the first time, a fighter designed for carrier operations won air superiority in combat, and success in 1937 led directly to the Zero fighter whose performance gave the Japanese Navy the belief it could control Pacific skies in 1941. The value of close-support of ground troops, the effects of sustained bombing of cities, and the different results of bombing by day or by night were demonstrated. American aircraft designers learned from the war in China the value of drop tanks, pilot armor, and heavy-caliber guns, as well as the best tactics for fighter pilots confronted by enemy planes with Zero's capabilities. We invite the reader to learn how the Sino-Japanese war of 1937-1941 pointed to the future of air warfare. Documents in the San Diego Aerospace Museum archives, some of them not published previously, enable us to describe this air war more accurately than has been possible before.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=glcTRAAACAAJ&dq=Prelude+to+Pearl+Harbor:+The+air+war+in+China+1937-1941&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Strangest Secret (Earl Nightingale's Library of Little Gems)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qmJ0OwAACAAJ&dq=The+Strangest+Secret+(Earl+Nightingale%27s+Library+of+Little+Gems)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cambridge Seven","description":"Harold Schofield, brilliant Oxford doctor and a missionary in China for many years, prayed that the Lord would give him missionaries from British universities to help in China.

The Palliser novels are six novels, also known as the \\"Parliamentary Novels\\", by Anthony Trollope. The common thread is the wealthy aristocrat and politician Plantagenet Palliser and (in all but the last book) his wife Lady Glencora. The plots involve British and Irish politics in varying degrees, specifically in and around Parliament. Plantagenet Palliser is a main character in the Palliser novels. First introduced as a minor character in The Small House at Allington, one of the Barsetshire novels, Palliser is the heir presumptive to the dukedom of Omnium. Palliser is a quiet, hardworking, conscientious man whose chief ambition in life is to become Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Ask Me Why I Hurt is the touching and revealing first-person account of the remarkable work of Dr. Randy Christensen. Trained as a pediatrician, he works not in a typical hospital setting but, rather, in a 38-foot Winnebago that has been refitted as a doctor s office on wheels. His patients are the city s homeless adolescents and children. In the shadow of an affluent American city, Dr. Christensen has dedicated his life to caring for society's throwaway kids the often-abused, unloved children who live on the streets without access to proper health care, all the while fending off constant threats from thugs, gangs, pimps, and other predators. With the Winnebago as his moveable medical center, Christensen and his team travel around the outskirts of Phoenix, attending to the children and teens who need him most. With tenderness and humor, Dr. Christensen chronicles everything from the struggles of the van s early beginnings, to the support system it became for the kids, and the ultimate recognition it has achieved over the years. Along with his immense professional challenges, he also describes the trials and joys he faces while raising a growing family with his wife Amy. By turns poignant, heartbreaking, and charming, Dr. Christensen's story is a gripping and rich memoir of his work and family, one of those rare books that stays with you long after you ve turned the last page.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=j9KkHgfBwxAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Yage Letters","description":"In January 1953, William Burroughs began a seven-month expedition into the jungles of South America, ostensibly to find yage, the fabled hallucinogen of the Amazon.

She then examines the historical, literary, and religious-spiritual dimensions of the New Testament, highlighting the implications for interpretation theory and methodology, and concludes by putting her theory to the test in a feminist interpretation of John 4. The author argues that the comprehensive object of biblical interpretation is not merely information but transformation. She suggests that an adequate hermeneutical theory must include a wide range of exegetical and critical methods within a theologically and philosophically adequate understanding of Scripture as sacred text. She writes specifically to educated believers who wonder how sound biblical criticism can be incorporated into a faith- filled reading of the New Testament; biblical scholars who struggle with the question of whether or how faith can function legitimately in biblical scholarship; and those whose task it is to teach and preach the faith that looks to the New Testament as source and norm.

Should historians reach out more beyond academia to the general public? Why do Hollywood films, historical novels and television histories prove more successful in presenting the past to a wider audience? What can historians do to improve their effectiveness in reaching and engaging their target audience in a digital age? The way history is presented to an audience is often taken for granted, even ignored. Presenting History explores the vital role played by presenters in both establishing why history matters in today's world and communicating the past to audiences within and outside academia. Through case studies of leading historians, historical novelists, Hollywood filmmakers and television history presenters, this book looks critically at alternative literary and visual ways of presenting the past as both academic history and popular history. Historians discussed include Stephen Ambrose, Niall Ferguson, Eric Hobsbawm, Robert A. Rosenstone, Simon Schama, Joan Wallach Scott and A.J.P. Taylor. Chapter topics include Hollywood and history; Michael Bellesiles' controversial history of gun rights in the USA; Philippa Gregory's historical novels; historians and the David Irving trial; and Terry Deary's 'Horrible Histories'. Raising serious questions about the nature, study and communication of history, Presenting History is an essential text for historians and history students, as well as anyone involved in listening to, reading, or watching presenters of the past.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7ptGEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE SINGING KNIVES; LADIES FROM HELL; FIELD TALK; SHADE; ARKANSAS BENCH STONE; CONSTANT STRANGER; THE BATTLEFIELD WHERE THE MOON SAYS I LOVE YOU [Complete Set of Mill Mountain Press Books]","description":"Dit boek is onderdeel van de TREDITION CLASSICS serie.

Eastern Europe, August 1942. The Khazar kaganate, an isolated nation of Turkic warrior Jews, lies between the Pontus Euxinus (the Black Sea) and the Khazar Sea (the Caspian). It also happens to lie between a belligerent nation to the west that the Khazars call Germania and a city the rest of the world calls Stalingrad. After years of Jewish refugees streaming across the border from Europa, fleeing the war, Germania launches its siege of Khazaria. Only Esther, the daughter of the nation s chief policy adviser, sees the ominous implications of Germania's disregard for Jewish lives. Only she realizes that this isn t just another war but an existential threat. After witnessing the enemy warplanes  first foray into sovereign Khazar territory, Esther knows she must fight for her country. But as the elder daughter in a traditional home, her urgent question is how. Before daybreak one fateful morning, she embarks on a perilous journey across the open steppe. She seeks a fabled village of Kabbalists who may hold the key to her destiny: their rumored ability to change her into a man so that she may convince her entire nation to join in the fight for its very existence against an enemy like none Khazaria has ever faced before. The Book of Esther is a profound saga of war, technology, mysticism, power, and faith. This novel simultaneously a steampunk Joan of Arc and a genre-bending tale of a counterfactual Jewish state by a writer who invents worlds  out of Calvino or Borges  (The New Yorker) is a stunning achievement. Reminiscent of Michael Chabon s The Yiddish Policemen s Union and Philip Roth s The Plot Against America, The Book of Esther reaffirms Barton s place as one of her generation s most gifted storytellers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=15eTCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A gentleman of leisure,","description":"Unlike some other reproductions of classic texts (1) We have not used OCR(Optical Character Recognition), as this leads to bad quality books with introduced typos.

Often information about specific traumas, the year in which they occurred, & the physical location in the body can be found without verbally questioning the subject. Furthermore, when the results of these traumatic experiences are dissipated & the dysfunctional assumptions (erroneous beliefs) are corrected, numerous problematic conditions have been alleviated in the areas of physical & emotional well being, financial & relationship harmony.

With contributions from leading experts in the field, it investigates the potential for, and emergence of, new policy arrangements along with their patterns of conflict and cooperation. Building upon theoretical inspirations from various traditions studying international affairs, this volume develops and applies the concepts of policy arrangements and countervailing power to the field of global business - civil society relations. A range of key issues including labour, consumers, global finance, the mining industry, climate policy and the World Economic and Social Forums are examined.

In this treatise, Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn argues that it reduced to one simple and very dangerous idea: equality of political power as embodied in democracy. He marshals the strongest possible case that democratic equality is the very basis not of liberty, as is commonly believed, but the total state. He uses national socialism as his prime example. He further argues the old notion of government by law is upheld in old monarchies, restrained by a noble elite. Aristocracy, not democracy, gave us liberty. On his side in this argument, he includes the whole of the old liberal tradition, and offers overwhelming evidence for his case. In our times, war and totalitarianism do indeed sail under the democratic flag. This book, capable of overturning most of what you thought you knew about political systems, was first published in 1952.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=icap6yCQx1gC&dq=Liberty+or+Equality&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Surviving Fights With Your Brothers and Sisters","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=g1BHzwEACAAJ&dq=Surviving+Fights+With+Your+Brothers+and+Sisters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Unofficial Manual to Living with Men","description":"Editor, Carina Castelli, addresses cohabitating couples' most common problems in the comically illustrated, \\"Unofficial Manual to Living with Men.\\" Seven different women contribute over seventy secrets to living together happily ever after.

In a much-simplified way, he endeavors to explain the relationship that exists between the signs he had been receiving and his illnesses. Even though he has had a successful life, he feels that somehow he is not completely happy with the results. Throughout his journey, he discovers that there are no coincidences in life and that everything happens for a reason. He also finds out that God is always trying to communicate with him, and us, by way of many different signs and messages; however due to our busy schedules, we don't often listen to them, or tend to discard them as unimportant. For many months, the author suffers an internal transformation that unexpectedly makes him happy and which also allows him to experience a gradual change in his spirituality. The inner changes and spiritual evolution that he sees from within motivates and gives him a new purpose for living. He also realizes the immense need to give thanks to God every day for all the blessings he has received. As this exciting drama unfolds, and consequences develop after being able to decipher the meaning of the signs and finding out that God had truly been with him throughout his life, he considers it a duty and a promise to God to explain his testimony in writing, not only for his family and friends but for anyone who desires a spiritual transformation. The story contemplates the universal human questions of how, when, why, what, and where this experience could take place. This narrative is a true story written without exaggeration or drama. The story is a testimony of what actually happened to the author and is therefore identified with our human spirituality, obviously by making a great emphasis on the importance and of the need to find God. His story, The Signs for a New Life, perhaps to some, might be controversial due to the reader's own speculations, ideas, perceptions, and, certainly, religious beliefs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=In4uEAAAQBAJ&dq=New+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Each Day a New Beginning: Daily Meditations for Women","description":"With millions of copies sold, these inspirational daily meditations speak to the common experiences, shared struggles, and unique strengths of women in recovery from all addictions.

Al duizend jaar leven de skaa in angst en ellende. Want al duizend jaar worden zij onderdrukt door de Opperheer, de onaantastbare Splinter der Oneindigheid, die met ijzeren vuist en absolute macht regeert. Maar als alle hoop verdwenen is, als de mens niet eens meer weet wat hoop is, ontdekt de skaa-halfbloed Kelsier in de helse gevangenis van de Opperheer dat hij beschikt over de mysterieuze gave van de Nevelaars: het vermogen om krachten aan metalen te onttrekken, dat hij kan inzetten om de Opperheer ten val te brengen. Op dat moment is de kiem gelegd voor een titanenconflict, een machtsstrijd van immense omvang die vele levens zal eisen. Maar Kelsier is vastbesloten, en hij staat niet alleen in zijn streven de Opperheer van de troon te stoten. Onder de Ertsmagi?rs van de Nevelaars vindt hij gedreven bondgenoten.

Vin, door schade en schande wijs geworden, vertrouwt niemand meer. Ook Kelsier niet... Brandon Sanderson (1975) groeide op in Lincoln, Nebraska. Hij studeerde en doceerde creatief schrijven aan Brigham Young University en woont momenteel met zijn vrouw en kind in Provo, Utah. Zijn boeken, warm onthaald door pers en publiek, bereikten de bestsellerstatus toen Sanderson werd uitgekozen om Het Rad des Tijds, het meesterwerk van de in 2007 overleden Robert Jordan, te voltooien. Sinds die tijd is zijn naam wereldwijd een begrip. Brandon Sanderson werd tweemaal genomineerd voor de John W. Campbell Memorial Award en won in 2011 de David Gemmell Legend Award met The Way of Kings. Het Laatste Rijk is het eerste deel van Sandersons trilogie over de geheimzinnige Nevelaars, waarmee hij stormenderhand het Angelsaksisch taalgebied veroverde en zijn naam vestigde. Meer dan eens worden zijn boeken vergeleken met die van George R.R. Martin en Raymond E. Feist.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3j0vAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Treasure Mountain #09","description":"In Treasure Mountain, Louis L Amour delivers a robust story of two brothers searching to learn the fate of their missing father and finding themselves in a struggle just to stay alive.

These individuals were often part of a revival in Catholicism and expressed admiration for the Middle Ages and Christian mysticism. They were utopian, yet reactionary, seeking to restore a lost past from which the modern age was believed to have fallen. They may be described as counter-revolutionaries, opposing the French Revolution, defined by the Catholic traditionalist and reactionary Joseph de Maistre as \\"not a contrary revolution, but the contrary of revolution\\". Gottfried begins his book by discussing the Catholic revival, the rise of millenarianism and romanticism. Prime among the figures involved in the Catholic romantic revival include Novalis (pen name of Friedrich von Hardenberg, poet, scientist, and philosopher), Adam Muller (Protestantconvert to Catholicism and romantic economic theorist advocating a corporativist state, based on medieval society), Friedrich Schlegel (expositor of romanticism, originally a radical individualist and admirer of the ancient Greeks, Indians, and other pagans who became a convert to Catholicism), Joseph von Gorres (early proponent of the revolution who grew disenchanted and became a defender of Catholicism), and Franz von Baader (romantic and social philosopher, a Catholic who was influenced bymysticism particularly the thought of the Lutheran apostate Jakob Boehme). While these Catholic revolutionaries shared political ideals with such thinkers as Burke (the father of conservativism and opponent of revolution), Joseph de Maistre (reactionary traditionalist Catholic), and de Toqueville (Catholic writer on the \\"ancien regime\\" and opponent of democracy), they also were influenced heavily by mysticism and German idealism, including such mystics as Jakob Boehme, Jung-Stilling, Saint-Martin, and the Pietists. Gottfried next turns his attention to the age of Montgelas, in which various laws were enacted which resulted in oppression for the church and clergy. Here, Gottfried notes the influence of various rationalists, including the Bavarian Illuminati of Adam Weishaupt and the Rosicrucians, who plotted against throne and altar. Weishaupt, a professor of canon law, created the Illuminati modeling his society after the Jesuits in 1776, actively conspiring to murder the king and adhering to rationalist beliefs. Weishaupt along with Adolf von Knigge (a fellow Illuminatus) actively opposed other mystical doctrines such as those of the Swedenborgians and the Rosicrucians. The Rosicrucians were another initiatory society, whose presence was revealed in the various manifestos which appeared at the time. Believed to have been founded by Christian Rosenkreuz, the Rosicrucians were an invisible society of elite scientists and philosophers who would create a utopia. The chief Rosicrucian manifesto to appear is believed to have been authored by the Lutheran minister Johann Valentin Andreae, who actively opposed the papacy and Catholic reaction. Other individuals actively influenced by Rosicrucian mysticism, along with the writings of Paracelsus, include Karl von Eckarthausen and Gotthilf Heinrich von Schubert whose book _The Symbolism of Dreams_ was to play an important role in the romantic movement. Indeed, many romantics were especially influenced by Rosicrucianism as well as Martinism (the mysticism of Saint-Martin) and the Jewish Cabbala, though they often denied this influence. The thought of Schelling, who although a Protestant was much admired by Catholics, also played a prominent part in the development of the romantic movement. Throughout this discussion, Gottfried demonstrates the various conflicts which arose particularly between Catholics and Protestants as well as conflicts involving the Jews. Another important component of the romantic movement was that of \\"the Awakening\\", a movement started by many Catholic parish priests who sought to imitate Protestant pietism within Catholicism but were also repulsed by Enlightenment rationalism. Individuals involved in this movement included Johann Michael Sailer and Johann Ringseis, Catholic priests who sought an Awakening. In the era of Ludwig I, Catholicism witnessed a revival and romantics led the way in propagating the faith. In such journals as the Athenaeum, romantics actively sought the origins of human existence, often dabbling in non-Western religions, including the Vedas, as well as ancient Greek myth (arguing that the ancient Greeks were precursors of Christianity). Romantics also exposited an eschatology in which a coming conflict with modernism would bring about the reign of Antichrist. Romantics actively made war with both liberalism and modernism, advocating a corporativist medieval state as an alternative to class conflict. For thinkers such as Muller and von Baader, the role of the worker played an important part in their economic theories. Indeed, Gottfried notes the influence that romanticism may have played on the thought of early socialists including Karl Marx.

Along with Salome, his darkly decadent dramatization of the Bible story, these immortal plays continue to pack theatres, and have been adapted for every kind of media. This Macmillan Collector's Library edition of The Importance of Being Earnest & Other Plays echoes the book form in which Wilde originally insisted his plays were published, and includes illustrations by Aubrey Beardsley and an afterword by Ned Halley. Part of the Macmillan Collector s Library; a series of stunning, clothbound, pocket-sized classics with gold foiled edges and ribbon markers.

Though seen by many as two sides of the same coin, they have developed widely different connotations. Nationalism is increasingly seen as destructive, and at the root of the world's bloodiest conflicts; patriotism seems something more benign, a political virtue. How are we to mark the distinction between these two phenomena? How can we rescue patriotism from the tainted grasp of nationalism? Reconstructing the historical the meaning of the terms, Maurizio Viroli shows how the two concepts have been used within specific cultural and ideological contexts. He reviews the political though of Italy, England, and Germany and shows how patriotism and nationalism have fundamentally different roots. Professor Viroli concludes that it is morally unacceptable, and indeed unnecessary, to be a nationalist to defend the values that nationalists hold dear. Patriotism, however, is a valuable source of civic responsibility.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Y8crPCvAaNkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flower fairies of the summer","description":"Experience the beauty and the magic of Cicely Mary Barker's famous Flower Fairies, with a new edition of Cicely Mary Barker's Flower Fairies of the Summer.

For many companies IFRS, and most particularly the concept of fair value in IAS 39, has amounted to a phase shift  which is prerequisite to achieving compliant financial reporting. The research conducted by Dr. Chorafas for this book, documented that the process of meeting IFRS requirements presents opportunities and challenges to all enterprises. As many companies have found out, abandoning the classical accruals accounting for marking-to-market their transactions and portfolio positions, has not been easy. The conversion process has affected several functions within the organization including balance sheets, P&L statements, auditing, risk control, information systems, and management accounting.

These range from the implementation of IFRS directives such as hedge accounting, to developing practices of real-time balance sheets; the help provided by sophisticated accounting solutions help in stress testing; and a comprehensive definition of the role of the audit committee. * A clear and practical view of the complexities of IFRS implementation * Includes practical case studies from real-life companies going through the process * Pays particular attention to IAS 39 on Fair Value","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aFjLfm0UincC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Montana's Bob Marshall Wilderness","description":"More than 100 hikes are described in this updated and expanded comprehansive guide.

On July 14, 2015, something amazing happened. More than 3 billion miles from Earth, a small NASA spacecraft called New Horizons screamed past Pluto at more than 32,000 miles per hour, focusing its instruments on the long mysterious icy worlds of the Pluto system, and then, just as quickly, continued on its journey out into the beyond. Nothing like this has occurred in a generation a raw exploration of new worlds unparalleled since NASA s Voyager missions to Uranus and Neptune and nothing quite like it is planned to happen ever again. The photos that New Horizons sent back to Earth graced the front pages of newspapers on all 7 continents, and NASA s website for the mission received more than 2 billion hits in the days surrounding the flyby. At a time when so many think that our most historic achievements are in the past, the most distant planetary exploration ever attempted not only succeeded in 2015 but made history and captured the world s imagination. How did this happen? Chasing New Horizons is the story of the men and women behind this amazing mission: of their decades-long commitment and persistence; of the political fights within and outside of NASA; of the sheer human ingenuity it took to design, build, and fly the mission; and of the plans for New Horizons  next encounter, 1 billion miles past Pluto in 2019. Told from the insider s perspective of mission leader Dr. Alan Stern and others on New Horizons, and including two stunning 16-page full-color inserts of images, Chasing New Horizons is a riveting account of scientific discovery, and of how much we humans can achieve when people focused on a dream work together toward their incredible goal.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZDA6DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rockets of the Air Force","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=y3NNAQAAMAAJ&dq=Rockets+of+the+Air+Force&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tokyo for Free","description":"Tokyo For Free is a Kodansha International publication.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=I4Rh7r9hvxcC&dq=Tokyo+for+Free&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Soldier, Nurse, and Spy: A Woman's Adventures in the Union Army","description":"Among the hundreds of women who, in disguise, enlisted to serve as men during the Civil War, only Sarah Edmonds is known to have written a memoir recounting her experiences. As \\"Franklin Thompson,\\" she joined the 2nd Michigan Infantry Regiment in 1861, then fought in some of the bloodiest struggles of the Civil War, from the first battle of Bull Run to the Kentucky Campaign of 1863. This daring woman embarked upon dangerous missions into Confederate territory to gather information and to survey enemy positions, sometimes in the guise of a slave or Irish washerwoman, sometimes in Confederate uniform. Through her experiences as a \\"male nurse\\" and Union soldier, Edmonds depicts the horrors of Civil War hospitals and the simple pastimes of camp life. Throughout her impassioned account, first published in 1865, this enthralling storyteller reveals her courage, dedication to the Union, and resourcefulness in concealing her identity. Three years after her death, Edmonds's body was reinterred with military honors by her comrades, who recognized in her a \\"strong, healthy, and robust soldier, ever willing and ready for duty.\\" The introduction and annotations by Elizabeth D. Leonard, a leading authority on Civil War women, support and amplify Edmonds's account. Challenging established views of the Civil War soldier, Memoirs of a Soldier, Nurse, and Spy is compelling reading, especially for those interested in the Civil War, women's history, American studies, and military history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mj8zAQAAMAAJ&dq=Memoirs+of+a+Soldier,+Nurse,+and+Spy:+A+Woman%27s+Adventures+in+the+Union+Army&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The expression of the emotions in man and animals (The thinker's library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9ZSytwEACAAJ&dq=The+expression+of+the+emotions+in+man+and+animals+(The+thinker%27s+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Detective Comics #38 : Toys R Us Replica Edition (DC Comics)","description":"Batman races to uncover the Joker's latest laugh, a kidnapped Commissioner Gordon, and the mystery of the Gotham Ripper.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=N4mAMAEACAAJ&dq=Detective+Comics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secret of Right Activity","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cHUvAQAAMAAJ&dq=Secret+of+Right+Activity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MAIN CURRENTS IN SOCIOLOGICAL THOUGHT","description":"This is the first of Raymond Aron's magisterial two-volume treatment of the sociological tradition perhaps the definitive work of its kind. The second volume treating Durkheim, Pareto, and Weber is scheduled to appear in spring 1998. More than a work of reconstruction, Aron's study is, at its deepest level, an engagement with the question of modernity: What constitutes the essence of the new modern order that, having emerged in the eighteenth century, still forms the categories of our experience, sweeping us along toward an unknown destination? With his usual scrupulous fairness, Aron looks to the major social thinkers to discern how they answered this pressing question. Volume 1 explores three traditions: the French liberal school of political sociology, represented by Montesquieu and Tocqueville; the Comtean tradition, anticipating Durkheim in its deemphasis of the political and its elevation of social unity and consensus; and the Marxists, who posited the struggle between classes and placed their faith in historical necessity. A foreword by the eminent French philosopher Pierre Manent highlights Main Currents as a unique contribution to political philosophy as well as the history of sociological thought, while Daniel J. Mahoney and Brian C. Anderson provide an introduction situating Main Currents within the corpus of Aron's work as a whole.

The city of El Amarna was built by the Pharaoh Akhenaten, during his religious reforms in the 1340s BC, but was then abandoned after he died and Egypt reverted to worshiping the old gods. These letters provide a unique glimpse into a period of Egyptian history, that the Egyptians themselves attempted to erase. After Akhenaten's heir Tutankhamen died, his successor Ay was only able to hold the throne for a few years before Horemheb seized it, and attempted to reunited the Egyptians by erasing all records of Akhenaten's reforms, which included erasing Akhenaten's name from almost every record in Egypt. By this period, El Amarna appears to have already been mostly abandoned, and therefore Egyptologists were able to reconstruct the strange story of Akhenaten's reign, in the middle of the New Kingdom era. The Amarna letters were recovered from the royal archives in El Amarna, where they appear to have been archived after having been translated for the royal court. The letters are inscribed on clay tablets in Cuneiform, the dominant form of writing in Mesopotamia, Canaan, and the neighboring cultures in Anatolia and Cyprus at the time. The shape of the Cuneiform logograms used are Akkadian, the parent form of the later Neo-Babylonian, Neo-Assyrian, and Ugaritic forms of Cuneiform, however, the language used in the Letters is not pure Akkadian. The Letters are between various members of the Egyptian royal court, and many different cities and nations across the Middle East, including Babylon, Assyria, Mitanni, and Cyprus, and therefore the language within the Letters is not consistent. Within the letters from Canaanite cities, all of which were subject to Egypt at the time, several transliterated names are also used, which appears to be a direct precursor to the later development of Ugaritic Cuneiform by 1200 BC, which was an abjad similar to the Canaanite script that was developed by 1000 BC, however, used Cuneiform logograms instead of alphabet-like letters. The surviving letters were mostly about trade and diplomacy, however, do include a great deal of information about what was happening in the Middle East at the time. In particular, they demonstrate how limited Egypt's actual control of its Canaanite holdings were, where the governors of cities were constantly requesting military help to defend themselves against each other, the marauding Habirus, and the Hittite-backed Amorites in northern Canaan. The Amarna Letters were written during the mid-1330s BC, during the reigns of the Pharaohs Amenhotep III and Akhenaten, although it is not always clear when in their respective reigns the letters were written, or even which pharaoh was on the throne at the time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XSUSEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The unnatural act of management","description":"Chronicles the ninety days experienced by Enfield Manufacturing, under the guidance of the author, in learning how to manage effectively through building trust, making better decisions, managing stress, and more","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=s6NxQgAACAAJ&dq=The+unnatural+act+of+management&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Woman Triathlete","description":"You Are a Badass for aspiring triathletes: a practical and inspiring guide to getting off the couch and on the trail to race your first -- or 50th -- triathlon When Meredith Atwood first shared her journey from tired, overworked wife and mom to successful triathlete, her story resonated with women everywhere, online at her SwimBikeMom blog and in the first edition of Triathlon for the Every Woman.

Is aging inevitable? Will advances in medical knowledge allow us to extend the human lifespan beyond its present limits? Because growing old has long been the one irreducible reality of human existence, these intriguing questions arise more often in the context of science fiction than science fact. But recent discoveries in the fields of cell biology and molecular genetics are seriously challenging the assumption that human lifespans are beyond our control.; With such discoveries in mind, noted cell biologist William R. Clark clearly and skillfully describes how senescence begins at the level of individual cells and how cellular replication may be bound up with aging of the entire organism. He explores the evolutionary origin and function of aging, the cellular connections between aging and cancer, the parallels between cellular senescence and Alzheimer's disease, and the insights gained through studying human genetic disorders-such as; Werner's syndrome-that mimic the symptoms of aging. Clark also explains how reduction in caloric intake may actually help increase lifespan, and how the destructive effects of oxidative elements in the body may be limited by the consumption of antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables. In a final; chapter, Clark considers the social and economic aspects of living longer, the implications of gene therapy on senescence, and what we might learn about aging from experiments in cloning.; This is a highly readable, provocative account of some of the most far-reaching and controversial questions we are likely to ask in the next century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JImoswEACAAJ&dq=Means+to+an+End:+The+Biological+Basis+of+Aging+And+Death&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"GROUND ZERO","description":"In time for the twentieth anniversary of 9/11, master storyteller Alan Gratz (Refugee) delivers a pulse-pounding and unforgettable take on history and hope, revenge and fear -- and the stunning links between the past and present.

This book offers a detailed and explicit exploration of the ways in which shared sexual use of women and women s bodies engenders, sustains, and nourishes such relationships in the Hebrew Bible. Hebrew Bible narratives demonstrate that women and women s bodies are not merely used to foster and cultivate male homosociality, male friendship, and toxic hegemonic masculinity, but rather to engender them and make them possible in the first place. Thiede argues that homosocial bonds between divine and mortal males are part of a continual competition for power, rank, and honor, and that this competition depends on women s bodies for its expression. In a final chapter, she also explores whether female characters in the Hebrew Bible use male bodies to form friendships and alliances to advance female power, status, and rank. The book concludes by arguing that women are essential to the toxic biblical hegemonic masculinity we find in the Hebrew Bible, but only because their bodies are used to make it possible in the first place. This book is intended for scholars of the Hebrew Bible, as well as advanced undergraduate and graduate students in religious studies, women and gender studies, masculinity studies, queer studies, and like fields. The book can also be read profitably by lay students of biblical literature, seminary students, and clergy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iJktEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Funny Insults and Snappy Put-Downs","description":"A collection of insulting remarks (none malicious) to use as put-downs for any occasion, e.g. : Why don't you put an egg in your shoe and beat it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ygyvzgEACAAJ&dq=Funny+Insults+and+Snappy+Put-Downs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clip-Clop","description":"After Mr. Horse asks his friends if they want to go for a ride, Cat, Dog, Pig, and Duck try to hang on as they urge Mr. Horse to go faster and faster.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YUzhAAAAMAAJ&dq=Clip-Clop&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Aaron Burr conspiracy,","description":"Looks at the Burr Conspiracy, which involved a plan to set up an independent republic in either Mexico or the Western frontier.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PyWM2rWyc_UC&dq=The+Aaron+Burr+conspiracy,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Experiment","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jGYjAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Experiment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Lone Star Cowboy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ea_wsgEACAAJ&dq=A+Lone+Star+Cowboy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Leonid Stein - Master of Attack","description":"Leonid Stein's brilliant chess career, cut tragically short in 1973, included overwhelming victories against the world's leading grandmasters, Stein not only stormed to an incredible total of 3 first prizes (out of 4 attempts) in the USSR Championships, but also won what were arguably the two strongest tournaments of all time, (Moscow 1967 and Moscow 1971)","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4CG8PQAACAAJ&dq=Leonid+Stein+-+Master+of+Attack&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The treatises of Benvenuto Cellini on goldsmithing and sculpture","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BsGQQAAACAAJ&dq=The+treatises+of+Benvenuto+Cellini+on+goldsmithing+and+sculpture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"General Practice: A Sector General Omnibus","description":"At Sector General, anything can happen-and frequently does.

It s just another murder, one of the hundreds of simple homicides in 1939: A spinster nurse is killed in her apartment; a suspect is caught with the murder weapon and convicted. PI Fintan Dunne, though, feels compelled to unravel the complex setup that has put an innocent man on Death Row. He will soon find this is a murder with tentacles that stretch far beyond the crime scene . . . to Nazi Germany, in fact. In Berlin, meanwhile, plans for a military coup are forming among a cadre of Wehrmacht officers. Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, head of Military Intelligence, is gripped by a deadly paralysis: He is neither with the plotters nor against them. Joining them in treason would violate every value he holds as an officer. Betraying the plotters to the Gestapo Chief Reinhard Heydrich might just forsake the country s last hope to avert utter destruction and centuries of shame. Heydrich is suspicious. With no limits to Hitler s manic pursuit of territorial expansion, with crimes against the people candy-coated as racial purification, every German conscience must make a choice. And Fintan Dunne will be led into a murder conspiracy of a scope that defies imagination.  A good choice for those who enjoy a rich, stylish period piece that, like Philip Roth s The Plot against America, explores the fickle fate of men and nations and the destructive power of a really bad idea.

The principles in this book are not theoretical. They have worked successfully in Jack Hartman's life and in the lives of many people who have followed these principles. Jack carefully points out the differences between the world's system of prosperity and God's laws of prosperity. He explains that all of the warnings in the Bible against financial prosperity are warnings against following the world's system of prosperity. God's Word clearly indicates that He does want us to prosper as long as this prosperity is achieved by following His laws of prosperity. These laws are laid out in detail in sixteen chapters of specific instruction -- every chapter filled with many verses of Scripture. The book closes with a unique \\"test\\" in which readers can test themselves on their knowledge of God's laws of prosperity. Jack Hartman believes that our economy is going to experience a definite down-turn and he urges all Christians to study and apply God's specific instructions for prosperity and success. God's laws of prosperity are not in any way dependent upon the condition of a man-made economic system. Now is the time to start learning and applying these laws.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qQGpqrlpZWUC&dq=Trust+God+For+Your+Finances&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Nun's Priest's Tale on CD-Rom: Individual Licence (Scholarly Digital Editions)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YOQKGhGLkSsC&dq=The+Nun%27s+Priest%27s+Tale+on+CD-Rom:+Individual+Licence+(Scholarly+Digital+Editions)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life Magazine November 28, 1969 -- Cover: The U.S. Mail Mess","description":"LIFE Magazine is the treasured photographic magazine that chronicled the 20th Century.

W. E. B. Griffin In this thrilling geopolitical adventure from New York Times bestselling legend Dale Brown, Brad McLanahan and the Space Force must fight to preserve America s freedom when ruthless enemies forge an unlikely alliance to control not only the earth, but the moon and beyond Because its enemies never stop trying to undermine the security of the United States, the men and women who serve to protect America must always be vigilant. Few know this better than warriors Brad McLanahan and Nadia Rozek. Newly married, the two are just beginning to settle into their life together when they are called back into action. Though the Russians were badly defeated by Brad and the Iron Wolf Squadron in their previous bid for world dominance, they are back and doubling down on their quest for control of outer space. In addition to their cutting-edge weaponry, they have a formidable new ally: China s energetic and ruthless leader, President Li Jun. To protect America and the rest of the free world from the Russians and the Chinese, the Americans plan to mine the moon s helium-3 resources, which will allow them to fully exploit the revolutionary fusion power technology Brad and his team captured from the Russians aboard the Mars One weapons platform. But Russia s minister of defense, Mikhail Leonov, and Li have devised a daring plan of their own. They are building a joint secret base on the moon s far side fortified with a powerful Russian plasma rail gun that can destroy any spacecraft entering lunar orbit. If the heavily armed base becomes operational, it will give America s enemies control over the world s economic and military future. As this latest skirmish in the war for space accelerates, Brad, Nadia, and their compatriots in the Space Force must use their cunning and skill and America s own high-tech weaponry to derail the Sino-Russian alliance and destroy their lunar site before it s too late for the United States . . . and the entire world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v06rDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To Be Me: Understanding What It's Like to Have Asperger's Syndrome","description":"Looks at what it is like to be a child with Asperger's syndrome through the eyes of a boy with the condition named Greg, with information for parents and professionals on how to deal with the syndrome and the effects it has on families.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FZv0r_CIHCwC&dq=To+Be+Me:+Understanding+What+It%27s+Like+to+Have+Asperger%27s+Syndrome&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Directory of Temporary Placement Firms for Executives, Managers & Professionals (Directory of Executive Temporary Placement Firms)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XXkOAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Directory+of+Temporary+Placement+Firms+for+Executives,+Managers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Swamp Thing Vol. 5: Earth to Earth","description":"The newly reborn Swamp Thing battles the Rot, a force of decay and death that attempts to destroy Earth, while Abigail Arcane discovers an old foe that will change Swamp Thing's life forever.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NCGAMAEACAAJ&dq=Swamp+Thing+Vol.+5:+Earth+to+Earth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lurulu (The Sequel to Ports of Call)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IhiGtgAACAAJ&dq=Lurulu+(The+Sequel+to+Ports+of+Call)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life Begins at Sixty","description":"\\"Failure to change will ensure that you will die at the age socially decided by yourself and your family\\" says Anthony Kearney, author of The Pursuit of Happiness.

And no other American city has had a mayor like William Hale \\"Big Bill\\" Thompson, not in any of his political incarnations. A brilliant chameleon of a politician, Thompson could move from pro- to anti-prohibition, from opposing the Chicago Teachers Federation to opposing a superintendent hostile to it, from being anti-Catholic to winning, in huge numbers, the Catholic vote. Shape-shifter extraordinaire, Thompson stayed in power by repeatedly altering his political image. In Big Bill Thompson, Chicago, and the Politics of Image, Douglas Bukowski captures the essence of this wily urban politico as no other biographer or historian has. Using materials accessible only thanks to the Freedom of Information Act, Bukowski has fashioned an unforgettable story of a volatile Chicago leader and his era. And he does it with such grace and in such an irresistible style that readers will yearn to visit the local speakeasy and lift a glass to colorful politicians gone by. \\"An excellent book, written in a lively style with a contemporary resonance. A first rate meditation on the image and reality of 'Big Bill' in the context of actual and mythological Chicago political history.\\" -- Steven P.

Born in Durban, South Africa, Stapleton joined the Royal Air Force in 1939 and flew Spitfires with 603 Squadron. His legendary escapades during the Battle of Britain account for nearly twenty enemy aircraft destroyed, probably destroyed or damaged. Stapleton later became flight commander of 257 Squadron and a gunnery instructor at RAF Kenley and Central Gunnery School, Catfoss. He returned to combat in 1944, flying Typhoons as commander of 247 Squadron. For his courageous combat during the Battle of Arnhem, he received the Dutch Flying Cross. In December of 1944, he was forced to land inside German lines and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner in Stalag Luft I on the Baltic coast. Nicknamed 'Stapme' after a phrase used in his favorite cartoon 'Just Jake', Stapleton was a larger-than-life character who became a beloved public figure in his postwar life. With his handlebar mustache and good-humored bravado, he became for many the quintessential ace fighter pilot. In this authoritative and intimate volume, Stapleton tells his full story to historian David Ross, author of the acclaimed biography Richard Hillary.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RPG-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Evangelica III: 1992-2000.

What can death teach the living? Former monk and hospice worker Rodney Smith teaches us that through intimately considering our own inevitable end we can reawaken to the sublime miracle of life we so often take for granted. A well of stories, personal anecdotes, and direct advice gleaned from years of working with the dying in their final moments, Lessons from the Dying helps us redefine our conception of what it means to truly live. Each chapter contains guided reflections and exercises that allow the reader to integrate the wisdom in its pages more fully into their lives. With a sense of compassion, Lessons from the Dying provides all the tools of mind one needs to rediscover, in this very moment, the mystery and wonder of a lifetime. From the foreword by Joseph Goldstein:  Lessons from the Dying could also be called  lessons for the living  because of the courageous honesty revealed in so many of the stories told here. These accounts reflect back to us our own attitudes toward death and love, and they prompt us to examine the way we are living our lives right now. In the busyness of our lives we rarely take time to consider our mortality and the implications that it might have for the choices we make. Yet when we do cultivate this awareness it becomes a powerful force for wise discrimination.

Many were purged from key positions in the central government for their relentless push for a national moral rearmament under the Tianqi emperor. While their martyrs' deaths won them a lasting reputation for heroism and steadfastness, their opponents are remembered for fatally degrading the quality of Ming political life with their arrests and tortures of Donglin partisans. John Dardess employs a wide range of little-used primary sources (letters, diaries, eyewitness accounts, memorials, imperial edicts) to provide a remarkably detailed narrative of the inner workings of Ming government and of this dramatic period as a whole. Comparing the repression with the Tiananmen demonstrations of 1989, he argues that Tiananmen offers compelling clues to a rereading of the events of the 1620s. Leaders of both movements were less interested in practical reform than in communicating sincere moral feelings to rulers and the public. In the end the protesters succeeded in commemorating their dead and imprisoned and in disgracing those responsible for the violence. A work of unprecedented depth skillfully told, Blood and History in China will be appreciated by specialists in intellectual history and Ming and early Qing studies.<","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4ZwBEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Merry adventures of Robin Hood: Of great renown in Nottinghamshire","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=R6irBWFq3t4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fragrance of Faith: The Enlightened Heart of Islam","description":"The essence of Islam is conveyed to spiritual students in this practical and heartwarming introduction to the religion and its practices.

With the ability to understand how things workedor might work at a very deep level, he linked his own mathematics to engineering and provided basicideas for the design of all sorts of inventions, from radar to communications networks to computersto artificial limbs. Wiener had an abiding concern about the ethics guiding applications of theorieshe and other scientists developed. Years after he died, the manuscript for this book was discoveredamong his papers. The world of science has changed greatly since Wiener's day, and much of thechange has been in the direction he warned against. Now published for the first time, this book canbe read as a salutary corrective from the past and a chance to rethink the components of anenvironment that encourages inventiveness.Wiener provides an engagingly written insider'sunderstanding of the history of discovery and invention, emphasizing the historical circumstancesthat foster innovations and allow their application. His message is that truly original ideas cannotbe produced on an assembly line, and that their consequences are often felt only at distant timesand places. The intellectual and technological environment has to be right before the idea canblossom. The best course for society is to encourage the best minds to pursue the most interestingtopics, and to reward them for the insights they produce. Wiener's comments on the problem ofsecrecy and the importance of the \\"free-lance\\" scientist are particularly pertinent today.SteveHeims provides a brief history of Wiener's literary output and reviews his contributions to thefield of invention and discovery. In addition, Heims suggests significant ways in which Wiener'sideas still apply to dilemmas facing the scientific and engineering communities of the 1990s.Norbert Wiener (1894-1964) was Institute Professor at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=G3Q2qOtOeLYC&dq=Invention:+The+Care+and+Feeding+of+Ideas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pesticide safety (MF)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0W_5Can6ufIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"101 projects for bottle cutters","description":"Instructions for making such items as tumblers, candleholders, and lamps from bottles.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2gdWjG6q1owC&dq=101+projects+for+bottle+cutters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Passover Journey: A Seder Companion","description":"Retells the story of the Israelites' fight for liberation from slavery in Egypt and explains the traditions of the Passover Seder.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZDXhAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Passover+Journey:+A+Seder+Companion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mosby's Comprehensive NCLEX-RN Review of Nursing (Interactive CD-ROM for Windows & Macintosh)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_x8QAQAAMAAJ&dq=Mosby%27s+Comprehensive+NCLEX-RN+Review+of+Nursing+(Interactive+CD-ROM+for+Windows&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chasing the Eastern Star: Adventures in Biblical Reader-Response Criticism","description":"Argues for a method of biblical interpretation that allows for multiple legitimate meanings, providing examples from popular literature and movies while considering in length the story of the Magi and the impact of Scripture on human truth.

The Taiping Rebellion has been called the greatest popular revolt in modern history, and it came remarkably close to toppling the Ch'ing empire some fifty years before it was finally overthrown in 1911. Captured in June 1864 by government forces, Li Hsiu-ch'eng spent the final days before his inevitable execution writing a personal account of the Rebellion and his role in it.

Er is echter niet   n overkoepelende solidariteit, maar er bestaan vele vormen van solidariteit; formele, statelijke solidariteit tot uitdrukking komend in het sociale zekerheidsstelsel of het migratiebeleid; van mening zijn dat er niet op de sociale zekerheid mag worden beknibbeld of dat mensen met riskante leefgewoontes niettemin gelijk behandeld moeten worden in de gezondheidszorg; daadwerkelijk informele hulp en zorg bieden aan mensen uit oudere generaties; geld geven aan goede doelen; vrijwilligerswerk; informele onderlinge steun binnen arme huishoudens of in kringen van illegale vreemdelingen. Het zijn allemaal verschillende uitingsvormen van solidariteit. Een andere vanzelfsprekendheid in het denken over solidariteit is dat overwegend de positieve zijde van het verschijnsel wordt belicht: solidariteit wordt gezien als iets goeds, iets dat volgens sommigen bedreigd wordt en onder druk staat, en dat dus gekoesterd en eventueel nieuw leven ingeblazen moet worden. Uit de klassieke sociologie blijkt echter al dat solidariteit een 'tweesnijdend zwaard' is: waar bepaalde mensen binnen solidariteitskringen worden opgenomen, worden anderen daarvan tegelijkertijd uitgesloten. Bovendien kunnen solidariteit en cohesie verstikkende vormen aannemen: niemand mag afwijken van de groepsnormen, niemand mag boven het maaiveld uitsteken. In Het cement van de samenleving worden beide vanzelfsprekendheden ter discussie gesteld.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZBFjiSE-fbkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of the United States of America Under the Constitution Vol II 1801-1817","description":"Excerpt from History of the United States of America: Under the Constitution, 1801-1817 Republican gains in spring elections; New York, New England, Foreign relations, French convention ratified.

The narrator is an upstanding commuting family man who, faced with awkward situations, plays sick, has small fits of rage, or babbles something inappropriate and/or witty. Like the author, he works on cartoons published in a New York magazine, and uses humor to deal with stress. The plot includes an officious lady employed by an adoption agency, and the confused identities of babies.

The scope of these committees' power and responsibility has expanded, as recommended by the 1987 National Commission on Fraudulent Financial Reporting. All of the major stock exchanges now require their listed companies to maintain audit committees, and all but small insured depository institutions are now required by the federal government to have audit committees. The new emphasis on audit committees has made committee members liable for the effective fiscal governance of corporations. In addition, the rapid growth of and the liability now placed on these committees have left them vulnerable to the criticism that committee members do not fully understand their duties and responsibilities. The Audit Committee Handbook is a complete revision of what was once entitled The Audit Director's Guide. This Handbook offers comprehensive guidance to all functions, duties, and responsibilities of audit committee members as well as their directors. It reflects recent changes in law and accepted practice and provides a complete survey of the relevant literature, and recent developments in the field including: the Report of the National Commission on Fraudulent Business Practices; the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991, changes in accounting standards and pronouncements by the FASB, AICPA, SEC, and the Institute of Internal Auditors, and a review of criticism and litigation resulting from business failures. Conveniently organized into four parts for easy reference, the Handbook begins with an overview of the audit committee's functions and responsibilities, then moves on to detailed discussions of its three main functions: planning an audit, monitoring and supervising an audit, and reporting audit findings to the board of directors. Extensive appendixes include a glossary, a historical overview of audit committees, and relevant excerpts from all major legislation and professional guidelines and codes of ethics dealing with the function of the audit committee and the internal auditing process. For accountants, financial officers, CEOs, managers and auditors, it offers insights into the purpose and function of the audit committee and practical guidelines for developing a productive relationship with the audit committee. For all, the main thrust of this book is to maximize the effectiveness of the audit committee and thus bolster stockholder confidence in the internal auditing process.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6x4UAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Audit+Committee+Handbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Women of Azusa Street","description":"The Women of Azusa Street pays tribute to the women who played a vital role-which was typically overlooked or down-played in literature-in the 1906 Azusa Street Revival, an event that catapulted the then fledgling Pentecostal Movement into national prominence.

The women whose stories are told herein: Anna Hall, Mable Smith, Neely Terry, Julia Hutchins, Lucy Farrow, Clara Lum, Florence Crawford, Lucy Featherman, Ophelia Wiley, Lillian Garr, Susie Valdez, Rosa de Lopez, Ardella Meade, May Evans, Daisy Batman, Jennie Moore Seymour, Emma Cotton, and Rachel Sizelove.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1MDYAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Women+of+Azusa+Street&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Learning To Fly","description":" It's not so surprising that on the day of my fifth wedding anniversary I would be crouched in the open door of an airplane, thirteen thousand feet above the Colorado plains, about to jump out. That coincidence of timing really wasn't.  Steph Davis is a superstar in the climbing community and has ascended some of the world's most awe-inspiring peaks. But when her husband makes a controversial climb in a national park, the media fallout and the toll it takes on her marriage suddenly leaves her without a partner, a career, a source of income . . . or a purpose. In the company of only her beloved dog, Fletch, Davis sets off on a search for a new identity and discovers skydiving. Though falling out of an airplane is completely antithetical to the climber's control she'd practiced for so long, she turns each daring jump into an opportunity to fly, first as a skydiver, then as a base jumper, and finds herself indelibly changed. As she opens herself to falling, she also finds the strength to open herself to love again, even in the wake of heartbreak. And before too long, she fortuitously meets someone who shares her passions. Learning to Fly is Davis's fascinating account of her transformation. From her early tentative skydives, to zipping into her first wingsuit, to surviving devastating accidents against the background of breathtaking cliffs, to soaring beyond her past limits, she discovers new hope and joy in letting go. Learning to Fly isn't just an adventure but a woman's story of risk-taking and self-discovery, with love at its heart.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IIDRCgAAQBAJ&dq=Learning+To+Fly&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Liberation of the Riviera: The Resistance to the Nazis in the South of France and the Story of Its Heroic Leader Ange-Marie Miniconi","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ywkrAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Liberation+of+the+Riviera:+The+Resistance+to+the+Nazis+in+the+South+of+France+and+the+Story+of+Its+Heroic+Leader+Ange-Marie+Miniconi&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Celtic Shaman","description":"Probably the oldest known spiritual discipline, shamanism is the timeless art of living in harmony with creation, providing a universal system to work with today, whatever our religion or spiritual affiliation may be.

And they are more dangerous to children than to adults. Not as dangerous of course, as kitchen utensils, drapery cords, five-gallon water buckets, horses, or cows. Not nearly as dangerous as playground equipment, swimming pools, skateboards, or bikes. And not remotely as dangerous as family, friends, guns, or cars. Heres the reality. Dogs almost never kill people. A child is more likely to die choking on a marble or a balloon, and an adult is more likely to die in a bedroom slipper related accident. Your chances of being killed by a dog are roughly one in 18 million. You are twice as likely to win a super lotto jackpot on a single ticket than be killed by a dog. You are five times as likely to be killed by a bolt of lightning than be killed by a dog. Because it is so extraordinary, lightning is often regarded as a universal clich for an Act of God. Dog-attack deaths are even more extraordinaryfive times more extraordinary.The supposed epidemic numbers of dog bites splashed across the media are absurdly inflated by dubious research and by counting bites that dont actually hurt anyone. Even when dogs do injure people, the vast majority of injuries are at the Band-Aid level.Dogs enhance the lives of millions more people than even the most inflated estimates of dog-bite victims. Search-and-rescue and cancer-detecting dogs save significant numbers of human lives, and assistance dogs enormously improve the quality of many more. Infants who live with dogs have fewer allergies. People with dogs have less cardiovascular disease, better heart attack survival, and fewer backaches, headaches, and flu symptoms. Petting your dog lowers stress and people who live with dogs just plain feel better than people who dont.Yet lawmakers, litigators, and insurers press for less dog ownership. This must stop. We must maintain perspective. Yes, dogs bite. But even party balloons and bedroom slippers are more dangerous.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FBxSAAAACAAJ&dq=Dogs+Bite:+But+Balloons+and+Slippers+Are+More+Dangerous&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"China Today: How Population Control, Human Rights, Government Repression, Hong Kong, and Democratic Reform Affect Life in China and Will Shape World","description":"Looks at daily life in modern China and the challenges of the future","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cWOwAAAAIAAJ&dq=China+Today:+How+Population+Control,+Human+Rights,+Government+Repression,+Hong+Kong,+and+Democratic+Reform+Affect+Life+in+China+and+Will+Shape+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cigarettes: Anatomy of an Industry from Seed to Smoke","description":"The author focuses attention on the $48 billion tobacco industry, tracing its remarkable success as a cash crop and modern superbusiness, even in the face of public health concerns about their products.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1oeeQgAACAAJ&dq=Cigarettes:+Anatomy+of+an+Industry+from+Seed+to+Smoke&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Search for the Emerald Blackbird","description":"What happens when Satan decides to invade Mexicos ancient deities?

It situates attacks on black Africans by fellow black Africans within the context of ideals such as Pan-Africanism and Ubuntu, which emphasize unity. The book straddles a range of social science perspectives to explain why attacks on foreign nationals in Africa usually entail attacks on black foreign nationals. Written by an international and interdisciplinary team of scholars, the book is divided into four sections that each explain a different facet of this complicated relationship. Section One discusses the history of colonialism and apartheid and their relationship to xenophobia. Section Two critically evaluates Pan-Africanism as a concept and as a practice in 21st century Africa. Section Three presents case studies on xenophobia in contemporary Africa. Section Four similarly discusses cases of nativism. Addressing a complex issue in contemporary African politics, this volume will be of use to students and scholars interested in African studies, African politics, human rights, migration, history, law, and development economics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lfFUEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Picnic on paradise","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=byGRPwAACAAJ&dq=Picnic+on+paradise&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Snow Storm","description":"One night with heavy snow storm, a woman visits her friend's house, isolated on the mountain top.

It provides a map of an area where there are few detailed discussion of the achievements of these difficult, yet immensely rewarding, writers. In doing so, this overview raises issues of general relevance to feminist research: it participates in debates around the nature of feminist theory, the relations feminist intellectuals have to male dominated knowledges, and the strategies appropriate for developing non patriarchal, autonomous or woman-centred knowledges. No book in French feminists would be complete without including the contributions of Kristeva and Irigaray. The inclusion of Le Deouff's work, which brings a different perspective to bear on the question of sexual difference, provides a counterbalance to literary appropriations of French feminism by Anglo-American readerships. Kristeva, Irigaray and Le Deouff are the focal points of this study, precisely because each highlights the differences of the others, revealing the frameworks to which the others are committed. Nevertheless, while these writers do not present a common political or theoretical position or form a school, each addresses the question of women's autonomy from male definition, affirms the sexual specificity of women, seeks out a femininity women can use to question the patriarchal norms and ideals of femininity and rejects the preordained positions patriarchy allots to women.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cW76DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The World's 100 Greatest Books Audio Collection on 50 CDs","description":"A short novel.

This fundamental fact has generally been overshadowed by popular and scholarly images of the plantation household as the source of slavery's redeeming qualities, where 'gentle' mistresses ministered to 'loyal' slaves. This book recounts a very different story. The very notion of a private sphere, as divorced from the immoral excesses of chattel slavery as from the amoral logic of market laws, functioned to conceal from public scrutiny the day-to-day struggles between enslaved women and their mistresses, subsumed within a logic of patriarchy. One of emancipation's unsung consequences was precisely the exposure to public view of the unbridgeable social distance between the women on whose labor the plantation household relied and the women who employed them. This is a story of race and gender, nation and citizenship, freedom and bondage in the nineteenth century South; a big abstract story that is composed of equally big personal stories.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oMunAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Malcolm: The Life of a Man Who Changed Black America.","description":"Traces the life of the influential Black leader, describes the people who helped shape his philosophy, and looks at the circumstances that led to his murder","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2VOQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Malcolm:+The+Life+of+a+Man+Who+Changed+Black+America.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teaching of the Parables","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=azziAAAAMAAJ&dq=Teaching+of+the+Parables&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The varieties of religious experience: A study in human nature","description":"The Varieties of Religious Experience: A Study in Human Nature is a book by the Harvard psychologist and philosopher William James comprising 20 lectures given at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.

In this anthology, the first-ever collection of essays by innovative, cutting-edge writers on the theme of narration, forty of the continent's top experimental writers describe their engagement with language, storytelling and the world. The anthology includes renowned writers like Kathy Acker, Dennis Cooper, Nicole Brossard, Daphne Marlatt, Lydia Davis and Kevin Killian, writers who have spent years pondering the meaning of storytelling and how storytelling functions in our culture, as well as presenting a new generation of brilliant thinkers and writers, like Christian B?k, Corey Frost, Derek McCormack and Lisa Robertson. Contemporizing the friendly anecdotal style of Montaigne and written by daring writers of different ages, of different origins, from many different regions of the continent, from Mexico to Montreal, these essays run the gamut of mirth, prose poetry, tall tales and playful explorations of reader/writer dynamics. They discuss aesthetics founded on new explorations in the field of narrative, the mystery that is the body, questions of how representation may be torqued to deal with gender and sexuality, the experience of marginalized people, the negotiation between different orders of time, the 'performance' of outlaw subject matter. Brave, energetic and fresh, Biting the Error tells a whole new story about narrative.

Frustrated by an epidemic of misbehavior at all employee levels, management teams are getting back to basics back to the idea that personal character and individual responsibility are the ultimate keys to integrity, just as they were back in the days of the Open Range. A decade ago, the book Cowboy Ethics first inspired businesspeople to look to the Code of the West. Once they did, they discovered that its simple, common-sense principles can be more effective guides to business leadership than a truckload of corporate mission statements, rules, and ethics manuals.  Cowboys are role models because they live by a code,  says author James P. Owen.  They show us what it means to stand for something, and to strive every day to make your actions line up with your beliefs. And isn t that as good a definition of integrity as you can find?

There are actually three cable lines in operation today: the California Street line and the two Powell Street lines-- the Powell-Mason and Powell-Hyde. The Powell Street lines have been the subject of much controversy through the years, due to a complex lineage of private and public ownership. Cable cars on Powell Street began in 1888, operating under the Ferries and Cliff House Railway Company and utilizing the same basic design pioneered by Andrew Hallidie in 1873. Among the story's twists and turns are the line's actual routes following the 1906 earthquake, which caused heavy damage and forced major repairs. Post-quake, United Railroads was able to replace many of the cable car lines with streetcars, including a part of the Powell Street system. San Francisco at one time had eight separate cable car operators. Gradually most were replaced by streetcars, buses, and trolley buses, given the complexities and expense of cable systems. The Powell lines were taken over by the city in 1944, but the mayor tried to abandon them in 1947. The public disapproved of this move, and since then the Powell Street line has only grown in stature and its importance to San Francisco.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KiG4Vrzy9XcC&dq=San+Francisco%27s+Powell+Street+Cable+Cars+(Images+of+Rail)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Days of Awe: Ideas and Insights of the Sfas Emes on the High Holy Days (Artscroll Judaica Classics)","description":"Rabbi Yosef Stern has distilled the profound, scintillating, pithy, incredibly rich discourses of the great Sfas Emes, Rabbi Yehudah Aryeh Alter of Ger, into enlightening and inspiring English essays.

From a dummy tank in North Africa in World War II to the different uniforms of Waffen-SS on the Eastern Front soldiers to zebra-striped dazzle ships in the north Atlantic to today s digital pixelated pattern uniforms used by US soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, the book is a wide-ranging examination of the developments and wrong turns in military camouflage all around the world. Although this was military work, the inspiration often came from the natural world and the designers were civilian artists. As we move further into the 21st century, the use of camouflage is changing. Straightforward visual camouflage is less important for aircraft as they can be picked up by heat sensors, so the task becomes to create non-visual camouflage, deflect radar signals and reduce their signature. Today, technology is being developed to project live images on to bodies, so that they appear invisible. From uniforms to tanks, from ships to aircraft to military buildings disguised as civilian ones, the book is an expert account of how different countries have sought to hide their forces in plain view for the past century. Packed with 200 colour and black and white photographs and colour artworks, Camouflage at War is a fascinating exploration of how warfare has changed over the last hundred years.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SHpFDwAAQBAJ&dq=MITSUBISHI+J2M+RAIDEN+(JACK)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Geometrical Tolerancing Desk Reference: Creating and Interpreting ISO Standard Technical Drawings","description":"Geometrical tolerancing is the standard technique that designers and engineers use to specify and control the form, location and orientation of the features of components and manufactured parts.

While visiting Russia in his twenties, Rainer Maria Rilke, one of the twentieth century's greatest poets, was moved by a spirituality he encountered there. Inspired, Rilke returned to Germany and put down on paper what he felt were spontaneously received prayers. Rilke's Book of Hours is the invigorating vision of spiritual practice for the secular world, and a work that seems remarkably prescient today, one hundred years after it was written. Rilke's Book of Hours shares with the reader a new kind of intimacy with God, or the divine a reciprocal relationship between the divine and the ordinary in which God needs us as much as we need God. Rilke influenced generations of writers with his Letters to a Young Poet, and now Rilke's Book of Hours tells us that our role in the world is to love it and thereby love God into being. These fresh translations rendered by Joanna Macy, a mystic and spiritual teacher, and Anita Barrows, a skilled poet, capture Rilke's spirit as no one has done before.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=99Uo01-ptl4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Visualizing Quaternions (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Interactive 3D Technology)","description":"Introduced 160 years ago as an attempt to generalize complex numbers to higher dimensions, quaternions are now recognized as one of the most important concepts in modern computer graphics. They offer a powerful way to represent rotations and compared to rotation matrices they use less memory, compose faster, and are naturally suited for efficient interpolation of rotations. Despite this, many practitioners have avoided quaternions because of the mathematics used to understand them, hoping that some day a more intuitive description will be available. The wait is over. Andrew Hanson's new book is a fresh perspective on quaternions. The first part of the book focuses on visualizing quaternions to provide the intuition necessary to use them, and includes many illustrative examples to motivate why they are important a beautiful introduction to those wanting to explore quaternions unencumbered by their mathematical aspects. The second part covers the all-important advanced applications, including quaternion curves, surfaces, and volumes. Finally, for those wanting the full story of the mathematics behind quaternions, there is a gentle introduction to their four-dimensional nature and to Clifford Algebras, the all-encompassing framework for vectors and quaternions. Richly illustrated introduction for the developer, scientist, engineer, or student in computer graphics, visualization, or entertainment computing.

John Belushi was found dead of a drug overdose March 5, 1982, in a seedy hotel bungalow off Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. Belushi s death was the beginning of a trail that led Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward on an investigation that examines the dark side of American show business TV, rock and roll, and the movie industry. From on-the-record interviews with 217 people, including Belushi's widow, his former partner Dan Aykroyd, Belushi s movie directors including Jack Nicholson and Steven Spielberg, actors Chevy Chase, Robin Williams, and Carrie Fisher, the movie executives, the agents, Belushi s drug dealers, and those who live in the show business underground, the author has written a close portrait of a great American comic talent, and of his struggle to succeed and to survive that ended in tragedy. Using diaries, accountants  records, phone bills, travel records, medical records, and interviews with firsthand witnesses, Woodward has followed Belushi s life from childhood in a small town outside Chicago to his meteoric rise to fame. Bob Woodward has written a spellbinding account of rise and fall, a cautionary tale for our times, and a poignant and gentle portrait of a young man who had so much, gave so much, and lost so much.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZWcPqPzYUCsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christo (Modern artists)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OM5XswEACAAJ&dq=Christo+(Modern+artists)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roo's Big Adventure (WINNIE THE POOH AND HIS FRIENDS BOARD BOOK)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=C2o4DQEACAAJ&dq=Roo%27s+Big+Adventure+(WINNIE+THE+POOH+AND+HIS+FRIENDS+BOARD+BOOK)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Narada-bhakti-sutra: The secrets of transcendental love","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=L-4-nQEACAAJ&dq=Narada-bhakti-sutra:+The+secrets+of+transcendental+love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clay and Glazes for the Potter.","description":"2015 Reprint of 1957 Edition.

Drawing on author-editor William P. MacKinnon s half-century of research and a wealth of carefully selected new material, At Sword s Point presents the first full history of the conflict through the voices of participants leaders, soldiers, and civilians from both sides. MacKinnon s lively narrative, continued in this second volume, links and explains these firsthand accounts to produce the most detailed, in-depth, and balanced view of the war to date. At Sword s Point, Part 2 carries the story of the Utah War from the end of 1857 to the conclusion of hostilities in June 1858, when Brigham Young was replaced as territorial governor and almost one-third of the U.S. Army occupied Utah. Through the testimony of Mormon and federal leaders, combatants, emissaries, and onlookers, this second volume describes the war s final months and uneasy resolution. President James Buchanan and his secretary of war, John B. Floyd, worked to break a political-military stalemate in Utah, while Mormon leaders prepared defensive and aggressive countermeasures ranging from an attack on Forts Bridger and Laramie to the  Sebastopol Strategy  of evacuating and torching Salt Lake City and sending 30,000 Mormon refugees on a mass exodus and fighting retreat toward Mexican Sonora. Thomas L. Kane, self-appointed intermediary and Philadelphia humanitarian, sought a peaceful conclusion to the conflict, which ended with the arrival in Utah of President Buchanan s two official peace commissioners, the president s blanket pardon for Utah s population, and the army s peaceful march into the Salt Lake Valley. MacKinnon s narrative weaves a panoramic yet intimate view of a turning point in western, Mormon, and American history far bloodier than previously understood. With its sophisticated documentary analysis and insight, this work will stand as the definitive history of the complex, consequential, and still-debated Utah War.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2C0_DQAAQBAJ&dq=AT+SWORDS%27+POINTS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pioneer Days Along the Ocmulgee,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=az8TAAAAYAAJ&dq=Pioneer+Days+Along+the+Ocmulgee,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ungovernable City: John Lindsay's New York And The Crisis Of Liberalism","description":"Chronicles the political life of John Lindsay, from his campaign to be mayor of New York, through his attempts at governing a city enmeshed in strong racial and anti-war tensions, to the end of his political career.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9M54AAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Ungovernable+City:+John+Lindsay%27s+New+York+And+The+Crisis+Of+Liberalism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All My Dangerous Friends","description":"Award winning children's author, Sonya Hartnett, weaves a compelling drama of friendship and choice that is perfect reading for the 15+ market.

What can we learn about our culture's sexual attitudes, fears, and fantasies from the ways that porn films are designed and produced? In this book, Dr. Robert J. Stoller, one of the world's leading experts on human sexual behavior, joins with I. S. Levine, a professional writer with long experience in X-rated video making, to examine the ideas and psychological makeup of the participants in an adult heterosexual X-rated video, Stairway to Paradise. Their interviews with performers, writers, directors, producers, and technicians provide extraordinary insights into the technical aspects of this type of video, the motivations and backgrounds of the people involved, and the porn industry's view of the video's intended audience. Stoller, Levine, and the porn filmmakers have wide-ranging discussions about the aesthetics, ethics, and etiquette of the porn industry; the hostility that Dr. Stoller claimed underlies all erotic excitement; the liberating and educational function of porn in a puritanical culture; the misconceptions of antiporn crusaders; the impact of aids on the participants; and the future of the porn film industry. The authors hope that if we understand how and why a pornographic work is created, we will be better able to understand the implications of the legal and moral issues it raises.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=w2bSt5JdQUYC&dq=Coming+Attractions:+The+Making+of+an+X-Rated+Video&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pictorial history of the wild West; a true account of the bad men, desperadoes, rustlers, and outlaws of the old West--and the men who fought them to establish law and order","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0mqYswEACAAJ&dq=Pictorial+history+of+the+wild+West%3B+a+true+account+of+the+bad+men,+desperadoes,+rustlers,+and+outlaws+of+the+old+West--and+the+men+who+fought+them+to+establish+law+and+order&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One by One from the Inside Out : Essays and Reviews on Race and Responsibility in America","description":"Argues against racial political practices that promote \\"correctness\\" rather than directly addressing racial problems, encouraging consideration based upon actual merit","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=eYF2AAAAMAAJ&dq=One+by+One+from+the+Inside+Out+:+Essays+and+Reviews+on+Race+and+Responsibility+in+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creative Thinking","description":"Get ready to get inspired In short and engaging entries, this deceptively simple volume presents examples of creative thinkers from the worlds of writing, music, architecture, painting, technology, and more, shedding light on their process, and showing how each of us can learn from them to improve our lives and our work.

Diana Lary gives a detailed examination of Kwangsi province in south-west China, the home base of a major warlord clique that was important both for its interesting internal politics and for its national influence in the late 1920s and the 1930s. She reconstructs with imagination and thoroughness the intricate political and military history of the nation, but without losing sight of the overall regional character of the Kwangsi government and its policies. She shows how the regional leaders responded to central breakdown, what sense they had of the nation even in its weakened condition. China is usually studied as a monolithic entity; Diana Lary demonstrates that such a simple view must fail, that China also consists of a large number of distinct regions with special patterns of relationship to the centre.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tCA9AAAAIAAJ&dq=Region+and+nation+:+the+Kwangsi+clique+in+Chinese+politics,+1925-1937&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elementary Korean: Includes a 74-minute Audio CD","description":"Telepathy\\" which serves to save face for everyone involved.

In the original section of the book, now entitled \\"God--An Infantile Illusion?,  Hans K?ng traces Freud s views on religion and religious longing, compares Jung s and Adler s attitudes toward religion, shows that Freud s arguments against the existence of God are theologically unsound, and concludes with a frank and provocative discussion of what psychoanalysis may be able to teach the Christian Church. In a new section, \\"Religion--The Final Taboo?,  K?ng points out that religions still plays a negligible role in the practice of psychoanalysis, despite its increasing importance in the lives of most people. Has religion replaced sex, K?ng asks, as an integral facet of human experience ignored or repressed by the very profession that seeks to enlighten?

Set against the background of Fascist Italy and the Tyrolean Alps where she spent the early years of her childhood, the story Ezra Pound's daughter movingly reveals is a side of the poet which is seldom touched upon, that of devoted father, and at the same time serves to illuminate many of the more difficult, personal passages of The Cantos. But the book is more than a mere memoir, for Mary de Rachewiltz is an accomplished poet and translator in her own right, guided in her craft under her father's tutelage: through her stylized, often oblique prose technique we are enabled to appreciate more deeply Pound's inner anguish during the war years and the strains put upon him by the circumstances of his life.

Hickory nuts and macadamia nuts are close behind, but are available only in limited supply. Pecans are among the nuts highest in oil content. In general, the varieties of nuts with the highest oil content are also rich in flavor and tender in texture. Some varieties of pecans (i. e. , Schley and Curtis) have been shown to contain as much as 76% oil. The oil in pecans is highly unsaturated, which means it is desirable from a nutritional standpoint but that it is also highly susceptible to oxidation which can cause pecans to tum stale and rancid. Pecans used in confections, bakery goods, cereals, or in snacks are more subject to staleness and rancidity than most nuts because these products are often stored at ambient temperatures. For this reason, pecans are considered to be semi-perishable and are not used in some \\"fine\\" products due to their limited shelf-life. Research at the Georgia Experiment Station has shown that raw pecans or most pecan products may be held in good condition for more than 20 years if freezing is the mode of preservation. However, development of new products demands that pecans be stored at ambient temperatures for extended intervals. Pecan 'meat' is easily bruised during shelling and handling.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k6I9BQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cognitive Neuroscience of Human Communication","description":"This is a book about speech and language. It is primarily intended for those interested in speech and its neurophysiological bases: phoneticians, linguists, educators, speech therapists, psychologists, and neuroscientists. Although speech and language are its central topic, it provides information about related topics as well (e.g. structure and functioning of the central nervous system, research methods in neuroscience, theories and models of speech production and perception, learning, and memory). Data on clinical populations are given in parallel with studies of healthy subjects because such comparisons can give a better understanding of intact and disordered speech and language functions. There is a review of literature (more than 600 sources) and research results covering areas such as neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, development of the nervous system, sex differences, history of neurolinguistics, behavioral, neuroimaging and other research methods in neuroscience, linguistics and psychology, theories and models of the nervous system function including speech and language processing, kinds of memory and learning and their neural substrates, critical periods, various aspects of normal speech and language processes (e.g. phonetics, phonology, syntax, semantics, reading), bilingualism, speech and language disorders, and many others. Newcomers to the field of neurolinguistics will find it as readable as professionals will because it is organized in a way that gives the readers flexibility and an individual approach to the text.

Nori J. Muster, a California native, joined the International Society of Krishna Consciousness (ISKON) - the Hare Krishnas - in 1977, shortly after the death of the movement's spiritual master, Srila A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. She lived in the Krishnas' western world headquarters in Los Angeles and worked for ten years as a public relations secretary and editor of the organization's newspaper, the ISKON World Review. Her story of the Hare Krishnas' decline is a gripping presentation of facts gleaned from personal reminiscences, published articles, and internal documents. Betrayal of the Spirit details drug dealing, weapons stockpiling, deceptive fund-raising, child abuse, and murder within ISKON, as well as the dynamics of schisms that forced some 95 percent of the group's original members to leave. Although the movement fell into disarray after the death of its founder, the author's story is one of a continual search for truth and religious meaning as an ISKON member. Muster's account of the scandal-plagued decade following Swami Prabhupada's death ends in 1988 when, disillusioned over the continuing internal strife and scandals, she left her job and the movement.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Dw3-xD05wnoC&dq=Betrayal+of+the+Spirit:+My+Life+behind+the+Headlines+of+the+Hare+Krishna+Movement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Avram Davidson Treasury: A Tribute Collection","description":"Avram Davidson was one of the great original American writers of this century.

Their aim was to consider the question of the 'Byzantine outsider'. Some categories of outsiders appear clear and simple: those marked out by class, race, sex, religion. But these categories are not universals. Today, historians of all periods are examining the ways in which we analyse the divisions in our societies, which can determine how we look at societies in the past. There is no consensus on who forms the 'outsider class' in modern society; it should come as no surprise that there was no consensus in Byzantium as to who the outsiders were, what they had done to deserve that status, and what the result of their attaining it should have been. The papers in this collection, drawn from the large number presented at the XXXII Spring Symposium, continue the debate about the idea of the 'Byzantine outsider'. The scholars within - theologians, historians, literary critics and art historians - present differing approaches to different aspects of the problem. The volume does not aim to have the 'last word', but rather to provoke debate and to open the field. Any examination of society that uses the concept of the outsider has implicitly within it a concept of the 'insider'. By looking at those on the margins it becomes easier to see who were - or at least thought they were - on the inside.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iBOmDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Local Religion in Sixteenth-Century Spain","description":"\\"Spanish Catholicism in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries has attracted considerable scholarly attention over the years.

Talk Yourself Slim with the Self-Chatter Diet was written from John Richardson s childhood observations of his grandfather and mother. His grandfather was slim, and a naturally healthy weight, whereas his mother was not, and this was the true cause of her early disablement. Diets don t work, do they? Not conventional, out-of-date, orthodox, restrictive diets  these are one of the fundamental instigators of obesity in the world today, fueled by the same diet industry that masquerades as a 'solution provider'. It is not food that makes people overweight, but the behavioural manner in which food is eaten, and until obesity is addressed and treated behaviourally, no solution will ever be found. In this book you will discover the true cause of obesity: beliefs, habits and associations. Richardson first provides a way in which these rogue behaviors can be identified. He then questions them and challenges them, allowing readers to form a general understanding of a method through which they can be changed. Talk Yourself Slim was written to facilitate permanent weight-loss success, and nothing more. This simple yet highly effective method is uniquely innovative in its approach, ideal for anyone fed up of diets that don t work, who wants to lose weight and keep it off!","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2If0AwAAQBAJ&dq=Talk+Yourself+Thin+Handbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to the Kabbalah: How to Apply the Ancient Mysteries of the Kabbalah to Your Everyday Life","description":"The Kabbalah is a practical system for understanding ourselves and our relationship with the world.

WHY ME? Today, millions of women in their twenties and thirties, many of whom are just beginning to plan a family, are receiving the shocking news that their reproductive years are already over. They are in premature menopause -- menopause years before its time. Whether due to an autoimmune disorder, surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or the often undiagnosed condition known as Premature Ovarian Failure (POF), premature menopause is common, increasing -- and almost always traumatic. If you are one of the women experiencing early menopause, you have hundreds of questions, but have probably found few answers...until now. The Premature Menopause Book is the first book focusing on this difficult transition -- written by a woman who faced the same questions: What can I do about it? Do I need hormones? How can I have a baby despite this condition? How can I feel like \\"me\\" again? The Premature Menopause Book provides the latest information on health and emotional issues, explores all of your options, lists resources, websites and support groups, shares the experiences and advice of women going through this experience, answers frequently asked questions and offers the support and understanding you need.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=d2nvYYSdKrIC&dq=Early+Menopause+Guidebook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"P.J. & Puppy","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_p_QVKXcAuoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cycads of Africa","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cUVFAQAAIAAJ&dq=Cycads+of+Africa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Martin Eden,","description":"Martin Eden, le chef-d'?uvre de Jack London passe pour son autobiographie romanc e.

From most outside appearances, the Owenses are a normal, middle-class family who live in a big house in a nice neighborhood. Both the parents and the children have their crosses to bear, some ordinary and of this world, and some not. In spite of this, they each seem able to get up in the morning and face, if not accept, what lies ahead. But, walking a rope such as this can be done for only so long. What is truly going on in that house would cause the strongest of spirits to turn away. This novel follows a family as it tries to survive domestic abuse. It depicts the effects of screaming and throwing and yelling and the use of words meant to kill. It shows what happens when there is an ongoing war in your home. The Owenses story illustrates that what you do in front of your children, you do to your children. And the consequences are much more deleterious than those not realizing, not meaning to harm, expect. Amidst the ugliness, however, there are also dreams, magic, and hope. And the presence of ghostly activity in the Owenses house causes the reader to question the true catalyst of what has found this family. Theres Meggie, the wife and mother, who has lived most of her life the way she has been expected to, not questioning, not rising up, just following her duty, knowing somewhere inside that she has a penance to pay. There are the children: Elizabeth, whose anger is making a slow burn through her skin, who is most likely the only one in this family who actually sees what is going on. Grace, whose visions and clear eyes lend a certain magic to an otherwise oftentimes hopeless world. Danny, the only boy, whose dedication to making things right, trying to place order back into a chaotic world, almost ruins him. And Annabelle, whose tiny body and youngest mind help her to hide, but also cause her never to be seen -- not when it counts. And, finally, theres Dan, the husband and father -- a kind, funny man at times -- he finds himself in a place he never intended, where rage and a sense of injustice start the quakes in his house, in his children. This novel is intended for adults and is not appropriate for children.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9xV15klUWsoC&dq=The+Haunting+of+the+Owens+Family&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Story of the Secret Service","description":"Meet Jerry Parr.

R. Martin as  fantasy as it ought to be written  and Lin-Manuel Miranda as  an incredible series,  featuring a new foreword by Robin Hobb and ten illustrations. Twenty-five years ago, Robin Hobb s first novel featuring FitzChivalry Farseer and his mysterious, often maddening friend the Fool struck like a bolt of brilliant lightning. Thus began a beloved saga spanning multiple series, full of adventure, magic, and sinister plots. To celebrate a quarter-century of wonder, this special edition of Assassin s Apprentice presents a modern classic as it s never been seen before: in hardcover, with ten beautiful illustrations by Magali Villeneuve. Young Fitz is the bastard son of the noble Prince Chivalry, raised in the shadow of the royal court by his father s gruff stableman. He is treated as an outcast by all the royalty except the devious King Shrewd, who has him secretly tutored in the arts of the assassin. For in Fitz s blood runs the magic Skill and the darker knowledge of a child raised with the stable hounds and rejected by his family. As barbarous raiders ravage the coasts, Fitz is growing to manhood. Soon he will face his first dangerous, soul-shattering mission. And though some regard him as a threat to the throne, he may just be the key to the survival of the kingdom. Praise for Robin Hobb and Assassin s Apprentice  Fantasy as it ought to be written . . .

Do or Die explains how to get out of denial and discover the inspiration and willpower to create life-changing renewal and a healthy lifestyle. Do or Die reviews seven midlife chronic conditions that reduce life expectancy and life quality. Author Jim McFarland calls these \\"pathways to middle-aged male destruction.\\" Based on his personal experiences and years of extensive research, Do or Die offers numerous strategies and ideas for exercise, weight management, nutrition, and life balance. McFarland's advice will help you: Start defeating the vicious grip of denial Recognize how to rebuild your self-esteem Understand how to lose weight Learn how good nutrition and exercise will help lower your cholesterol and your risk of type two diabetes and heart disease Understand how to take responsibility for your health Learn how to avoid injuries when exercising Discover the importance of using a heart rate monitor for all fitness training Do or Die will guide you in writing a personal renewal plan, and it will also help you learn how to create and enjoy balance in your life. Take the first step towards better health today! With his health declining, McFarland took control and turned his life around. At 52, the author was what has become your Standard American Male-obese, sedentary, hypertensive and in deep denial-when his doctor reported that he was a prime candidate for type-two diabetes. The good news is that he decided to do something about it. In frank language, he discusses his renewal strategy and the routines and behaviors for rebuilding his physical and mental health, finding balance and peace in the process. First he had to own up to his rotten condition, his blubber and sloth, and become conversant with his body's cardiovascular needs, his metabolism, what comprises a healthy diet and his need for physical activity. Thus began his education in cholesterol, stress, midlife depression, the body mass index, blood analysis, high blood sugar and a host of other subjects-all of which he manages to convey in clarity and modest depth, despite his lack of professional training. He endeavored to use common sense in his eating and exercise, gradually creating a life script comprised of the seven Fs: Fitness (he provides a detailed, gradual program), Finding what is important in your life, having Faith in what you believe (discovering some spiritual support), eating the right Foods, time with Family, Friendships and having Fun. He consistently stresses the elemental need for self-respect; without it, he says, you won't have the will to embark on what amounts to a complete lifestyle change. A helpful if arduous map for living a better life that certainly beats the alternative: giving up and dying. -Kirkus Discoveries","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=el7AVKdN6CwC&dq=Do+or+Die:+The+baby-boomer+man%27s+guide+to+regaining+health,+happiness,+vitality,+and+a+longer,+fuller+life.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mercenary","description":"It was 2004, and Sean McFate had a mission in Burundi: to keep the president alive and prevent the country from spiraling into genocide, without anyone knowing that the United States was involved. The United States was, of course, involved, but only through McFate's employer, the military contractor DynCorp International. Throughout the world, similar scenarios are playing out daily. The United States can no longer go to war without contractors. Yet we don't know much about the industry's structure, its operations, or where it's heading. Typically led by ex-military men, contractor firms are by their very nature secretive. Even the U.S. government-the entity that actually pays them-knows relatively little. In The Modern Mercenary, Sean McFate lays bare this opaque world, explaining the economic structure of the industry and showing in detail how firms operate on the ground. A former U.S. Army paratrooper and private military contractor, McFate provides an unparalleled perspective into the nuts and bolts of the industry, as well as a sobering prognosis for the future of war. While at present, the U.S. government and U.S. firms dominate the market, private military companies are emerging from other countries, and warlords and militias have restyled themselves as private security companies in places like Afghanistan and Somalia. To understand how the proliferation of private forces may influence international relations, McFate looks back to the European Middle Ages, when mercenaries were common and contract warfare the norm. He concludes that international relations in the twenty-first century may have more in common with the twelfth century than the twentieth. This \\"back to the future\\" situation, which he calls \\"neomedievalism,\\" is not necessarily a negative condition, but it will produce a global system that contains rather than solves problems. The Modern Mercenary is the first work that combines a broad-ranging theory of the phenomenon with an insider's understanding of what the world of the private military industry is actually like.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=T0gnDAAAQBAJ&dq=Mercenary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fishes of the Sea: The North Atlantic and Mediterranean","description":"This photographic and descriptive guide to the fish species that inhabit the North Atlantic and Mediterranean is unique in its emphasis on the appearance of marine fish in their natural habitats. It expands and recasts the Lythgoes' highly regarded first edition published two decades ago. In particular, all of the more than 200 color photographs are new, and most are accompanied by line drawings that emphasize distinctive traits. The fish are arranged by class, family, and species, and succinct descriptions give detailed information about anatomy, distribution, food, and breeding habits. Most of the photographs were taken underwater, providing valuable information on how the fish swims in nature, its true colors and pattern, and whether or not it is camouflaged against its natural background. The geographical area covered in the book includes the Atlantic coastal waters of the United States and Canada north of Chesapeake Bay; the Mediterranean; and from Gibraltar north to the Arctic, including all the coasts of Europe. John Lythgoe, a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Bristol, is an expert on the appearance and color of fish underwater. The section of the book on the gobies, a group of fish that are as difficult to study as they are interesting, has been contributed by Peter J. Miller. Gillian Lythgoe is a diver, photographer, and the future and managing director of Planet Earth Pictures, whose collection covers a wide range of natural history and environmental subjects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tlHbwAEACAAJ&dq=Fishes+of+the+Sea:+The+North+Atlantic+and+Mediterranean&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Avengers: Under Siege","description":"Home are the heroes, but the villains are waiting for them!

The preachers are highly recognizable and respected individuals who serve as trusted and wise guides for discerning a ministry vocation, including Fred Craddock, Walter Brueggemann, Tom Long, Barbara Brown Taylor, Brad Braxton, and Jeremiah Wright.

No single place was more symbolic of this initial encounter than Hawaii, the target of the first unforgettable Japanese attack on American forces, and, as the forward base and staging area for all military operations in the Pacific, the  first strange place  for close to a million soldiers, sailors, and marines on their way to the horrors of war. But as Beth Bailey and David Farber show in this evocative and timely book, Hawaii was also the first strange place on another kind of journey, toward the new American society that began to emerge in the postwar era. Unlike the largely rigid and static social order of prewar America, this was to be a highly mobile and volatile society of mixed racial and cultural influences, one above all in which women and minorities would increasingly demand and receive equal status. With consummate skill and sensitivity, Bailey and Farber show how these unprecedented changes were tested and explored in the highly charged environment of wartime Hawaii. Most of the hundreds of thousands of men and women whom war brought to Hawaii were expecting a Hollywood image of  paradise.  What they found instead was vastly different: a complex crucible in which radically diverse elements  social, racial, sexual  were mingled and transmuted in the heat and strain of war. Drawing on the rich and largely untapped reservoir of documents, diaries, memoirs, and interviews with men and women who were there, the authors vividly recreate the dense, lush, atmosphere of wartime Hawaii  an atmosphere that combined the familiar and exotic in a mixture that prefigured the special strangeness of American society today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eWXxJ6t3dVQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Greatest Player Who Never Lived","description":"When Charley Hunter goes to work as a summer intern at a prestigious Atlanta law firm, he has no idea that his passion for golf will come into play on the job.

A Guide to the Four Temperaments : Choleric, Sanguine, Phlegmatic, Melancholic","description":"How can we better understand ourselves and others? The classical concept of the four temperaments - the four personality types characterized as the fiery choleric, the airy sanguine, the watery phlegmatic and the earthy melancholic - has been revered by many significant thinkers over the ages. In a refreshing treatment Dr Childs demonstrates how this ancient doctrine remains relevant to the present day. He shows us how we can recognize the temperaments in our fellow human beings as well as in ourselves, and how to understand their workings. A comprehension of their influence can boost personal development, as well as help improve interpersonal relationships. Conversational in tone and easily digestible, this book features fascinating discussions of the relationships between adults of various temperaments. Childs reviews matters of compatibility in partnership, family and workplace situations, liberally spicing his commentary with amusing examples of likely scenarios. He investigates the origins and manifestations of the temperaments in both their psychological and physiological aspects. There is also a section on the temperaments of children, with helpful and practical advice on dealing with individual issues. DR GILBERT CHILDS attended the Steiner teacher training course at Michael Hall after war service. He later studied at four universities, his doctoral thesis being entitled 'Steiner Education as Historical Necessity'. After teaching at State and Steiner schools he spent twenty years as a tutor in a further education college for severely physically disabled students. He is, in retirement, a full-time author and keen gardener.

Dr. Lowen points out that lack of energy is the result of chronic muscular tensions, a condition caused by the suppression of feelings. These tensions can be dissolved through the direct body work in bioenergetic exercise, which restores the potential for living a rich, full life.

It was called this because Jesus Christ's advent, life, death, and resurrection did not focus upon theology as such or doctrines as such or upon achieving warm, fuzzy feelings as such. Jesus's teachings and life were all focused upon a way of life. A way of life focused upon a relationship with God, and a way of life focused upon our relationships with our fellow men and women. Jesus shined a spotlight on how we are to live yearly, weekly, daily, act by act, step by step, decision by decision under the watchful eyes of a gracious, loving God who knows us and calls us by name. Even Jesus's death and resurrection were pointers revealing the way, the way of the journey we will all take one day. This small book is called The Way because it focuses, as Jesus did, upon the how-tos needed to cope with an increasingly irreligious, if not anti-Christian culture. How do I deal with fear? How do I deal with my guilt? How do I? From my observation and experience, these are the questions in the mind of the man or woman in the pew. There are ways. There is a way. They were pioneered for us by Jesus. He and his way is The Way.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_WYuEAAAQBAJ&dq=Faces+of+Faith:+Powerful+Truths+for+Victorious+Living&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kodansha's Furigana English-Japanese Dictionary","description":"A comprehensive, communicative, and practical guide to using Japanese, Kodansha's Furigana Japanese Dictionary is an invaluable tool for anyone with an interest in the Japanese language. It has been edited with the needs of English-speaking users in mind, whether students, teachers, business people, or casual linguists, and special care has been taken at each stage of its compilation including the selection of entry words and their equivalents, the wording of the detailed explanations of Japanese words, the choice of example sentences, and even its functional page design to maximize its usefulness. What is furigana and why is it so important? Furigana refers to the small kana that are printed above or alongside kanji to show their pronunciation. With furigana superscripts, the beginner who is familiar with hiragana and katakana is able to read even the most difficult and obscure kanji at a glance. Other dictionaries either provide little or no guide to kanji readings or romanize some or all of the Japanese words and sentences. In the past, romanized dictionaries were of some value to students using textbooks that contained no Japanese script. Now, however, an increasing number of influential curricula around the world are based on a rationale and methodology that demands the introduction of hiragana and katakana from the earliest stages. Learners and their teachers using such curricula will inevitably feel more comfortable with a dictionary such as Kodansha s Furigana Japanese Dictionary, one that shows the pronunciation of kanji with a familiar and authentic kana script. Combining Kodansha's Furigana Japanese-English Dictionary (1995) and Kodansha's Furigana English-Japanese Dictionary (1996) in one portable. affordable, and user-friendly volume, this dictionary has the following unique features: ? A basic vocabulary of 30,000 entries covers the most frequently used English and Japanese words ? Special treatment has been given to hundreds of words, names, and phrases of special relevance to English-speaking students of Japanese ? Semantic and usage differences between Japanese words and expressions are explained in clear English ? Thousands of example sentences and phrases illustrate how Japanese words are used in context ?

While there is no cure for Sjogren's, much can be done to alleviate the suffering of patients. This extensively revised handbook offers everything you need to know to cope with this disease. The New Sjogren's Syndrome Handbook, Third Edition is a comprehensive and authoritative guide, produced by the Sjogren's Syndrome Foundation and its medical advisors and edited by physician Daniel J. Wallace, a leading authority on auto-immune disorders. This expanded edition provides readers with the best medical and practical information on this disorder, bringing together the current thinking about Sjogren's in an easily readable and understandable book. The handbook illuminates the major clinical aspects of the syndrome and is loaded with practical tips and advice to assist those seeking information. Indeed, it offers a wide-ranging look at the many faces of Sjogren's, covering diagnosis, the various organ systems that can be affected, the possible psychological problems, and the many treatment options, as well as an appendix listing the resources available for patients with the disease. It is a valuable aid that patients can use while discussing their illness with their physician and an excellent resource for family members. And because Sjogren's is greatly underdiagnosed, this handbook is a particularly valuable resource for healthcare professionals.

Deleuze and Geophilosophy is thoroughly pragmatic: it asks not what the earth means, but how it works. It provides a common conceptual framework within which physical and human geographers can work together alongside other social scientists, cultural studies practitioners, and philosophers ininterdisciplinary teams to explore the entangled flows, lines, grids, and spaces of our world.

Hij zal waarschijnlijk ook een van de eersten zijn om daar te sterven. Nadat een zandstorm hem bijna fataal wordt en de overige bemanning, die ervan overtuigd is dat hij is omgekomen, zich gedwongen ziet de planeet te verlaten, bevindt Watney zich miljoenen kilometers van de rest van de mensheid verwijderd. Hij heeft geen enkele mogelijkheid om een signaal naar de aarde te versturen en zelfs als dat wel mogelijk zou zijn, zouden zijn voorraden opraken lang voordat een reddingsmissie hem zou kunnen bereiken.

De dreiging van het defecte materieel, de vijandige omgeving op Mars of een simpele menselijke fout, kunnen hem eerder fataal worden. Maar Watney vertikt het op te geven.

It adds the missing face to the man that managed to stay in the shadows for over forty years. When the self-proclaimed sorcerer slips into Gaby Geuter's life, she suddenly believes herself to be at the gateway of knowledge. Tentatively she follows a trail of magical breadcrumbs that begins in private classes and public seminars, but eventually leads her to tracking the master to his home. In a twist of irony the teacher becomes the subject of his own teachings and Gaby the unintentional witness to the last years of Castaneda's life. In the sobering months of his inglorious end, the author discovers that all along, the answers to her lifelong search were inside of her.

Pioneer life in the 1850s was extremely difficult for the pioneers, food was scarce, work was hard, and marauding Indians keep everyone on constant alert. With the promise of great adventure and a better life 11-year-old Nick Wilson ran away from home with an Indian who had befriended him. The mother of Chief Washakie, a prominent Shoshone chief, had lost her youngest son in an avalanche. She readily adopted the white boy as her own. Nick spent the next two years with the Shoshone learning their language and culture and developing the skills of a hunter. He participated in buffalo hunts, fought off grizzly bears, witness large scale Indian wars, and even survived being shot in the head with an arrow and left to die. Later he became a trapper, was one of the original Pony Express riders, worked as an overland stagecoach driver, and served as an army scout and interpreter. He was often called to track down and negotiate peace with renegade Indians who had fled the reservation and threatened war. He found himself in danger numerous times and participated in many skirmishes with both Indians and outlaws. Growing up among the Shoshones taught him the skills he needed to survive the rough and wild west.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sPGzDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang","description":"The Sumner family can read the signs: the droughts and floods, the blighted crops, the shortages, the rampant diseases and plagues, and, above all, the increasing sterility all point to one thing.

Villa considers how the Socratic idea of the thinking citizen is treated by five of the most influential political thinkers of the past two centuries--John Stuart Mill, Friedrich Nietzsche, Max Weber, Hannah Arendt, and Leo Strauss. In doing so, he not only deepens our understanding of these thinkers' work and of modern ideas of citizenship, he also shows how the fragile Socratic idea of citizenship has been lost through a persistent devaluation of independent thought and action in public life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jZHsDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Socratic+Citizen&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The concise encyclopedia of Western philosophy and philosophers","description":"On its first appearance in 1960, J.O.

Its contributors included many of the leading philosophers of the English-speaking world: Ryle, Hare, Strawson, Ayer, Dummett, Williams and many others. They wrote with an authority and individuality which made the Encyclopedia into a lively and engaging introduction to philosophy as well as a convenient reference work.

The additions take account of recent developments in philosophy, of literary, historical and political issues in philosophy, and of developments in continental thought, including in Marxism, psychoanalysis, phenomenology, existentialism, structuralism, post-structuralism and deconstruction.

We see how they rebrand themselves as saviours of the poor; how they lavishly reward \\"thought leaders\\" who redefine \\"change\\" in winner-friendly ways; and how they constantly seek to do more good, but never less harm. But why should our gravest problems be solved by the unelected upper crust instead of the public institutions it erodes by lobbying and dodging taxes? Rather than rely on scraps from the winners, Giridharadas argues that we must take on the gruelling democratic work of building more robust, egalitarian institutions.

But as Garret Keizer illustrates in this probing examination, noise is as much about what we want as about what we seek to avoid. It has been a byproduct of human striving since ancient times even as it has become a significant cause of disease in our own. At heart, noise provides a key for understanding some of our most pressing issues, from social inequality to climate change. In a journey that leads us from the Tanzanian veldt to the streets of New York, Keizer deftly explores the political ramifications of noise, America's central role in a loud world, and the environmental sustainability of a quieter one. The result is a deeply satisfying book -- one guaranteed to change how we hear the world, and how we measure our own personal volume within it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yZ44DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Minnesota","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8z9rwfhWDBYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Harding's luck,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vWtmDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prudence","description":"A haunting and unforgettable novel about love, loss, race, and desire in World War IIera America. On a sweltering day in August 1942, Frankie Washburn returns to his family s rustic Minnesota resort for one last visit before he joins the war as a bombardier, headed for the darkened skies over Europe. Awaiting him at the Pines are those he s about to leave behind: his hovering mother; the distant father to whom he s been a disappointment; the Indian caretaker who s been more of a father to him than his own; and Billy, the childhood friend who over the years has become something much more intimate. But before the homecoming can be celebrated, the search for a German soldier, escaped from the POW camp across the river, explodes in a shocking act of violence, with consequences that will reverberate years into the future for all of them and that will shape how each of them makes sense of their lives. With Prudence, Treuer delivers his most ambitious and captivating novel yet. Powerful and wholly original, it s a story of desire and loss and the search for connection in a riven world; of race and class in a supposedly more innocent era. Most profoundly, it s about the secrets we choose to keep, the ones we can t help but tell, and who and how we re allowed to love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vdr-AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Courage To Be","description":" Marie Kondo, but for your brain.

These parameters differ from traditional parameters such as the power factor, power transfer efficiency, ripple factor, and total harmonic distortion. These new parameters result in the definition of new mathematical modeling: ? A zero-order-hold (ZOH) is used to simulate all AC/DC rectifiers. ? A first-order-hold (FOH) is used to simulate all DC/AC inverters. ? A second-order-hold (SOH) is used to simulate all DC/DC converters. ?

This new, enhanced leather-bound edition collects the legendary fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm. They are the stories we've known since we were children. Rapunzel. Hansel and Gretel. Cinderella. Sleeping Beauty. But the works originally collected by the Brothers Grimm in the early 1800s are not necessarily the versions we heard before bedtime. They're darker and often don't end very happily--but they're often far more interesting. This elegant edition of Grimm's Complete Fairy Tales includes all our cherished favorites--Snow White, Rumpelstiltskin, Little Red Cap, and many more--in their original versions. With specially designed end papers, a genuine leather cover, and other enhancements, it's the perfect gift for anyone looking to build a complete home library.

From the romantics through the impressionists and post-impressionists, the brushstroke bespoke autonomous artistic individuality and freedom from convention. Yet the question of how much we can credit to the individual brushstroke is complicated and in Brushstroke and Emergence, James D. Herbert uses that question as a starting point for an extended essay that draws on philosophy of mind, the science of emergence, and art history. Brushstrokes, he reminds us, are as much creatures of habit and embodied experience as they are of intent. When they gather in great numbers they take on a life of their own, out of which emerge complexity and meaning. Analyzing ten paintings by Courbet, Manet, C zanne, Monet, Seurat, and Picasso, Herbert exposes vital relationships between intention and habit, the singular and the complex. In doing so, he uncovers a space worthy of historical and aesthetic analysis between the brushstroke and the self.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bZV1CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Formal Semantics of Programming Languages: An Introduction (Foundations of Computing)","description":"The Formal Semantics of Programming Languages provides the basic mathematical techniques necessary for those who are beginning a study of the semantics and logics of programming languages. These techniques will allow students to invent, formalize, and justify rules with which to reason about a variety of programming languages. Although the treatment is elementary, several of the topics covered are drawn from recent research, including the vital area of concurency. The book contains many exercises ranging from simple to miniprojects.Starting with basic set theory, structural operational semantics is introduced as a way to define the meaning of programming languages along with associated proof techniques. Denotational and axiomatic semantics are illustrated on a simple language of while-programs, and fall proofs are given of the equivalence of the operational and denotational semantics and soundness and relative completeness of the axiomatic semantics. A proof of Godel's incompleteness theorem, which emphasizes the impossibility of achieving a fully complete axiomatic semantics, is included. It is supported by an appendix providing an introduction to the theory of computability based on while-programs. Following a presentation of domain theory, the semantics and methods of proof for several functional languages are treated. The simplest language is that of recursion equations with both call-by-value and call-by-name evaluation. This work is extended to lan guages with higher and recursive types, including a treatment of the eager and lazy lambda-calculi. Throughout, the relationship between denotational and operational semantics is stressed, and the proofs of the correspondence between the operation and denotational semantics are provided. The treatment of recursive types - one of the more advanced parts of the book - relies on the use of information systems to represent domains. The book concludes with a chapter on parallel programming languages, accompanied by a discussion of methods for specifying and verifying nondeterministic and parallel programs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JzUNn6uUxm0C&dq=The+Formal+Semantics+of+Programming+Languages:+An+Introduction+(Foundations+of+Computing)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Admission Accomplished : The Lesbian Nation Years, 1970-75 (High Risk Books)","description":"In the 1970s, Jill Johnston established herself as one of the most vital and original thinkers of her time.

Kennedy, his murder continues to haunt the American psyche and stands as a turning point in our nation s history. The Warren Commission rushed out its report in 1964, but questions continue to linger: Was there a conspiracy? Was there a coup at the highest levels of government? On March 1, 1967, New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison shocked the world by arresting local businessman Clay Shaw for conspiracy to murder the president. His alleged co-conspirator, David Ferrie, had been found dead a few days before. Garrison charged that elements of the United States government, in particular the CIA, were behind the crime. From the beginning, his probe was virulently attacked in the media and violently denounced from Washington. His office was infiltrated and sabotaged, and witnesses disappeared and died strangely. Eventually, Shaw was acquitted after the briefest of jury deliberation and the only prosecution ever brought for the murder of President Kennedy was over. Returning to print for the first time in years, On the Trail of the Assassins the primary source material for Oliver Stone s hit film JFK is Garrison s own account of his investigations into the background of Lee Harvey Oswald and the assassination of President Kennedy, and his prosecution of Clay Shaw in the trial that followed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rR_PwAEACAAJ&dq=On+the+Trail+of+the+Assassins&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Joseph: Beyond the Coat of Many Colors (Following God Character Series)","description":"As a sergeant in the United States Marine Corps, it was my sworn duty to guide, teach, and protect those who served in subordinate positions. In this role, it was critical to provide clear and concise information so that those who trusted my leadership would not be ignorant to the mission or threats. The apostle Paul gives a clear warning to Christian believers pertaining to the gifts of the Spirit: \\"I would not have you be ignorant.\\" His first-century warning is quite relevant in this twenty-first century, where doctrinal literacy is lacking and knowledge of the Holy Ghost obtained through the Word of God and experience has been replaced with choreographed programs. Without clear and concise teaching, the warrior in Christ is left with a butter knife rather than a sword to cut through the traditions, customs, and church politics that leave a believer paralyzed in ignorance. The Gifts of the Spirit and the Characteristics of Those Who Have Them is a book written to be a field infantry manual for the believer that is clear and concise. It provides the believer with definitions of the gifts of the Spirit and examples of how they operated both in the first-century church and this present age. Lastly, this book will provide the believer with the information needed to examine oneself and answer the question \\"What gift do I have?\\" This is done by describing the effect the gift has on a believer's character and behavior while operating in and out of the church.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GncuEAAAQBAJ&dq=Joseph:+Beyond+the+Coat+of+Many+Colors+(Following+God+Character+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life of Joseph F.

Following the arrival of the railroad in the early 1880's, the Laguna quickly became the nation's leading cotton-producing area, as well as a regional center for manufacturing, mining and smelting, and rubber refining. By 1910 it boasted the fastest growing city in Mexico, and the largest foreign population outside of Mexico City.

Michael Leyton's arguments about the nature of perception and cognition are fascinating, exciting, and sure to be controversial. In this investigation of the psychological relationship between shape and time, Leyton argues compellingly that shape is used by the mind to recover the past and as such it forms a basis for memory. He elaborates a system of rules by which the conversion to memory takes place and presents a number of detailed case studies--in perception, linguistics, art, and even political subjugation--that support these rules. Leyton observes that the mind assigns to any shape a causal history explaining how the shape was formed. We cannot help but perceive a deformed can as a dented can. Moreover, by reducing the study of shape to the study of symmetry, he shows that symmetry is crucial to our everyday cognitive processing. Symmetry is the means by which shape is converted into memory. Perception is usually regarded as the recovery of the spatial layout of the environment. Leyton, however, shows that perception is fundamentally the extraction of time from shape. In doing so, he is able to reduce the several areas of computational vision purely to symmetry principles. Examining grammar in linguistics, he argues that a sentence is psychologically represented as a piece of causal history, an archeological relic disinterred by the listener so that the sentence reveals the past. Again through a detailed analysis of art he shows that what the viewer takes to be the experience of a painting is in fact the extraction of time from the shapes of the painting. Finally he highlights crucial aspects of the mind's attempt to recover time in examples of political subjugation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=v-w69ttA2RMC&dq=Symmetry,+Causality,+Mind+(Bradford+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Freedom From Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Personalized Recovery Program For Living With Uncertainty","description":"Nearly six million Americans suffer from the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder, which can manifest itself in many ways: paralyzing fear of contamination; unmanageable  checking  rituals; excessive concern with order, symmetry, and counting; and others.

Although all three were determined, fearless and strong-minded females, each represented a contrasting viewpoint of the conflict. Lady Sarah Wilson, youngest daughter of the 7th Duke of Marlborough and aunt to the young Winston Churchill, was a conventional British 'Jingo'; happy to act as Baden-Powell's leading lady in the stirring imperial drama of the siege of Mafeking. Hansie van Warmelo was a staunchly republican Boer, dedicated to the cause of Boer independence and no less convinced of the serf-life status of black people within her country. Most admirable of all was Emily Hobhouse, the liberal, pro-Boer Englishwoman who bravely exposed the shocking neglect, mismanagement and appalling death toll in the British concentration camps. Set against the tumult and tragedy of the war, the adventures of these three troublesome women -- 'that bloody woman', Lord Kitchener called one of them -- throw a fresh light on the bitter colonial struggle. Their exploits, ranging from the farcical to the deeply moving, played no small part in the controversies which reverberate in South Africa to this day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=b3q0tAEACAAJ&dq=Those+Bloody+Women:+Three+Heroines+of+the+Boer+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Embrace of Spirit: A Woman's View of Mind - Body Healing","description":"With a complex range of chronic illnesses identified as national health priorities in Australia and New Zealand, nurses and health professionals are increasingly caring for people with chronic disease and disability across a variety of care settings.

In investigating the interplay of translation and the Americas as a geopolitical site, Guzm n Mart nez unpacks the complex tensions that arise in these  spaces of translation  as embodied in the output of influential publishing houses and periodicals during this time period, looking at translation as both a concept and a set of narrative practices. An exploration of these spaces not only allows for an in-depth analysis of the role of translation in these institutions themselves but also provides a lens through which to uncover linguistic plurality and hybridity past borders of seemingly monolingual ideologies. A concluding chapter looks ahead to the ways in which strategic and critical uses of translation can continue to build on these efforts and contribute toward decolonial narrative practices in translation and enhance cultural production in the Americas in the future. This book will be of particular interest to scholars in translation studies, Latin American studies, and comparative literature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jC_sDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bytes of Bits: Getting Started in Computer Science","description":"Create high-tech walking, talking, and thinking robots \\"McComb hasn t missed a beat.

A diverse range of global scholars music theorists, musicologists, pedagogues, neuroscientists, and psychologists address the implications of music in everyday life while broadening the range of topics in music cognition research, deliberately seeking connections with the kinds of music and musical experiences that are meaningful to the population at large but are often overlooked in the study of music cognition.

Steeds weer blijkt dat we totaal niet toegerust zijn om vreemden open en onbevooroordeeld tegemoet te treden. We schatten mensen verkeerd in, herkennen leugens vaker niet dan wel, interpreteren gezichtsuitdrukkingen niet goed en blijven hangen in onze eerste indruk. En de conflicten en het onbegrip die daar het gevolg van zijn, hebben een diepgaand effect op onszelf en op de hele maatschappij.

How far would you go to uncover the truth? One spring night in 1998 the beautiful Cressida Strauss plunges from a fourth-floor balcony at the Lyc e Internationale Suisse with catastrophic consequences. Loath to draw negative publicity to the school, a bastion of European wealth and glamour, officials quickly dismiss the incident as an accident, but questions remain: Was it a suicide attempt? Or was Cressida pushed? It was no secret that she had a selfish streak and had earned as many enemies as allies in her tenure at the school. For her best friend, scholarship student Kersti Kuusk, the lingering questions surrounding Cressida's fall continue to nag long after she leaves the Lyc e. Kersti marries and becomes a bestselling writer, but never stops wondering about Cressida's obsession with the Helvetian Society a secret club banned years before their arrival at the school and a pair of its members who were expelled. When Kersti is invited as a guest to the Lyc e's 100th Anniversary, she begins probing the cover-up, unearthing a frightening underbelly of lies and abuse at the prestigious establishment.

But with the 1950s came television sets and prosperity enabled more people to afford them. Radio began a decline. This work examines what could be called the final decade of AM network radio and the many factors that contributed to its decline. The first chapter is an overview of AM radio in the 1950s. The second chapter covers 1950 through 1953, when radio was still a popular medium but faced a need to make changes in its programming. Bill Paley and David Sarnoff strongly promoted radio in those years and the networks attempted to increase the ratings of their programs. Chapter three covers 1954 through 1956, three years in which radio experienced losses of its primary audience and some of its most popular shows (because of the pullout of advertisers), and an effort was made by the networks to keep their programs going and to convince audiences the medium was not on its way out. Chapter four, 1957 through 1960, chronicles the  end  of AM radio in homes, the cancellation of almost all remaining programs, network affiliates  going independent, and the rise in popularity of  drive time  radio. Chapter five covers 1961 to the present and summarizes the major changes that have taken place.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gy6SCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Build the Ocean Pointer: A Strip-Built 19'6\\" Outboard Skiff","description":"David Stimson grew up on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and learned boatbuilding while working in the local boatyards.

Successor to the Vampire, the Venom was also produced in a two-seat night fighter version, which was developed into the Sea Venom for the Royal Navy. With the co-operation and assistance of many former Service and civilian pilots, the record can finally be set straight in what is the definitive history of this ground-attack, all weather and naval strike fighter. The problems of the trials and development program are discussed, followed by a detailed look at the aircraft's operational service with foreign air forces. The book's tour de force is the comprehensive account of Venom operations during the Suez campaign, the 'Firedog' operations in Malaya, and the protracted anti-terrorist offensive in Aden and Oman. These chapters throw new light on the conflicts and have been compiled from interviews, private papers, and personal accounts. Of particular interest is new information relating to the Sea Venom's career with the Fleet Air Arm.

De hofdame vertelt het verhaal van het bijzondere leven van Anne Glenconner, maid of honour tijdens de kroning van koningin Elizabeth en de hofdame van prinses Margaret. Ze is een unieke getuige van de recente Britse koninklijke geschiedenis en geeft in haar memoires niet alleen een kijkje achter de schermen van het koningshuis, maar schetst ook een beeld van een generatie aristocratische vrouwen die gevangen zat in een wereld vol sociale verwachtingen. Ze was voor haar vader een  grote teleurstelling  omdat ze geen jongen was en ze werd niet genoemd in het testament van haar eigen man, die zijn fortuin naliet aan een van zijn werknemers. Anne Glenconner, inmiddels achtentachtig jaar oud, schrijft in De hofdame met humor, openheid en moed over haar tragische leven in een gouden kooi, haar vriendschap met prinses Margaret en de vrijheid waarvan ze nu pas kan genieten.

The first, which comprises chapters 0 through 9, is a revised and somewhat enlarged version of the 1972 book Geometrie Differentielle. The second part, chapters 10 and 11, is an attempt to remedy the notorious absence in the original book of any treatment of surfaces in three-space, an omission all the more unforgivable in that surfaces are some of the most common geometrical objects, not only in mathematics but in many branches of physics. Geometrie Differentielle was based on a course I taught in Paris in 1969- 70 and again in 1970-71. In designing this course I was decisively influ enced by a conversation with Serge Lang, and I let myself be guided by three general ideas. First, to avoid making the statement and proof of Stokes' formula the climax of the course and running out of time before any of its applications could be discussed. Second, to illustrate each new notion with non-trivial examples, as soon as possible after its introduc tion. And finally, to familiarize geometry-oriented students with analysis and analysis-oriented students with geometry, at least in what concerns manifolds.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SFXSBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Glory Be to Mars","description":"The beginning two novels in the series were about the early years of the first human settlement on Mars, but you don''t have to read them to enjoy this latest stand-alone novel, in which a new desert fox is the pivotal character in a great war on Mars. In the first novel, As It Is On Mars, three courageous explorers, abandoned to die on Mars in 2038, found a fantastic but illegal settlement. In the second, stand-alone novel, Give Us This Mars, European and American \\"rescue\\" missions in 2048 compete to take over the fledgling settlement, which turns out to have resources worth trillions of dollars.The story in this third novel, Glory Be to Mars, takes place over a quarter century later, in 2074. It has a whole new set of lead characters, and enough of the early history of the settlement is included for new readers to join the tale effortlessly.By now, the illegal settlement has grown enormously, and a whole new generation born on Mars has grown up, thanks mainly to an amazing machine the Martians have developed, unlike anything the world has ever seen. Getting rid of this well-defended settlement is now a serious military matter. But, as the story opens, a United Nations coalition armada approaching Mars is intent on doing just that; it is so overwhelming a military force that nobody on Earth thinks the settlement has a chance.Coalition governments on Earth have terrified their citizens into believing that the Martians'' amazing machine is a horrible weapon of total annihilation, capable of eliminating all human life on Earth. The fabricated fear has had the desired effect, and decent people are supportive of the obscenely expensive armada to Mars. They will pay anything for an end to the dangerous, illegal settlement and its abominable machine.The armada is the brainchild of two cunning, scheming, aristocratic brothers, both born leaders, out for wealth, power, and prestige. They are also out to avenge their father''s disgraceful death on Mars, and erase a demeaning stain of dishonor that has sullied their ancient family name.One brother, Harold Derk, is the CEO of Condor Copper Inc., the world''s largest resource company, bent on taking a huge copper deposit from the Martians, worth over ten trillion dollars. Harold paid for the warmongering political leaders who engineered the armada.The other brother, four-star General Oliver Derk, is the armada commander. This rogue general has genocide in mind, and has the overwhelming military resources he needs to kill off all his Martian enemies.The armada''s arrival triggers a great war on Mars, and this is the story of those who fought in that war, particularly a young man the war makes into a legend: the desert fox of Mars.The story opens with a small Martian work crew, far from home. They have just finished hiding the infamous Martian machine, to keep it out of the hands of approaching coalition forces. That evening, the Martian work crew makes a fluke discovery. Coalition forces have secretly arrived, unexpected early, obviously planning a surprise attack on the settlement. The workers now have to get home at once, to warn the settlement of the danger. They take an impossible short cut, up along the treacherous thirty-mile long Hell Ridge, which climbs up to a four-mile high plateau they must cross to get home.But then, in Chapter Two, disaster. Not long after, a deadly enemy of the coalition appears out of the southern waste, at the head of a dusty column of tanks, his predator drones flying overhead. It is Edward Russell, a young man with desert warfare in his genes. He is soon to be known as the desert fox of Mars, feared and revered on two planets.Two women are a major part of the story, both in love with Edward, and engaged in their own private war over which of them will have him. A religious American President is also involved. He is an enemy of the big resource companies, but is boxed in by the cunning Derk brothers, and left with no choice but to fight a war he has no heart for. There is a sly, psychotic hit man in the story too. He is an essential part of General Derk''s genocidal plan to kill every single Martian, and his first contract will be to arrange for an American war correspondent to have an accident: Americans must not know what is being done on Mars in their name.These characters, and many more, walk the pages of this powerful, fast-paced tale of war, malice, ambition, love, and treachery, in a story that takes the reader along on the tank columns of the desert fox, to witness his daring exploits in a war that transforms the western hemisphere of Mars into a gigantic military chessboard.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mWNWAAAACAAJ&dq=Glory+Be+to+Mars&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE LOST STRING QUARTET","description":"On the way to a concert on the far side of the mountain, the members of the Daffodil String Quartet make a disastrous wrong turn in their small Italian car.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XqYVAQAACAAJ&dq=THE+LOST+STRING+QUARTET&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buy Jupiter and Other Stories","description":"Twenty-four tales set in diverse locations are accompanied by critical and autobiographical commentary","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=EkhaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Buy+Jupiter+and+Other+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deleuze and Philosophy: The Difference Engineer (Warwick Studies in European Philosophy)","description":"The work of Gilles Deleuze has had an impact far beyond philosophy. He is among Foucault and Derrida as one of the most cited of all contemporary French thinkers. Never a student 'of' philosophy, Deleuze was always philosophical and many influential poststructuralist and postmodernist texts can be traced to his celebrated resurrection of Nietzsche against Hegel in his Nietzsche and Philosophy, from which this collection draws its title. This searching new collection considers Deleuze's relation to the philosophical tradition and beyond to the future of philosophy, science and technology. In addition to considering Deleuze's imaginative readings of classic figures such as Spinoza and Kant, the essays also point to the meaning of Deleuze on 'monstrous' and machinic thinking, on philosophy and engineering, on philosophy and biology, on modern painting and literature. Deleuze and Philosophy continues the spirit of experimentation and invention that features in Deleuze's work and will appeal to those studying across philosophy, social theory, literature and cultural studies who themselves are seeking new paradigms of thought.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J5OFAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Webster's American Family Dictionary","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fRlwAAAACAAJ&dq=Webster%27s+American+Family+Dictionary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Spectrum of Voices: Prominent American Voice Teachers Discuss the Teaching of Singing","description":"A quick-and-handy reference for the studio teacher, this book can also serve as a text for vocal pedagogy courses and as a supplement for physiology and vocal mechanics, teachers and students of singing, music educators, and musical theatre performers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bRopXb3v48YC&dq=A+Spectrum+of+Voices:+Prominent+American+Voice+Teachers+Discuss+the+Teaching+of+Singing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Measuring History: Cases of State-Level Testing Across the United States (Research in Curriculum and Instruction)","description":"Measuring History complements the cases presented in Wise Social Studies Practices (Yeager & Davis, 2005). Yeager and Davis highlight the rich and ambitious teaching that can occur in the broad context of state-level testing. In this book, the chapter authors and I bring the particular state history tests more to the fore and examine how teachers are responding to them. At the heart of Measuring History are cases of classroom teachers in seven states (Florida, Kentucky, Michigan, New York, Texas, Mississippi, and Virginia) where new social studies standards and new, and generally high-stakes, state-level history tests are prominent. In these chapters, the authors describe and analyze the state s testing efforts and how those efforts are being interpreted in the context of classroom practice. The results both support and challenge prevailing views on the efficacy of testing as a vehicle for educational reform. Catherine Horn (University of Houston) and I lay the groundwork for the case studies through a set of introductory chapters that examine the current environment, the research literature, and the technical qualities of history tests.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6PgnDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Duck's Easter Surprise (Sparkling Egg Books)","description":"Little Duck is hoping that when the egg Mama Duck is sitting on finally hatches, its occupant will become her best friend, but she's in for a big surprise.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=isOrHAAACAAJ&dq=Little+Duck%27s+Easter+Surprise+(Sparkling+Egg+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vom Ursprung und Ziel der Geschichte","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YayfAAAAMAAJ&dq=Vom+Ursprung+und+Ziel+der+Geschichte&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chemistry;: A conceptual approach","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9C8GoQEACAAJ&dq=Chemistry%3B:+A+conceptual+approach&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buddha Facing the Wall: Interviews with American Zen Monks","description":"Buddha Facing the Wall presents firsthand accounts of life in an American Zen monastery.

One of the signal events of the twentieth century was Germany's effort to construct an empire in Europe modeled on the European experience outside Europe. The turn to European empire resulted less from the dynamics of capitalist expansion than from a deep crisis in global political and economic order. Confronted with the global economic and political power of the western allies, the Germans turned to Eastern Europe to construct a dependent space, tied to Germany as Central America was to the US. The First World War transformed how Germans thought about international order, empire and the nature of Romanians. The domestic consequences of Germany's eviction from global markets authorized deep interventions in Romanian society to establish a pre-eminent position for the German state inside Romania. David Hamlin embeds occupation and war aims in economic concerns.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3BssDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Origami Zoo: An Amazing Collection of Folded Paper Animals","description":"In Origami Zoo, two of the world's finest paper folders invite you to create your own menagerie with this exciting how to make origami animals book.

Maybe it's the creepy calliope music that tirelessly beckons visitors. Let's face it, an enigma that chooses Sunnydale nearly guarantees it's up to more than wholesome family entertainment. After a visit to the carnival's Hall of Mirrors, a once-shy pair of homely sophomore twins parades the halls of Sunnydale High like diva supermodels on a runway. Intuiting the twins' abrupt personality change as more than a self-confidence boost, Buffy -- joined by Angel, Giles, and the rest of the Scoobies -- decides to investigate the suspicious carnival firsthand. But soon it's apparent that the price of admission is higher than she imagined. Those who enter the carnival's attractions exit...changed. Each of the gang soon shows extreme displays of vice. Willow is wracked with envy. Cordelia's greed consumes her. Xander unleashes his gluttony. Angel reveals a lusty new persona. And a dark anger rises in Giles.
