It may be long, but once you finish a chapter you want to read the next. This story has a lot of adventure and great detail. It's about a Hobbit named Frodo. A Hobbit is a very short person who lives for a long time. Frodo gets a powerful ring that he needs to destroy. The ring can maked Frodo vanish in thin air. The reason Frodo wants to destroy the ring is because the Dark Lord wants to use its power for evil. Frodo goes on an adventure with his friends Merry, Pippen, and Sam. During the book new characters appear in each chapter. They pass through towns,villages, and end up fighting Lords, monsters, and the Dark Lords warriors. This is a really good book.

The answer to both questions is, OH MY GOSH, YES! The movie is about as good an interpretation of the book as anyone could've hoped for - but even so, they still had to leave out a ton of stuff to make it into a manageable movie. People who've never read the book will wonder who Tom Bombadil is. What makes reading the books so essential is that no movie can capture the actual LANGUAGE of the novel. Whereas the movie is about action set-pieces, the book is more about a quest - meeting new people and traveling imaginary lands. Reading the book will only increase your appreciation of the film - and reading it first will only make it even better...having Gandalf, Frodo, and Rivendell in your mind and then seeing them brought to life is well worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"chuck it away burn it most boring est book ever go buy yourself a decent book like George RR Martins Song Ice And Fire the its better than LOTR this crap"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book is quite boring and goes off on long tangents that have nothing to do with the plot of the whole story. It is like Tolkien started this set without any outline or idea where it was going. The next two books far surpass this one. It was a struggle for me to get through this book. Just because everyone is in love with Tolkien does not make this book good. I know he did not have the format modern writers do for their series but that still does not make this book good.

Granted it opened up many doors for the half hearted fantasy writing of today, it still used plane, boring and ohhhhh so long descriptions. What I don't understand is how JRR Tolkien could take a great idea about four young chaps (who happen to be midgets which kills alot of the drama for me) on a harrowing adventure to destory the ring that the evil one wants so he can take over middle-Earth. The whole book went through a phase of Duex Machinea where Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin where either saved by friendly hobbits, not so friendly hobbits, friendly Elves, not so friendly Elves, or friendly Men or not so friendly Men. Startaling trasitions from numbly simiple to madingly difficult dialog made the book jump from one pace to another. Tolkien didn't use mounting suspense through the book, but manic-depressive, spasmatic jumps. Putting a song in the middle of one of the few exciting scenes breaks the pace, and leaves the reader starting all over again, feeling bland. Altogether, the book was my least favorite \\"classic.\\""},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is the absolute worst book ever written. I still can't believe they killed off Frodo, the supposed star of the trilogy, within 175 pages. That's just ridiculous. Also, what's the deal with the zombies??? I re-read that section 3 times and I still didn't get it. Did they eat Gandalf or not? I still don't know. If you're looking for a confusing book filled with wordy descriptions of fish and the walking dead, you're in luck. Otherwise, you'd better find a new book. A great boook."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I'm very tolerable of boring books. I have a great passion for history and can slog through textbooks with the best of them. Indeed, i even got through the Simirallion without too much trouble. But history books are supposed to be boring, and they flatly detail things that happen in the past for the most part. However, in Lord of the Rings, things are supposed to be happening RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES and it's about as interesting as watching water slooooowwllllyyy slide down a wall.When pointing this out to LotR fanatics, and pointing out better fantasy writers, i'm generally greeted by \\"yeah, well Tolkien started it all\\"Claiming that the fantasy world is completly reliant on Tolkien is utter lunacy. A great deal of Tolkien's world was taken from myths and legends (especially norse ones) that have existed for centuries.Moving on, tolkiens world is very unrealistic in a great many ways. In Gondor, there is no high court, no scheming, and everyone seems perfectly happy to be ruled by a lunatic. This is a very poor reflection of both the medieval ages and mankind in general. In Rohan, there's a bit of dissent, but that's all do to Saruman, no one in Rohan can think for themselves. Everyone's dark side is motivated by the ring, but what about the inherent darkeness in everyone's nature. Tolkien should've researched psychology a bit more before writing characters. So there you have it, I challenge everyone to read this and cast aside any preconceived notions, and you will find that the \\"beloved classic\\" is hardly lovable"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is put under the genre 'fantasy' but it not only owns that it also rules 'sci-fi', 'adventure' 'action', and 'suspense'!

When I read this book I felt as if I was Frodo's companian and I felt strongly for the fellowship like when they felt sad I felt sad, they felt scared I was scared, etc., and I think he felt that when he wrote it, I'm never gonna know but I'll definitely beleive! His beggining was excellent it was commical and proved hobbits my be small outside but they're quite, quite I say the opposite on the inside.It is about a hobbit who inherits the deceiving Ring of Bilbo's (found in'The Hobbit')and is not at all aware that it contains more evil than 1,000,000 orcs put ta' together he doesn't realize that Saraun will do anything to get a hold of it and if he does well we don't wanna go there... but we might have to..."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read, and I've read a lot of books. The language in which Tolkien brings his message is beautiful. He truly makes the world of Middle-earth come to life. While some things may be confusing for first time readers of the Lord of the Rings, such as names and places, I would recommend it to fans and non-fans alike.I was not a fan of the Lord of the Rings until about a month ago. Before that, I thought the whole series was boring and stupid (thanks to the cartoon which defiles the books). Do not let such prejudices hold you back from experiencing this adventure. I suggest you buy it and find yourself in a whole new world!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"When J.R.R. Tolkien sat down to write these books, I doubt that he knew how great they really would be. When reading The Lord of the Rings, you are forced to escape into Middle-Earth for however long you wish to stay there. Unlike other fantasy tales that just don't seem real, this is oftentimes creepy in how it makes you forget where you are. It's almost as if you are the tenth member of the Company.I won't go into any detail about the plot, considering the success of tbe book and the recent movie, it's already a given. But I felt that I needed to say just this one thing:Our world is frightening, stressful and sometimes a bore. However, with Tolkien, you forget where you are and are part of something else, something amazing. 'The Lord of the Rings' is probably the best fiction story of all time. Though not my favorite book, I now understand why it is loved worldwide and why the tale of Bilbo and Frodo Baggins will never die.A rare gem amongst oftentimes disappointing works."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This review is for those who, like me, are not big sci-fi readers, who don't like reading classics just because they ARE classics, and who like to be entertained.I rate a book by two things: Does it paint a picture in my mind and make me feel like I'm watching the movie in my head while I'm reading? Can I put it down at night to go to sleep?If a book is too boring, or difficult to get through (like Tolkien's The Silmarillion) I start getting heavy-eyelid syndrome. Since I don't usually read to &quot;improve my mind&quot; but to be entertained, being put to sleep is not a good sign for me. This problem does not happen with the Lord of the Rings series!The Fellowship of the Ring and the rest of the series are some of the best books for drawing me into the story. In my mind, I can see the hobbits scrambling to keep up with the taller members of the group, I can hear the screams of the Nine, and I can feel the terror of Mordor.The vivid descriptions and characters are matched only by the incredible storyline. This is the kind of book that I'll be reading at 3 a.m. and think, &quot;I'll just read one more chapter and then I'll go to sleep.&quot; Or I'll be working on something that I have to do (like dishes, laundry, etc.) and think &quot;if I just do a little more of this I'll let myself read some more of the book!&quot;This book is strongly recommended to anyone who likes a good story, and who is not daunted by a long tale: sit down, relax, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I loathe some of the newer forms of literature just because they are so tame, I think that they have nothing compared to Tolkien's genius. His quick wit and serious situations make you want to keep going throughout the story. If you put it down for a few minutes you are literally craving to begin again. ]I saw the movie first because my fianc&eacute; pointed out that it would be worth my while. I had never taken the time to read these books before. I saw the movie and was awe struck.The book is full of fun adventures, interesting people, like Aragorn, Legolas, Frodo, and the famous Bilbo. I think if Leonard Nimoy would have read this book then istead of Bilbo being &quot;The greatest little hobbit of them all&quot; Frodo would have been talked about more.I liked the story, dialouge, and the vivid presentation of all the people, places, and things the fellowshop comes across. Spontaneous, sad, happy, and merry are only a few words that I could use to describe the story. All inspiring and fun Tolkien is a master of the Fantasy tale. I enjoyed this tale, continuing the saga is a must. It just isn't right any other way. READ THESE BOOKS! If you like fantasy, adventure, drama, and comedy rolled into one book!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This excellent fantasy trilogy paved the way for just about all fantasy books that we have today. Even if some people find Tolkien's writing style &quot;boring,&quot; if you can appreciate a great descriptive style that goes in-depth with everything, this is the book for you. As soon as I read this book, I was so caught up in Tolkien's world of Middle-Earth that I didn't really think that any other fantasy book could live up to this, and so far none have. Even though the movie was very good, in my opinion you couldn't get quite as much out of it if you had read the book. Anyone who appreciates great fantasy should read it. Even if you don't like it, you should recognize that many fantasy books written today are written after this great trilogy. This is a great adventure of good against evil, how some friends will stick by you forever and how some will someday let you down, and how so small a thing can cause such a huge struggle."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I first read this book when I was in the 8th grade in 1984.

These books got me into reading and it seems I haven't stopped. The Fellowship starts the journey and I enjoyed every step. Tolkien has a way with describing his world that you feel a part of it. As I re-read the book (in preparation for the Movie), I was transported to two places at once. I felt like I was back at Adams Junior High School in Tampa Florida and in Middle-Earth at the same time. I have just picked up Two Towers and am looking forward to continuing the journey.

Buying Tolkien's novels for people is a great gift because they read them over and over. I keep reading the series each year because it is that good. I also recommend reading this novel slowly, because the depth of his writing is amazing. If one reads slowly, and let Tolkien's words sink in, imagine what he describes, the reader will be taken to a magical place. Each time I read this novel, I notice something I didn't before, and it is always entertaining. I noticed this time that in the past, I read to quickly and did not allow myself to see the landscapes he paints.What happens. The book begins with a continuation of the Hobbit, and Bilbo's magic ring has been found to have a dark past. The Ring must be destroyed. But Bilbo passes the ring on before this is known, and the quest is thrust upon his heir, Frodo. Frodo leaves with his friends and meets elves and Tom Bombadil, before he reaches Rivendell. The movie leaves out some stuff. Once Frodo and the other hobbits make it to Rivendell they continue with five others. Their goal is to destroy the ring, but they must go to Mordor, and the road is long and tough. The novel ends with the fellowship being broken. Boromir's horn has not yet sounded."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I liked this book, even though it was not casual reading for me.

I often got lost in some of the less interesting passages and in some parts I found that I had basically no idea what was going on. Having seen the movie before I read the book, I had a vague idea of what should happen next, so I was able to finish the book pretty much satisfied. I'd recommend it because it's an interesting story, but if you do decide to give it a shot, don't underestimate this book--it WILL take a long time to read."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I hate to be one of the only ones who don't give it totally amazing ratings...I think Tolkien was GREAT in description, and bringing you into his little world of Middle-Earth. I read the Hobbit in elementary school many years ago. I also LOVE READING, and everyone and thier dog has always told me to try reading &quot;LORD OF THE RINGS.&quot; I gave it a try...I even bought nearly everything Tolkien has produced, and I must say, he is talented beyond many people dreams. I love his work...but far too often, as in this book...it had way too many boring dull parts that dragged on. He loves being extremely detail oriented and will go off for 10 pages at a time describing the scenery and exactly how some little bush looks. It does help to bring you into the fantasy and escape from life if that is what you are looking for, but the action (that you see on the movie) is all by-passed and you only see the AFTER-EFFECTS and rarely get details of combat or anything intense as the movie tries to depict. I must say the books are worth reading at least once, and even I own them all...but there are many pointless drawn out parts that never seem to end."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Imagine a story about love, betrayal, war, and heartbreaking victory and you have the science fiction book called The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. This outstanding book is part one of the series of The Lord of the Rings. The one ring that Frodo carries is the one ring that can destroy evil once and for all. So the urakies are trying to stop him from doing that so they could take over the world.Part one is about a little hobbit named Frodo Bagins. He is chosen to be the ring carrier. He is given a fellowship: a fine swordsmen Aragon; a skilled elf named Legolas (who does quick magic with a bow and arrow); Gimly, a master at an ax with power like a bear; and a wizard named Gandalf. The fellowship and the ring carrier are trying to bring the ring to the land of Mount Doom in order to destroy evil once and for all.They travel light and miss turns. They lose people and gain people. One day while the fellowship is trying to get the ring one step closer to Mount Doom, they stumble against some of the urakies and start to battle. Boramier, son of King John, was protecting two little hobbits: Merry and Peppy. The leader of the urakies shot one arrow at him and hit him, but he stood strong and still fought back. Then another one hit him, but he was still standing till the third one hit him. He fell on his knees and an urakie went up to him and tried to hit him in the head with an arrow. Then Aragon came and helped him and he killed the urakies, but Boramiers life was lost -- he was destined to die. Aragon made a promise to him that he would protect Frodo with his life and sword.I feel like this is the best book for people who have an imagination beyond the unthinkable. I admit I watched the movie first and I loved it. So I picked up the book and I started reading it. It ended up being the best book that I ever read. It took me to another world. So now get up and pick up The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and don't forget about the Two Towers and The Return of the King. They are miraculous books.~Jaime Guevara, Grade 8, Patrick Lyndon Pilot School, Boston, Massachusetts"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is the first part in the &quot;LOTR&quot; trilogy. Who hasen't read &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;? This book has movie art cover. But this still is a classic! So if you don't have this book, get it! Man this is great. Read it today!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"When Frodo Baggins accepts a mission to destroy an evil ring, he doesn't know what he is getting into. In this book, the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien, many things happen to the young Hobbit, Frodo. This was a well written book, and a wonderful story.In the book, The Fellowship of the Ring, there lived a hobbit (a small creature, looking much like a man, only smaller) named Frodo Baggins. Frodo's uncle, Bilbo, came across a ring on an adventure of his. This ring, as he later found out, was the ring of power, made in the fires of Mount Doom, by Sauran, the dark lord. The man who told Bilbo about this was a wizard named Gandalf the Grey. This wizard knew that this ring had to, and could only be, destroyed in the mountain in which it was conceived. For this task, Gandalf chose Frodo. When Frodo this mission, not knowing the danger of it, he set off to Mount Doom, along with three friends to destroy the ring. On the long quest there, he stopped at Rivendale, an elven fortress, and meets with Gandalf, and various known warriors. At this meeting, a fellowship was forged; it was called the Fellowship of the Ring. This Fellowship is to protect Frodo and the evil ring. Throughout this book, this group falls apart. Some die, some are captured, but some still survive.The Fellowship of the Ring was a very well written book. It is my opinion that this is, because it presents a higher level in a book that almost all age groups read. Also, it explained things with an obvious presence of higher writing. Some examples are, the book itself, it is an example because there are no weaknesses at all in this book. The book also is a great storyline for a book. I feel this way because it shows the struggle for good or evil.In The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien, Frodo Baggins goes on a dangerous quest to destroy evil for all eternity. Overall, this was a very good book. It had more than the necessary components to be called a, \\"good book\\". Unquestionably, this was an excellent book because it had a fun storyline and was extremely well written."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"In the book The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien, the One Ring of the Dark Lord is found; so a fellowship of nine people set out to destroy it. This book is very well written but a little confusing to understand.The main character, the Hobbit, Frodo Baggins, inherits the One Ring from his uncle Bilbo Baggins. In the book Gandalf the Grey, a wizard, discovers that the ring is that of the enemy. So Frodo sets out for the Elf city, Rivendell, with his best friend Samwise Gamgee and his two cousins Merry and Pippin. Along the way they meet the Aragorn, the Man, who helps them to get to their destination. In Rivendell the Elf Lord Elrond makes a fellowship of nine people consisting of the four hobbits, Gandalf, and Aragorn, with the new members, Gimli the Dwarf, Boromir the Man, and Legolas the Elf. They set off to destroy the Ring. Since this book is part one of the trilogy of The Lord of the Rings books, the rest of the story is continued in The Two Towers and The Return of the King. The characters struggle through many injuries and problems but somehow the manage to get through them.This book, although a little confusing to understand, is very well written. By \\"well written\\" I mean that it was very well thought-out and because Tolkien had a very big imagination he wrote a good story, for example he made up all the languages and places in the book. It also pulls you in making you think that you are there. The weaknesses are the book being a little confusing a pretty long. For example some of the words are hard to pronounce, like the names of people and places. Another example of it being confusing is it is a little hard to follow, you really have to pay attention to the book so you know what is going on. As long as you do this you can be sure to understand and enjoy this book.In conclusion this book was outstanding, probably the best book I've ever read. Tolkien is very imaginative and writes well. If you read this book I would recommend the other two books and the three movies that are based upon the book. If you've seen the movies I recommend the books to you. I think the best part about this book is when I finished it because I knew that there were always two more books to look forward to reading."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I recommend this book to anyone that enjoyed the movie Lord of the Rings. This book takes you back and tells you in detail how Bilbo found the ring. You will laugh, you will cry, and best of all you will fall in love with the wee little ones known as Hobbits."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Plain and simple, this is one of the greatest masterpieces of literature on the planet. No author has gone to so much work to creat a practical world, 5+ languages, histories of characters, and many maps for this world.Tolkien provides a thrilling story to read. Although the detail is often boring it is worth reading for the rest of the book is exciting and interesting. It also helps reading the book before the movie, you'll appreciate the movie alot more.Characters are so detailed and lovable (or hateable) that you love to read about them. Again the detail is worth it, it lets you believe you are in this created world and that it does truly exist.All in all, the book is in the top 10 of fantasy books written and should be in the top 50 of books of all time. Read it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I have read each and every one of J.R.R. Tolkiens LOTR trilogy including 'The Hobbit' at least 6 times and I am still not tired of them. They are classics! Some people say there's too much detail. I disagree but I like detail and I think it's the mark of a great author but I understand that some people just want to read the book and not have to listen to the author describe the bark on a tree for three pages (I'm exaggerating, he doesn't go into THAT much detail). These books are great, no language, nothing inappropriate at all. If you are looking for a good book to read on a rainy day I recommend LOTR. P.S If you want to see too much detail read 'Last of the Mohicans'."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I had never read the Rings trilogy. I liked The Hobbit when I read it years ago. I've never been a big fan of high fantasy (elves, dwarves, wizards), but this is the best. The world Tolkien creates is deep and amazing, and although the songs and poems get a bit tedious (especially when they're written in imaginary languages), I really got into the adventure of the characters. I read this right when I got back from Alaska and imagined the landscape to be much like that in Denali National Park."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is one book to enjoy. Tom Bambadil is the best! Tolkien creates interesting stories with classic creatures that most people have a slight background of information to, thus not wasting time on creating a new world of different names."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Everyone knows that the Lord of the Rings is a fantastic fantasy epic and a classic work of literature. It shows that genre writing does not have to be hack writing. Clearly if you want to get into the series you have to start with The Fellowship of the Rings. I do not think you can think of yourself as a true fantasy lover unless you have read or tired to read this book. It is not for everyone as it is very dense, but it is also just a great story with great characters."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"My husband doesn't get alot of time to read, the audiobooks are perfect and they keep him awake while driving...HUGE BONUS!!! Perfect for road trips or just your general busy life. You always have time for a CD, in the car, while cleaning the house or even on the treadmill.I really don't have much to say about this one in particular, (Who hasn't seen the movie)except it is better than the movie. No need to say more.Listen to it for your self....no excuses."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I bought The Hobbit for my 11-yo son at a school book fair. He plowed through it in no time and loved it so I decided to buy him the Lord of the Rings trilogy as a Christmas present. He can't get enough of these books. He read the first book and absolutely loved it. He's almost done with the second book. He (and I) would definitely recommend any of the Lord of the Rings series. If you like the fantasy type of books then these are a must-have for your collection."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Tolkien was a man beyond his years, he and Lewis (in my humble opinion) started the fantasy genre as we know it today.Fellowship is so much more than the movie (which I did like) but to read the books as Tolkien wrote them, in the order he wrote them is enchanting!This story didnt take a couple of weeks but years, a lifetime. There are many reluctant heroes, and many that once in a position to make a difference did. It is about friendship, honor and respect. Things the modern world has seem to forgotton.(FOR CHRISTIANS?)I hold a Doctorate in Christian Theology, and I have to say Tolkien knew what he was doing when writing. You are being ministered to...and dont even realize it. You come away from the story wanting more, craving it. Once you find the basis of his story....the Bible, and put the two together you see the kinsmenship. Middle Earth are like parables, take them as such and any doubt you may have about them will soon disapear.I will admit Fellowship is not the best of the four books (JUST my opinion) but that is not to say it does not blow away most modern books...because it was an absolute blessing to me, and an eye opener on who I wanted to be."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"If you were a little Halfling called a \\"Hobbit\\" and all of a sudden a ring of power and evil comes to you, what would you do? This book shows how two hobbits come together and gain many friends on their way to destroy the one ring in the fires of Mount Doom which lurks in the land of Mordor.The rings of power were crafted by the elves. Three rings for the Elvin lords under the sky. Seven for the Dwarf lords in their halls of stone. And nine, nine for the race of men who above all else desire power. But they were all of them deceived for one other ring was made. In the fires of Mount Doom, Souron the deceiver made one more ring in which he poured all of his cruelty in. with that all of Middle fell to his hand.But there were some who resisted. A last alliance of men and elves marched to the gates of Mordor and fought there. Then the King Isildur picked up his fathers shattered blade and cut the ring of Sourons hand. A thousand years later a creature named Gollum. There the ring stayed for a thousand years until the ring abandoned Gollum. But something happened that the ring did not see. It was picked up by a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. The ring was passed down to Frodo Baggins of the Shire. He will now set out on a journey to destroy the ring of power. Now it's up to you, do you think he will destroy the ring, or will he get captured?I thought this was a great book to read. It showed: respect, honor, courage, and friend ship.

It begins with a hobbit, the smallest creature in Middle Earth and it will end with the same hobbit, Frodo Baggins, nephew of Bilbo Baggins, of whom we read about in The Hobbit. This book is historic piece of literature with characters the develop well over the course of the storyline. How can the smallest creature change history? By resisting all that is evil, and even that may prove to be too much for Frodo of the Shire. J. R. R.

Listening to this unabridged rendition of the story added yet more insight into an amazing epic tale. Robert Inglis reads so very well, characterizing the voices enough to tell the difference between characters, but not overdoing. I also love that he actually sings the many songs in the book. He sings unaccompanied by music, just as the character in the story would, and the melodies fit the setting very well. When reading, I tended to skip the songs - especially the long ones. Hearing them as they would have been done by the characters added depth to the story that is missed in just reading. I would recommend this rendtion to anyone who loves Middle Earth and is looking for new ways to experience it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Bilbo Baggins has been living happily in his hobbit hole for many years with his magic ring. Suddenly, he gets the urge to go traveling again. He disappears in the middle of his 111th birthday party, leaving the ring to Frodo, a young hobbit he adopted. Gandalf the wizard comes and tells Frodo that the ring is evil, and he has to take it to Mount Doom to destroy it. Otherwise, the evil Sauron will take over the world. Frodo and his hobbit friends journey to a few places, then they go to the Council of Elrond, a meeting about the ring. It is decided that a few others will accompany Frodo to Mount Doom. There are nine of them in all, and they form the fellowship of the ring (hence the title). They have to encounter many hardships, and the end of the book isn't even the end. It leaves you hanging until you read the Two Towers.This was a very complex book. It started out really slow and boring. It took about ten minutes per page, and I had to re-read some of the pages to understand. But after Bilbo leaves, things start to get darker and scarier, and the plot moves faster. I felt so bad for Frodo because so many bad things happen to him, and he didn't even want the ring. It was a little slow, but very well written. If you don't like descriptions, then you may not like this. The page are filled with descriptions, but they don't bog the story down, they add to it. I thought it was an awesome book, and I wanted to start the sequel right away.*To understand the book better, read The Hobbit first.( By the way, the movie was great too. Go see it!)"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring, first in the LOTR trilogy and basis for the sensational movie, is a must read for anyone. In Fellowship, Tolkien begins to weave an intricate story, laying the foundation for a bold adventure. A seemingly ordinary member of an unnoticed race of hobbits is thrust into a quest that will determine the fate of everyone.For anyone who has read The Hobbit, Fellowship is much more sinister, complicated, and grand in scope. Over 400 pages, Fellowship contains a rich treasury of details of characters, thoughts, and conflicts that The Hobbit does not contain.For anyone who has seen the movie and is curious about reading Fellowship, do it! From the book one gets a much greater feel for the degree to which the Hobbits struggle just to make it to Rivendell. The movie leaves out fantastic characters like Tom Bombadil, a jolly, mysterious care-taker of the Old Forest who is the oldest known creature of Middle Earth.Also, if you're interested in history, you will love Fellowship of the Rings. Inspired by old European history, Tolkien creates his tales out of the myths and legends of what happened before mankind existed.I must, however, give one caveat: if you read Fellowship, you won't stop there. When you finish you'll be dying to read the rest of the series too!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Lord of the Rings is an outstanding work that has defined the field of heroic fantasy for two generations. I would recommend it to anyone who loves narrative sweep, an extraordinarily compelling world, and a master's use of the English language. Be warned, however, that it is one continuous story, published for practical reasons in three volumes. The Fellowship of the Ring is not complete in itself, and indeed, ends on an excruciating cliff-hanger. I guarantee, you will need to know what happens next. Once you know, this is no problem, as the other two volumes are very easily obtainable. This is one fantasy work that is never going to go out of print. Another book that follows in the steps of Tolkein is The Price of Immortality by C.M. Whitlock and it is a book that should be read at least once"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was without a doubt my 3rd fav. book ever, the 1st two places being occupied by the 2 LoTRings follow up's.

While written in humbler days, this book had and has the ability to impact you more than any modern day hyped up japanese video game can, even if it does carry the lable of \\"fantasy.\\" But inspite of all that, this type of book may not be for everyone. It's a book that, if you are not willing to put your trust in the author and where he is taking you, you can end up reading through it and never experiencing it.

Usually 5 star reviews are over the top and too much to actually trust. But on this occasion, I believe that the one star reveiws have missed the mark.Tolkien's works ARE extremely detailed in their nature. I agree that it slows the pace down drastically. But this isn't a quick little adventure that the characters are on. This is a long journey to save their lives, the homes, and their civilization. You can't expect to solve something so grand without writing it in a grand scale.As for those that have compared this work to an encyclopedia, it is. Look at all that Tolkien wrote about Middle-Earth. This is just one piece of the history. I, myself have yet to finish the Silmarillion do to it's extremely detailed presentation. Do I count that as a terrible book? No. Just detailed.For everyone that said the book was slow and too much, give it another chance sometime in the future. I too enjoy Terry Brooks's Shannara novels, but in my opinion those novels lack a certain amount of detail that Tolkien provides. Yes Mr. Brooks's novels are more action oriented but they lack a &quot;feel.&quot; A Tolkien novel gives me the &quot;feel&quot; of Middle-Earth. It makes that a reality. No other novel has that quality for me. Others are simply escapist fare.

He seeks the Ring he forged 2,000 years ago, holding within the small golden band the power to enslave the world. All he must do is find it. This is the precise situation that the people of Middle Earth had to go through in the Fellowship of the Ring the first book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This is one of the best books I have ever read. In this epic fantasy, the reader will experience breathtaking danger, overwhelming suspense, and beautifully created worlds.

R. R. Tolkien was born on January 3rd 1892. He grew up in Birmingham, England where he earned a place at King Edwards school. He then went to Oxford university to study languages. He eventually became a profess of anglo-saxon there in Oxford. Lord of the Rings was published in 1954.The first part, Fellowship of the Ring, was about a young hobbit who inherits a very powerful ring that changes his life greatly. His mind is opened to things that occur outside the peaceful life in the shire, his home. He has to change from a peaceful hobbit minding his own business into a courageous hero.The book was very entertaining. After seeing the movie, I wanted to read the book. The book offers many more details that were not in the movie. Many scenes that were in the movie are lengthened. Many events in the book aren't even mentioned in the movie. Even some new characters that aren't mentioned in the movie are in the book. However after seeing the movie, some parts of the book were portrayed in the movie were less interesting and hard to read through. That contributed to the length of time it took me to read the book.

Nothing changes in the book, at least hopefully. Most of the time artists try to make a living by remaking and selling the book. They change the cover of the book. I mean come on, the people at the copyright industries need to stop this, or else it will just keep on happening. WHATCH OUT J.K. Rowling, your Harry Potter series might be next. You should get a lot of your own books and keep them and sell them later. You need to do this because in years, artists will start taking advantage of this and give your prized books a new cover. One that you wern't there to see. If you hold on to some books they will be worth a great deal of money for the original book. The very first book with the same cover and same illistrater. You need to grasp what is yours and hold on to it.Well anyways, I need to tell you what this great novel is about.It startes off when a Hobbit ( almost like little migits ) find a ring. Acually it is one Hobbit. His name it Bilbo Baggins. He finds a ring of great power. When Bilbo puts on the ring it makes him invisible. But with great power comes great responsibility. Poor Bilbo i so cought up in the fun that he does not realize that a great evil is amoung this ring. See a great ruler of darkness and evil forged many great rings of great power. In these rings were the power to guide and rule each race. Three rings were given to Elves. Seven were given to the Dwarves. And nine rings were given to the race of men. All of the ring bearers were fooled by their greed and were blinded by the power of the great rings. For there was another ring made that they did not know of. In the land of The great ruler Sauron there was a mountain. It was Mount Doom and in the fires of Mount Doom he forged the 'one ring to rule them all'. It had the power to corrupt and decive all other great rings of power. One by one the rulers of Middle Earh ( where they live in ) fell to the power of The Ring. There was an alliance of men and elves and on the slopes of Mount Doom they fought. They fought to distroy the One Ring. The alliance almost won when Sauron took matters into his own hands. He distroyed hundreds of Elves and Men. At that moment the king of Men stood up. He fought a use less battle and lost his life for it. His son Isiliadur, heir to the throne of men took his fathers sword. From the blow of Sauron the sword was broken. And with all his might he gave one last slash. Isiliadur had missed . . . wait he hit him. He had sliced of all four of Saurons fingers. Sauron was defeated. Isiliadur took the ring and stood at the heart of Mount Doom. He had but one chance to cast it from which it came from, but he refused. Insted he decided it to be a token to the heir of the ruler of men. On the trip home, Isiliadur was bumbarded by a band of orcs and killed him. They then tossed him in a great river, the Anduin. Although they threw him in the Anduin, they were not aware of his great burden. For over two thousand years is sat and waited at the bottem of the great river of Anduin. Until the Ring was found. It has been found by a Hobbit. No, not Bilbo Baggins but some one else. His name was Gollum. He Brought it in a great range of mountains east of were the Hobbits lived,the Misty Mountains. The Ring gave Gollum a very unusually long life. In the deep caves of the Misty Mountain he sat there ever thinking about it. Until Bilbo Baggins came and found the One Ring and kept it, not knowing what is did or does. He then passed it on to his nefew, Frodo Baggins. He then had to find a way to vancwish this evil that poisened Middle Earth.Will he suceed, or not?"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"To this day, even the greatest find it difficult to match Tolkien. You can still feel the freshness and innovation that marked the beginning of his genre. Almost any reader will have to confess that there are tedious parts, but they enrich the storyline and add a depth possessed by few other worlds. The characters are alive and breathing. The humor is memorable and the friendships lasting. Tolkien describes everything, giving the world a feeling of reality. Modern day fantasy sometimes gives the impression of being a movie or TV show. There's nothing but exciting parts and footage seems to be cut out. There are two or three points of major crisis in The Fellowship. In modern fantasy it's ten, twenty, thirty times, vainly trying to get a rise out of the reader. The Fellowship and the remainder of Lord of the Rings is the work of a man who invites you to live in his world and doesn't apply the impatient force of constant action and employ all the usual gimmicks. Many people criticize the flow of Tolkien's writing, but his books are fantasy in its purest form. This book is a must-read for more than its entertainment value. The Lord of the Rings is the key to understanding the genre. All fantasy books that follow the Ring Trilogy have definite roots to the father of them all. If you read through The Fellowship and its sequels and are still hungry for more, I would recommend Brooks and Eddings, my favorites."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Now that our friend Potter is taking all the glory, I thought it was a good idea to go back to basic. And wow. Not to benchmark, but the rich, complex personalities of its characters and the thick, intriguing plot makes this book a forget me not. We must remember that this saga was written more than 80 years ago, when imagination was not hindered with today blast of easy science fiction and gruesome information. In my wish list, is a visit to middle earth, and, if I may, use the ring for a few moments.An adult, honest story, perfectly balanced, that, as Joyce almost said: I love to love it.Get lost in Middle earth, and, if you are lucky, you won't come back"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The begining of one of the greatest sagas in history!

I was scared to live in a big city for the first time in my life, so I comforted myself by inhabiting Middle-Earth for a while. The sense of location in this book is palpable; from Rivendell to Lorien, from Bree to Weathertop to the Mines of Moria, one feels as if one has truly visited the locations described.The structure of LOTR is in the manner of a picaresque -- the callow hobbits journey across a wide world and have various adventures on their quest to deposit the Ring in Mt. Doom. Characterization is for the most part simplistic, but Frodo and Gollum achieve some depth, and the story throughout has the force of myth, full of rich archetypes. One ought to read this book the way one might read Homer or Chaucer: it is an old-fashioned epic, drawn in broad, bold strokes. It is a spectacularly successful exercise in literary nostalgia."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book is fascinating from cover to cover. Tolkien is at his very best in this book, wielding adjectives about Middle Earth that make it seem so believable I felt I was actually there, and unlike so many fantasy books today, the plot and character development don't take a back seat. It's one huge tour-de-force that is just hurled at you. Some people will argue that it's just too boring, and I'll go with you on that, but that's no reason not to like the book. I guarantee that half of the people who say that didn't get past the first hundred pages. What we have here is a masterpiece of fantasy and fiction, and a fine line drawn between a fantasy world and the real world, and Tolkien gives us an epic fantasy that will stay in the mind's of it's readers for years to come."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"It is hard to get into the book at the front of it but after about 100 pages or so it gets pretty good. It is the first part of The Lord of the Rings trilogy.

It was still a pretty good book but I liked The Hobbit better."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"As another reviewer said, \`\`forget Harry Potter!'' This is the real thing.

Tolkien starts up slowly, but then it gets a little more exiting (especially if you are into dungeons and dragons.)This is a very good book out of a series, that you must read (I would recommend you to read the Hobbit first, it will give you an idea of the story and the settings.) But if you start with this book, you will get the story even if you don't read the Hobbit.The Fellowship of the Ring is about an evil ring who by destiny was given to Frodo who is Bilbo's nephew. So a wizard advises Frodo to destroy it in the place it was made. By trying to accomplish this goal Frodo has many adventures and surprises and meets many different people hobbits, humans and elves.Beware there's a lot of strange, made-up words and there is a lot of songs in this book. I think you can just skip them, because for me they don't make any sense and are placed there just to keep you in suspense."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Forever a classic this one. Gloriously detailed and fully explained along the way, from the villages of Hobbiton to Gondor this is an essential read. Anyone interested in the superb Nintendo64 video game classic &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; or George Lucas' epic &quot;Starwars&quot; will feel truly at home. Never before has a fictional world been so detailed and real. Anyone new to the series should read the &quot;Hobbit&quot; first to enjoy and appreciate it more."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is a great book! It's the first book in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, which is about The one ring which the dark lord Sauron made to control all the rings of power. This is such an incredible book, but it doesn't make any since whatsoever if you don't read The Hobbit (also by Tolkien) first! The Hobbit is a lot more fast-paced (and shorter) for you people who thought the Fellowship of the rings dragged itself out. (which it did for a very good reason,to explain a bit of history that comes in very important later on,if you read the other books)So don't give this book a bad review if you haven't read the book that explains it or haven't even finished the trilogy, it gives this really good book a bad name which is the least it deserves!

If not, read The Hobbit, its a good background and a good book in its own right, then pick up this and read away. You'll never want to leave. Although there are many fantasy writers, none can compare with Tolkien (still, I really like The Wheel of Time series). He is the master of fantasy, undisputed. I read this series about once a year, sometimes twice, because it takes me away from this crazy place for awhile. Takes me to somewhere a little more my style; that place I dream about."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I think that the fellowship of the rings is a great book and deserves 1000 stars, but the book should not be forced on anyone(but still strongly reccommended), and if you have not read all &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot; and are conserding reading this book or are part-way-through, then stoping reading these reviews, as you will find out what happends later on in the book.If you didn't know, there is 3 movies coming out about &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot; in year 2001, being filmed in New Zealand and is 3 movies The Fellowship Of The Rings, The Two Towers, and The return Of The King which will be about 2 hours each."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book was amazing!I am a devout Tolkien fan,and I love all his books(as a matter of fact,I study the languages he created in his books as a hobby.I was inspired by his books to create a fantasy world of my own.)I was 12 when I first read this book,and I've loved it ever since.But,I must point out one major flaw:the writing gets so complicated some times,that it's hard to read(#2:the Two Towers is even worse on this,but #3 gets much better)Their is one other flaw:the characters aren't developed enough until #2.But other than that,this book is a great read, esp.

I hate to rain on everyone's parade, but FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is a snoozer. The book could have at least a hundred pages cut from it simply by eliminating the endless descriptions of nature that the band is travelling through. Another thing that I found annoying was the portrayal of elves - why are they always relegated to living in magical forests, where they possess great wisdom and power, but never use it? Just to say I've read them, I will probably force myself to read the next two volumes. On it's own, however, the first book is a real disappointment."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Lord of the Rings Book ReviewIn lord of the rings there are little people called hobbits and they are the most peaceful and careful races of all in the story. One of them (Bilbo Baggins) contained something of great value to out side the shier. The shier is where the hobbits lived, far out of where wars and conflicts are. There are darker races like Orks, Goblins and Ring wraiths. They want what Bilbo has, the ring. The ring is known to control evil and destroy all that was good to middle earth. Bilbo was ready to leave the shier and move on; he left the ring with his nephew Frodo Baggins. They had no idea it was the most powerful ring of all and everyone was looking for it. An old friend of Bilbo, Gandolf knew what it was and sent Frodo and Sam to travel a distance and help them destroy the ring.One of my most favorite parts in the story is when J.R.R Tolkien described how the shier looked. The detail he put in and how things were, the houses the field the hobbit nationality. When I was done I could clearly see everything about the shier. I think J.R.R Tolkien wanted his audience to know excaclty what he wants you to see in your head. He also left room for imagination. Reading it was exciting, though some parts were sort of boring and I could define some of the words used in the book but I got most of it. Another one of my favorite parts through out the story is when Frodo and his crew of hobbits (Frodo, Sam, Pippin, and Merry) were camping out with there new friend strider, strider went out and on the lookout and handed the hobbits swords for defense, the ring wraiths found them and stabbed Frodo. Then an elf rider came to pick up Frodo and cure with elfish medicine. On the way nine ring wraiths came to take them out. When J.R.R was telling what happened it felt as if you were right there with them. Intense and extreme feelings were cool. I like how he even wrote in elfish language when the elf rider was talking to her horse. Those were my most favorite moments in the book. Also that merry and pippin made me laugh in some parts because they were funny characters. It was good to hear humor in the book with merry and pippin. I really like this book and I recommend it to others who enjoy fantasy stories."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Imagine a ring that its only purpose is to create evil, is passed on to you, its heir. In The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien a malicious ring is passed on to a young hobbit. The hobbit though is doomed to take the ring and destroy it at on of the darkest corners of the earth. However, black riders that work for Sauron (the creator of the ring who rules them all) want the master ring and want to kill him. the nine black riders,(sent by sauron) are owners of the nine other rings which are specially made for them.I think this is not a boring book but a different book that is just a different way of writing. I think it is very cult. I also think it is obviously very fictional and it is a book that is also very adventurous and mysterious. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to read a classic and cultural book. I warn though, that when reading, the person needs to have patience if they think \\"Book 1\\" is too boring to read. I you are a person that likes only the books like the Da Vinci Code which is a thriller you wont like it that much. However, someone that likes Science Fiction will like it, since it is a very mysterious book that has from evil rings, to adventurous hobbits.Though most of the book is pretty boring it does include mystery especially after the council of Elrond, when the fellowship sees the glowing eyes appearing and disappearing into the darkness of their journey."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I remembered from years ago when I first read The Lord of the Rings trilogy that these were really wonderful books. After watching the first two of the movies I decided to buy the books again and read them after many years to see if the books are as bad as the movies or if my memory was faulty.I feel redeemed. The books are wonderful, just the movies were bad.For those of you who were shunning the books because you found the movies to be a steaming pile of excrement, do yourself a favor and spring a few bucks at the used book store a copy and see what a real work of literary excellence looks like.My star ratings:One star - couldn't finish the bookTwo stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning.

The story on the screen is captivating and the special affects were astounding. The book though was tedious. It was just a boring discription of history and observations about the nature in the journey. I could hardly connect with any of the characters on an emotional level and I really coundn't get into the story and missed some of the important plot point because i just wanted to finish it. I do like the story and plot so that is why my rating is this high."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I know I'll probably go to hell for saying this, but I really do not see why Tolkien is so popular. I can not deny that he writes intelligently. His world is undeniably well thought out. However, it seems to me that his style of writing is out of date and if he wrote the Lord of the Rings Trilogy today-- it would flop. His story is bogged down with detail (most of it unnessasary), the plot is typical (yes I know his story is the protoype for modern fantasy writers)and his characters seem very flat as compared to the demand we put on writers today for well rounded characters. I have great respect for Tolkien, but I think some readers love him only because of his reputation and not for his work. His style of writing is now extinct."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Lord of the Rings; The Fellowship of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien is a classic. If you haven't read this book your missing out. It is one of the best-selling books of all time and I can see why. The eloquent vocabulary and side storylines are what make this book great, along with the incredible sensory detail which prints a picture in your head of exactly what the author means to tell you. It's less like reading and more like imagining.The story takes place in a pre-medieval age but not in Europe, in a place called Middle Earth. Middle Earth is inhabited by many magical creatures including elfs, men, wizards, orcs, dwarfs, dragons, monsters of all sorts, and hobbits. A hobbit is a smaller version of a man, only 3 or so feet tall. Our story follows Frodo Baggins, a small but curios hobbit on his adventure to overcome evil and destroy the one magic ring that can cast the entire Middle Earth into darkness if it falls into the hands of the evil being Sauron. He created the ring in the volcano Mount Doom and is the only one who can control the power within this ring. Frodo must take the ring into the heart of the volcano which is the one place the it can be destroyed. He is aided on his quest by his three hobbit friends, Samwise Gamgee, Meriadock Brandybuck, and Perigren Took, two men, Aragorn and Boromir, Legolas the elf, and Gimli the dwarf. Together they set out to destroy the ring and save the world from the powers of evil.I would recommend this book for kids and adults over they age of 12. This is because the vocabulary and depth of the story are almost to hard for a child to comprehend, let alone be interested by. Also some knowledge of medieval times helps greatly to understand this book. Overall I give this book 5 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Take a head-trip to wonderland of the medieval times in J.R.R. Tolkien's masterpiece, The Lord of the Rings trilogy. In an epic adventure across foreign landscapes, join an unlikely band of humans, an elf, a dwarf, and hobbits in the first installment of the three, The Fellowship of the Ring. Envision their every movement as they brave dark, treacherous, caves, and as they fend off their attackers of trolls,orcs, goblins, and other unknown evils in their perilous quest. Tolkien's tapestry of history and thought throughout the book is incredible as he weaves his complicated history of his imagined world and flawlessly brings the book right out of the pages and into your room. His novel inspires everyone to do what is the courageous and right thing to do in their everyday lives to bring evil to its knees and to promote righteousness in the sinning environment we live in today.Frodo Baggins is the main character in this action and adventure series. He and his comical looking friends add humor to the violent scheme and his other counterpart, Gandalf the wizard, expresses his wisdom throughout dramatic scenes. Along for the trip are several humans and others humanly creature that add their own affairs of love giving the book a unique blend of everything. inn reality this book will only benefit us through stimulating our minds and bringing what truly could happen to our eyes."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien brings you to the small and lovely Shire. In the Shire lives an ordinary hobbit named Frodo, or at least he thought he was normal. Little did Frodo know that he would one day have to leave the dear Shire to go on a wild adventure to the darkest of all places.When Frodo was young he was adopted by Bilbo Baggins and was loved dearly. Bilbo was a rich hobbit and lived in the fairest hobbit hole. He gave the hole to Frodo when he left the Shire. Bilbo also left behind a very precious gift to him, a golden ring that had magical powers and could be very dangerous. Gandalf, an old wizard and a great family friend, made sure that Frodo got it and kept it safe. In the movie Frodo leaves the Shire with the ring almost immediately with Sam and ends up bumping into Mary and Pippin on the way. In the book it is a lot more complicated and more interesting too. Shortly after Gandalf left he came back to tell Frodo that the ring was evil and need to be taken away soon because it belonged to Sauron, who was evil.Eventually Frodo, Sam, Mary and Pippin left quietly on an adventure that would last forever. From the time they left the Shire to the time they got to Mordor there was not one time where they were not in danger. On this adventure they meet many new and interesting people, such as elves, and learn many things about life and the world around them. You follow these amazing hobbits through a wonderful, but dangerous adventure through all different types of unknown places.This is an excellent book. Most people have seen the movie and so have I, but the book answered all my questions about the movie. The book is just as interesting too. You can see everything clearly in your mind. Then the next time you watch the movie everything seems to piece together like a puzzle and you catch things you never would have noticed before. Read this book, it is excellent!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is a virtuoso performance by Rob Inglis. His portrayals of all the characters is superb, and he (almost) never mixes up their voices. His understanding and interpretation of Tolkien is marvelous, and he has the perfect voice for the job. Wouldn't it have been nice if Jackson could have found a role for Rob Ingis in the films? He'd have made a great Tom Bombadil, but let's not get into that.An earlier reviewer pointed out the problem of inconsistent disc and track naming, but that flaw exists with the online database, not the CDs themselves.For any fan of the book or the films, get these audio CDs. Nothing better on a long drive."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Even today, almost six decades since its first publication, J. R. R. Tolkien's magnificent work of fantasy is still attracting readers and scholars - more so now due to the publicity surrounding Peter Jackson's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" film trilogy. Perhaps for the first time ever, the movie release of a book adaptation has actually boosted sales of the book involved. And this can only be considered a good thing, as one cannot claim to be a literary reader without exploring Tolkien's Middle-Earth at least once in their lives.To outline the story seems almost redundant, but here goes: in the idyllic pastoral land of the Shire lives the hobbit Frodo Baggins, who is intrusted with an immense task. The magical Ring that his uncle brought back from his adventuring is revealed by the wizard Gandalf to be none other than the ruling Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron, who is now mustering his forces to find his possession and overthrow the world once more.And so Frodo sets off, with his cousins Merry Brandybuck and Pippen Took, and his loyal gardener Samwise Gamgee in order to conceal the Ring from the enemy and seek out a way in which to destroy it. His journey throws him into the path of the mysterious Ranger Strider, and the terrible Ringwraiths sent out to fetch Sauron's prize. Finally reaching the elven sanctuary of Rivendell, Frodo becomes a part of a larger Fellowship of men, hobbits, elves and dwarves, in order to make the perilous journey across land to the volcanic Mount Doom in the land of Mordor: the only place where the Ring could be destroyed.On the way of course are dangers galore - the betrayal of the white wizard Saruman, the legions of orcs plaguing the land, the pattering footsteps of an unknown stalker, and of course the lure of the One Ring itself, whose corruptible nature endangers Frodo from within the Fellowship as well as without...\\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" is the first of the three books in the trilogy, which in turn are divided into six books (two books for each volume). This new edition of the text involves several new additions; a note explaining Tolkien's terminology and linguistic decisions (such as writing \\"elven\\" instead of \\"elfin\\" and \\"dwarves\\" instead of \\"dwarfs\\"), a foreword by Tolkien himself explaining how the story came about, and the famous prologue \\"Concerning Hobbits\\" which introduces the reader to the culture of these small creatures and the history of the Ring that took place in \\"The Hobbit\\". Then of course there are the meticulous maps of Middle-earth, and the wonderful story itself.In creating his work, Tolkien had done something that no author had done before, or since (despite the dismal attempts at copying by the likes of...well, I'll let you fill in the blanks) - the creation of an entire world, complete with history, flora, fauna, landmarks, star plotting, folksongs and a thousand other details that make Middle-Earth the most vivid and three-dimensional sub-creation that the literary world has ever seen. In many ways the land itself is the protagonist of the story - it is what the characters are fighting for, and at times the land itself helps or hinders the Fellowship's progress.You can read this story from a thousand different viewpoints, whether it's the irrevocable fading of the magic in the world, the battle between good and evil (both internal and external), a beautiful love story between a mortal man and an elven maiden, the impossible journey of the ordinary-man to change to course of the world...the list goes on. Most touching for me however was the gentle touches of Christian idealogy imbued and combined with the realms of Faery, creating a harmonious and magical whole, not as heavy handed as C. S. Lewis's Narnia allegories, but meaningful, deep and beautiful.In reading \\"Fellowship\\" for the first time, one may be put off by the rather slow pace of the first book, in which Tolkien takes his time to set the scene, establish what's at stake, gather together his information and then throw in a singing Tom Bombadil. Trust me, if you hang in there to book two (when Frodo reaches Rivendell) then the pace will pick up.Tolkien has a beautiful poetic prose used throughout the story, sometimes soft and gentle, sometimes grand and epic. There has never been a better time to get involved with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" than with the release of Jackson's movie trilogy on DVD - read the book, and then watch the world unfold on the television screen."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"&quot;One Ring to rule them all.

He takes you to a beautiful world of puzzles, story, love, poetry, song, and exitment.My advise READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring not only lays the foundation for the rings trilogy but shoots the reader off on an entertaining ride through danger, intrigue, mystery, and battles between good and evil. In this book, Tolkien develops the characters and backgrounds of the story and also includes suspense and excitement along the way.As I read the rings trilogy, I found that it was helpful to have seen to the movies to help picture the events, characters, and surroundings. Of course, the movies made much more sense after reading the books, but I found reading the books more enjoyable than the movies. I am really glad that I decided to read them at a friend's suggestion.Tolkien is an excellent writer. This book along with the others is intelligently written. It is not just kid's stuff. It is stimulating reading.He tells a great story filled with complex characters and plots. The story follows a logical and understandable path that sparks the readers full imagination and range of emotions.When you buy this, you might as well buy all three books of the rings set because it is essentially one story divided into three books. This book does not complete the story but only a section of it.And don't think that since you have seen the movie, you don't need to read the book. If you liked the movie at all, you will indeed enjoy the book, especially if your one criticism of the movie is that it didn't make sense. The book will fill in the gaps and will cause you to appreciate the movie much more."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of three books that make up the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Its about a simple hobbit named Frodo Baggins who inherits a ring from his uncle Bilbo. He soon learns from a wizard named Gandalf that the ring isn't just any ring, it is the most powerful ring ever made. Now he is sent on a quest to destroy it in the fires of Mount Doom before the Dark Lord, Sauron, finds it. If it ever got into his hands, the word would turn to darkness and all things once peaceful and beautiful would be destroyed and Sauron would rule the world.Frodo and Samwise Gamgee then go on an adventure together with seven other companions. These seven are: a dwarf named Gimli, an elf named Legolas, two men named Boromir and Aragorn, and two hobbits named Merry and Pippin (Gandalf also joins them for a little while). Merry and Pippin are bothe cousins of Frodo while Samwise is his faithful gardener. Frodo is a normal hobbit who loves food and friends. He is also the kindest person Sam knows. Aragorn is the heir of a great kingdome who has finally decided to take up his throne. Boromir it the son of the steward of that kingdome who wishes to represent it by joing the company. Legolas is the prince of a far away forest and Gimli is a well respected dwarf.The beginning of the book is a little boring but it pays off when their quest begins and conflicts begin to come up. In the beginning, Merry, Pippin, Frodo, and Sam begin their journey alone through their country called the Shire to a little town called Bree to meet Gandalf. After going through and meeting new and interesting people and being chased by Black Riders (servants of Sauron), they finally make it to Bree. The trouble is, Gandalf isn't there!Can the whole world depend on hobbits to save them from destruction? Will Gandalf ever come to Bree? How can the hobbits go on without him?

It just got boring after a few pages discribing tiny detail.I lost interest during the climax, and put it down for what I meant only to be that day, but ended up being several months. When I finally picked it back up, and managed to finish it, I really didn't feel fulfilled.There were good things about the book, like the overall story.But it could have been a huge amount better. Like if they shortened the detail to like a page per place, and blew up the important events more, rather than letting peaceful moments dominate the story.It could just be that I need to read it again. I sometimes find that the second time around is more enjoyable.Overall, I thought it was perhaps worth the chore of reading it, but would have enjoyed it more if the detail hadn't droned on quite so long.Oh, by the way, I'm halfway through The Two Towers book, and it's much better."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I would give this book two thumbs up. I read its pre-quil, The Hobbit, it was excellent as well and helped to understand this book. The Lord of Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is a book that is placed in an earth-like world, but it isn't earth. The time would be medievalish, with such things as dragons, orcs, elves, dwarfs, wizards, trolls, and hobbits of course, plus many other creatures. The content of this book is very similar to that of an AD&D (advanced dungeons & dragons) storyline. This story starts off at a mild pace, a peaceful setting in the hobbit town known as The Shire. The story is about one hobbit, Frodo Baggins. His long time friend Gandalf the Grey, a wizard, visits him and that is when the story really takes off. They set out on many adventures, most of them unintentional. This story is filled with adventure, and the suspense never stops throughout the duration of the story. There is a great conflict between the good and evil in Middle Earth, where the story takes place. Evil forces are threatening to destroy everything good in the world, Frodo and his fellowship set off to prevent that from happening. If you like all of these things that I have just described, this book if definitely for you. It has one of the best storylines I have ever read. It helps to read The Hobbit first however, it will give you a much greater understanding of what is going on. This story doesn't end in this book, it stops right in the middle. To finish the story you have to read the next two books, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"If you are like me and loved the Harry Potter books, there is little chance you won't go crazy over this book. I was very disappointed I had to wait for the fifth book so to fill my gap I purchased the collection of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. It was one of the greatest decisions I ever made. Suddenly this series I bought to &quot;fill in the gap&quot; became something better than anything Rowling ever wrote in a book. Tolkien gives a far more vivid world, much more complex, with characters that are far more three dimensional. I can't understand why there is so much buzz around Harry Potter when the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; is so much a better fantasy story. Then again, it is written above a second grade level."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"One of the things that was a little tough about finally reading the fellowship of the ring was the fact that I am used to reading thriller novels and historical fiction. Therefore the language of this book took some getting used to. I felt at times that I was wading my way through some slow parts. But slow compared to the stuff I usually read I guess. So I have to take that into consideration. This was worth reading and I am glad I did. I would certainly recomend it especially with the movie coming out and all."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is the first volume of Tolkien's masterpiece, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. There is nothing else that has ever come close to comparing to it - although many have tried. &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is a wonderful introduction to Middle Earth and it's residents. Unless you have been completely spoiled by modern interpretations of fantasy, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; should be in your permanent library. Be sure to read the first volume =before= the new movie comes out, as I have heard that they changed many events, and left out others in the interest of brevity. Every fan of fantasy should read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; at least once in their lives. My very highest recommendation for any fantasy book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"As so many cynnical people deftly point out, most of this book is &quot;just people walking around doing stuff.&quot; However can't anything be reduced to utter simplicity? Like Frank Herbert's Dune was just &quot;a bunch of people in the desert doing stuff.&quot; Please, we're not infants here. So, with that cleared up this book perfectly sets up the stage for the next two. Please consider that the trilogy is written continuosly, and is in excess of one thousand pages. Therefore, for you to know what they are talking about, they will have to put you through a little boredom. This is a good introduction to the final two in the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"With great action and suspense I believe this is one of the best books i've read so far. The plot to this part is woven intricately like a web, that all comes together. Its exciting how Frodo, the relative of Bilbo who got the evil ring in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, has to run away from all the henchmen of Sauron, the evil being searching for the ring to become the ruler of the world again. Along his way Frodo meets many characters with different personalities. After travelling near to Sauron's country, Mordor, Frodo finds out that one of his trusted companions wants to take the ring and rule for himself. He is faced with tons of enemies and then finds that one of his own friends is one of them. He uses the ring, which makes him invisible, and escapes. But he is still faced with the dreaded mission into Mordor. This is where the second part, &quot;Two Towers&quot;, starts. (Im reading this right now)"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Last year, I thought I'd go through and read the top Sci Fi and Fantasy classics and compare. I started with Clarke's 2001 a Space Odessey, Asimov's Foundation, continued with the Tolkien's Hobbit and Herbert's Dune. Don't get me wrong, Tolkien is a master, and I loved this book, but I thought it was very slow, and very little action. The best book ever as some have said? I thought Dune by Frank Herbert was a much more intriguing read, with much more &quot;depth&quot; but still, I'm glad I read it as it was enjoyable and I want to read the other books. I just didn't &quot;blow me away&quot; as it did other readers. Maybe I'm shallow, but I failed to see the signifigance. Tolkien sometimes puts too much in the journey, and not enough problems for characters to deal with. I liked the Hobbit MUCH more, though I understand the series continues and isn't finished. I would still recommend you read it, but try your hand at Dune first."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"to all who have never read this book, and to all who have found it boring, I am forced to tell you I couldn't care less. To those of you who find the books rich in symbolism, let me just say that Tolkien despised symbolism, and allegory, and other tricks writers use to inspire depth in their works. tolkien simply wrote and let his works stand for themselves. while current fantasy readers are inclined towards the &quot;brute force&quot; angles of fantasy, in which mighty wizards throw fireballs all day long and retire on dragonback at the end of the day(Jordan and Goodkind, I AM talking to you!), Tolkien created a world in which power is wielded with care, the meek overcome the mighty through humane virtue, and magic itself is falling into darkness. this is a parable of our times, fantasy or no, and it pains me that Tolkien's works have been relegated to the realm of Jordan and Terry Brooks: his place is in high literature. if you hate fantasy, it doesn't matter- savor his words, cry for the woes he shows you, marvel at the depth of his imagination. just don't dismiss his work as fantasy; he deserves better than that. as I said, the works stand for themselves."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"One of the major comments you will hear about this book is that it is a bit slow getting started. But hang in there and get through the set up; its SO worth it! Even the parts of the book characterized as slow are useful; this exposition helps immerse you into Middle Earth, which is one of the more common positive comments you will read about here in the reviews. Reading LOTR is a commitment, treating it like a weekend novel will result in disappointment. But when you are on the edge of your seat as the fog closes in on the hobbits on the Barrow-Downs, or letting the phone ring off the hook, forgotten, as Glorfindel urges his horse to flee with Frodo on its back at the attack of the Ringwraiths at the Ford of Brunien, you will be glad you took the time to do it right. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The primary influence of this work is deeper than storytelling. If you read the Lord of the Rings, it will change your life for the better. Some perceive the changes immediately; others perceive them over time. As Gollum descended into shadow, you will rise from it. If you have not read the book, I'm sure these comments sound contrived and condescending. After you read the Lord of the Rings, you will get a feeling for what I am trying to express. The reason the Lord of the Rings is so popular is because it has a profound psychological effect on virtually everyone who reads it. This influence is pervasive and obviously not the reaction of just a few fanatics. The most mysterious aspect of this is the fact the influence becomes more profound with subsequent readings. You will get more out of the book on the second or third reading than the first. Middle-Earth becomes a place you will visit over time and this is one of the few books that you will read again and again."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I started this book. It is awesome!!! It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time!!!!!!!!!!! Buy it, it's worth hundreds of dollars!!!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I have to admit that the Fellowship was a triffle on the boring side it did lead up to the momentus events that occured in the Two Towers and the Return of the King. The Fellowship was here to introduce the characters that would become of great importance later on in the series. In this book it gave the reader time to absorb the character's traits so he can read the other books flouidly and withouth doubt. So you can see why the Lord to the Rings is referred to the book that set the standards for modern fantasy and is considered a classic."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Fellowship Of The Ring is about a hobbit named Frodo and a wizard named Gandolf who get possession of a magical ring. This ring has great powers .The ring also has an evil past. Now the hobbit and the wizard are trying to learn more about the ring. The main characters are Bilbo, Frodo, and Gandolf. The plot is Gandolf &amp; Frodo are fighting against the evil Gollum and many others. The setting takes place in an imaginary world.I think this book is good for skilled readers. It takes some skill to read a book like this."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book is far superior to any fantasy book. I was stunned by the amazing ability possessed by the author, Tolkien, to create such a masterpiece. Being the first author to write books that belong to this genre, I think that Tolkien should be honoured and respected by any fantasy-lover. This book includes a serious study and realistic description of characters and their motives, beautiful descriptions of Middle Earth and its different cultures, and, of course, an interesting and complex plot. The fantasy books I had read before were merely average, and thus, when I started to read this book, I had low expectations. However, the book became better and better as I read, and impressed me in a way that I cannot begin to describe. If only modern writers had half the talent and imagination possessed by tolkien. My advice to young reader is: do not waste yourselves on trashy romances: this book is the vital core of children's literature. Enjoy this book! From a 14 year-old in Israel."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"If you appreciate science fiction, fantasy, history, or just a fireside tale, you will be awed by The Fellowship of the Ring, as well as it's companion books. The attention to detailed history, fictitious though it is, is amazing. Blended with a pinch of magic and a touch of good humor, the story is gripping. The struggle between Mordor and the rest of Middle-Earth is always present, whether the characters are in the comfort of a nice, soft bed, or in a dank cave or tunnel. Middle-Earth, Tolkien's realm of storytelling, is so diverse and ever-changing, that no matter how many new places the hobbits or any other member of their fellowship visit, it's never just another stop along the way. The poems and songs of Tolkien's creation are so beautiful and, sometimes humorous, that The Fellowship of the Ring would be a 10 no matter WHAT chapter you selected to read."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I have read Lord of the Rings at least 6 times and each time I do I still feel the same emotion I felt the first time, even more.

For those who haven't read it WHAT ARE YOU WAITING for....!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This whole series, has, by far, proven to be the best that I have ever read. It is a vast epic of sweeping proportions and implications. Tolkien is a genius when it comes to portraying a character's emotions, and the storyline is first - rate. Anyone that enjoyed The Hobbit will definitely like these books."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book, as well as the Hobbit, and the rest of the Lord of the Rings, have given to me a gift of experience.

You can get lost in this book and live another life in it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"If you read fantasy and you haven't yet read The Lord of the Rings, then you haven't read fantasy at all. All other fantasy pales in comparison; R.A. Salvatore and the rest of his TSR cronies are mere hacks. Tolkien stands alone as the master of the Secondary World."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This was the greatest trilogy I have ever read!Ibeg you to read these books. The first book is called the Lord of the Rings. The second is called The Two Towers. The final book is called The Return of the King, which was my favorite. The books have two parts. The first part is about 4 hobbits taking the great Ring of Sauron to be destroyed at Mount Doom which is located in the black land of Mordor.The second part tells of the War of the Ring.Which occures in the capitol of Gondor (Minis Tirith) to draw Sauron out of his land so Frodo can finish his quest. I had many character that l liked. Such as Gimli the dwarf, Legolas the elf, Gandalf the wizard, Theoden the King,Treebeard the Ent, and finnaly the evil creature gollum. I strongly suggest reading this trilogy. I also strongly suggest readin The Hobbitfirst, so you can understand it better.READ IT!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book, The Fellowship of the Ring, is the most amazing book I have ever read in my entire life. It is extremely well-written, and very impacting. I admit I got emotional over many scenes in the book. I was very touched by the sense of fellowship... everlasting friendship that binds people together... that Tolkien gave off through his writing. No doubt that his work influenced me to write better and be more patient at times with my own work. I cried during the death of a character, which has never happened to me before. I strongly recommend reading this book, and the rest of the trilogy... I can guarantee that you will be as touched by this amazing emotional and epic book as I am."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This story exemplifies why books are so much better than the films.So much more to read and involve yourself with.A steady beginning to the adventure that captures the imagination.

The Lord of the Rings for me is more than just a story, it's a tale of love and heartache, perseverance and triumph, shadow and dispair, loss and sorrow but also victory and friendship. This is one of the rare gems of our time, written by a man than few can compare to, it's a story that will forever be in my heart."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Although this was probably my fifth time reading The Lord of the Rings, I still find it my favorite of all times. Tolkien was truly a master. I had not read The Lord of the Ring since before the epic movie production was released, but Peter Jackson's The Hobbit will be released in December and I thought it was a good time to re-read. Just finished The Hobbit and now after finishing the Fellowship I am on to The Two Towers. The best of the three is still The Return of the King. I am in my late 50's but I am prompting my grandchildren on being Tolkien Fans!If you haven't read the Hobbit and The Trilogy, please do. You will become instant Tolkien Fans too!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"It's said that J.R.R. Tolkien invented an entirely new genre, \\"Sword and Sorcery,\\" by creatingThe Lord of the Rings. Some readers will insist that Tolkien's work falls under the rubric of \\"High Fantasy,\\" but the difference between the two genres seems, to this reviewer, to be equivalent to the difference between purple and violet.More relevantly, fully 30% of all fiction books published today fall into the genre, whatever name we give it. In truth, Tolkien breathed life back into the old Northern European myths about Elves and Dwarves and Trolls.Tolkien, when he wasn't teaching philology at Oxford, academically translating Anglo-Saxon epics, working on the staff of the Oxford Dictionary of the English Language, or raising his fair-sized family, spent all his adult life creating the LORD OF THE RINGS universe, which includes the entireSilmarillionlegendarium.Tolkien's desire was to create a mythology for England. More properly, one might say he wanted to create a mythology for Anglo-Saxon England based upon it's Germanic roots. Arguably, England's mythology would be the mythology of the original Celts who populated the Scepter'd Isle, but so much of that has been lost under the palimpsest of Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and Norman domination that only fragments remain, and during his lifetime Tolkien admitted he did not much consider the fragments compelling.Although Tolkien began writing THE SILMARILLION legendarium in 1917, it was considered bizarre and ultimately unpublishable by the decision-makers of the day. A history of the speakers of the \\"Elvish Tongues,\\" it grew out of Tolkien's invention of those tongues. Like a classical composer, Tolkien was compelled to put his favorite sounds down on paper, and once having done so, wove a history around the development of the languages he created, which were based, in part, on Finnish (Quenya, or High-Elven) and Welsh (Sindarin, or Grey-Elven).The legendarium backed into published existence when Tolkien wrote down an episodic bedtime story he had been telling his children over the years. As written down and published it becameThe Hobbit, the story of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins and his amazing journey \\"there and back again\\" to wrest a treasure from a dragon. Willy-nilly, it contained elements of his legendarium, and quite unexpectedly, it became a best-seller when published in 1937.With his publishers clamoring for a sequel, Tolkien sat down to write it. It took him twelve years to complete, finally seeing the light of day as THE LORD OF THE RINGS. I first read THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING back in 1976, just as Tolkien's work began to enjoy a resurgence. Having been embraced by 1950s longhairs, and then by 1960s counterculturists who loved its vision of a pastoral and unspoiled Middle-Earth, we in the late 1970s valued it for its escapism (and not a little for the in-joke of good-natured, laid-back Hobbits indulging in \\"pipe-weed\\"). Tolkien's popularity amongst my generation spawned the publication of THE SILMARILLION, the republication of THE LORD OF THE RINGS and THE HOBBIT in leatherbound editions with typo-corrected texts, and the production of aJ.R.R. Tolkien Animated Films Set (The Hobbit/The Lord of the Rings/The Return of the King)in those years.I own the leatherbound editions, and the old Ballantine boxed set editions copyrighted 1966 (which I bought in 1976). It's tough to carry the leatherbound editions around (or even read them in bed) and my Ballantine editions have fallen apart due to re-reading and age, so I bought a new boxed set. I'm glad to see that the text in the new set is the corrected text, though the maps in the old paperback edition were larger and clearer.Despite being called a \\"trilogy,\\" THE LORD OF THE RINGS is not a trilogy in any real sense. Tolkien conceived THE LORD OF THE RINGS as a single volume comprising six books (plus appendices) but the original publisher split the work into three, publishing two books per volume with the appendices included into the third. The titles proposed by Tolkien for separate books were: Book I, \\"The First Journey\\" or \\"The Ring Sets Out\\"; Book II, \\"The Journey of the Nine Companions\\" or \\"The Ring Goes South\\"; Book III, \\"The Treason of Isengard\\"; Book IV, \\"The Journey of the Ring-bearers\\" or \\"The Ring Goes East\\"; Book V, \\"The War of the Ring\\"; and Book VI, \\"The End of the Third Age\\".THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is the first publisher-created volume. It starts out much like THE HOBBIT: Bilbo Baggins throws a magnificent going-away party and sets out for parts unknown. He leaves most of what he owns behind to be inherited by his nephew Frodo, including a magic ring which has the interesting ability to make its wearer invisible. The Ring (always capitalized) also has the ability to confer apparently eternal life and youth, and this makes Gandalf, the Grey Wizard (who appeared in THE HOBBIT as well), suspicious of its provenance.Ultimately, Gandalf discovers that Frodo's Ring is indeed the One Ring, the Master Ring of all magical Rings in Middle-Earth. The Ring was created by the Dark Lord Sauron more than a thousand years before, and, having recently (as time is measured in Middle-Earth) re-established his Kingdom in the Land of Mordor, Sauron is seeking the One Ring.Closely pursued by \\"The servants of Sauron\\" Frodo flees The Shire, taking the One Ring with him to the temporary haven of Rivendell, where lives Elrond the Half-Elven, a master of wisdom. After a long council, it is decided to take The Ring back to Mordor, where, if unrecaptured by Sauron, it can be destroyed in the fire where it was first cast.The Ring sets out in the company of a Fellowship consisting of four Hobbits, two Men, an Elf, a Dwarf, and Gandalf, but almost immediately their steps are dogged by The Enemy.THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, particularly Book I, is very unlike the remainder of the trilogy. Tolkien was still clearly trying to write a sequel to THE HOBBIT, and so in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING there are some of the avuncular narrator's asides which either made THE HOBBIT so charming or so irritating to a reader, and a kind of chattiness and droll humor that is absent from the rest of the LORD OF THE RINGS, as in\\"Why are you eavesdropping?\\"\\"Beggin' your pardon, but there ain't no eaves in Bag-End, and that's a fact.\\"\\"He took along a supply of pipe-weed (but not enough, I'll warrant).\\"Tolkien also includes many of his own original poems and songs.Ironically enough, this disparate tone works spectacularly well, since it was entirely organic and not planned out. What starts out as a second journey There And Back Again transmogrifies by small increments into a classic epic tale of a Quest, drawing the reader along with it.Tolkien, who is the Shakespeare of Sword and Sorcery, set a high standard for fantasy authors who came after him (not that he ever imagined the legions of writers who would follow in the footsteps of Frodo and his Nine Companions) by crafting his Middle-Earth with such precision and detail. Thus, we are told that \\"wisps of fog, like steam, rose off the surface of the dark river,\\" and we know what the \\"muddy\\" ground is like, that a \\"sullen\\" rain fell, and even what the phase of the moon is.Not just adventure, Tolkien created art---a portrait in words. \\"Elen sila lumenn' omentilvo, a star shines on the hour of our meeting.\\" For what it is, THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING deserves as many stars as it can get."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"A new wave of readers have discovered \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" thanks to the arrival of the epic movie hits. And that is definitely a good thing, because this trilogy not only spurred the fantasy genre into a respectable position, but also provided the template for virtually every elf, dwarf, lost king, and medieval fantasy world since. It's also a wicked good read.We open some sixty years after the events of \\"The Hobbit\\" -- Bilbo Baggins is older, not much wiser, substantially wealthier, and quite eccentric (one not-so-affectionate nickname is \\"Mad Baggins\\"). He has also adopted his bright young cousin Frodo, who was orphaned at a young age and had led a rather fractured life since then. On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron. It inevitably corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him, that will take him across Middle-Earth to the evil land of Mordor.Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (although they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were when the book was first penned.Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as \\"The Hobbit\\": it's lighter and more cheerful, since it opens in the Shire. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't elaborate on the such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers.Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions. Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.Frodo himself is the quintessential \\"little guy\\" hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. He has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person.We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of \\"Hobbit\\" -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. And Frodo is surrounded by a well-rounded cast of characters, including his loyal gardener Sam and his charmingly sneaky cousins, as well as a rich fellowship of ethereal Elves, mysterious men and doughty dwarves.And since this is being rereleased for the 75th Anniversary edition, apparently they've cleaned out some errors and replaced certain words with more archaic ones that Tolkien preferred.Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today. \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is a must-read -- and then go watch the movies again."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I highly recommend this Audiobook version of The Fellowship of the Ring narrated by Rob Inglis. He has narrated each book in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, as well as The Hobbit. It is the only version of these books that I will listen to. I am currently acquiring all of them. Rob Inglis is a great narrator, his voice is not grating, his variations of the characters & creatures voices are wonderful, and his singing is also great. I, personally, think there are no other versions of this on audiobook that can come close to comparing. For some, the fact that they are not available for download (or at least, not that I have found) maybe be an issue, but I think it is more than worth it to buy each set on CD."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I remember reading these books in the 6th grade.

Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.Frodo himself is the quintessential \\"little guy\\" hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. He has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person.We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of \\"Hobbit\\" -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. And Frodo is surrounded by a well-rounded cast of characters, including his loyal gardener Sam and his charmingly sneaky cousins, as well as a rich fellowship of ethereal Elves, mysterious men and doughty dwarves.Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today. \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is a must-read -- and then go watch the movies again."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book is about the story of an ordinary hobbit, Frodo Baggins, with a most extraordinary ring. Everyone wants it, including the evil Sauron, who sends dark riders after Frodo to get it. Frodo flees, but he's alone on the road with his witless hobbit friends. They somehow manage to make their way to Rivendel and regroup, and agree to start on a long trip to destroy the ring. Frodo is given suitable escort. This escort is made up of the best sword, bow, ax, and magic warriors around. Even with this escort he is hounded every step of the way by the enemy. If you love a great fantasy world with a vigorous journey, then this is the book for you. I would recommended this book to anyone who is able to read."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Because &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is only the beginning third of the Lord Of the Rings novel, readers should know that it will not follow a typical plot line. Instead, the reader will find an extraordinary amount of time dedicated to introducing us to the fictional world of Middle-earth. For the fan of fantasy books, the read will be an engulfing experience, but for the person just venturing into this literary area and who are use to more straightforward prose that moves the plot forward, it may be challenging.Many may find that they are unsure if they can continue on with the following two parts, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and &quot;Return of the King&quot;. Let me reassure you that as the novel progresses you will not be disappointed. At the end of Fellowship and into the Two Towers, the book will literally hit its stride as the adventure of Frodo, Strider, and the rest of Fellowship unfolds.The entire story of The Lord of the Rings is truly a classic and one that will be enjoyed by anyone who takes the time to immerse themselves in this glorious tale."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I have a friend who for years tried to get me to read the Tolkien books. She fell in love with them in the 70s when they were very popular and wanted to share them with everyone. I'm not really into narrative prose--although I occasionally read a murder mystery of the classic \\"who-done-it\\" type--so I have never read the books, Fern's efforts not withstanding. When the recent Peter Jackson film Lord of the Rings came out, I was very taken with the trailers for it and decided to see what all of the hullabaloo was about. Needless to say, like many people, I was totally taken with the color, the scenery, the characters and the adventure of the movie. I decided to read some of the books before the advent of the next film, The Two Towers, so that I could be better prepared to enjoy and appreciate it. My first venture into Tolkien's style was The Hobbit or There and Back Again, which I managed to read in a matter of a few hours.Because the film had initially sparked my interest, I read part one of the Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring, from which the action of the movie was taken. This book is considerably more complex in style than The Hobbit, and probably represents a more mature writer. (In checking the copywrite dates, I discovered that The Hobbit was, in fact, written in the 1930s, while the Fellowship appears to have been copywrited in the 1950s shortly before the author had retired from his academic career.) It's narration is much more convoluted, with great attention given to environmental detail and more space devoted to poetry, some of it exquisite--and I don't normally like poetry--than in the earlier work, perhaps reflecting the author's intention to appeal to a more adult audience. While The Hobbit is a fairy tale, the Lord of the Rings is a more sophisticated fantasy. The bard like style, the poetical interludes, the almost Celtic character of the story, and the author-created languages reflect Tolkien's background as a linguist, philologist, and translator of Anglo-Saxon poetry. It is almost as if he is writing a history of the parallel world of elves, halflings, and dwarves that mankind believed existed around them during the early middle ages, a delightful and frightful world of magic and mystery that modern man misses for all his scientific and technological advances!An enjoyable if brief suspension of disbelief."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's epic novel \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" and the mythical, mystical world of Middle Earth in which it takes place, have enthralled millions of readers. This book, \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" is the first part of that legendary saga, which tells of the discovery that the magic ring given to Frodo Baggins by his uncle Bilbo is indeed the One Ring, forged by the dark lord Saroun, which would give him unstopable distructive power if he reclaims it. Therefore, it is decided that Frodo should embark on a perilous quest to destroy the evil, corruptive ring by casting it back in the Cracks of Doom where it was originally forged - in the very center of Saroun's stronghold, the land of Mordor, where the shadows lie - resulting in the ultumate good-versus-evil struggle - one which will captivate you, shock you, thrill you, scare you, and, yes, deeply move you. This first part will leave you breathless.If it is possible to improve upon Tolkien's already perfect text, Rob Inglis has done so in this complete and unabriged audiobook performance. From the moment he begins to read the story to you, you are totally immersed in the world and the peoples - both good and evil - that inhabit it. Each character is given a distinctive voice that perfectly suits his or her personality as described by Tolkien in the novel. He shifts from character to character flawlessly, perfectly balancing them all, almost making the listener believe that the real character, not just an actor, is providing their lines. During the passages where Inglis simply acts as narrator and not as any perticular character, he proves himself the perfect person to guide the listener through Middle Earth. He embraces the diversity of the story, and uses just the right tones to set the mood for the scene and to get his audience truly involved in the groundbraking epic.This performance - like the book - is flawless, and is a true listening experience. Pick this title up; no matter if you have loved Middle Earth for a lifetime or are just a kindly newcomer seeking to immerse yourself in the exciting, perilous world, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The first part of the book shows what the Hobbits are. This partis rather too long and maybe boring. You can learn all about theHobbits though. The book becomes really enjoyable from the nextchapter. The story is very thrilling and mythical. Tolkien usesmany motifs of medieval epic, Arthurian romance, Celtic legendand Old English poems. We can entry into the old-fashionedworld of story of adventure.Also Tolkien uses many styles of English- a colloquial expressionbetween the hobbits, a bit Middle- English like dialog by theelves and kings, a daialectal talk by the hobbit Sam and others.Reading this book, you can read all kinds of speeches and evenpoems."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy are one of the finest books written. Many other fantasy books included a lot of magic, evil wizards, big wars and happy endings. The Trilogy are fantasy books that are like no others. It mainly centers on a great journey to destroy an evil, with wars and evil wizards as just additions. Even the usage of magic is rare except when it comes to the evil Rings' seduction. The evil seduction is just one of the aspects that makes this books' plot dark so you should not expect a fairytale Narnia story.Many would find these books strange, for example, Tolkien does not create the characters personalities etc. throughtout the books but only changes them yet this makes the characters more believable. The books though, are not for the weak-willed readers since you need patience and a good imagination.Tolkien does not just create a plot and a load of characters in the books, but a whole new world so the books aren't simple. Yet this makes them amazing. It's the Star Wars of fantasy fiction. Every detail that Tolkien has written draws you further into that world. This is the difference between the movie and the books: the movie doesn't draw you in. These books are not for you if you are looking for a Harry Potter, quick read kind of book the centers mainly on the plot.This is definatly one of those books that seem hard and boring to get into but then you keep reading and it gets better. We've all had one of those books so with this one you can't give up. It is the best book i have ever read and it beats the rest of the fantasy books. (And segmented into 7 books make the chapters fly.)"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of three books in The Lord of the Rings; a story set in the fictional world of Middle Earth. The Lord of the Rings is Sauron, the Dark Lord, who long ago lost the One Ring that holds much of his power. His really wants his ring back and is controls some of the inhabitants Middle Earth. Through unknown ways, the ring is given to Frodo Baggins, a hobbit. Because of the ring, however, Frodo is caught up in business that will change Middle Earth forever.With Gandalf advice, Frodo sets out with three of his hobbit friends to keep the ring out of Sauron's hands. Lord Sauron's minions attack them, but, with the help of a man named Strider, they make it safely to Rivendell, a home of elves. There, with the help of Elrond, Frodo takes the task of taking the ring to the only place it can be destroyed, the pits of hell in the fiery mountain Orodruin, inside Sauron's realm of Mordor. A Fellowship is created to help him, consisting of Frodo, his servant Sam, two other hobbits, Strider, Gandalf, an elf named Legolas, a dwarf named Gemini, and a man from the south named Boromir.The Fellowship heads south and tries to pass under the Misty Mountains through Moria, the ancient realm of the dwarves. There, Gandalf falls into the chasm of Khazad-dum while protecting the party from a terrible demon called a Balrog. The rest of the party continues on to Lorien, the forest of the Galadrim elves, where the Galadriel tests their hearts and gives them gifts to help them on the quest. From there, they go down the Anduin River by boat. When they must return to land, they cannot decide whether to head toward Mordor on the east or toward the sanctuary of Minas Tirith on the west. Boromir wants the ring and confronts Frodo, who decides that he must go to Mordor. However, Frodo cannot bear to take his friends with him or to subject them to further temptation, so he attempts to leave secretly and continue the quest alone. He does not, however, manage to escape his faithful friend Sam, so they set out together for the realm of the Dark Lord.I really liked this book it was good easy reading. I am a complete Fantasy guy so I loved that and it has a great plot. I really like Strider a lot but Lord Sauron is the coolest by far."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. This is the grim lesson learned by many who have sought the One Ring Of Power, a relic with powers of astonishing magnitude. Anyone who has ever possessed it has succumbed to its power... Except one. Frodo Baggins is the nephew of Bilbo Baggins from The Hobbit. The ring that Bilbo found in that story is the One Ring, which was thought to be lost for centuries. Frodo is asked by Gandalf the Wizard to deliver the Ring to the town of Rivendell so that a council can decide how to destroy it before its maker Sauron revives himself and reclaims the Ring, then destroys the world. At the council, no one can agree on who should be the \\"Ring-Bearer\\" and bring the Ring to Mordor so that it can be destroyed. Along with Frodo go eight others, who are dubbed the Fellowship of the Ring. This includes Gandalf the Wizard, Aragorn and Boromir, the humans, Legolas, the elf, Gimli, the dwarf, and the hobbits, Merry, Pippin, and Sam. But this is no easy task. Ringwraiths, trapped spirits forced to serve Sauron, are relentlessly searching for the Fellowship. What's more, Saruman (not to be confused with Sauron), a former ally, has become corrupt and obssesses over the Ring, and wants its power for himself. This is a great book, so if you haven't read it, at least check it out. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book was awesome!!! It was full of adventure and excitement. I can not wait to finish the trilogy. If I were Frodo, I would have let someone else continue my journey when they reached the House of Elrond. I do not know how he kept up the courage to keep running from the frightening Black Riders of Sauron. I could not wait to turn the page to find out what was going to happen next. There is a lot of anticipation as the journey progresses. No sooner do you think that the fellowship is in the clear that they are on the run again from the Black Riders and Sauron. This is a must read book, even if you saw the movie. Having seen the movie, it interested me even more to read the book and finish the trilogy to see the next two movies. If you can help it, read the book before you go see the movie. Doing that will make the movie even more enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I thought Fellowship of the Ring was a great book.

Seems like it is often true that the books are better, and this case is no different. Characters are somewhat more developed and there are 'short stories' in the book that are not in the movie. They add to the enjoyment of the story, and fill out what is already a jam packed to even greater proportions. Another thing I enjoy when reading this story rather than watching it is the ability to go at my own speed. I reread parts that I need to understand better, go slowly through my favorite parts.

The first one is entertaining, it tells the story of the people Rohan going to Helm's Deep and their fight against Saruman as well as the Ents battle against Saruman. This part has a lot of history thrown around and it has the exciting battle sequences of Helms Deep and the battle at Isengard. This is all good and enjoyable to read.The second part is the tale of Frodo and Sam and their eventual companion Gollum as they traverse the wasted lands north of Mordor and finally into Mordor, where the story stops. There is not much going on here, and there isn't a lot of history thrown around, this is just character building for Frodo and Sam and the quest. Also the story ends abruptly, without a satisfying conclusion, in my opinion.Still overall the book is a classic, and I liked it. This is at least the tenth time I've read/heard this story in the past 25 years, so it still always gets a run every few years. The audio version I listened to sounded very professional. I also think after hearing this audio book and listening to the orc voices I believe Peter Jackson listened to this well to come up with some of the orc voices in his movies."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"this book is such a thrilling book it was hard for me to put it down. all the characters are so real but not at the same time !!!! it was also a very well writen book. tolken is such a good author. i encourage you to read the other books also they are wonderful books to."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"When I was 9 I watched the third movie with my dad, and loved it.

We got cable, and two years after my dad found the third movie on some channel. I watched all of it, I had to be forced to eat my supper and take my eyes off the screen, I couldn't take it any more. When I was 12 I got the first book from the library, since my dad wouldn't takeme to the book store, I finished it withen two weeks. It was amazing, every word was perfect, and I understood most of it. My dad is waiting until we buy it before he reads it. I love the story, it all comes together, and is all connected. My mom and sisters arn't into it though, I wish they were. I just wish there were more stars, 10,000 stars. I am now like 4 chapters from being done with the second book. and then the third.

So to actually read them for the first time was absolutely amazing. For any fan of the movies I highly recommend it! The world is much richer and more vibrant, with greater nuance and detail, and just an all around more vivid and brighter world than the movies could ever hope to portray. They still did a great job though!The characters were richly displayed and wonderfully drawn. The scenery and descriptions were like paintings with words, and the world as a whole was just unique and layered and believable. I loved reading about the mythology and history behind the story, as well as the built up languages and the songs and poetry that helped make it all have such a rich tapestry. Some people complain that it reads like a historical text and that it is dry and heavy instead of entertaining. I didn't find that true at all for me, but then again I love to read history books so perhaps that's saying something when I say I really loved this book!Since this book was supposed to be just the first two parts of a very long book it didn't follow the standard story arc and that ended up bothering me a bit. I'm used to a certain level of excitement and lead up to some sort of a climax to finish off the first book, but that didn't end up happening. A lot of the deviations that the movie made makes sense in this light. They needed to make the movie have more of a traditional arc or risk not having people come back for the rest of the series. Tolkein never intended the books to be published separately and so his story reflected that. As a result, for me, the end of the book after the Fellowship left Moria really dragged out for me. I didn't end up enjoying it as much as I had the earlier parts.All in all though I really enjoyed The Fellowship of the Ring. I highly recommend it for fantasy fans and for anyone that is a big fan of the movies. Getting to read more about your favorite characters is just one small part of getting a peek at the mythology, poetry and language of Tolkein's richly imagined world."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is the best book in the trilogy. It is more detailed then an autobiography. If you do not own this book i advise you to buy it. it has been rated the best book ever and i agree.I would also like to say the people that rate on what the book looks like are rating for the wrong reason, because i saw i guy saying it was one of the best books he has ever read but he gave it on star because how it looks. Frodo is a better character than Bilbo was in the hobbit.Loads of supporting characters:Aragorn or Strider, Faramir, Sam Gamgee, Meriadoc, Peregin, Boromir, Bilbo, Gandalf, Eomyr, and Galadriel. One problem is Aragorn or Strider should have had a bigger role. Bilbo has a big role even though he is not in it alot that is very respectable. I like that the ring did not exclude Bilbo in its power.The mission is very clear and precise but how to get it done is shady and i like that. I like how they set up the dark lord and his minions(orcs). The book set it up so i could not avoid the second book(the two towers). This is a 10 star work.This is the best book Tolkien has ever written.This a classic masterpiece and I will not dissagree. I know I am just 12 and you will think i dont know what i am talking about but i do and i would like you to read this. This book would be suitable for ages 10 and up. This would be a book any kid would like to see under the tree on Christmas.The book has loads of facts: four Family trees, the rune alphabet, and an Index split into sections for easy info. there is not enough words to explain this instant masterpiece.

He is able to describe the scenary and the situation extremely well, I feel like I'm really in a land to where the grass is fresh and green, the air is refreshing and easy to breath, and the atmoshphere is happy when he explains the Shire. Yet on the other hand he can make me feel fear by explaining the fright that the characters are experiencing.

Personally I have a very, very strong affection for this book and I think it is truly one of the most beautiful works of literature of all time. Tolkien's landscape of imagination is staggering. I understand that some people may find the songs and poems tedious to read, but I think it is these songs and poems which bring a certain magic to the whole story. This story is amazing - it is comical, adventurous and dark at the same time. I actually felt sad when it came to an end! Tolkien had this incredible talent for evoking strong emotions from the reader (well, from me anyway!); his style is simple, yet elegant and beautiful, and melancholy all at once. I thought that many of the characters were given great depth, and I became especially fond of Gandalf and Sam! And one of the things I really loved about this story was that the 'hero' who embarked on the quest to destroy the Ring, and who suffered greatly from this quest, was actually a little hobbit and not some stereotyped handsome hero. This goes to show that everyone - including little plain people - can be a hero in their own way, if they have the heart to accomplish their task.I have read other fantasy stories, but somehow I just don't find them even remotely as captivating as Tolkien's LOTR.Reading this book opened up a whole new world to me, and it was indeed a wonderful, unforgettable experience. I read this book in high school, and I've been reading it at least once every year since. I never tire of it, it is very endearing. And I am looking forward to the movie, it really does look amazing!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The exciting novel The Fellowship of the Ring I would give five stars to. If you are looking for a book with a lot of excitement and adventure this would be the book to read.This book follows up where J.R.R. Tolkien's first book, the Hobbit, leaves off. It is the first book of a three book series.The book takes place in an imaginary world called middle earth. Middle earth has all types of strange creatures in it including hobbits. Hobbits are little people that are cheerful and shy. The main character in this book is a hobbit named Frodo who must go on a perilous adventure. This book also contained a lot of sensory language. The Fellowship of the Ring also had many surprise outcomes or endings. If you try to guess what will happen next you are usually wrong.If you are interested in reading this book I sugest first reading The Hobbit, which contains an equally exciting adventure and will help explain many parts of The Fellowship of the Ring.Another interesting thing is that there is a movie coming out of The Fellowship of the Ring and this may be another incentive for reading it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I and many others will tell those of you who haven't read LOTR that if you were to read only one of the books, read this one.

In the land of Middle Earth, where hobbits, elves, dwarfs, wizards, evil kings, warriors, and a few strange marsh creatures live, why wouldn't it be enjoyable. The story is about a group that is sent on a dangerous mission to the dark land of Mordor to destroy the Ring of Power before it falls into the hands of Sauron."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I haven't actually finished reading this book but so far it is a great book. I like the way there is so much fantasy and magical beings in here, as of that my favortie type of literature is fantasy books. I tried reading The Hobbit when i was in 4th grade or something but I couldn't get interested in it because I thought it was boring. Now that I am reading the Lord Of The Rings series, I knew why I thought that this is boring.It is because I was a little kid and didn't understand it very well. What I am saying is that I think that this should be a book for kids that are in middle school or higher because it has easy understanding but you have to concentrate more on this book than other books (for me at least).I am not saying that little kids shouldn't read this, but I am recommending it to an older audience because it is a little more complex than other books. It is still one of the greatest books I have ever read (so far that is) and one of the greatest books ever written. I can't wait for the movie to come out."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Mr. Tolkien has created a truly fascinating world, of a variety of characters drawn from the well of time.

I made an exception for this one and will read the other two in the series because Fellowship of the Ring is just so well done. If you love fantasy, well, you've probably already read this one, but if it's just not your thing, try this one. It's definitely written on a much more sophisticated level than The Hobbit. It's readable, it's engaging and it doesn't go over the top at all. One warning: the novel just ends pretty much in the middle of the action, so you'll probably want to run right out and pick up The Two Towers--just be prepared to devote a large block of time to reading the series. Have fun."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book is the finest piece of writing that I have ever read. The Fellowship of the Ring though it is a rather old book, it still is very good. The Author starts out by telling about the events of what happened in the book The Hobbit and then goes on to tell about the events that currently are happening in Hobbiton, which is where the majority of hobbits in the story live and are from. Without giving away too much, the story then takes a turn for the worst, and the hero of the story, Bilbo Baggins, Must take the ring of power once held by Sauron, where is must be destroyed. The bulk of the first book in the series is about the journey to rivendell, which is where the elves are located, and then they must get south to the area close to Rohan and Gondor, the humans civilizations in the story. The book in my opinion is a good book because the characters are all developed very well, and they all have a back-story behind them, and they all have something to tell and for the most part seems blank in the story. The author is very descriptive in his writing, and likes to share a lot of details with the reader that would normally be left out of other books because of time restraints, or other reasons that need not be discussed. The basic factor behind this book is that the author is so good that the book works around the few problems that it has, and works through them with tremendous steam driving force. The problems that the book mostly experiences are that, the author sometimes goes too in depth with detail, and he sometimes drags on and on with certain parts. Some may find this very interesting, but from where I stand it goes on too long some times, and doesn't really progress to anything of real importance that may be used by the reader. But some believe that when the author goes into this extreme depth that he gets a point across, he sometimes does this but other times the detail just goes on and on without getting anywhere. The major strong points of this movie are that the characters are given real depth and they know what their doing based on what that type of character would normally decide in that situation, and not what the author would decide if He was there in that condition, and based on this the book accomplishes the factor that those characters have a very humanistic quality to them, and they always know where they are going based on their conditions. The characters though there are many of them, all have a very unique quality that they share with one another and themselves that they always want to accomplish a certain goal for the group and themselves. For example the character Boromir in the story is from the nation of Gondor, he comes with the Fellowship in about the middle of the story, when the fellowship is first formed. He comes to accomplish his own goals with the ring; he wishes to use the ring for good and not to destroy it, without giving too much away this will eventually bring about the end of him, because of his greed for the ring, which shows real humanistic quality and how someone would genuinely react to this sort of instance that may occur for them. Overall I would say that this book is a genuinely the best that I've read, for the most part it overcomes the obstacles and passes through the trenches to become an award-winning book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"When I first started this book I thought it to be another boring fantasy adventure book, then Frodo left Hobbiton and from there-on-out I was compleatly hooked. The overall description of this is exciting and overwelming. The songs in this book are very creative, it makes Edgar Allen Poe looked like some fithe grade writing assiment. {SORRY EDGAR}! The thing I like most is the old-language he uses. I mean you don't hear &quot;hither and thither&quot; every day. I strongly recommend this for any reader.

They are all off on an action packed adventure to destroy a ring of power that evil is trying to get their hands on. If they do there is no stopping them from conquering good.

I have no Idea where he came up with this wonderful story, AMAZING that someone could just pull an entire world out of thin air with such clairity, down to the moss on a single stone!The book was also refreshingly free of lots of writing cliches (how rare!)The only bad thing about this series is the sleep you'll lose from staying up all night reading it.... You wont be able to put it down! I read it in 2 days."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The movie version is good but the book is where you'll find the true joy. Tolkien can be hard to read if you don't have patience and a strong imagination. Some parts of the book are long in detail and short in happenings. Others seem too quick and light on detail. Tolkien sometimes skips around and you don't get to see everything that's happened. Instead you experience from outside view. But all this is as it's meant to be. Being with a single character every moment and knowing exactly what's happening at every instant would make for a boring read. Tolkien weaves magic by keeping you guessing and not always letting you see exactly what's happening. For the impatient reader I say stick with it. It's a journey worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book really comes alive in the first chapters. The action may be a little bit slow in the beginning, but the wonderful details and descriptions of every part of the world really make this story seem real.

From the start of this book, with Bilbo leaving the Shire, and giving everything he has to his nephew, Frodo. Gandalf the wizard then tells him that a ring bilbo left to him is really Sauron's One Ring of Power, and if he recovers it, it spells doom for all races of Middle-earth. Thus Frodo, with the help of three of his friends, makes it to the house of Elrond, where he seeks further council, and then heads off to Mount Doom with 8 other companions to destroy the ring and defeat the Dark Lord.

Not to mention the very helpful map included at the start of the book which guided me through my reading. Very descriptive --- even the unimaginative cannot help but picture Tolkien's world vividly.I started with the Hobbit & moved on to this & immediately continued to read Books 2 & 3. Well, I have to admit, I had an overload of the Hobbit world but I appreciated the entire story more, since I view it as just one long continuing saga of the Company's mission to save Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book is a great book but you have to be ready for the difficulties of reading it. It is hard to get into the language and fully understanding it. Sometimes you will have to read the same sentence over and over to finally get the meaning. I love the characters and as the book goes on it is easier to read. I can almost put myself in middle earth and feel like I am there with Frodo and everyone else. Just don't over analyse the language and try to remember everything that goes on, that would make reading this book like a headache. Your best bet is just to read and enjoy and go along with the characters and try to image what the places look like, etc... this is how I enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Frodo, a young hobbit, has inherited a magic ring from his relative, Bilbo. Little does he know, that this ring can rule and destroy all of Middle-Earth. He and a Fellowship of nine must destroy this ring, or Middle-Earth will perish. Together, they seek Mt. Doom, the only force that can destroy the ring. They face many perils. In the end, for the most part, they succeed.This book was very exciting, I enjoyed it. It was Full of action and adventure. This Fellowship of Nine faced many dark creatures, and with the help of Gandalf, the strongest in their party, were victorious. Many demonic creatures are after them, they want to help their master, Sauron, get the ring. With this ring, Sauron can control all of Middle-Earth, but these nine devoted people will go to any lengths to make sure this doesn't happen. This book kept me on the edge of my seat.My favorite part of the book is when they had to pass through the Mines of Moria, a dark, dreadful place full of goblins and a firey demon. Gimli, the dwarf, helps Gandalf navigate through the dark mines. These mines were once inhabited by dwarves, and Gimli used to live in them. During the end, the Fellowship is attacked by Goblins. They fight them the best they can. They flee towards the exit when something bigger and more evil attacks them. A large, fiery, demon seeks to destroy them and get the ring to Sauron. Gandalf destroys this demon, but in the process of doing so, kills himself."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The first part of The Lord of the Rings is an amazing story of courage, friendship, and the war between good and evil. the story is about a young hobbit and his friends. Frodo Baggins is given the responsibility of destroying the One Ring, the ring that will give the evil Sauron the power to destroy all of Middle Earth. He leaves to the Cracks of Doom with nine companions, forming the Fellowship of the Ring. The Felllowsip is being pursued by the evil Ringwraiths, servents of Sauron. With the orcs and other evil creatures of Sauron at their trail, the weight of the ring on Frodo is terrible. As the Ringwraiths grow near, the desire to put on the ring is tremedous, and that is the one thing that will bring them nearer.

I can't wait to get into the other books."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The entire Lord of The Ring trilogy, starting here, is that rare thing so often mentioned in literature but so rarely true -- the undisputed masterpiece. This book shows that Tolkien's imagination must have been truly boundless. It starts the trilogy by recounting the events of The Hobbit, adding and greatly enrichening them, and weaving them into the tale of the Ring. It then goes on to tell of the Fellowship and sets the characters off on their journey. The book is so epic, so wide in scope that readers come away feeling that they have just read a true account, an actual happening from an actual world; such is the book's power. Tolkien has really described the whole world of Middle-Earth and its people in such striking and vivid detail that one can only be in awe. Apart from the striking array of richly drawn characters, a marvel in itself, Tolkien has created languages and entire histories for his characters, Hobbits of course being gone into in particular depth. This is a tale so epic, so novel, so bold that you are bound to like it regardless of your literary conventions. Tolkien's writing is very smooth -- though archaic seeming and a lot different from what we now see, which of course only adds to the marvel and sense of wonder -- and very poetic at times. It almost feels like reading poetry. There are of course lots of actual songs also. Not that the book is perfect. It is a bit overlong, and some parts drag. The walking bits seem particularly slow, as does The Council of Elrond, necessary though it is. There are also too many songs for my taste, ingenious though they are. Still, few books come closer to mastery. This is one of the books that all should be able to say they've read."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book is about the journey of Frodo and his companions. Frodo is a hobbit who lives in the Shire with his uncle, Bilbo Baggins. On the day that the book starts, it is Frodo's and Bilbo's birthday and Bilbo celebrates with a grand party with presents for all. In the middle of the party Bilbo vanishes and leaves a ring for Frodo. This ring is the beginning of his journey and the end of his normal life. Frodo learns of the power of the ring and of the dark forces of Sauron, who wish to steal the ring and slay its bearer. Frodo begins his journey with his companion Sam Gamgee. In the rest of the book, they acquire more alliances and companions to aid them in their quest to destroy the ring and save middle earth, and this is known as The Fellowship of the Ring.This book is recommended because of the suspense of Frodo's journey and the story behind it. There are many good chapters in the book, and it will rarely leave readers with a boring moment. Readers may wish that the book had is a bit more detail on the story behind the Ring Wraiths of Mordor. The book is a bit hard to understand if read through too fast because of the old style speech that some of the characters use. In some chapters, readers must really pay attention, such as The Council of Elrond, because of the detail Tolkien goes into and what will become of the ring. If one likes fantasy books with elves, orcs, goblins and wizards, read this book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This trilogy has to be one of the greatest epic ever written.

Kids would love this book as well."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I have read a great deal of boring books in my life, but this one might take the cake. When the reproductive cycle of algae is more interesting than this work of fiction, you know you're in trouble.Let me sum up the plot of this 400+ pg book for you: Frodo and co pack their bags, rest, eat a good meal, and walk. Walk, walk, walk through the forests, walk to Elrond's house, walk to Moria, walk to where the elves live. AND NOTHING EVER HAPPENS. Occasionally, some &quot;dark forces&quot; strike, but it is all very anti-climactic. Tolkien's writing style is never intense, so if you're getting drowsy as you read, you might gloss over the fact that the characters were just attacked and think that they were just walking as usual.Ok- let's give Tolkien credit for creating this extremely detailed world, new languages, for defining the genre and influencing generations of fantasy writers to come. Fine. But plot? No. Characterization? None whatsoever. Entertainment? You've got to be kidding.I really wanted to like this book. Everybody else does, even people who don't generally like to read. What am I missing? Perhaps that I never read this book as a child?Tolkien has inspired some really amazing artwork and the previews for the coming movies look awesome. I will keep reading and hopefully the next two books of the series will be better. I can't really imagine that they can get worse."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The best review I ever read of this book was by one of Tolkien's own circle of friends. After hearing Tolkien read aloud yet another chapter of the Ring trilogy, the visitor exclaimed &quot;Not another goddam elf!!??&quot;. Tolkien's work is so dense and slow moving you wonder if it is an adventure or a still photograph. He has no concept of moving the narrative ahead. His dialogue is wooden. The Hobbits sound like robots. His poetry is leaden. What is the point of this book? I can't figure out why people praise it so! And why is it that whenever anyone does a take on a mythically powerful ring, they need such absurdly great lengths to do it (hello Richard Wagner). I am utterly puzzled by the enthusiasm this book stirs up in people. To me, it is a mindless, poorly written, utter bore."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Last year I read the Hobbit and thought it was pretty good, so I decided to read the LOTR. About halfway through The Fellowship Of The Ring, it started to get really boring and I about gave up. But for some reason I decided to read the whole thing. Finally, I got through the book and bought the second book, The Two Towers, thinking it would be more exciting and that there would be more fighting. But, was I wrong. I finally gave up at about 4/5 the way through. A few months back, however, I decided to give the LOTR another try because everyone kept talking about how great it was. I painfully got through the first book for the second time and was halfway through the second book when I just got so bored I started skiping pages. Finally, I got through the second book and I guess if you read the first two books you have to read the third. So, I bought the last book and pretty much skimmed through all the pages. In fact, all I can remember is how the ring was destroyed! I wanted to like LOTR, I really did, but I guess I never will. I don't know why people worship these books, there's nothing exciting about them."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"this book was so boring and bland, tolkein dwells on the obvius and never loks back there is no excitement, if you want REAL fantasy read TERRY BROOKS THE SWORD OF SHANNARA!

It was a waste of my money. And also a waste of my little time left here on earth because I will soon be gone into the unknown world."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Boring. Here are the reasons why this book is so incredibly boring, slow moving, and often frustrating.ok, first of all, Tolkien spent more time describing the scenery than he did anything else.There's hardly any character development. I mean, honestly, the book is more surroundings rather than narration. Plus, the book was just too wordy.Not enough action. Where are the battles? Tolkien had the talent of creating a good battle scene, but, unfortunately, there were hardly any action scenes, and the ones that were there you had to get through atleast a hundred pages of fluff, and in the end the battle scene was only two pages long!Needed more excitement. Oh man, I don't even wanna begin to tell you how much minimal, (yes, MINIMAL) excitement this book has. The movie was ten times better, no make that one hundred times better. No, make that a thousand time better.Overall, I wouldn't be willing to spend one dime on any of these books. I read one hundred pages of the fellowship, and it was just so boring. Where were all the good battle scenes? Where were the monsters? There were hardly any other creatures of interest besides Orcs and Hobbits. That's basicly it.I just don't like any of the lord of the rings books. I want action books, not only with action, though. I don't expect an action scene every two pages, I just want an action scene atleast every one hundred pages! I also want a book that has SOME KIND OF EXCITEMENT OR A HOOK! this book didn't supply that at all. Plus, it's frustrating. Why is it frustrating? Because it has nothing which makes the quality of a book good. That's it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"There is so much to be said against The Lord Of The Rings that it shouldn't be worth the effort. A book that, judged by conventional standards, contains so many appalling lapses of taste and so much coarse vulgarity really ought, by now, to have faded from sight.From many points of view, it has dated badly, and its aesthetics and politics are now so odd that you might be forgiven for thinking, as Peter Jackson's new trilogy of movies rapidly approaches, that its appeal, after all, is one of a delicious period piece.But all judgements have always been confounded by this extraordinary book. It ought to be too long, and too pointlessly abstruse, to command wide popularity; it is not a book for children, and yet not a book for adults either; its style is too elevated for popular literature, but too coarse for &quot;high&quot; literature. There is no reason on earth for anyone to like it, and there are plenty of readers who still think that the judgement of JRR Tolkien's first publisher - who was surprised when it started to look as if the book might make as much as 1,000 - was much sounder than the people who, in the past 50 years, have bought more than 100 million copies of the book.However, by now, The Lord Of The Rings is unarguably a part of English literature. Contrary to popular belief, 100 million readers can perfectly well be wrong; but the continuing life of the book cannot just be ignored. It is just there, massively.But, in many ways, it is just awful. It is amazingly humourless, and Tolkien knows it - over and over again, he writes &quot; 'Come, master Pippin!' Gandalf laughed&quot; - a very bad sign, all those laughing wizards. You don't have to be politically correct to be mildly alarmed by some aspects of it. Apart from Eowyn, the women in it are not madly significant, or allowed to do anything much. There is Galadriel, who stays at home being Wise; there are Goldberry or Rose, who stay at home being Patient Helpmeets; there are Lobelia Sackville Baggins and Shelob, who stay at home being completely ghastly.It is an appallingly nave fantasy of good and evil races; mostly, the good people are tall and blond and speak Nordic or Celtic languages, and the bad ones are dark and hairy and talk a sort of Persian - those guttural dwarves are allowed a sort of virtue, but it is rather grudging in tone. Sam Gamgee is a loyal retainer of the most frightful variety, still &quot;Mr Frodo-ing&quot; away and knowing his place 1,000 pages in; basically, he is Dickens's Sam Weller, and Tolkien couldn't even be bothered to change his name.Tolkien probably knew as much about language as anyone, but it would be fair to say that his interest stopped at grammatical inflection. The Lord of the Rings, by ordinary standards, is just badly written. Great swathes of it are in a sort of Ben-Hur biblical: &quot;And all the host laughed and wept, and in the midst of their merriment and tears the clear voice of the minstrel rose like silver and gold, and all men were hushed. And he sang to them... until their hearts, wounded with sweet words, overflowed, and their joy was like swords...&quot;There are endless mock subtleties of the &quot;It seemed to Sam that he saw...&quot; variety. And there is, too, that infallible sign of a really bad writer, the overuse of the word &quot;suddenly&quot;. Everything in The Lord of the Rings happens suddenly, dozens of times a chapter. And yet it is one of those very rare books that confounds all objections, all standards, and which in the end may make its own standards. Nobody, I think, has ever produced anything with the imaginative density and intricacy of the book. The reviewer's clich&eacute; is, for once, apt here; he really created a world.The power and resonance of the book come in part from an ethical debate that is much more adult than one remembers - it is haunted by the cruelty of its age, and is not, in fact, just about the alternative of Good and Evil, the elves and the orcs, but largely about the possibility of becoming evil through the best intentions. It is really about slow corruption, and is at its finest in the portraits of Saruman and Denethor, characters who it is not difficult to parallel in 20th-century history.But its claim on real greatness comes from the sense of huge, half-glimpsed vistas of history and language, the illusion (which may not be an illusion) that its author knew exactly the languages each of its characters would have spoken and understood the events of ancient history that lead all of them to act as they do.In a realistic novelist, writing about a real war, this would be a remarkable feat of intelligence; when you consider that Tolkien invented absolutely everything - the backstory, the languages, the geography - it quickly becomes almost incredible. At some point, the critics and the literati have to admit that they were just wrong, and, by now, it is probably time to start considering his extraordinary flight of imagination as one of the key works of modern literature."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I read the &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; section and the first chapter and then immediatly returned it to my library. I couldn't keep my eyes open it was so boring."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I'm not going to tell you not to read _The Lord of the Rings_ just because it bored me stiff; too many people have loved it for you to take my advice instead of theirs.

Tolkien was a storyteller of genius!!!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Obviously with Tolkien, it's all been said before, but having just re-read Lord of the Rings again I felt inspired to add my bit. I cannot think of another author in any genre who has put in the same about of work and passion into the background for his or her novel. Tolkien not only create a completely believable universe in the form of Middle-Eart, he create languages, a history, politics and religion unparalleled in complexity or scope. Lord of the Rings is the template from which almost all subsequent fantasy has been cut. It doesn't take a lot to see the parallels between Goodkind and Jordan's first novels and Tolkiens, the exhausting flight in the face of deadly and unexpected danger, the reluctant hero and even the black riders in the case of Jordan. So compelling and complete is Tolkien's dominance of this genre that it will take another genius of his calibre to truly innovate in every respect. With the film's of the same name fothcoming over the next three years I would recommend everyone get a copy a read or re-read what has to rank as one of the greatest works of literature produced in the last century to see if Peter Jackson can truly bring to life the majesty of Tolkien's world."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Nobody has surpassed Lord of the Rings. Read it and you'll see.Tolkien spent decades creating the backdrop for the story, a tale that literally fills volumes and is also well worth reading (Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales I &amp; II, Lost Tales (all volumes)). SF/fantasy writers today could learn something from this astounding amount of preparation."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"He is the Shakespeare and Homer of the 20th century. He takes a genre once associated only with acne-faced teenage boys and elevates it to literary excellence. His selection as Writer of the Century was well-deserved to say the least.Written mostly during Europe's WWII years, the symbolism of that war lies heavily in his novels (See especially &quot;The Scouring of the Shire&quot; chapter in Vol. 3 &quot;The Return of the King&quot;)His epic story has a background color and richness that rarely exists in today's literary works. He built his own languages from the syllables on up, his appendices and notes lend depth and history to his works, he is truly the only fantasy write to literally create a world. Every sentence that spills from the mouths of his characters hints at a world that we are only scratching the surface of.The poetry and lore that his characters express hint at the many volumes that Tolkien could have written if time would have allowed it. Rarely have I seen a fantasy writer who could put such a large amount of high quality verse and rhyme into their works.Almost every fantasy author of the last 30 years must tip their hat in Tolkien's direction. I have yet to find a noteable fantasy author who didn't mention Tolkien in their list of inspiring/influencing authors.I can only hope that on the eve of the long awaited Lord of the Rings movies that would-be Tolkien Cinema fans take the time to read the epic fantasy saga that made the movies possible."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The writings of Professor Tolkien are absolutely Timeless. These books are the gauge by-which all Fantasy books are measured. The Hobbit and The Trilogy have been the Inspiration for decades of works by other authors, yet I have not ever seen these works surpassed by anyone. Terry Brooks is the only author I have read who even compares to J.R.R. Tolkien and his epic style. I became fascinated with The Hobbit and Trilogy when I was in the seventh grade. I borrowed them from a friend and snuck them home. I was completely enthralled with the world Tolkien created. I was not allowed to read anything that was even remotely related to Wizards, Witches, Astrology, D&amp;D, etc., so these books were like nothing I had ever seen, before. I was captivated and felt the call to become a Writer. Previously, the poetry and such that we were studying in school BORED me to tears. I found my schooling to be mind-numbingly BORING and Tolkien became my Inspiration to Learn, create Poetry, Write stories, Study, become an Anthropologist, delve into Masonic Lore and so much more.... Throughout High-School, I had pictures of Prof. Tolkien on my wall and I desired to be like him. Not-only was he the Greatest Fantasy Writer the world has known, but he was &quot;Professor of Anglo-Saxon, at Oxford University, from 1925 to 1945....and professor of English Language and Literature....and a Fellow of Merton College from '45 to his retirement in '59.&quot; Check out his translations of (book title:)&quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo&quot; (J.R.R. Tolkien) Also, Prof. Tolkien wrote wonderful stories like &quot;Smith of Wooten Major (&amp;) Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; for children. Pop those titles into the search box! I can honestly say that reading Tolkien changed my life...for the Better! Tolkien created the highest standards of writing for generations of authors....I am quite sure he would be deeply disappointed with the majority of books published today, with numerous spelling errors and pathetic grammar. I believe Tolkien is a god-send to English teachers. Perhaps, he can still inspire young people to elevate their Writing and English skills, from beyond. I would fight to keep his works on the shelves. I was not allowed to do my Senior Thesis about this author, despite the fact that he is such an amazing author and advocate of Literature. I lost interest in doing my thesis and threw something together at the last minute. Perhaps teachers should Recognize the potential for inspiring youth, via the works of J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Tolkein is a master story teller. His stories have entertained people for years. A great choice.

This book cannot be classified as fantasy, epic or anything because it truly stands alone. I was a bit suprised to see it only got 4 1/2 stars, but then I read the reviews. I can understand the frustration of the half dozen people who gave it one star. By their own admission, most are under eighteen and were perhaps forced to read it. I also put this book down as boring when I was in high school because it was like taking a valium; it put me to sleep. I picked it up again when I was about 28 and could not believe how good it was. It is undoubtedly one of the great English language works ever created. Over the next ten years I re-read my copy of the trilogy so many times it literally fell apart. My wife gave me a deluxe edition a few years ago and I once again cruised through it this summer. I don't attempt to read it word for word but simply dwell in Middle Earth for a while. I am now 41 and appreciate it more than ever. So if you are having trouble with it now, wait a few years and try again. You may eventually catch up to it. Incidentally, my nephew gave me Terry Brooks' first Elf Queen book, and I found it very entertaining. But not memorable."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is the first book in the trilogy; and even as a standalone it's a masterpiece, if any author is to be viewed as a master; as they talk about Mozart, etc. Tolkien is to be for his lifework. The fellowship of the ring is from the beginning to the end a linguistic maze; those who have troubles with beautiful; almost poetic, language; will not appreciate this, but set aside that; and look only at the contains of this work, and you'll realize what a brilliant mind Tolkien had, noticeably is that he took much inspiration from Nordic, Preussic and Greek mythology; which adds to the atmosphere and feeling of this book, everything feels real; authentic, as if it was written in experience, I've read David Eddings, I've read Elizabeth Moon, but they are just mere pale copies compared to J.R.R Tolkien, (not saying they're bad though, just emphasizing on how great Tolkien is). This is a book that really is best experienced alone, in a dark room, with some soft moody music and just enough light to read, be terrified, be amazed, be astounded.To those who have yet to read this, and these books: I am in envy, the first experience of them is incredible, just put a little effort into it, and you will be rewarded times 1000."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is the best fantasy novel that I've ever read! The character development and plot depth is something that you don't find in every novel. The other two books in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; series are extremely good as well, but I'd have to say that &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is the best of the three. This is, in my opinion, the best fantasy/adventure novel ever written! The preclude to it &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is also a worthy tale and should be read before the actual &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy.

It's narrated by one man, Rob Inglis, doing the entire thing as he apparently used to on stage. He does the voices, he sings the songs. He also did The Hobbit for Recorded Books, and Ursula LeGuin's Earthsea books. He's marvelous. It's like having a wizened grandfather read you a story.

Rob Inglis does a great job reading.But: If you plan on downloading CDs onto your MP3 player, keep reading.The book is broken into 48 CDs (all 3 books (16 CDs per book)). And each CD is broken up into 3 min tracks (about 275 tracks per disc).And no freaking consistent organization.Each CD has a completely (ugh!!!) different way of titling the tracks.So, my Ipod now has 800+ 3 minute LOTR tracks . . . in no particular order!!!There's no way I can listen to the book in chronological order. Instead my Ipod shuffles randomly between tracks, changing every 3 minutes.It's a disaster.But I love this book. So, I'm listening anyway.It's the equivalent of cutting the book into 800 pieces, throwing them in the air, and then reading them: William S. Burroughs, please meet J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is a fantasy book written by J.R.R. Tolkien. It takes place in a land known as Middle Earth. There are elves, wizards, dwarves, orcs, and hobbits. This story appeals to readers young and old. For someone who enjoys other fantasy books, this would be a great book to have because you can read it over and over again. However, this is only one book in The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. To be able to read the entire tale you also need to purchase The Two Towers and The Return of the King which complete the story. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book because of my own love of fantasy. I read this book for my school PACES Paideia and they provide a Study Guide that can help you with the book. It is divided into weeks and it gives you different assignments to do. For each week there is vocabulary, parent questions (questions for the parent to ask the student), occasionally a small writing assignment, and a theme tracker chart which helps get the literary elements straight. The study guide really helped me understand some of the deeper meanings of the story not just what is obvious to an average reader. This book is perfect for any fantasy lover or just a reader looking for a new adventure. Even if you do not like reading much you will cling to this book because it is extremely interesting and an overall great book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Classic book. Can read over and over. Much better then the movies!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Having never before read the \\"Lord of the Rings\\", or even seen the movies, I decided to give the \\"Fellowship of the Rings\\" a try to see what all the fuss is about. I wasn't disappointed. Tolkien presents a stunning world of ancient legends, characters and vivid scenery that is as real to the reader as any movie could produce. This is a stunning work and well worthy of all the praises it has received.The most potent aspect of this novel is the vivid descriptions as the voyagers trod through the vast lands of Middle-earth on their epic quest. Tolkien describes sweeping panoramic vistas, roaring rivers, and foreboding mountains with such detail and elegance as to transport the reader into his own world. Indeed, if the reader has but an ounce of imagination, it is not hard to picture the glory of Middle-earth with all of its inhabitants, such as the majestic and grand elves of Lothlorien, or the loathsome and evil Gollum and the Dark Riders. Yet, the detail is not too burdensome. Tolkien has a gift for using just the right words to paint a vivid scene, yet to not burden the reader with too much unneeded detail.Tolkien's Middle Earth comes through as a mythological wonderland, one that has survived for ages of legends and kings, tales and history. Tolkien's attention to detail is remarkable. Not only in the songs and language of the different races, but also in the history and legends of the ancient days. There is a long, detailed chronology of the different races. There are a myriad of tales of the ancient kings and rulers of Middle-earth. Indeed, this may prove to be too burdensome for the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" novice, as the novel begins with a lengthy account of the Middle-earth and its history. However, these stories are interwoven into the very fabric of Middle-earth that makes it so real, yet lend it a mythological aura.The recurring theme of the corruption of power illustrates the peril of the One Ring, the ring who brings its wearer ultimate power. Yet, this power is ultimately evil, for it will corrupt the wearer, no matter how inherently good he is. This aura of power corrupts even the most pure of heart. This is a stern warning that the pursuit of power will inevitably lead to evil, despite what the original intentions may be.Another warning is about the pursuit of knowledge, for knowledge is a kind of power. It is the dwarves and their pursuit of knowledge that originally awoke the \\"evil\\" lying beneath the mountains. Although knowledge is usually desirable, Tolkien makes a distinction between knowledge and wisdom. Wisdom puts forth a moral dimension to knowledge, for it is knowing the consequences of actions, and also the ability to choose between good and evil.It is significant that Frodo, a hobbit of diminutive size and stature, is chosen as the ring bearer. The hobbits are usually only concerned with their own petty lives in the Shire and love good food and drink. Yet, Frodo is chosen to be the penultimate bearer of the One Ring. For strength and might do not make a hero, but a strong heart and iron will to resist temptation are the rigid foundations of a hero. Frodo may start out as a young, inexperienced hobbit, yet he leaves on an epic quest and is determined, despite all odds, to complete his mission. Indeed, Frodo proves that even the unlikeliest of heroes can shine when their time comes due.So whether you're an avid fan and have read the books and seen the movies many times, or whether you're a Johnny-come-lately like myself, this novel is a must-read. Now it's on to the part 2 of the saga - \\"The Two Towers.\\""},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"There is no need to review Tolkien's work, his plots and characters, here. But this is simply the best audio version there is. Peter Jackson's movie trilogy is great, the BBC audio versions are fine, but this version is unabridged and that is what matters. All of the events, all of the poetry, all of the imagery, are here. Rob Inglis does a superb job of narration, with enough vocal variation to distinguish the characters. If the Lord of the rings is in your blood, and Tolkien's words are part of your soul, then this is the version for you. I lost the ability to read, to hold a book, to turn a page, but now I can go to Middle Earth and any part of Middle Earth any time I choose. And that my dears is precious!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The first part of the trilogy that helped fantasy get where it is today. If you've seen the movies and not read the books, you are still missing so much of what Tolkien has to offer."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"A new wave of readers are devouring the Tolkien books, thanks to the arrival of the epic movie hits. And that is definitely a good thing, because this trilogy not only spurred the fantasy genre into a respectable position, but also provided the template for virtually every elf, dwarf, lost king, and medieval fantasy world since. It's also a darn good read.We open some sixty years after the events of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; -- Bilbo Baggins is older, not much wiser, substantially wealthier, and quite eccentric (one not-so-affectionate nickname is &quot;Mad Baggins&quot;). He has also adopted his bright young cousin Frodo, who was orphaned at a young age and had led a rather fractured life since then. On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron. It inevitably corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him, that will take him across Middle-Earth to the evil land of Mordor.Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (although they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were. Tolkien also demonstrated his skill in keeping the &quot;feel&quot; of the different races separate; without being too obvious, he emphasized the subtle differences between Elves, Dwarves, hobbits and Men. There are faint but distinguishable differences in their speech patterns and thought processes. You could never get Frodo mixed up with Legolas.Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as &quot;The Hobbit&quot;: it's lighter and more cheerful. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't elaborate on the such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers. Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions. Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.Frodo himself is the quintessential &quot;little guy&quot; hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. Self-sacrifice is his middle name. Unlike Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter, Frodo also has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person, an everyman... or should I say &quot;everyhobbit.&quot;We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of &quot;Hobbit&quot; -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. Sam, though not yet fully into the selfless role he plays in books two and three, aptly demonstrates his loyalty and love for Frodo, as well as displaying his progression from a shy young hobbit to a bolder, more decisive person. Merry and Pippin aren't quite into their full roles either, but they are excellent: Merry is mature beyond his years, and Pippin is (and I say this with all affection) a goodhearted flake. Elf and Dwarf fans will find their enjoyment in Legolas and Gimli, who initially grate on each other, but show the beginnings of a loyal friendship.Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today. A must-read -- and then go watch the movies again."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I chose to read \\"Fellowship of The Ring\\" for a class project. It is a very well written book, which is the first of a trilogy. The author of the series of books is J.R.R Tolkien. It is a wonderful story of adventure in a different world.It all starts with a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, finding a ring. A hobbit is a man like creature but only smaller. He then gives the ring to his nephew Frodo Baggins. Then Gandalf the grey a wizard friend of Frodo's figures out that Frodo's ring is the ring of power made in the mountain of Doom. It is made to control all the other rings and all the inhabitants of Middle Earth. It can only be destroyed in the Mountain of Doom where it was created. So Frodo sets off on a journey to destroy the ring. Along with him were Sam, Merry, and Pippin some of Frodo's hobbit buddies. During their long journey they stopped at Rivendale, a place where elves live. Then there Frodo meets up with Gandalf and other great warriors. The warriors consisted of two men, an elf, a wizard, a dwarf, and the four hobbits. Then they all head for the Mountain of Doom. They come upon many obstacles and different adventures.Tolkien writes this book marvelously. The way he describes the lands they go through makes you feel like you are there in middle earth. This book is for anyone who loves adventure tales of good and evil. This book has a great storyline and will keep you hooked the whole time you are reading it. This book can be read by people of all ages. Everybody that loves the idea of a different world will love this book. It is definitely a great book and should be read by everybody."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"After seeing the movie based off this book in December of 2001, I decided to read the book itself about nine months later. It was a great decision to do so. Even though the movie was a spectacular display of making an imaginary world come alive, it was not nearly as enthralling as this simply incredible book. I was just amazed with how much information and how many details were given about middle-earth and the characters within. Whenever I was reading this book my mind left my body and went to Tolkien's amazingly enchanted world.With J.R.R. Tolkien's fluid diction and incredible use of imagery, this book is a page-turner that will keep one up way into the middle of the night. If there is a problem with this book (and movie) it is the fact that it does not end, at least yet. In order to figure out the ending one must read the next two books in the series: &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and &quot;Return of the King.&quot; I have not read either one of these, but I think I will continue with my pace of seeing the movie and then reading the book nine months later. I would also recommend this method to anyone who has not seen or read any of &quot;The Lord of The Rings&quot; books or movies because seeing the movie first helps put faces with names while reading the book. No matter what method one uses to read these enchanting fantasy novels by J.R.R. Tolkien, I recommend that they are read with an open mind and a will to be enthralled. This book was simply incredible."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book was really great!

I definatly recommend this book for any fantasy lovers!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"~If you were a Tolkien fan before the movie came out, I think rereading the series is worthwhile. If you have never read the series, but liked the movie, you will love reading these books. I read the The Fellowship of the Ring before it came out last year, and I just finished reading it again. I was surprised by how much I had forgotten and by how much I replaced what Tolkien wrote with what the movie showed. The movie is good, but it is different from the novel. Tolkien's style and~~ descriptive prose make the novel worth reading. As I said the movie added to the novel in some cases, but it left much more out. Adventures with Tom Bombadil and the journey to Rivendell are shortened dramatically or left out of the movie.This novel opens my imagination. That is why I love Tolkien's work. It is easy to read and allows your mind to waunder. I can feel myself in the journey. Hiking cross country with Aragorn and the hobbits, cutting through the forest and swamps with~~ Sam, Frodo, and Pippen. I am there. The animals, the Shire both have special places in my imagination. The nights before entering Moria. The wolves, the beast of the lake, the onslaught of orcs in moria, although I have read it before, I can still feel the fear and hope the company feels. Tolkien's greatest gift to me, was the inspiration he has given my imagination.~"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This story was different from many others I have read. It really gives in-depth details and allows you to imagine the setting clearly. There were very exciting and fun parts of this book that keeps your attention.

The book is based on a long journey of a group of people across various lands throught you get this great sense of an adventure.Looking back on the story as if you were actually their yourself is not very difficult with this book. The problem is that the book leaves you at a very odd place. This seemed strange even though I do know of the rest of the series. This was one of the better stories I have ever heard even though I am only a third of the way through, but I defenitly recomend reading the rest of the series along with it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"What Clancy and Ludlum did for mystery trillers and King did for horror Tolken did for fantasy. When I first read the book 4 years ago I was amazed at the great attention to detail Tolken paid to the world he had created inside of his head. This isn't just a story of 9 guys being chased through the woods for 400 pages, it is about their myths, culture history and way of life. Now some have criticized the language and I can see where that would throw some people off, however if you just let it flow over you it can really get insense. Now personally I myself feel a little annoyed with the characters seemingly endless urge to compose songs and poems, but I can see how this adds a lot to the storyOverall-This book is incredible and you need to read it become you see the movie, otherwise you will be absolutely clueless."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I must admit, I read this book purely because of the movie, partly because I&iexcl;m curious about the similarities between the two and partly because everyone says it&iexcl;s a good book.After reading the book, I&iexcl;m going to agree that it is a good book. IF you can read through the first 100 or so pages and have a faint recollection of what it was about. It&iexcl;s not that it&iexcl;s written badly, more like it&iexcl;s written too detailed, often I&iexcl;ll find myself reading a long paragraph and catch my mind wandering instead of taking in what&iexcl;s happening in the story. And I can tell you, it&iexcl;s extremely irritating to read the same paragraph a hundred times.For the most part, this is a serious book, it also contains some comic relief from one of the supporting characters like Merry or Pippin.There are heaps of action and adventure in the story C At Moria, meeting the nine riders and a lot more. But unfortunately there are also quite a bit of boring parts, mostly describing the scenery, that would've been fine if it wasn't described every other page.But there&iexcl;s a reason why this is a classic, it is an engaging and grand story, and if you haven&iexcl;t read it, definitely do, even if it is just to find out what the fuss is all about."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"My mother has been reading this book aloud to us.

Actually, I was forced by my English teacher. I thought, since the book was good enough to have a movie after it, it probably wouldn't be such a bad book.Well, I started to read the prolouge. Bad idea. My biggest advice is, DO NOT READ THE PROLOUGE!!! It took me days to get through the ten pages of it. This part is so confusing and worthless information that you really don't need to make sense of the book. Anyways, the rest of the book was very slow. If you want a quick read, this book is not for you. The details go on and on and there really is no action what so ever.However, this book wasn't all bad. I got through it, but I could only read about ten pages at a time or i would lose intrest. At the end it is a nice story but I don't know if the pain reading it amounted to the pleasure of finishing it afterwards."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I've given a lot of good reviews on Amazon--generally, I don't review books I don't like because I don't finish them--but The Fellowship of the Ring is the absolute crown jewel of fantasy novels. In Tolkien's original plan, this was merely the first part of a single, enormous book: The Lord of the Rings. The afore-mentioned superlative could apply to the entire series, but being quite large enough on its own without the added weight of its successors, Fellowship is the all-time classic.I feel sorry for anyone who saw the movie before reading this book. I have two reasons for this: firstly, all those moviegoers, even if they read the book now, will be tempted to superimpose imagery from the film in their brains as they read, cancelling out the imaginative power of Tolkien himself. Secondly, these newer readers will be unprepared for Chapters 3-8, which are comprised entirely of matter omitted from the movie. Such readers are likely to find the story slow-starting, or even boring.Tolkien spends a lot of time working up his hobbit characters, establishing their peaceful and essentially inconsequential existence in a larger world. Only Gandalf the wizard seems to care for them at all ... until it becomes clear that one special hobbit has come into possession of an especially dangerous and powerful artifact, the Dark Lord's omnipotent ring, within which he has invested his hold on life and the potential to enslave the world.In Book I of The Fellowship, we travel with Frodo and his three hobbit companions into exile, \\"from danger towards danger, drawing it after me.\\" In Book II (the one from which the movie was largely drawn), representatives from the societies of men, elves, and dwarves accompany these hobbits at the start of an impossible mission towards the fabled Mount Doom, where alone the ring may be destroyed.Tolkien takes his time in his prose, establishing every character and setting with such talent and such a love for the language, that those of us who loves these things will be instantly and forever enchanted. Impatient readers, however, are likely to become quickly bored--and that is too bad, because the payoffs in the action scenes are worth the price of the book unto themselves.It's the best--period.(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire fantasy \\"Teeth\\".)"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I choose to read the classic J. R. R. Tolkien book Lord of the Rings, specifically the Fellowship of the Ring, the first installment of the now famous trilogy. I choose to read it because I am a fan of both movies and have heard from several people that it is an outstanding book. I would have to say that I agree with these assessments, though I feel it was a little long winded at times.The story is entertaining, at time engaging, and the most wonderful aspect of the entire book is that Tolken masterfully creates a world of fantasy that becomes alive in the readers mind. If you really try, you can imagine a Middle Earth consisting of Dwarfs, Elves, and Hobbits fighting for the survival of the human race. Tolken takes so much care in depicting the ordinary lifestyle of hobbits that it almost makes their life seem interesting when really it is boring. However, it is brought to life with astounding detail to their habits and makes it very easy for the reader to imagine knowing a hobbit.One thing that must be made clear is that there is a world of difference between the movie and the book. Though the movie moves at a thunderous pace the book opts to be more cautious and deliberate as the tale unfolds. Of course Tolken had an entire book to work with while the movie has only three hours to unfold one of the premier science fiction stories of all time. The movie also leaves out important details about the story such as the time which passes when Frodo seizes control of Bag Ends, and the departure of Bilbo. In the movie it seems as though very little time elapses between these events however in the book it explains that no less than nine years passes before Gandalf comes to Frodo with news of the ring.Also there are several chapters in the middle of the book which tell of the hobbits journey from the Shire to the rendezvous with Gandalf. Important characters are introduced and bonds are strengthened and it seems like a relevant part of the story to me, which should not have been completely overlooked in the movie.The story is simply unique in its ability to capture the imagination of readers from many age groups. Though younger teens may have difficulty understanding more of the abstract aspects of the story the action and adventure of the story will surely keep them interested and older readers appreciate the shear genius of the story as they watch the carefully crafted tale unfold in three dazzling installments.Though I can't honestly say that I enjoyed the book more than the movie (I am of the MTV generation after all), I can truly say that the book was enjoyable to read. It has interesting underlining themes I believe about racism and judging people and the ability of people of all size and stature to achieve in the most outlandish of tasks. If you need a little inspiration or you feel that you just don't measure up to the task at hand, just look at Frodo Baggins, the small hobbit who had to save the entire world from doom. It will definitely make you feel just a little bigger, and perhaps push you to achieve your goal.The Fellowship of the Ring is a classic, and all classics deserve to be read. So if you are looking for a good book to read be sure to keep the Lord of the Rings as an option because books of it's quality are rare, and if you are a fan of the movie ( which has broken into the top ten grossing films of all times) it will help you garner a new appreciation for the story."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Call me a heretic if you will, but while I found _The Fellowship of the Rings_ to be an incredibly vivid and imaginative tale, I also found that in many places, it dragged. Tolkein was a genius, no doubt about that; however, he was also a bit obsessed with an insane number of details about the world he created. Naturally, this is partly why so many people love his books immensely, but for those of us who are more interested in advancing the story than in the lineage of a hobbit or elf, the intricate details can truly weigh the book down quite a lot. On the other hand, the details in the scene-setting are wonderful - it's probably more a case of \\"one woman's drek is another's dream\\" and so forth. I reckon there's more than one person out there who hates the lavish settings, but loves the history and storytelling-through-song.As a linguist, Tolkein definitely got the language details *right* throughout this series - his efforts there are extraordinary. And, while some people no doubt find the frequent songs in the book charming and entertaining, I generally found myself clenching my teeth to get through them. Further, characters like Tom Bombadil had really interesting elements, but most of them were buried in his too-merry flouncing and bopping about. I would have loved to have seen more discussion of his relationship with nature, and less of the \\"hey-ho, Bombadillo!\\"Overall, though, this is the kind of story that parents should read to their children, letting them get swept away in the vast realm of Middle Earth. Fan of fantasy will likely also enjoy seeing where many of the standards of the genre came from. While there are parts of it went really slowly for me, it was worth the time spent.Now, for the inevitable comparison between the book and the film, for those who have experienced one but not the other. Personally, and I could easily be hunted down and thrashed for this...I enjoyed the movie more. It eliminated many of the slower areas of the tale that I didn't enjoy, yet still remained largely true to the story. Many of my die-hard Tolkein-loving friends agree that the movie did an excellent job, and that secretly, some of them enjoyed it better, too.Still, it would be worth picking up a copy of the book to see if you'd really enjoy."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Lord of the Rings trilogy as a whole, when it was written, founded a new genre in the world of Literature. It did not &quot;set influence&quot; the concept of fantasy writing, it INVENTED the concept. These books are timeless and are rightfully placed in the ranks of books such as Candide, The Republic, Paradise Lost, and other truly classic literature. The levels of meaning range from the literal to the esoteric. While the new movies may be spuring new interest in Middle Earth, one must recall that Bilbo has lived for almost a century despite a previous movie that was disgraceful. To read The Fellowship of the Ring simply as an introduction to ann upcoming movie is a disservice both to the reader and the movie."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"What can I say? After over 65 years, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is still the ultimate fantasy epic. I won't go on and on gushing in praise. I will just note one of the brilliant literary devices that Tolkien uses that sets this book apart from so much other fantasy work. Tolkien weaves a complex narrative with many characters and plot twists, but also manages to set up brilliant parallels between them. For example we see two leaders (Theoden and Denethor) who face strikingly similar challenges, but Tolkien shows them responding differently. The former leads his men against evil, while the latter is cold and despairs. This use of paralleling gives the book so many layers and adds lasting value. Indeed, it's no wonder people can read this book many times over and not get bored. While the Peter Jackson movies are great, it doesn't - and can't - capture all of the nuance in the book. If you haven't read it yet, you're in for a treat."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I came to \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" straight after reading \\"The Hobbit,\\" which is one of my favorite books of all times. (I've read it about ten times). Although \\"The Fellowship\\" picks up, in a sense, where \\"The Hobbit\\" left off, the two books are quite different, and the difference for me was a bit of a culture shock--enough in the past to prompt me to quit reading about after fifty pages. But this time I persevered, and did not regret it!The culture shock: totally different pace. \\"The Hobbit\\" flies along, wastes no time, goes into less detail, and covers huge distances of time and geography in a few pages. \\"The Fellowship\\" goes about ten times slower, poring over detail, which, once I got used to it, became rather interesting and at times welcomed. (I admit, though, at times I did some skimming, especially when I sensed that Tolkien was revving himself up to create his own Hobbitish version of Norse mythology.)That said, the book, overall, is excellent (so much so that I'm presently three-fourths of the way through \\"The Two Towers\\"). It's a true adventure story, spirited, passionate, deep, and for me inspiring. (I'm soon embarking on a major life adventure, and have found myself surprised to find comfort from Tolkien.) I heartily recommend it to everyone and anyone, especially if you like \\"The Hobbit.\\"But here are my criticisms, though take them with a grain of salt, because again, I find \\"The Fellowship\\" excellent overall.1) Too many poems and songs! Boring! AAH, I started skipping them after about page fifty, with NO regrets at all. Tolkien gets a little poem-and-song happy for my taste.2) The whole scene with Tom Bombadil is pointless and boring--and too grandiose for my taste. Worth skipping over entirely, because not only does it detour from the tale, but actually detracts from it. Why did Tolkien put that in?3) Tolkien makes some silly and/or inconsistent plot decisions from the get-go. To give one of many possible examples, Strider's whole mission is to save the wandering hobbits, and yet he moronically lets them walk right into a dangerous tavern, whereas he could have introduced himself to them while he was spying on them earlier (when they were with Tom Bombadil, who knew Strider!), and prevented a near calamity.4) I felt it inconsistent that the Ringwraiths were on one hand so TOTALLY powerful and yet on the other hand so foolish and stupid. Didn't add up.But all that said, J.R.R., you ROCK!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I've been meaning to read it for years but never seemed to get around to it. I've loved the Hobbit and knew I would enjoy the Lord of The Rings, but just kept putting it off. Tolkein is truly a great writer. Typically I find that older books take more effort to read as the writing style just doesn't seem to flow easily. Pleasantly, this was not the case in Fellowship of the Ring. I was amazed by how fluent his writing style was for me. I was also very happy to note that a lot of the dialogue from the recent movie was taken directly from the book. It really made me appreciate the movie more. Peter Jackson really did a great job on the movies and it's evident that he's a true fan of the novels. That's about one of the highest praises I can give a movie, for they're usually nowhere near as good as the book. On to the review of the novel... *spoilers follow if you aren't familiar with the story*The Fellowship of the Ring takes place several decades after the Hobbit left off. Bilbo is now 111 (eleventy-one as Bilbo would say) and ready to go quietly off and enjoy his life to the end of his days. The ring is entrusted to Frodo's care. Through Gandalf's inquiries, we come to find out that the ring is the One Ring.\\"One Ring to rule them all,One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them alland in the darkness bind them.\\"Frodo must leave the Shire to keep the Shire safe and keep the ring out of the hands of the Ringwraiths and Sauron. Frodo's travels take him through many treacherous paths and eventually he makes it to Rivendell, the house of Elrond. This seems to be where Frodo shows his true valor. He originally thought his journey was over since the ring was in Rivendell. But, he vows to take the ring to Mordor once he sees the turmoil it creates. It is truly an evil ring and will corrupt even those who would use it for good. Nine set out for Mordor to destroy the ring; Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf, Aragron (known by many names - Strider, the Ranger, and Isildur's heir), Boromir (a man and a son of Gondor), Legolas (an elf), and Gimli (a dwarf and son of Gloin who was one of the dwarves in the Hobbit on Bilbo's grand adventure).The book follows them through the mines of Moria (where Gandalf stands against a Balrog), to Lothlorien (where we meet Lady Galadriel), and down the river towards a decision yet to be made - through the marshes towards Mordor, or over the mountain pass towards Gondor. This is where the Fellowship of the Ring ends - the Fellowship has a parting of the ways - Frodo and Sam go in one direction and the fate of the others in another."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I have to say that Tolkien is one of my top authors, period. The extensive work that he put into his literature is astounding. The man was a genius.I have to say, though, that the first 100 pages were hard to press through... and I couldn't get the characters from the movie out of my head. Anyway, after the first pages, the story really takes off.I literally could not put it down, which I don't do. I cannot wait to get the next two to read.Tolkien purposely made his stories without allegory, unlike his companion C.S.Lewis. He wanted people to draw many things from his stories, and not forced to comply to one story. However, there are a lot of lesson to be drawn from them.For instance, Borimere's state of weakness for betraying the fellowship that resulted from his personal lusts. However, he was redeemed and had his honor restored before his death."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The march is on- for Frodo Baggins and his faithful servant, Sam. In the Fellowship of the Ring, they need to deliver the ring that Bilbo Baggins gave Frodo to the one place to be destoyed. For if the ring fails to be destroyed, then the evil Sauron will destroy all the good that exists in the Middle- Earth. I read this book and now I want to read the entire series, and I think you would too. If you love stories that take you on an adventure, like the story of The Hobbit, then you will definately love this book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"It's hard to find an argument against these editions, and it's clearly impossible to present them in paperback form in an improved manner.In terms of size, it's large enough not to be squashed by a large dictionary or other textbook in your bag, nor is it too large so that handling it becomes a chore (or seem tacky in appearance). The width is perfect; the font size and spacing are relieving to the eye, light and spacious, enough room to break up the printing so it doesn't jumble together on long, extended reading marathons, which with Tolkien is easy to do.This is, of course, the first part of the new \\"Holy Trilogy.\\" I would strongly recommend starting with the books if you've never forayed into Tolkien's Middle Earth before, although it's hard to find someone who hasn't seen Jackson's films. Needless to say, the film has done some \\"light\\" editing, such as many of the songs, as well as the Anglo-Saxon influence, which makes it in the film as dress, props, and the honorable Boromir.Chronologically the book follows a larger timescale than the films. For example, Gandalf leaves for the archives at Minas Tirith immediately after Bilbo leaves the Shire, and seems to be gone for only a week or so. In the book, his absence is actually three years in length, then a brief visit, and then another nine years. Although this all takes place in less than a page-length, the impression it leaves is that time has surely passed by, and Frodo is not quite the same hobbit as before. There has also been some shifting of the dialogue in the films. Example; the line \\"I will help you bear this burden, as long as it is yours to bear\\" comes in the film at the Council of Elrond scene. In this book, it comes in Chapter two.Also cut are the smatterings of Old English, such as the word \\"glede\\" which is \\"hot coal\\" (haven't translated in years). As for the story itself; modern mythology, legendary, enchanting, superb. Yes, all these things.Finally, the maps in back are the authentic ones by Tolkien himself. They are printed large enough to trace your own pen-marks on them and make notes in the margins, useful especially if you're teaching.The quality of materials is good as well; you can beat these editions up a fair amount, dog-ear the pages, and they'll hold. The binding is very well done as well, no breaking or falling apart."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Lord of the Rings/ The Hobbit are one of the best series of books ever written. What is so vast about Tolkien is that he creates a world and a culture like nobody else. He created languages, mythology, huge maps, etc.., culture, and in this world which is as believable as ours, a huge war is on the verge is breaking out. Many will complain that it is boring or pays too much attention to details, but do not listen...Warning: if you get stuck on the chapter \\"The Council of Elrond\\", know that after that chapter it gets very interesting, and you can skip a few pages if you like. Also, the movie-lovers will proclaim that this is not anywhere as good as the movie. Some will tell you that the book does an injustice to the movie. But do not listen to them. The movies were good, but the books are just as good, if not better.Try THe Lord of the Rings....most likely you will be glad you read it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; by J.R.R. Tolkien is an exciting and insightful read. The world which Tolkien creates, called Middle Earth, although fanciful is a place which one cherishes. The world created has clear cut lines between good and evil, leaving us whole-heartedly cheering on Frodo and the Fellowship. However, not only does Tolkien's Middle Earth capture us, we also are taken by Frodo's brave journey. He possesses the One Ring, which if surrendered to the enemy could destroy all that is good in Middle Earth. Frodo is faithfully accompanied by his innocent and vulnerable friends Sam, Pippin and Merry. Their helplessness and doomed quest capture the readers' attention and encourage the reader to complete all three parts Tolkien's spectacular trilogy."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is the excellent first installment in the Lord of the Rings trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien. It is a story of Middle-Earth, where Men, Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, and all sorts of other races live. Set in a medieval-type setting, with medieval weapons and archetecture while combining fantasy and magic with realistic things. Though this book starts off a little slow, like a marble down an inclined plane it gains momentum til it reaches the suspenseful conclusion (to be continued in The Two Towers).Frodo Baggins (a Hobbit), relative of Bilbo Baggins who found the One Ring and took it from Gollum in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, inherits the Ring from Bilbo. He soon learns that it is a corrupting Ring, the One Ring into which Sauron the Dark Lord poured all his wrath and malice in to. Gandalf the Wizard advises him to 'keep it secret, keep it safe' until he returns. He returns to tell Frodo that the what the One Ring really meant and that it must be thrown into the Cracks of Doom, the one place where it could be destroyed. This happened to be in the middle of the evil kingdom of Mordor where Sauron was regaining power, searching for the Ring, and preparing to destroy all that was good. Frodo, along with Hobbit friends Merry, Pippin, and Sam, journeys to Bree where they meet Aragorn the Ranger and eventually reach Rivendell, all the while pursued by the Ringwraiths. There in Rivendell, the Fellowship that would take the Ring to Mordor to be destroyed was formed: Gimli the Dwarf, Legolas the Elf, Aragorn the Ranger, Gandalf the Wizard, Boromir of Gondor, and Merry, Pippin, Frodo, and Sam. They then embark on there quest: through Moria and Lorien, and many other places wonderful and terrible. Will they ever finish their quest?J.R.R. Tolkien weaves a masterful tale in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, to be continued by &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and &quot;The Return of the King&quot;. His style of writing, plus the constant surprises and happenings, make this a wonderful story, a timeless classic for generations to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I believe that Lord of the Rings part one deserved 4.5 stars(out of five). It started off slow, but it leaves you wanting more. If you liked the Hobbit, this book is a must read. If you have not read the Hobbit, and you are planning on reading the Fellowship, I recomend reading the hobbit first so that you can see what the ring appears to be, and get an idea of what the main characters are like. But if your even going start to read it, you should at least be a little bit interested in fantasy types of books. And if you are even thinking about it being like Harry Potter, Ill tell you now, its not(its better).The main characters are frodo(A hobbit), Gandalf(A wizard), Aragorn/Strider(A king and a ranger),Sam(A hobbit),Merry and Pippin(Also hobbits), Legolas(An elf),Gimli(A dwarf),and Borimir (A king of men). These individuals were banded together in Rivindel to make the Fellowship of the ring. Thier mission was to destroy the one ring. Why destroy it?Well,the Dark Lord Sauron forged a ring that he invested all his powers into wich made him powerful enough to destroy Middle Earth. But only was it powerfull when he wore it. It was in the last attempt to fight against the armies of Sauron that Isuldir the king at that time, cut the ring from Saurons hand and took it for himself. Although the ring when in possetion of someone other than Sauron had a way of persuading the barer to wear it,for when they put it on it reveals to Sauron were the ring is. Isildir was ambushed and the ring was lost at the bottom of a lake for thousands of years until a creature named gollum or smeagol found it and hid far under the mountains under its influence. It wasnt untill Bilbo Bagins found the ring and brought it back to the shire(His home),that the ring was in good hands. Although the ring can only be destroyed in the fires of MT. Doom were it was forged, and is also were the armies and the stronghold of Sauron lay. Therefore the book is about the struggle to destroy the one ring and what the Fellowship has to do to get the ring to MT. Doom. Many battles will be fauhgt to rid the world of something so small.So if that plot doesnt interest you, I dont know what will. So I encourage you all to read The Fellowship of the Ring and all its sequals."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I'm sure much has been written about the Lord of The Rings series but basically, get through the first 100 pages or so and you'll get caught in the most masterful fantasy saga written to this day!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I am writing this critique as an English project, but also as an active reader.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is J.R.R. Tolkien's gift to the world. Tolkien did not just write a book, he created his own world full of different people, places, cultures, creatures, legends, and languages. The land of Middle-Earth is a place that he describes so vividly that you can just envision yourself there. The way he builds each of his characters' personalities, you feel an amazing amount of empathy towards them... Its almost as though you are right there with Frodo and Sam eating mushrooms, or fighting the evil Uruk-hai with Legolas and Aragorn.In The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, we follow a young hobbit named Frodo Baggins on his path to save the world. You see, young Frodo inherits a ring of power that was created by a dark lord named Sauron. This ring has incredible amounts of power that Sauron wants to use to take over the world. Frodo, along with his hobbit buddies, a powerful wizard named Gandalf, an elf called Legolas, the dangerous human Aragorn, who is heir to the throne of Gondor, a dwarf who calls himself Gimli, and another human called Boromir, are on a path to destroy it. The ring that they are on this fateful quest to dispose of has a mind of its own. It wants to return to Sauron, and will manipulate the minds of its beholders until it gets there. Ridding the world of the ring is not an easy task. The ring can only be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom, where it was created, and Mount Doom is in the center of Sauron's fiery kingdom. This book is part one in a trilogy.I gave this book five stars, because its one of those you just can't help but enjoy.

I had a niggling doubt in my mind that his writing was dry due to the time period in which he wrote his novels. But with the movies forthcoming, I figured I should read them and see what they were all about. I must say that i was presently surprised.The first thing that jumped out at me was exactly how much he has influenced fantasy both as a book genre and also from a role-playing game standpoint. His dwarves and elves are templates for how they are used in modern FRPGs.The story moved along at quick pace, although the beginning was a little dry and slow. But once it started it went at a breakneck pace that kept me glued to the book. I'd sneak it into work to be able to keep reading it.This starts the journey of Frodo Baggins. He is given the Ring that Bilbo won from Gollum in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and sets out on a journey to destroy it before the evil forces from Mordor can get their hands on it and return it to the one who created it. (Can't recall the name right this second) The only problem is that the ring causes it's bearer to desire it with an intesity that can bring about murder to obtain or keep the ring.If you plan on watching the movies when they come out, I suggest you bone up on the books so you can see the movies with a trained eye to the details."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Really, so this reads like a book report. Those who hate that kind of thing should skip this or succumb to its lack of opinionism. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is J.R.R. Tolkien's sequel to his previous book, The Hobbit. It starts with Bilbo Baggins, the hero of The Hobbit, giving his nephew, Frodo Baggins, a ring that hasa the initial power to make you invisible, but has other strong powers that few are privelaged to know. Dark forces in the world are gathering, and Frodo's ring is their last key in their quest to take over the world. So Frodo, accompanied by a powerful wizard and several other companions, sets out in a quest to destroy the ring, which is too powerful to eliminate by conventional means. In his journey to the land of Modar, where he could destroy the ring, Frodo is pursued by many strange beings. Among them are three mysterious riders clad in black. With black steeds they tracked Frodo from the beginning of the book. They seem to have strange powers, like the ability to sniff out Frodo from a mile away. They are but a fraction of the diverse, strange characters that are scattered throughout this book.

Having said that, and I feel it necessary to say this at the outset of each review to forestall the lynching: this is the ONLY unabridged version that is available, and it not nearly so objectionable that it can not be recommended. Indeed, I feel compelled, my misgivings notwithstanding to place this version in a \\"must have\\" category - but only until a better version comes along - Frederic Davidson? Where are you? Your country and Tolkein's readers need you!It is my view that Inglis does Tolkien and his characters great disservice in many and varied ways. Aragorn comes across as an arch, cloying, pompous lout. The Hobbits are uniformly presented as servile, unctuous, country bumpkins - Sam is the worst. Legolas is fay and effeminate - almost goofy. There are times you just want to smack his Frodo and say, \\"oh for god's sake man, get a grip on yourself.\\" I was NEVER annoyed with any of these characters when I read the book, but one can easily become annoyed with them as presented by Inglis.An interesting \\"acid test\\" for this is Peter Jackson's movie version. Virtually ALL of his actors and characters get it \\"right\\" - and Inglis does not do well by the comparison.When Inglis does get it right, he is capable of \\"nailing it\\". Gandalf is excellent, Gollum brilliant, and Treebeard surpassing.The problem is that Inglis has a deep voice and is incapable of pitching it into the higher registers. His performance rapidly degrades with the number of characters he is required to present in a short period of time. \\"Return of the King\\" is the worst of the three volumes because there is a welter of voices - most of them men. At times it is hard to remember who the heck is speaking - so similar do the voices become.And there is another, more insidious problem - my brother Ross first noted this. When Inglis is required to deliver scenes of great drama - he becomes somewhat shrill and affected.And now I will allow myself on comment on the book itself. I read this book as a youth - I was enchanted. And I came back to it as a perhaps jaded 47 year old. You know what disappointed me the most? It is the PRFOUNDLY undemocratic nature of Tolkein's tale. Of course the immediate riposte to this is that it is a fairy-tale. And fairy-tales are all about kings and queens. Well, yes, sure, SOME of them are - but by no means all of them.But The Rings is a tale of a pagan time and as my friend Fox and I were discussing, the pagan world was distinctly non-aristocratic. And it is not as though Tolkein didn't have loads of democratic or semi-democratic models to crib from. I cringed as the aristocratic leaders made ALL the decisions for their men - there is no HINT of collective decision making. I thought constantly of the Iliad and the Anabasis of Xenophen -- where the lords and their men regularly debate policy, strategy and even tactics. Does this destroy the book? Of course not. But I do view the apotheosis of Aragorn, for that is what it is, as the central failure of the book. Tolkein had a magnificent opportunity to have his Aragorn cast off the tyranny of aristocratic blood-lines and establish a democratic society wherein men were governed by elected officials and the rule of law. And this could have been done without compromising the romance of the story one whit.But that's just me...a 47 year old curmudgeon! You'll find me happily ensconced in hell with the tyrannicides and regicides."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Just bought all three parts of the LOTR trilogy on CD. The reviews talked about how it was read by someone and it wasn't different actors or voices, etc. However, it is exactly that different actors reading the parts. It is not a person reading the book to you. I'm going to listen to it and then either sell it or gift it but I am very disappointed. Amazon needs to be careful in lumping together reviews of products that once existed with new ones and with different formats, etc. This is not acceptable."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I originally read the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy about 25 years ago while still in college. At the time it was all the rage as a leisure time read.With the release of the movie we are now seeing a resurgence in popularity of the works of J.R.R. Tolkien.As a work of fantasy , the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" stands out from the rest of the pack of would be fantasy novels like a Rembrandt at an amatuer art exhibition. In this regard I have concluded that GOOD fantasy is extremely hard to write. There are alot of wannabe fantasy writers that simply attempt to imitate Tolkien (for the most part they just don't get the job done!).The \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is the first book in the\\"Lord of the Rings\\" , trilogy and introduces the One Ring , or the master ring of power forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom. In the novelette that timewise preceeds this book , \\"The Hobbit\\" , Bilbo Baggins finds the magic ring and after a series of adventures , returns to the Shire and retires to a remarkably long life.\\"The Fellowship\\" begins with allusions of a stirring of evil power attributed to a resurgence of the power of Sauron and the issuance of the nine dark riders , the high Nazgul , who are afield in search of the One Ring.Gandalf the Grey , apparantly a jolly old wizard , comes to Bilbo's birthday party to provide fireworks , and convinces Bilbo to leave the ring to his nephew Frodo Baggins before once again going on the road for an adventure.And thus begins an epic quest for Frodo. Gandalf arranges for Frodo to take the ring and depart the Shire , accompanied by his faithful friend , Samwise Gamgee. On the road to Bree , Frodo and Samwise encounter two other young Hobbits , Merry and Pippin , who also enter the \\"Fellowship\\" . \\"Strider\\" , as he is called manages to rescue the young Hobbits from the Nazgul at Bree , and becomes the guide of the group.Along the way , many other amazing characters of Middle Earth are encountered , and many adventures transpire. Gandalf emerges as a mighty and powerful wizard , who uses his awesome powers to aid Frodo and his companions on the ultimate quest to the fires ofMount Doom , into which Frodo plans to cast the One Ring and forever destroy the power of Sauron.In my mind what sets the entire \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy apart from it's imitators is the author's knowledge of Celtic and Anglo-Saxon legends and language. There is also a warmth to the characters , the Hobbits in particular , that is missing in other fantasy works. Frodo and Samwise exhibit reservoirs of strength , determination , and courage that is unexpected.Altho' fantasy is not my favorite genre , I am rather fond of this particular work. It is exceedingly well-crafted and written by a master of his discipline. I rate this part of the trilogy 4 stars ; this is a comparative rating to the other two segements which I rate as 5 stars. I enjoyed it 25 years ago , and again recently ; recommended."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"A new wave of readers are devouring the Tolkien books, thanks to the arrival of the first of the movie blockbusters (as you can tell by the pic of Elijah Wood on the cover). And that is definitely a good thing, because this trilogy not only spurred the fantasy genre into a respectable position, but also provided the template for virtually every elf, dwarf, lost king, and medieval fantasy world since. It's also a darn good read.We open some sixty years after the events of \\"The Hobbit\\" -- Bilbo Baggins is older, not much wiser, and quite eccentric. He has also adopted his bright young nephew/cousin Frodo, who was orphaned at a young age and had led a rather fractured life after that. On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the aghast young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the dark lord Sauron. It corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him...Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were. Tolkien also demonstrated his skill in keeping the \\"feel\\" of the different races separate; without being too obvious, he emphasized the subtle differences between Elves, Dwarves, hobbits and Men. There are faint but distinguishable differences in their speech patterns and thought processes. You could never get Frodo mixed up with Legolas.Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as \\"The Hobbit\\": it's lighter and more cheerful. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. (The reader almost wants to yell \\"Don't do it!\\" when Frodo is given the Ring) The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't overdo the descriptions of such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers. Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions. Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.I will warn you that you should have the second and third books on hand when you read this. As this was originally intended to be one huge chunk of a book, it ends on a semi-cliffhanger. (The movie ends in about the same place, so if it frustrated you there, you'd be frustrated here as well) If you're a person who can't handle anything more complex than a half-hour sitcom, or think that Harry Potter is the pinnacle of modern literature, then this book is not for you.Frodo himself is the quintessential \\"little guy\\" hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. Self-sacrifice is his middle name. Unlike Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter, Frodo also has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person, an everyman... or should I say \\"everyhobbit.\\"We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of \\"Hobbit\\" -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. Sam, though not yet fully into the selfless role he plays in books two and three, aptly demonstrates his loyalty and love for Frodo, as well as displaying his progression from a shy young hobbit with a fascination for Elves to a bolder, more decisive person. Merry and Pippin aren't quite into their full roles either, but they are excellent: Merry is mature beyond his years, and Pippin is (and I say this with all affection) a goodhearted flake. Elf and Dwarf fans will find their enjoyment in Legolas and Gimli, who initially grate on each other, but show the beginnings of a loyal friendship.Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I first read The Hobbit in grade school, and loved the adventure and excitement of Bilbo&#65533;s journey to Lonely Mountain to defeat the evil dragon. But I grew bored mid-way through Fellowship of the Ring, as the second half of that book focused on the ancient histories and alien geography of Middle Earth. I never finished the trilogy.When I picked up both books fifteen years later, I had the reverse experience. The Hobbit was still fun to read, but rather childish and simple. On the other hand, FOTR captured my imagination because of the incredibly complex, detailed lore surrounding Middle Earth. Tolkien spends much time discussing the differences in attitudes, customs, and languages of his three major races &#65533; men, dwarves, and elves &#65533; almost as if he were writing an anthropology textbook rather than a novel.Frodo&#65533;s mission to destroy the Great Ring, while exciting, serves primarily as device to flesh out the mythos of the Middle Earth universe. Indeed, some of the most exciting action scenes in the recent movie version (Gandalf&#65533;s battle with the evil wizard; the capture and escape of Gollum) occur &#65533;off camera&#65533; in the book and are related to the reader second-hand. Other important sequences, such as the battle with the demon balrog, occupy only a few brief pages.This book is not for everybody. It demands a lot of patience through long passages of exposition and backstory. It leaves gaps in the narrative for readers to flesh out in their imaginations. But, once you begin to understand the intricacies of Tolkien&#65533;s world, it becomes an engrossing experience. I will wait another year before reading the next volume (just in time for the movie, probably). But I plan to buy a copy of the Silmarillion this week to brush up on the stories of ancient Middle Earth, events alluded to in FOTR but never fully explained."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"...the book is better. Better in the sense that Tolkien's language is so rich and his descriptions of Middle Earth and his characters so vivid that these are virtually impossible to capture in full in the film-makers medium. With that said, however, I think Peter Jackson's film is a phenomenal piece of work and probably as true to Tolkien's vision as possible.I am not a fan of fantasy fiction, but this book (the Lord of the Rings, that is, of which this is just a piece) transcends the genre to rank as one of the 20th century's greatest works of literature in English language. Give it a few pages, and then be prepared to be swept up in a world utterly unlike our own, and yet, particularly in light of what's going on in the world today, so chillingly similar.Fantastic - almost prophetic - stuff."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Many of the negative reviews here conjure up an image of a single type of critic. There may of course be exceptions, but the complaints seem to come from people born within the last 25 years, those who are mostly indoctrinated in the fast and the flashy, the dumbed-down, the highly edited movies and TV shows of their youth, those more comfortable punching a remote control than turning a page. Well, this isn't for them, pure and simple, and they should have known that when they saw the size of it. Tolkien's lengthy descriptions of the landscape are welcome as far as I'm concerned; he had a love for the natural world and it shows. At the very least, if anything in print can get you away from asphalt and cell phones, this is it. In my mind that's a great part of its charm. His description of the Shire is based on rural England as he knew it and loved it before the First World War, and he wants us to experience that through a fictional medium. And many years ago, when I first read it, the references to the earlier histories of Middle Earth, whether expounded in conversation or song, were among the most fascinating aspects of it, and I can't imagine why anybody would object to that if they're voluntarily reading the thing in the first place. It adds greatly to the depth and involvement in this other world, and does not - repeat, does not - noticeably slow down the action. The style has been criticized as &quot;archaic&quot;. If they want archaic, they should try William Morris' fantasy novels of the 1890s. Tolkien keeps the archaism under control. In fact, the style is one of the most remarkable things about the book. Since The Fellowship of the Ring follows immediately (plotwise) upon The Hobbit, which was written as a children's book in the 1930s, to smooth over the transition to this more serious and complex work the author starts out in a style similar to that of The Hobbit, and gradually brings it up to a more mature level before Frodo makes it to Rivendell. This is done so unobtrusively that I've never seen it mentioned before. It's one of the more subtle strengths of the work. The style, admittedly, changes somewhat in later situations, but deliberately, and the so-called archaic writing that appears when the action is in the field before Minas Tirith in The Return of the King, for example, is entirely appropriate and adds just the right atmosphere. In any case, it's very readable and never difficult going, unless you need everything spelled out in monosyllables. A comment that Tolkien borrows too much from Arthurian fantasy is just meaningless. Everything borrows from something, and most of the motifs of Arthurian fantasy are found elsewhere anyway. Arthurian legend itself was a series of borrowings until it reached the form we know today. If I have any criticism of the book, it's that at some places in the plot things are obviously rigged for the good guys to succeed. For example, in Book 1, when Frodo and his pals are in the Shire one night lying low as a Black Rider is creeping up on them, drawn by the power of the Ring, suddenly a troop of Elves, rarely seen in the Shire, just happen to show up to scare off the Rider. Whew! That was close. Something like that happens several times in the Trilogy. But such plot abuse is so common in fiction and movies that it's almost forgiveable. Is it the greatest novel ever written? Hardly. But it's certainly one of the most sheerly entertaining things I've ever read. To repeat what a lot of readers have said before,&quot;The book is too short.&quot;(BL, Tucker, GA)"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I purchased the CD version of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; which states on the back of the box that it contains the both the original Forward and Prologue.

It is a delightful combination of poetry, lovable characters, beautiful descriptive writing, and adventure. Tolkien is an incredible wordsmith and paints beautiful (or terrifying) pictures of scenery, from the clouds in the sky to the grass on the ground. The reader can see the forests, the mountains, the rivers, even the clothing worn by the characters. The characters in this story are diverse and fascinating, coming from different races, speaking different languages, but all having a common purpose and a profound friendship.

If you like a fast paced plot and lots of action, this is not for you. If you like to savor the moment, you will absolutely fall in love as I did.Tolkien takes you step by step and describes EVERY step. His dialogue is simple natured and simply put which adds a hint of humor in and of itself. The plot is profound. It deals with fighting evil through friendship, loyalty, and tradition. There's food, dancing, poetry, storytelling, magic, tragedy, adventure, suspense and humor. I liked reading this in the wee morning hours when the world was quiet and when Tolkien's detailed accounts would draw me into Middle Earth. Yes, the story could have survived with less scenery descriptives, but I believe it would have been different. I believe there is something to be gained from savoring the moments in a story and Tolkien does it beautifully. The characters and settings linger in my mind which says something to me."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I read this trilogy in high school and was captivated by the \\"Middle Earth\\" universe created by Tolkien. The book has lost some of its popularity, and I have been unable to get my children (captivated instead by Harry Potter) to read it. The excellent movie version of Lord of the Rings has helped a bit in restoring the book to its proper cultural status. The audio CD version of this makes the book very digestible, and the reader (Shakespearean actor Rob Inglis) is excellent.In re-reading this first volume 35 years later, I am struck by the vulnerability of good and the primacy of evil in Tolkien's universe. It is no accident that the standard bearers for good are brave little hobbits; good is a distinct underdog in this world.The triumph of good against all odds is our most basic human myth, and Tolkien tells this oldest of stories in a fresh and entertaining fashion. I suppose that Harry Potter is the updated version of Tolkien, but try to get your kids to read Tolkien as his telling of the myth is unrivaled."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This has been a perennial personal favorite of mine since I first read it in the 1970s. I don't know how many times I've read it since then, but a conservative guess would be at least a dozen times. I just finished reading it again last weekend - it was once again, outstanding!So, what should you know if you are pondering your first foray into Tolkien's tale of Middle Earth? Lets see...1) \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" done not include a complete stand-alone tale. It is, rather, the first book of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy which also includes the volumes \\"The Two Towers\\" and \\"The Return of the King\\". So, when you get to the end of this volume you are left hanging there...you MUST get the other two books to complete the tale. (That's what happened to me when I read this book the first time [as an assignment for a college English class I was taking])2) This is a classic tale of good versus evil, but, as you can read in the forward, Tolkien states that it is not meant to be an allegory; it is just a tale that he wanted to tell.3) Be prepared to have your traditional views of what an elf, wizard, etc., are to be challenged.4) This book can be enjoyed by readers of many ages. I read it first when I was in college, and, later, when I had children of my own I read this trilogy to them while they were in elementary school (one was even a pre-schooler - that was years before the movies of the same names were released).5) There is no objectionable language in the books, though many parts convey a dark image of a world under the sway or impending threat of evil.6) You do not have to read Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" before reading this book. And I found this trilogy to be far superior to \\"The Hobbit\\" when I did read it.At first I wondered at the Amazon-indicated reading level of 9-12 yrs for this book. I would not have guessed that when I first read it, but now that I have children of my own that have consumed the entire \\"Harry Potter\\" series as well as many other long novels, I can see how a 9-12 yr range could work for these books as well...depending on the child. Be aware though, that there are many places in the book where Tolkien's characters launch into sometimes extensive recitation of verse as part of the story. That can put off some younger readers (I sometimes skip over those parts myself...though that may offend some Tolkien purists out there)If you have children that like books like \\"Harry Potter\\", \\"Eragon\\", etc., and they are looking for a new adventure, you might suggest this one to them. I have read the \\"Harry Potter\\" books, and if I were to compare them to Tolkien's works I have to say that Tolkien's story conveys a richer image of a world to me than do the books of JK Rowling (though I also enjoyed them).All in all, this book launches a top-flight story and represents what I consider to be the prototypical modern fantasy story - \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"Definitely 5 stars (only because I can't award more)"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien was the master of fantasy, and that's not just because he was the first to write a very popular modern epic.What makes Tolkien superior was how he used his extensive knowledge of mythology and linguistics to create his own complex world. He was a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, a fellow of Pembroke College, and a fellow of Merton College where he studied and taught the linguistics of early English. Over many years he created his own elvish language with a complex syntax and grammar, and a complete history and mythology of Middle Earth (see the twelve volumes of The Histories of Middle-Earth below.) This gives his works so much complexity and texture that when you read them, you feel like you've dropped into the middle of a real civilization.Besides the amazing world-building, Tolkien builds excellent characters and uses them to explore such heavy human themes as friendship, love, greed, power, redemption, gender-roles, self-sacrifice, and death. This is not a light epic for a Sunday afternoon. This is intense, bone-chilling, goose-bump raising stuff. You can feel the weight of the world on the shoulders of Frodo and his companions. And, though there's a happy ending, it comes with much suffering and loss.And all the while, Tolkien's writing is beautiful and poignant. In my opinion, the only writers I've read who even begin to compare are Ursula LeGuin, Susanna Clarke, and perhaps Lois McMaster Bujold.~FantasyLiterature.net"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"It would have helped if I read the Hobbit first.This book had a depth, I had never read before.

I personally enjoyed this book and finished it in less than week. The story follows this theme, \\"Three rings for the Eleven-kings under the sky, Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone, Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die, One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne, In the land of Mordor where the Shadows lie. One Ring to rule them all, One ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.\\" The story begins with Frodo the little hobbit, who inherits a ring from his uncle Bilbo. Unfortunately, he learns from his friend, Gandalf the Wizard, that the ring is extremely evil, and wants to get back to his master, The dark Lord Sauron. Then starts the adventure of the Hobbit, who goes on a journey with a few companions to the only place where the ring can be destroyed, the Cracks of Doom in the fiery mountain Orodruin, inside Sauron's realm of Mordor. Chased by evil that does not sleep, this book gives you more than just entertainment, it also throws in some values and other ideas, like friendship, loyalty, courage, respect for one another.

Although each time I've re-read it I have gotten yet more and more out of it, listening to this unabridged reading has made me appreciate the work even more, if possible. Listening to it without the printed page before your eyes renders everything so much more vividly it is truly astonishing. It also modulates the pacing of the experience, since it takes longer to read aloud than to read silently in your head. And you can appreciate the nuances of Tolkien's elegant and stately prose style so much more this way, too.Rob Inglis's reading is wonderful. His vocal characterizations are excellent, particularly for Gollum, Treebeard, Gimli and Gandalf. His emotional range is a bit narrow, unfortunately, and some of his intonations can be a bit repetitive or occasionally off, but this does not really detract from the whole. An especially nice thing is that he actually sings each of the songs that are interspersed throughout the story. I don't know where the melodies came from, but they are very fitting, with a sort of English folk-music style that fits in perfectly with the ambience of the whole.Listening to these CD's has been absolutely delightful in every way.

Later,the ring took his own life and he dropped it into the river,where it remained undiscovered for 3000 years.Thousands of years later,the hobbits (a kind of small people) wants to live in peace,and having nothing to worry about. One of the older hobbits,Bilbo Baggins,cheated himself the almighty ring from a creature named Gollum,and suddenly,the servants of the dark lord finds out where the ring is. Bilbo leaves the ring to his relative Frodo. The wizard Gandalf decides that the ring has to be destroyed - that\`s the only way to defeat Sauron forever. Frodo later becomes the leader for The Fellowship of the Ring,which consists of four hobbits (Frodo,Sam,Merry and Pippin),the wizard Gandalf,the two humans Aragorn (or Strider)and Boromir,the elve Legolas and the dwarf Gimli.And I think most of you recognize those characters,so I don\`t have to explain in detail who they are. The fellowship is now thrown into a fantastic adventure,where they have to meet a thousand dangers on their way to Mount Doom.What amazes me mostly with this book is how complex the world is. And imagine Tolkien has found out all of it himself!He really must have had a lot of fantasies!But this isn\`t just some wild imaginations - because the world feels so complex,it is so real you can believe it really has existed. He creates detailed cultures for each of the people in his Middle Earth,like comparisons between different religions today. Over all,the world is similar to the medieval Europe,but with fantasy creatures like dragons as well.As Tolkien was an expert of Nordic mythology,he also figured out the names like Frodo,Bilbo and Gandalf very easily. And The Middle Earth is actually an english translation from the Swedish Midgard,which was the place where the humans lived in the nordic mythology. That could be interesing to know.Many people claims the book is too short - and sometimes,I do agree. A hundred pages more would not have been a bad idea.Over all,this is a difficult book to review,because there is always something that remains incomplete.Now the book has been made into a film,which is one of the most popular today,but before you see the film,I recommend you to read the book. It\`s not enough having seen just the film and skip the book. You have to read it to really understand the whole complexity of Tolkien\`s world.The three books are all in all like one great adventure,but this is my favorite,because it is the most classical and introduces us to the Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This narration is tremendous! It is COMPLETE and not overdone with stupid special effects or a whole cast of characters. Rob Inglis has the most wonderful voice and creates all of the characters as though they were in the room with you. He makes you feel like you're cudled in front of the fire in the House of Elrond listening to tales of old lore. I can honestly say that my favorite part of the day, the part I look forward to all day, is the half an hour before bed when I listen to these CDs. It's strange to say that a set of CDs brings you closer to inner peace...but I dare say that if any could do that, these are among their number."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is beautiful and rich in texture, character development, and writing style, and in my opinion transcends the realm of \\"book\\" and \\"fantasy\\", becoming true literature and a classic. The book should not be confused with the movie, as the two are aimed at different audiences with different expectations. Fellowship is without a doubt dated. As some reviewers have pointed out, Tolkien may spend 80 pages walking down a road, or 2 pages in a song. He may spend pages developing a character's style, then mere paragraphs describing an action scene. Tolkien wrote to a British audience back in the 30s and 40s who didn't mind this and actually expected it. An audience who were not as rushed as we are today, who did not expect the instant gratification TV and computers bring and were used to pure imagination to visualize action scenes. An audience who had 2 or 3 hours a night to become absorbed in a book and who were willing to put forth the sustained effort to delve into complex character development. The movie in turn is geared towards maximum action and gratification in a short time period. There's nothing wrong with that; in fact I think the movie is brilliant, a visual feast. But that is not, nor can it be, the aim of the book. The point of this book is to close yourself off to the real world and lose yourself entirely in Tolkien's fantasy. If a sentence has to be reread a couple of times, or only 20 pages are read in an hour or two, than so be it. This is not a novel to be rushed."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I think this is a great book. There are so many different interesting characters. I also like fantasy.

I love it!!!I hope more people buy it and read it...buh-bye now"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is the first volume in J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series. The next two areThe Two TowersandThe Return of the King.The Hobbitcontains an important backstory, but is not absolutely essential for enjoyment of this tale.Frodo Baggins discovers that the gold ring given to him by his uncle Bilbo is more than a trinket of minor magic. It is the physical embodiment of a great evil power. And its owner is looking for it. Frodo, along with three other hobbits from the Shire, travel to Rivendell to participate in the Council of Elrond. There it is decided to return the ring to be destroyed in the volcanic fires of Mordor, where it was originally forged. Frodo and eight companions set out to accomplish this task. The book follows the first part of their journey.This book was made into the movieThe Fellowship of the Ring, which is remarkably faithful to it. With one interesting exception. Between leaving the Shire and arriving at Rivendell, Frodo and his fellow hobbits spend an indeterminate period of time in the Old Forests as guests of Tom Bombadil. Tom was omitted from the film entirely. Both fans and critics have suggested he didn't belong in the book, either.Tom does not fit well into the taxonomy of good, evil, and unaligned creatures in the rest of the trilogy. He is clearly powerful, working magic in his forest by singing and persuading plants and animals to do this and that. And the ring has no power over him, not even making him invisible when he tries it on. When it is suggested in Elrond's Council that the ring be entrusted to Tom, this idea is rejected. Tom doesn't stay focused on any one thing very long and would make an inattentive guardian. The hobbits are refreshed by their stay with Tom, but he neither hinders nor helps them with their larger objective.Tolkien offered an incomplete explanation for Tom's presence in the story. In a world where everyone, good and evil, is struggling for power and control, Tom seems to have renounced this kind of power. There is an immediacy to the good he does for others, offering food or helping with a concrete problem. He doesn't sign on for a larger quest, and accepts no responsibility to lead. He exists in impenetrable serenity, while causing frustration in some of those around him.Tom is hard to understand and even harder to explain to an action-oriented audience. It is small wonder that the film omits him. But Tom Bombadil is worth understanding and is one reason you should read this book, even if you have seen the movie. Is there a place in the world for someone who seeks no power over others, even to do good?Think about your answer."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"...of a fantasy epic that is loved the world over.A little hobbit inherits a magic ring from his uncle--a ring that turns out to be something very much wanted by the greatest villain of his time...If you haven't read it, what are you waiting for, go ahead and do it!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"We have two other editions of Tolkein's THE LORD OF THE RINGS, but this set illustrated by Alan Lee is extraordinary.

Rob Inglis' performance is so magnificent, it actually took me from liking the books over the movies, to actually DISLIKING the movies altogether! For example, Sean Astin's \\"Sam\\" was as good as it could have possibly been on screen, yet Inglis nailed Sam even better, in my opinion. He nailed Bombadil, nailed Treebeard (and Quickbeam), nailed Gandalf, nailed Gimli, nailed Butterbur, as well as all other more difficult characters (not to mention all other main characters). Absolutely BRILLIANT. 10 STARS![LISTEN TO THE AMERICAN \\"DRAMATIZED\\" VERSION OF THE HOBBIT (and I assume the matching LOTR version is equally embarrassing) AND THEN SEE HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT INGLIS!]"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"What can I say? After over 65 years, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is still the ultimate fantasy epic. I won't go on and on gushing in praise. I will just note one of the brilliant literary devices that Tolkien uses that sets this book apart from so much other fantasy work. Tolkien weaves a complex narrative with many characters and plot twists, but also manages to set up brilliant parallels between them. For example we see two leaders (Theoden and Denethor) who face strikingly similar challenges, but Tolkien shows them responding differently. The former leads his men against evil, while the latter is cold and despairs. This use of paralleling gives the book so many layers and adds lasting value. Indeed, it's no wonder people can read this book many times over and not get bored. While the Peter Jackson movies are great, it doesn't - and can't - capture all of the nuance in the book. If you haven't read it yet, you're in for a treat."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"It's been thirty years since I read The Hobbit and only recently that I began reading the Fellowship trilogy. I have just finished Part 1 and am well into Part 2, The Two Towers. What a marvelous writer Tolkien was! Though my experience with fantasy literature is limited, these volumes have more than earned a place in my permanent Classics library alongside Baum's Wizard of Oz, Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia and Rowling's Harry Potter series. The illustrations in this edition alone are worth the price of admission. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"My oldest son and I are big Lord of the Rings fans, and usually listened to the books from our library. They no longer have the first of the trilogy, so I started to look for an unabridged version for my son's 10th birthday...as we hadn't been able to listen for over a year (gasp!).This recording is wonderful. It is verbatim and does not have a lot a background noise to deflect from the story itself, yet at the same time the reader does an amazing job of making the story come alive.I definitely recommend this set of CDs if you're looking for an UNABRIDGED version of Book 1 of Lord of the Ring."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"There are six \\"books\\" of the Lord of the Rings in all. Two are found in the first volume, two in the second, and two in the third. Apparently, Tolkien originally meant for the books to be divided into six volumes; not three, so I'm taking him at his word.The first \\"book\\" of the Fellowship of the Ring chronicles how Gandalf and Frodo discover the identity of an evil ring, and set out on a quest to get it out of Frodo's neighborhood (the Shire) before it can do any real harm. That is, Frodo and some of his friends set out on said quest, but they need to do it without Gandalf, who has some other things he wants to check up on. They expect Gandalf to reappear and accompany them, but he fails to do so, and in the end, they need to leave the Shire without him.During the first book, the hobbits leave the shire and have some adventures, encountering several strange things in the world outside. Elves, an evil willow tree, a very powerful singing man named Tom Bombadil, some undead called wights, a bartender named Butterbur, and a ranger named Aragorn. In the early parts of the book, not much happens to really excite or hold one in suspense. I got the impression that Tolkien was trying to ease readers into his adventure book. However, once the hobbits get to Bree and meet Aragorn, things start to pick up. They wander in the wilderness with him and quickly fall under attack by black riders. Luckily, they meet help shortly after that. Frodo then needs to ride quickly to the ford, in order to get away from the black riders.The scene at the end of this book, with Frodo in a sort of standoff against the black riders was really something; especially compared to the rest of the book, which was more whimsical and fun than suspenseful and exciting. If all you know is the Peter Jackson movies, you may be surprised by how far the action and suspense were amped up in the movies (though, in my opinion, to great effect.) Still, when I said that this book was whimsical and fun, that was exactly what I meant.Many points in this book are just plain fun to read. The adventure of the hobbits through the old forest, and their many songs and such while still in the shire were amusing and fun, and it was enjoyable to hear some of their stories about odd lands and strange people, as well as find out what happened to many of the characters from \\"The Hobbit.\\" If I had to pick just one character, however, who truly embodied the overall mood of whimsy in the first \\"book,\\" it would definitely be Tom Bombadil; perhaps one of Tolkien's most interesting and powerful characters. He's so powerful, in fact, that it's very hard to feel threatened with him around, and he dances in and out of scenes like a fairy in some children's tale.That having been said, I think that most children would have a hard time sitting still for the whole story. Some of Tolkien's descriptions get a bit lengthy, and children (unless they're very good and have been raised away from television,) would have a tough time with that, as much as they might like the subject matter.The second \\"book\\" of the Fellowship of the Ring chronicles how the ring arrives at Rivendell, a council is held to determine what to do with it, (and to provide some much-needed backstory,) and Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry set out again from Rivendell, alongside Aragorn the dunedain, Legolas the elf, Gimli the dwarf, Boromir the man and the wizard Gandalf. The party travels through the underground realm of Moria, the woods of Lothlorien, and down the river Anduin towards the fork in their path, where they must decide where to take the ring; to Gondor; city of men, or to Mordor, where it can finally be destroyed. As they move on, party members begin to fall away, until finally, the fellowship is splintered, with only Sam and Frodo left the guard the ring itself. Most of the fellowship members are either dead or in mortal danger by the time this book ends.The humor of the first half of the book is replaced here with high adventure, although some sections feel a bit tacked-on (such as the showboating of many of the characters during the attempt to cross Caradhras.) Additionally, the stay of the fellowship in Lothlorien feels neither humorous nor thrilling. I honestly found it more strange than anything else; strange in a good way, but not really all that engaging, compared to the passing through Moria.It's odd to say that the strangest place in the second half of the book was also the least intense, but that's how Lorien came across to me. I thought that the whole second half of the book was a great deal more interesting and exciting than the first half, if only because of the lethal enemies that get introduced right off the bat, but in terms of overall story quality, I'd rate them about the same. The point of the narrative is never really to set a mood or dwell on how the characters feel, which is probably for the best on some level. When there's evil to deal with, personal feelings really don't matter.We're still not into the \\"war\\" parts of the lord of the rings, exactly, and Tolkien seemed to have enjoyed skimming over smaller battles in his books. The more I read, the more I'm struck by just how much better the pacing was in the films. The books are just as good and entertaining, of course, but they're entertaining in a more high-fantasy, intellectual sense, rather than stressing mood, excitement or drama. Though the story is almost identical, the book and movie versions of the Lord of the Rings are really very different from one another in tone and pacing. Me, I like both, but not on the same day.Lastly, I should bring up my reason for reviewing these books in particular. Tolkien was Catholic, and his writings reflect a Catholic view of the world; where evil and good are both refreshingly-clear, and evil attacks from both inside and outside, hiding in the smallest and seemingly most innocent things. The ring itself seems both like a beautiful piece of jewelery and a fascinating source of magic power, but it's also small enough that people wouldn't normally think of it as being capable of so much harm. There could not be a more perfect allegory for sin, which toutes itself as satisfaction for vanity, greed, the craving for power, and yet, often seems like it's no big deal. Just one little sin. No one would ever know. Then suddenly, you're wounded to the heart by it, just like Frodo nearly was.However, although I view the ring as an allegory, it's important to note that the allegory is far, far subtler than the ones used by C. S. Lewis in the Chronicles of Narnia. In fact, I think that's the greatest strength of this series. Lewis' allegories didn't interfere with the storytelling much in later books, but in Tolkien's writings, they hardly even seem like allegories half the time. The real strength here is in the world view that his books have; the correct world view. That there is good, and evil, and all types of people are somewhere along one of those roads, no matter how normal or odd they may seem.Some might raise issue with the magic that gets thrown around in this story, and the other stories in this series, but it's important to remember that the \\"magic\\" in this tale is fantasy-magic. It bears no real similarities to the real thing. How can I tell? Because of the world view of those who use it. In this book, the heroes are, for the most part, outmatched and on the run from their enemies. Evildoers are very strong, and the good are very weak, but nonetheless, they go on a quest to triumph over their much stronger adversaries. The mentality of the weak prevailing over the strong runs directly contrary to the philosophy of the real occult; which always stresses the selfish pursuit of greater strength. So long as this mentality is present (victory in weakness,) any talk of \\"magic\\" in these books is not dangerous; just a harmless fantasy element. This is why I consider this book so good, overall.The minor imperfections that I spot early on are simply that the pace starts out a bit slow, and doesn't really pick up until over halfway through. Still, a patient reader shouldn't have any trouble getting through them, and even appreciating the sheer amount of detail that Tolkien put into this work."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"It was only after playing Lord of the Rings Online that I felt the desire to read the books, & so I started with The Hobbit in January. When the day is done, I curl up with a book in bed & read until I pass out.So LotR was written 17 years after The Hobbit, but Tolkein's memories of his characters was as sharp & clear as if there hadn't been a pause (if only the same could be said for Anne Rice). LotR is more serious, which is a little disappointing since The Hobbit was more of a comedy. The IS comedy, but things get a lot more serious after they hook up with Aragorn.This is a nice fantasy story where a group of men ignore their racial differences & travel as friends to destroy the source of power of a common enemy. I like how the Elves have a realistic scene that even after the ring is destroyed, things will never be as they once were. The Elves are very interesting, being like tall glorious gods who watch the uneducated & unwashed mortals to pass the boredom of eternity.I like how even though these books were written in a time before Womens' Rights, the ladies are not housewives. Actually there are probably only three women in this entire book; Goldberry, Arwin (who in this book is a completely useless character who does nothing) & Galadriel (who is equally as important as Celeborn, yet seems more so because she is a ring bearer).One thing I'm particularly fond of is the lack of token romance that everyone seems to feel they need to throw into every book & movie. If you know of any other fantasy books that have no romance, please leave a title suggestion in a comment.After you read LoTR, it's not over yet; Tolkein's other book are related. You should also check out Lord of the Rings Online; most faithful adaption of the books ever made.Now I really enjoyed this book & the one before it, butt it genuinely has some things that bug me.*Galadriel is terribly annoying & she speaks in a way that no other Elf does & there's a chance that you're going to have trouble understanding what she's babbling about. It's like she's trying to force herself to sound poetic & seems to be repeating herself but changing the wording....& then the characters praise her for it!*Gimli should NOT find Galadriel attractive; Dwarf women are short & bearded so it would have made more sense for him to be attracted to a equating Gandalf than her.*Much like The Hobbit, there is a lot of singing. I'm suprised no one has made a musical out of his collective works yet.The flaw is the enemies. Yes, I can understand now why Dungeons & Dragons revamped Orcs, & even why Rowling's Dementors may be a little more badass than the Nazgul. When it comes to a small band of (mostly) mortal men being heavily outnumbered by the enemy or encountering a single powerful entity, the heroes win too easily & too quickly, all for convenience, making the battles rather boring. The enemies basically sissy-fight the heroes while the majority of them just stand in the sidelines & watch; when the ones actually doing the fighting are struck down, the others just give up instead of retaliate. & I can only describe the Nazguls attempts to get at Frodo as half-assed."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I ordered this used book from across the pond.

Excellent read. Can't wait to start the next book!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is an epic fantasy set in Middle Earth starring hobbits, dwarves, elves and even a few men.I love this story. I remember the first time I read it, at twelve. It took me three days to get through the Hobbit and the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy. All I did was eat, sleep, and read.I remember the chills that ran down my spine as Frodo and Sam first hid from the mysterious black riders (Ringwraiths) as they raced through the Shire and later on the road to Rivendell. The simple ring of invisibility (from The Hobbit) having taken on a dark purpose and the formation of the fellowship of the ring to take it into the very heart of Mordor captured my mind and drew me on.The characters, the places and the enemies are what make the story so memorable to me. So I wanted to list each below with a brief description (most are spoilers if you haven't read this before, but probably not that bad if you've seen the movie).The fellowship:-Gandalf the Grey, powerful wizard who still suffers the self-doubt and worry that plague all mankind.-Strider, mysterious ranger who both fears and desires to take on the responsiblities cast upon him by his sires.-Gimli, dwarf from the Lonely Mountain on a personal quest to discover the fate of Balin and his crew who disappeared into the Mines of Moria never to be seen again.-Legolas, the woodelf from Mirkwood, who comes to Rivendell to report the loss of the prisoner Gollum.-Boromir of Gondor, who sees in the ring a chance to turn the tides against the darkness in Mordor.-Merry and Pippin, Frodo's dear friends who conspire to join him in his quest before they know what it is, simply because he is their friend. They come as a pair until their paths diverge in the later books.-Sam Gamgee, Frodo's gardener and loyal companion who is determined to help his master succeed in his quest and make it back to the Shire alive.-And, of course, Frodo Baggins himself, Bilbo's heir, who volunteers to take the ring and destroy it in the fires of Mount Doom, \\"though he doesn't know the way,\\" although he does know there is every chance he will not survive the attempt.The places:-The Shire, the ideallic home of the hobbits, neverchanging, peaceful, and pure.-The Old Forest, borders The Shire and home of vindictive willow trees with mesmerizing voices, but also home of the jovial Tom Bombadil and his lovely Goldberry, the river daughter, who help the hobbits reach Bree in one piece.-Bree, an outpost community where hobbits and men live together in peace, where the Butterbur, the forgetful barman, redeams himself.-Rivendell, home of elves and the Lord Elrond, half-elven, and his daughter Arwen Evenstar (recently arrived from Lothlorien), the last homely home.-The Mines of Moria, deeply delved, filled with orcs and something much, much worse.-Lothlorien, the golden wood, home of the elves and the Lady Galadriel and Lord Celeborn. The Lady keeping secret one of the three elven rings of old.-The Great River, Anduin, the last road of the fellowship before it is sundered for good or ill.The enemies:-Ringwraiths, nine ancient kings of men who were seduced by the power of their rings under the One Ring. They are no more than shadows of their former selves, though the beasts they ride are real enough.-Sauron, the ancient enemy who gained power under the dark eaves of Mirkwood before being driven out and returning to Mordor to cast his shadow over the entire world.-Gollum, scrawny, pathetic former owner of the ring who desires and fears it more than anything else.-Saruman the White (Saruman of Many Colors), the leader of the white council who studied the darkness too closely, becoming it's servant.-Birds, ominous clouds of fowl who spy for the enemy. No place open to the sky is safe from their piercing eyes.-Wolves and Wargs, minions of Saruman who hunt the fellowship and drive them into the Mines.-Orcs and Trolls, dwellers in dark places and servants of the enemy, they are numerous and foul and always seem to turn up at the worst times.Besides the awesomeness, there are a few things to consider (though they don't change my rating):One, the songs are lengthy, numerous and everywhere. Not too bad in print because you have the option to skim past (though I think it worth it to read them all at least once), but I hear you have no choice but to listen to all of them in the audiobook. However, I do have a favorite among them: the longform version of Hey Diddle Diddle, which I believe comes along in the town of Bree.Two, this is a long book, purposely so according to the note from Tolkien in the frontmatter of the book. His goal was to write a long book, and he succeeded. But he did it well, so that doesn't bother me. Considering some of the epic fantasies written since whose individual books are longer than the entire combined Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy, I don't think they're too long.Three, there is no three. I like everything else.I recommend this to anyone, preferably in print. If you find you can't tackle the book, go see the movie. It's not an exact match, but it definitely channels the best of Tolkien in a format most can enjoy."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I like this book because it is a mix of both fantasy and adventure and you will have deep thought about the characters and you will enjoy this book.

The novel is actually broken up into 3 parts, the first part is \`The Fellowship of the Rings', the 2nd is \`The Two Towers', and the 3rd is \`The Return of the King'. These books in that order are a follow up to the even more famous book by him \`The Hobbit'. The Lord of the Rings takes you on an adventure with four young hobbits and their companions to destroy the ring that was placed before them. Before I go on you need to know that a Hobbit is a small creature that is about to of our size and they are peaceful creatures that live in one place and enjoy staying were they are.The main character of the story is Frodo Baggins, a young hobbit that grew up safe until being adopted by his uncle, the famous Bilbo Baggins. If you have ever read \`The Hobbit' then you would know who he is, and if you haven't read \`The Hobbit' then I recommend that you do before reading \`The Lord of the Rings'. Anyways, after Frodo is adopted by Bilbo he lives with him for quite so time, but soon Bilbo leaves leaving young Frodo alone with the adventure in front of him. Once underway, Frodo is accompanied by 3 other hobbits, a dwarf, an elf, 2 men and the famous Gandalf the wizard. Their journey starts from the elf homeland with the new fellowship, although it is a journey just getting there as you will soon find out.This book was one of the best books that I have ever came across, since I have never really found it easy to sit down and read a book, when I do it must be a really good book. If I were you I would read this book and if you don't like reading I think this book will even be enjoyable for you. JRR Tolkien did a wonderful job writing this book and its worth the time to read it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Anyone who does not enjoy this book most likely does not understand the use of language. Anyone who says it does not have a begining, middle or an end and/or compares it to the hobbit obviously lacks the knowledge that The Fellowship of the Ring is the begining to the ongoing story that is The Lord of the Rings. As for The Hobbit, it is one story, one part, it is the prelude to The Lord of the Rings, which is one story, three parts. And all three parts are very good...very entertaining...very WONDERFUL. Generally speaking, The Lord of the Rings was intended for an intelligent audience. If you have a vocabulary of 350 words or more...CONGRATULATIONS...this book is for you.Some people may argue that Tolkien created hollow characters, that is a falsity. He, in fact, created complex characters. They each have very different personallities and internal torment (at times in the book). Gandalf is an exception to this because Tolkien does not want you to know more about him than the characters. His personallity is mysterious, it would take away from the suprises in the story if it were any other way.Tolkien's advid decription of the characters' surroundings gives reality to the story. Some may say it is excessive, however, without it the story would lack individuality (which is why it it so great in the first place). Most readers are used to seeing this: \\"The door knob was shiney.\\" Tolkien readers would see this: \\"The glistening morning sun reflected cheerily off the now luminous surface of the door knob.\\" (This line is not in anyway of/by or related to Tolkien and is only intended to give a vague idea of his writting style.)He uses literary devices to enrich his stories much like the ancient Greek poet Homer. (Do not let this referance of history discourage you from reading this book.) THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING IS NOT BORING IN ANYWAY, SHAPE OR FORM! It is magnificently entertaining to the last page...AND BEYOND! We recommend this book to anyone who loves a good fantasy epic (and anyone else with the capability to read. Do not overlook this book, hidey ho!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring was one of the greatest books that I have ever read.

Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. A true masterpiece of adventure and imagination and once I started reading I couldn't put it down. Tolkien really puts the reader inside the realm of middle earth and never let's you leave. The characters are wonderfully described and give you sense of wanting to be right there with them, side by side part of the fellowship."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"In modern fantasy, Tolkien is easily the most influential figure. This book helps indicate why.The Lord of the Rings was intended to be a single story, not a trilogy, so this volume is not a stand-alone novel. Instead, it is the first two of six \\"books\\" into which Tolkien has divided his work. Book one introduces the principal characters of Frodo, Sam and Aragorn and reintroduces (from the Hobbit) Gandalf and Bilbo. It also outlines the dangers of the One Ring and the evil forces out to retrieve it. The second book deals with the adventures of the fellowship in the title as they set off on a quest to destroy the ring.Unlike the Hobbit, this is a work aimed towards adults. Tolkien does a wonderful job in telling his story and is unsurpassed in creating a setting that is rich in detail and history. As fantasy, or just storytelling in general, this is top-of-the-line stuff."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is a long review for a long book and yet there has so much more I have wanted to say that I could not due to limitations of space.The first part of the famous epic of The Lord Of The Rings , The Fellowship Of The Ring begins in the tranquil , rural setting of the Shire .It is from here that we get our first view of Middle Earth with the preparations for the 111 th birthday party of Bilbo Baggins (the hero of the children's classic The Hobbit ) . We are introduced to the many relatives of Bilbo and of course the hero of LOTR , Frodo Baggins (Bilbo's favourite nephew ) and his faithful gardener Sam Gamgee as well as his two favourite cousins Peregrine (Pippin ) Took and Meriadoc Brandybuck.It is after Bilbo's carefully planned disappearance and during visit from the Wizard Gandalf that we are introduced to the horrible threat to Middle Earth involving the Dark Lord , the enemy , Sauron and the Ring of Power which was introduced as a minor theme in The Hobbit and has been inherited by Frodo .Frodo sets out on the grand adventure with Sam,Pippin and Merry and it is in the Shire itself where the Hobbits encounter the absolute evil of the Black Riders (Ringwraiths) and the magic and beauty of the Elves . Throughout the novel they go from one diabolical danger to another , but are relieved by their stay in certain havens where the dangers and darkness of Middle Earth are kept at bay - The House of Tom Bomabadil and the Elven Kingdoms of Rivendell and Lothlorien. Together with their companions Gandalf , Aragorn the mysterious ranger (and heir to the ancient Kingdom of Numenor ) , the young warrior from Gondor , Boramir , the Elf Legolas and the Dwarf Gimli we are introduced to the scope of Middle Earth from the beautiful to the diabolical , from the homely to the mysterious , from the noble to the villainous . We also see the brilliance of Tolkien as a poet as we are introduced to a variety of Poems and Songs recited by different characters.Tolkien stressed that LOTR was in no way meant to be an allegory and was not meant to parallel any events taking place during the time , in this case the Second World War.Instead he says he approves of applicability which he distinguished from allegory by writing that the one refers to the ' freedom of the reader and the other in the proposed domination of the author ' . Thus while we must always bear in mind that LOTR is in now way an allegory we are free to draw our own analogies and parallels with events in our world .The Lord Of the Rings was published in 1954/55 .At the time there where many similarities between our world and Middle Earth . The world was divided into the Free World (as was Middle Earth ) which was engaged in a titanic battle with the Communist World and its surrogate Revolutionary Movements which aimed to destroy the way of life of Middle America and Middle England (which was mirrored in The Shire of Middle Earth ) . It aimed to destroy our Judeo-Christian heritage and all that we knew as right and good (as Mordor aimed to destroy everything noble and beautiful on Middle Earth ) through the use of terror and their disdain for what they saw as 'bourgeois ' mirrors the scorn expressed by Saruman ( in his meeting at Isengard with Gandlaf described in Chapter 11: The Council of Elrond ) for the values of old , and replace it with a system of total power and enslavement . Therefore it is hardly difficult to draw a parallel between Mordor and the old Soviet Union ( or during World War II Hitler's Third Reich ) , between the Orcs , Trolls and even fouler things infesting Middle Earth during Frodo's journey and the Revolutionary regimes and movements around the world at the time of The Cold War held in thrall by Moscow or Peking such as Nasser's Egypt , Castro's Cuba , the Viet Cong and Gadaffi's Libya .As Robert Foster , who has made detailed studies of Tolkines works and written various volumes on the topic once said : ' I remember at a Tolkien conference watching a Polish woman reach out to shake [daughter] Priscilla Tolkien's hand , This was in the dark days before Communism fell, and she said, 'You have no idea what your father's books have meant to us. They kept us believing that the Orcs would not always win.'\\"The Lord of the Rings is the story of a long and difficult battle against great evil, taken on by the humblest,\\" he continued\\".Indeed LOTR encapsulates all that great values of Western Civilisation - Freedom ,faith , the importance of the individual and the heroism of the common man .We can take faith again from LOTR as in the words of writer JP Zmirak '' A SHADOWY, evil overlord hides himself amid an unmapped mountain range. There he wields absolute power over fanatics and slaves, scheming for domination over the free peoples of the world. He sends forth assassins into peaceful lands and cities, spreading terror among civilians\\" : which refers to the network of terror supported by Radical Islam and Revolutionary Movements today which once more aims to , through an evil theology , spread terror to the innocent (whether in New York , Antwerp , Geneva or Jerusalem ) in order to destroy Western Democracy and our Judeo-Christian civilisation . Once more we need the faith of Tolkiens World to know that the forces of evil , no matter what the odds , will not win."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Four words: I love this book. The way it is constructed and the way it is so in-depth and visual just blows my mind. This book should be required reading for high school. It is the epitome of great English literature.I read this book over the spring of 2001 in anticipation of the movie which was to come later that year. The movie stood true to the book, but I was dissapointed that they left key points out, especially out of the first half. I love Tom Bombadil.Tolkien created this world which reflected our own but was totally his. It took him years to make this book and the effort shows. You NEVER at any point in the book get bored of it. The people and cultures of Middle-Earth enthrall you.The story is about a ring. A ring that once belonged to an evil king. It gave him power beyond imagination, and he used it to rule Middle-Earth. The dark lord was defeated in a brutal war, but the ring wasn't and the spirit of him still lived on.The ring somehow finds it's way to a Hobbit named Frodo. Hobbits are halflings with hairy feet and habit of smoking tobacco. They are the most peaceful race of Middle-Earth. Once he finds out that this ring is evil, and that it is his job to destroy it, he flips out, but he does it anyway. He takes three of his hobbit friends along and have adventures and meet cool people.In the second half of the book, a fellowship is formed between the four main races of Middle-Earth. The Elves, the Dwarves, the Humans, and the Hobbits. The job of the fellowship is to destroy the ring by taking it and throwing it into the cracks of Mt. Doom where it was forged. Frodo is the Ring bearer of the fellowship, the one who carries the burden of the ring, which means that he is most vulnerable to it's wicked powers.Some people say it's a social commentary but I can't really tell besides the fact of the Elves and the Dwarves as peoples hating each other, and the fact that two members of the fellowship, Legolas and Gimli make a bond which comparable to brotherhood. The Fellowship in my opinion is everyone working together in peace despite our differences.This is one of the best books ever written and I give the biggest five stars it can possibly get."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book was great and had alot more too it then the movie but the movie was more concise and to the point which was good. Too many songs that get really annoying around page 130 when Tom Bombadil rescues them. After they get past that part the books action increases and you don't wan't to stop reading until they rest which happens alot in this book and its a good thing or else I would have read the book straight through until the end and wouldn't have savoured the flavor so to speek."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"George R.R.

Who is that Tom bombadil guy and why did they add him? Or those stupid songs? And they ruined the cool intro and never showed Saruman's side of things in the book, making it all one sided. At least it ended where the movie did, but wth is up with Boromir not dead at the end of it? Whoever wrote this should have paid more attention to the script. The characters had FLAWS in it. And doubts. I don't plan to read the others."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This series is horrible beyond all conception. Tolkien overbloats EVERYTHING to the point where it's absolutely ridiculous, and I loose tract of the plot amidst unimportant details. Quite frankly my only thought is I DON'T CARE WHO EVERYONE'S FATHER IS, IF YOU WANT ME TO KNOW THEN WRITE A PREQUEL, JUST TELL THE STORY IT IDIOTIC BRIT! I don't know how someone who wrote something as good as &quot;The Hobbit&quot; could produce this junk. I think what happened was he had a bunch of notes left over, and wanted to cash in by writing a sequel, so he threw all the details he had onto a shallow plot, but sense it was to complicated to be called &quot;dumbed-down&quot; like most money-making sequels noone could attack it. And it was so complicated people have been trying to convince others for decades that they're intellegent because they can understand this book, but since noone understands it, noone can test them to see if they really do or not. Anyway, if you want a complicated plot you can understand, read &quot;Dune&quot; by Frank Herbert."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I had to read this book for a school assinment its like 5oo pages long or something and it is SO boring!

BECAUSE of the brillience of Peter Jackson I waded through one hundred pages of this book. But all too no avale: fact is, Tolkin wasn't that much of a genius as Peter Jackon is.Sadly i must conclude this because this book was so porely written. It is tedius to read all the details of Hobits lives and all the poems are bad to. I thought it would be like the movies but Mr. Tolkin writes with no emotions, he's all about the detail but please Mr. Tolkin realise that details arent the story and they arent the characters you have to pay attention to those things to or people cant be interested in your characters, 'kay?No offense but you shoud be very glad that Peter Jackson has taken this story and made it so anyone in the world can love it. I don't know if your writing sequals to the Lord of the Rings series with Sam's kids or anything or not but if you do you should look up Peter Jackson and ask him about his characters and story skills because he *understands* these things. just a helpful suggestian, 'kay?But if you MUST read this skip the opening pages and maps and start with the first chapters which are better than the stuff that comes before it but dont say you weren't warned. Tolkin impresses us with his educatian but not with his characters or story skills, sorry but its true so thats all."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"\\"The Fellowship of The Ring\\" is about how a small hobbit named Frodo receives a ring. The only thing he doesn't know is that this is the ring of evil power, the one in which evil could engulf the entire world under the power of the Dark Lord. The story is about Frodo's journey with eight companions to destroy the ring. Though people may die on the way, the fellowship still holds up but faces dangers. In the book there is a suspenseful paragraph about the beginning of the story. \\"Three rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone, one for the Dark Lord on his dark throne in the land of Mordor where the shadows lie. One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them in the land of Mordor where the shadows lie.\\""},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I read a great deal of books.

Also, I can see that there are two storylines brewing, which makes this story all the more captivating."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is an amazing book...

Buy it now.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"In my personal opinion \\"Fellowship of the Rings\\" was a good book. It was better than the movie because of its depth in everything. I saw the movie first and after seeing it I decided that I had to read the trilogy. The book went into greater detail with many of the events and it helped explain why some things were the way they were in the movie. There were a few flaws to the book however. First its length, the book is approximately 450 pages long and it can take a while to read. Second, it can become very hard to remember all the names and places which the book is heavy on. What I thought was weird when comparing the movie and the book was how a part of the book that would take 2-3 chapters, might have only taken 5-10 minutes in the movie. Where as with the action parts the movie might take 20 minutes whenever the book only covers it for a couple of pages. Overall the book is definitely worth reading even if you have seen the movie. My only suggestion would be that you go and read the \\"Hobbit\\" first, because it contains some background information that would help out quite a bit and also because it is a great book in its own right."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"A while back I read the Hobbit, one of those stay-up-late books because you can't put it down. Well, of course, then I had to read &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. I was rather disappointed at the time and never finished it. A month or two ago I decided to give it another try in anticipation of the movie. This time I did finish it, but I can understand why I never did the first time.First of all, Tolkien is a exceptional writer. He weaves a fantasy world of elves, demons, and magic full of color and life. His style, concepts, and general quest-type plot have become a much copied model for fantasy writing.However, his style is rather long winded. Although his writing is clear, sometimes I would get really tired of page after page of what the forest looked like. Sometimes I'd scan ahead and skip pages. Some of my friends, it turned out, admitted they did the same. Every once in a while it'd be problematic because I'd miss some detail and have to go back to pick up on it later. I can understand why I didn't have the patience at 12 years old to finish the book.Think of a bard, sitting by the fire with a circle of children around him. His story is good, but as he must last the entire night, he adds detailed descriptions of everything. Some of the kinderlings fall asleep. But everybody does come back for more tomorrow.

I enjoyed how Tolkien gave vivid descriptoins of every character and every thing, from the most important cahracter to the least eventful setting. I thought the general plot was original and exciting. At some points I had to force myself to put it down and go to sleep. I really enjoyed how Tolkien makes you wonder what happens at the end of the series and leaves you wanting more.In my personal opinion, the best part of the book is when Frodo Baggins, the main character, and his companions Sam, Merry, Pippen, and Strider are being persued by the Ringwraiths, evil servants of Sauron. The whole first half of the book they are fleeing to Rivindell and wondering what became of the wizard, Gandalf.I enjoyed the conflict of good versus evil that went on throughout the book. All the way from the Shire and and into the next book in the series. The journey of Frodo is filled with peril, from the Orcs of Mordor down to the slinking menace, Gollum, who stalks Frodo for &quot;his Precious&quot;. The resolution of the book leaves you wondering what will happen inthe next book.

IT's not possible, to a book classified as &quot;fantasy&quot;, to start a trilogy in such a boring manner.

Then comes the endless descriptions of the sun rising, wind from the west, winds from the east, the green of the ground, the waters falling in cascade, the sun rising, the sun going down...!!! Enough!! The FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is the worst book of the three. As I see, here are the merits and flaws of Tolkien's totally overrated trilogy:* MERITS:1- Someone willing to write such a long book must be respected by the enormous difficulty of the taske alone;2- TOlkien was really a respected English teacher and historian, and you can sense his joy in writing the book* FLAWS:1- The characters, all of them, are totally faceless, in the style of Frederick Forsyth's characters. We don't have any insight about heir feelings, about what's really going on inside their heads and hearts;2- Tolkien clearly copied unashamedly so many points from other fables, like the Arturian legend, for example;3- The endless descriptions sometimes makes one wonder that he is only gaining time (and pages), by repeating himself over and over again, like &quot; the sun was coming down, the air was heavy, the sun was rising, the air was clean and bright.........&quot;&quot; Irc!I really think the complete trilogy would fit in just one 500 pages book.

It's close to 400 pages of Frodo et al walking, being cold, encountering danger, getting rescued, walking, being frightened, being cold, getting lost, getting rescued, etc.For those of us sturdy enough to make it through the first part of the book, we are rewarded by the epic Council. Like the rest of the tale, the Council could have been dispensed with quickly and with relevance. Instead, we get numerous paragraphs on the lineage of everyone present, as well as those who are to be discussed. It is a terrible reading experience.Interestingly, after the Coucil, Tolkien's characters adopt an Olde English manner of speech, which only adds more weight to an already suffocatingly heavy load.Is Tolkien clever? Yes. Is he creative? Absolutely. Is Middle Earth a wonderfully imaginative effort? Quite. But all of this fails to make the story compelling and readable and fun.I'll admit I've been spoiled by Harry Potter. The difference in eras notwithstanding, J.K.

Tolkien is awesome!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Along with it's other parts, The Two Towers and The Return of the King, The Fellowship of the Rings makes up the greatest trilogy of books ever written. Tolkien has a style which gives life to his characters in such a way that the book feels less like fantasy and more like historical fiction. His descriptions are vivid and his setting is epic - both of which create an increbible book which I have read many times in my life. The Fellowship of the Ring is, of course, where anyone new to the books should begin. It lays out the quest and cast of characters for the entire trilogy as well as providing a daring &quot;chase&quot; story. I doubt that anyone who picks up this book will find it less than entertaining, and for a great many I am sure it will become a well-read favorite!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is the best work of J.R.R.

If you've read the Hobbit, my god, read the Lord of the Rings series! I guarantee that these books are going to be some of the best you've ever read and/or your favorites! Even if you don't care about fantasy, like me (i'm more of the sci-fi type), read them anyway.The first book, the Fellowship of the Ring, was my favorite of the three. All the action is well timed, and the book provides plenty of cliff-hangers...not to mention the ones in-between the books! All the nine characters (after the fellowship is formed), are so very different and interesting, and I loved how they brought back one of the old dwarves.Basically the whole idea of the books is that Bilbo Baggins, a small kind of man called a hobbit, passes down Gollum's Ring to his nephew, Frodo Baggins, in hopes that he might take it to be destroyed. Bilbo is 111 years old now, and doesn't feel he is up to the task. Gandalf and three other hobbits will accompany him- Merry, Samwise, and Pippin. Merry and Pippin provide comic relief for a while, until they meet Strider, and become pursued by the Ring Wraiths. They are now on a journey to meet the wise Elven King and Queen, who will brief them on their mission, as well as provide others to help them in their quest. The first book takes them through about half of their journey in the lands, while the second will be the other half. The last book takes place in Mordor...their ultimate destination, where Mt Doom is and where salvation from the Dark Lord Sauron."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring, the first part of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien, is a fantasy focusing on a hobbit by the name of Frodo Baggins. Frodo is the favorite nephew of his Uncle Bilbo Baggins, the legendary hobbit who set foot upon the most storied journey of all hobbit folklore. Bilbo's story is told in The Hobbit, which is considered the prelude to this trilogy. Near the end of Bilbo's travels he came upon the most powerful ring in all of the land, known as the Ring of Power. Being Bilbo's favorite relative, Frodo inherited the Ring, among various other items, when Bilbo decided to \\"retire\\" and move to a different land after his 111th birthday. Frodo had known of the Ring through stories relayed by Bilbo, however he learned all that was to be known of the Ring from the mighty wizard, Gandalf the Grey. What Frodo discovered was that very little was known of the One and that its mystery was only exceeded by its power. Gandalf told of the very evil implications about the Ring and that the dark Sauron was in pursuit of the One. Frodo must set foot on a journey to dispose of the Ring in the only place which it can be destroyed at the very center of Sauron's evil kingdom in Mordor atop Mt. Doom. Frodo is joined initially by his faithful servant, Sam, along with Gandalf. Along the travels, the crew encounters several new characters and conquests, both advantageous and perilous and is continuously having new light shone on the mystery of the Ring and the true meanings of the journey. This book is the classic story of Good versus Evil. This book is a must-read to a fan of anything adventurous, classical, magical, mythological, or fantastical. The one aspect that really sets this book apart from the pack is Tolkien's excellent language and diction. His language is very descriptive, yet to-the-point. The reader can see what is happening without actually viewing the actions. Tolkien's language is very poetic and would be better served had the book been printed in calligraphy. The Lord of the Rings Trilogy will hit the big screen in successive Christmases starting in 2001 with The Fellowship of the Ring. However, this story is sure to be far better using one's own imagination rather than the impressions of someone else. Read the book before seeing the movie."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"My old review: I tried to read this book. But it was just too boring.

Im glad I did, I feel that most avid readers should at least give the fellowship of the ring a try, it may not be for everyone but once you get into the world of Tolkien it is very hard to let go. I felt that I lived inside the book and I never wanted to leave. I have started The Two Towers (Part 2 of the lord of the rings) and it is even better. I dont know what I will do when I am finished the third book I dont think I will ever want the journey to end.

Just way to boring for me. I wanted to read this book to see if it gets any better. And it has. It has grown to win a special place in my heart. Not as big as the Oz series but a small place. It's compeling sad light hearted moving and has many other traits. At the beginning it is hard to understand and boring trying to figure out but it slowly get's better and better."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"As I read through the incredible story of The Fellowship of The Ring I was amazed at what J.R.R. Tolkien was able to create. Through all the imagination of the story and wide variety of characters I was entranced from the minute I started reading. I felt like I was part of the story all the way through to the end.I very much enjoyed The Lord of The Rings and am quite excited to finally be moving on to the second book. Throughout the first book you really get the introduction of the story and all the characters. From poor old Bilbo to the young spirit filled Frodo the adventure begins.It really starts out in the quiet parts of the Shire where Bilbo and Frodo Baggins both live. On Bilbo's 111th birthday he leaves the Shire forever leaving Frodo his most prized possession. This most prized possession is the ring. To describe the ring I leave you this poem of description which can be found in the first page of the book. Three Rings for the elven-kings under the sky, Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their hall of stone, Nine for mortal men doomed to die, One for the dark lord on his dark thrown, In the land of mordor where the shadows lie. One ring to rule them all, One ring to find them, One ring to bring them all together and in the darkness bind them, In the land of Mordor where the shadows lie. This one ring falls into the hands of our young boy Frodo and on his adventure to destroy the ring is where the real plot begins. My favorite part of The Lord of The Rings I must say is the part where the company is staying in Bree and come across there soon to be 5th companion named Strider. The descriptions of this great powerful man with rustic, broad features are amazing and very overtaking. He is by far my favorite character.Overall I really enjoyed this book and I would recommend it to everyone who can get through all the details and really enjoy the true nature of the book. J.R.R. Tolkien really takes you through his own world of imagination and I hope you enjoy the book like I did."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"A Review by JordanA young hobbit embarks on a journey to destroy the ultimate ring that will release destruction upon Middle Earth if the true owner gets hold of it.

It is a book of might and magic, also friendship and the battles against an evil warrior. I enjoyed this book but I didn&#65533;t like some of the parts where they got into a lot of detail and little actions. I also couldn&#65533;t fallow all of the different names sometimes, I found myself flipping back and forth though the book asking my self, &#65533;what was that again,&#65533; or &#65533;who is that,&#65533; but you get a better understanding of the beginning if you have read Tolkien&#65533;s first book &#65533;The Hobbit&#65533; which is kind of the prequel to the &#65533;Lord of the Rings&#65533; series.I would recommend this book for those with patience and imagination.

Very good (I felt) on the nuances that readers notice in the book after first reading in (say) junior high and then re-reading it every five-to-ten years or so. Will especially appeal to the less fanatical Tolkien fan who deeply appreciates the book without getting into collecting the plastic figurines or going to the movie of it; the reader who because of the LOrd of the Rings went on to discover other, even greater stories like those of Shakespeare and Dante (for which I thank Tolkien whole-heartedly). Better than the (enjoyable, light) BBC version, and far superior to the American - accented production."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"In the Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, Tolkien uses many interesting literary devices to grab all kinds of different readers attention. Unlike some other authors, Tolkien creates a fantasy world for readers, to make the book more fun, and more exciting to read. This fantasy world is called middle-earth. Middle-earth is a place where Tolkien brings all sorts of creatures like elves, goblins, dwarves, orcs, and other creatures to life. Tolkien creates a plot that is more than good enough to make the fantasy world that he has created come alive. He does this by giving elements of nature more attributes, and making unreal creatures that people have only imagined. By reading this story the reader is able to relate him or herself to one or more of the many characters in the story that Tolkien brings to life. Another important thing that Tolkien was able to do in this story was make the adventure of the main character Frodo Baggins seem true to life. Tolkien makes Frodo and his friends be heroes to those people who thought that some things were impossible. In this story Frodo's friends are compared to companions that Tolkien feels are true friends of somebody. Tolkien uses a literary device that is similar to a gospel message. The message is that one this adventure the fellowship would not have been able to accomplish what they did, if they were not there for each other, and they did not work together.This was an excellent story because Tolkien did as much as he was able to make this story as great as it is. Tolkien shows the world in writing this story that people don't have to write like there is only one world. Tolkien's imagination has defied the ways that people think about what literature can be. Tolkien put his thoughts, his emotions, and what he believes in into this book. If you are a reader who is looking for a story with an unreal world, and unreal characters, and an adventure that is like no other, than this is the book for you. Even though this was just the first book of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Tolkien still leaves readers curious and interested how the entire story will actually end. In conclusion Tolkien's story The Lord of the Rings, can be an inspiration to anyone who needs any kind of uplifting, or anyone who wants to read about something that seems beyond belief compared to the world that they live in now.Thank you for reading my review."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I have just yesterday finished reading the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy and &quot;the Hobbit&quot;. After being incredibly intrigued by&quot;the Hobbit&quot;, I can honestly say this book disappointed me. A precaution though: I loved &quot;the Two Towers&quot; and &quot;the Return of the King&quot;, but &quot;the Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is the worst book in the series.To begin with, lots of stuff we learn in the beginning seems irrelevent. I confess, I eventually gave up on the seemingly inconsequential prologue and skipped right to chapter 1. While this problem doesn't taint the rest of the book too much, the prologue is just too long and showcases this flaw too much to just ignore.Even once the story begins, you still have to deal with the slow pace that I'm sure you've read about in the negative reviews. Tolkien just takes too much time describing things. Basically, the problem runs through almost the whole book, but especially in the early going. I realize some description is needed, but &quot;the Hobbit&quot; was just as descriptive, yet had far less space devoted to descriptions.But there's good stuff as well, Namely the charactor interactions. Scenes like Gandalf revealing the truth about the Ring to Frodo and Frodo's chat with Gimli's father Gloin really redeem this book.But that doesn't change the fact that this is the worst of the trilogy. I'd give it 31/2 stars, rounded down. It is true &quot;the Fellowship of the Ring&quot; will be remembered as the book that started the original fantasy series, but being there first only holds so much credibility. Thankfully though, &quot;the Two Towers&quot; and &quot;the Return of the King&quot; were giant steps up from this book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"(...)The first 200 pages or so are tough going--a leaf by leaf description of the landscape as Frodo and his pals walk and walk and walk (I think I got aerobic benefit just from reading!). It really helps to skip all of the awful songs and poetry (even Kahlil Gibrain seems inspired compared to Tolkien), which are totally superfluous. When the action gets going, it's good. The characters are a mixed bag (or baggins, I suppose). The hobbits are really engaging: lazy, overeating, territorial little critters who are very human and lots of fun. Gimli the dwarf is okay, too--he's got a huge grudge against almost everybody and thinks that subterranean cities are fun. The human warriors are fatuous and dull, though Aragorn (Strider) earns some sympathy because, despite his strength and lineage (he's the scion of kings), he manages to screw up constantly. The tendency of the warriors to recite 600 generations of their ancestry at the drop of a spear gets old quickly. The elves are the most insufferable creatures in fiction--impossibly beautiful, immortal, and do they ever know it! They also deal some drugs, but don't ever have any fun.The loopiest character by far is Tom Bombadil, an old geezer who can talk cranky elm trees out of devouring hobbits. This bizarre proto-hippie sings godawful songs and seems to have eaten too many forest mushrooms. He also appears to be shacked up with a teenage forest nymph. I think Tolkien means us to take him seriously, but it's just not possible.Gandalf is a hoot--a wizard with a sense of humor, the inspiration, I guess, for Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series (which are much more fun to read than Tolkien). The best villain so far is not Sauron (who is just a yellow eye, anyway), but a character who appears for only three paragraphs or so--Bill Ferny, a stinky mortal who inspires more loathing than all the orcs and Gollums put together (I'd bet he was based on some Oxford colleague of Tolkien's)But with all the laborious description and with the tedious pastiche of mythology (some Celtic, some Germanic, a soupcon of Christian, etc.), the story is a good one, and you pull for the good guys. I had fun with it this time around. (...)"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I resisted reading this trilogy, felt above fantasy type genre. This is great stuff. There is really little else to say."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Over the years, I have joyfully delved again and again into Tolkien's fantastic world of Middle-earth. If you aren't careful, the lush descriptions and rich lore will enchant you into thinking this world is real. I sometimes have to pinch myself, remembering that Middle-earth is, after all, a world of imagination only. But what imagination! Still, I cannot recommend it unconditionally. The age-old criticism of this novel is that its conflict of good versus diabolical evil is too simplistic. Even if this is true, is this a flaw? Rather, it might be the most tragic aspect of Tolkien's tale - wouldn't we all rather live in an easy world of black and white distinctions, instead of our own unhappy, difficult and ambiguously gray world? That is why Middle-earth is so easy for people to love. Other notable criticisms are that Tolkien included no substantial female characters, and that dark-skinned characters are always on the side of evil. Truly, these are unfortunate anachronisms that mar an otherwise gorgeous story. Still, if you are able to willingly suspend your disbelief, you might find yourself enthralled by this epic masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's phenomenol trilogy starts with the Fellowship Of The Ring, the story that takes you into a world of elves, dwarves, men, and hobbits. Tolkien's writing painted the story in my imagination like de Vinci painted Mona Lisa. The first part of the War of the Ring takes you around Middle Earth with an unforgetable cast of characters. i will be honest, if your not in the mood it may start off a little slow, but it quickly turns into the page-turner epic classic tht makes it world famous today. I recommend it to any book lover, and especially those who love fantasies."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is the first step in what is undoubtedly the greatest work of fantasy literature of the 20th century, if not of all time. Tolkien has created a world so compelling, and so 'real' that the reader cannot help but be pulled into Middle Earth.The characters are engaging, the story is riveting, and the locations - Good Lord - the locations are Wonderful. Places like Lothlorien, the Old Forest, Weathertop, and of course the Mines of Moria - the ancient, sprawling dwarven kingdom that inspired Gary Gygax to create the Dungeons &amp; Dragons role playing game.If you are new to fantasy, if you don't usually go in for this kind of story, or if you are just looking for a great read, you owe it to yourself to pick this one up and find out what all the fuss is about.Let me put it this way -- there exist in the world dedicated Tolkien Scholars. How many Clancy or Koontz scholars do you think are out there?"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is the first segment of the greatest literary masterpiece ever written, The Lord of the Rings. Lots of people call it a trilogy, but I can only agree with that idea in that the three segments were initially published seperately in the years 1954, 1955, and 1956. Besides that, one has to notice that each segment is incomplete without the others. A trilogy would contain three complete stories, like the original Star Wars trilogy. Well, its time I got on with my two cents of TFOTR. After The Hobbit was published, the fantasy genre was revived in a way that gave Arthur and his knights a run for their money. Fantasy was back, 20th century style. People begged for a sequel, and Tolkien delivered one beyond anybody's expectations and imagination. TFOTR begins to answer the questions that resulted at the end of The Hobbit. This, I feel, is its main purpose. It doesn't have as much action as the two later segments, but instead focuses on why a new quest is to begin. It does have its moments of action, but most of suspense and intrigue comes from revelations. Thats why The Hobbit should be read first. It would be a mistake not to. It is true that is somwhat slow in the beginning, but the suspense and wonder of a ruling ring just glides in the story. Suddenly, what happened with Bilbo's quest becomes very importent. It was in TFOTR that Tolkien introduced Middle-Earth and its history. A person forgets that they're reading fantasy in LOTR. It feels very real, and once TFOTR gets though the beginning, it doesn't let go. The only real bad part is that it leaves you hanging in the end, forcing you to read The Two Towers and making you wish that you had a single volume edition. I've been to Middle-Earth, and I deeply regreted having to leave for a while. Read this masterpiece (LOTR) before you die. You'll be incomplete if you don't."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Prepare yourself to delve into a world so rich, so full of life and history that you will have trouble distinguising it from something real.

I picked up The Hobbit quite some time ago, I think I was in the 4th grade.From the moment I read the first words &quot;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.&quot;, I just couldn't put it down.This book does, however, lack a few things. Smut, trash, cussing, and all of the other all too common things these days. This is pure fantasy, pure enjoyment.My only wish is that I had never read it, so that I could enjoy the experience of reading it the first time again.I warn you. If you are a very busy person, and don't have much time on your hands, then don't get this book, because you'll find yourself neglecting many important things to keep reading.With charecters so vivid that it wouldn't surprise me at all if I were to run into Gandalf on the street. In fact, I'm pretty sure I'd sit down with him and blow a few smoke rings before heading in our seperate directions.My point is, this is a wonderful series . . . arguably one of the best.

Tolkien uses rich and skillful words to tell his epic tale. While part one doesn't have much in the way of action, it is my favorite out of the three books. It contains a very suspenseful build up to part two, where the real action begins. Of course you wouldn't expect Part one to have as much action as Part two or three.In 'Fellowhip of the Ring' I fell in love with Frodo's faithful servant Sam. He is character to good too be true! It is Sam's personality and comments, that make him an absolute bomb. In the other books he is the bomb, but in an action stand point. The only problems with the other two books, is that you have to wait to the second half of them, to find out what has happened to Frodo and Sam.This is a must read for everyone. Of course read 'The Hobbit' first. Without reading that first, this book here can be confusing, and less fun. I wish at times that I hadn't ever read this trilogy, just so that I could read it again for the very first time."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is the first book in the trilogy Lord of the Rings. This first portion of the book tells of the making and breaking of the Fellowship of the Ring. The major appeal of the story stems form its rich history of the mythical world Middle Earth, and the great number of characters.The Fellowship of the Ring tells of a little known race of beings called halflings, or as they like to all themselves Hobbits, who's peaceful and fun loving way of life is being threatened to the brink of total destruction as well as pure and utter chaos. None in the Shire,the secluded home of the Hobbits, know of this emanate danger which is rapidly approaching except one small Hobbit named Frodo. Fore he possesses a magical ring of immense power. A power which is sought after by the dark lord of Mordor and his nine black riders; who will stop at nothing and go to any lengths to obtain the One Ring.

Although the journey may prove parlous or even fatal Frodo and three of his closest friend begin their journey toward Mount Doom, which will that them more than a year fromstart to finish.I could go on for several dozen pages, how ever I would hate to destroy the great pleasure I found in reading and discovering the deep and rich history of Middle Earth.

He evokes the spirit of the book through the very timbre of his voice. Even if you do not usually like to listen to recorded books, I believe this recording will draw you into the story and keep you spellbound. Every time I listen to Inglis's recordings of The Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit (he has recorded them all), I feel as if he is spinning out the tale for the first time.Listening to a book helps me pick up details I miss when reading (sometimes being a fast reader is not a good thing). Inglis's narration and characterization have helped me understand the plot and characters better. In particular, he gives delightful and moving readings of the poetry--the stories within the story of Frodo's adventure. He sometimes chants, sometimes sings the tales of the ancient heroes of Middle Earth.Do not miss the opportunity to hear the best reading of Tolkien's masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Lord of the Rings is truly monumental fiction. I've read fantasy from many, many different authors, including Terry Brooks, Piers Anthony, Stephen R. Donaldson, Terry Goodkind, Robert Jordan, to name only a few, and I have come to the conclusion that every fantasy author in the last fifty years has borrowed from Tolkein to one extent or another.The basic plot of the book is fairly simple. Frodo Baggins is a hobbit who inherits a Ring of Power form his uncle Bilbo Baggins. At first glance, the Ring seems to be a good thing, posessing the power to turn its wearer invisible (a power which saved uncle Bilbo several times during his own adventure, chronicled in The Hobbit). However, the wizard Gandalf learns that the Ring is in fact the One Ring, created millenia ago by the evil Dark Lord Sauron, and removed from his posession by thr forces of good. Sauron was weakened by his loss, but now he has recovered strength and wants his Ring back. Once he gets it, he will have the power to conquer the world. The only way to keep the Ring from his grasp is to destroy it, and this can only be done by casting the Ring into the fires of Mount Doom, where it was originally created. Naturally, Mount Doom lies in the very heart of Sauron's realm in Mordor, so the quest is fraught with peril. Frodo and his faithful servant Sam, along with others, take on the task of the destruction of the Ring and the salvation of Middle-Earth. Fellowship of the Ring chronicles the first part of this story, which concludes with The Two Towers and Return of the King.If that was all there was to this book, it would be mo more than a first-rate work of fantasy. But, what lifts this book out of the realm of &quot;fantasy&quot; and into the realm of classic literature is the backstory. Lord of the Rings is essentially the conclusion of an incredible mythology that stretches back for over 7,000 Years of the Sun, and for who knows how many millenia before that. Tolkein worked on this mythology for several decades before Lord of the Rings was published, and references to it are sprinkled liberally throughout. The language and songs of the Elves are the best example of this, but there are many others.The pace of the book does slow a little in places, but that is only becuase several long expository sections are essential to give the reader the full story behind the Ring and how it made its journey from the hand of Sauron to the posession of Frodo. But, the book nevertheless has the power to draw you in. I've read this book over 20 times since I first discovered it in the early 1980's, and I still have not gotten tired of the wonder of this book.I do want to make one comment on the latest version of the book, however. I've noticed that many people have criticized the maps in the book as too difficult to read. I've looked at some of the newer copies, and I have to agree with this. I would like to point out that the map in these new copies is NOT the original map drawn by Tolkein himself, nor is it the revised map drawn by his son. The older maps are much better drawn, though the text is a little small. Frankly, if the new maps (drawn by Shelly Shapiro) bother you, I would suggest that you prowl through a local used bookstore and pick up an older copy of the trilogy, preferably the beautifully done Ballantine paperbacks of the early-to-mid 1980's. In addition to much better maps, the cover art on those books is beautiful. The one-volume red hardback version is also very nice, and you should be able to find a nice copy of it new.Books like the Harry Potter series are OK. They are light and enjoyable reading, but 100 years from now, they will be forgotten. Not The Lord of the Rings. It's a major classic of English literature, and it is THE classic of fantasy fiction."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"What can I say that has not already been said? (except in the bad reviews) Tolkien has changed my perspective on life. I may be an evangelical Christian (Tolkien was Catholic) but I find his books full of great Christian insights. And besides that, his books are AMAZING.The descriptions: full, deep, beautiful. Rich with variety, color, and realism. I stand on the rocky crags of the Emyn Muil. I hear the ever-changing music of the Falls of Nimrodel. I see the breathtaking majesty of Minas Tirith. And I shudder under the menacing glare of the Dark Tower of Mordor. I have read this book countless times, and I am still moved by it.The characters: Rich, touching, real. I cry for Frodo and empathize with Sam. I cheer on Gandalf when he rides on the Pellennor Fields. I gasp as Eowyn removes her helmet, revealing her identity and defieing the Nazgul. I laugh at Butterbur puzzling over the thought of Strider as a King. Even the secondary characters seem to have lives and histories of their own. These are people I know.Last, the plot: Oh-h-h-h. &quot;The Bridge of Khazad-Dum&quot; still scares me half to death. &quot;The Voice of Saruman&quot; makes me want to slap that evil wizard. &quot;Shelob's Lair&quot; still takes my breath away.I swear: Tolkien did not make this up. Tolkien has been to Middle Earth. This book rates second on my list of Books of the Millennia (with the Bible as #1!)If you have not read it, read it! If you have, read it again!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"In his introduction to The Fellowship of the Ring, J.R.R. Tolkien writes that the story he began in The Hobbit &#34;grew in the telling&#34; as it metamorphosed into the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I've found that The Fellowship of the Ring grows in depth and breadth each time I read it. I must confess that, after seeing Peter Jackson's movies of The Lord of the Rings, I needed to take a break from reading to let Jackson's images clear out. Having done that, my recent re-reading of The Fellowship of the Ring has been a wonderful experience. Tolkien's story is so much more complex than Jackson, and maybe simply than film, is able to convey. Read and enter a different world!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Rob Inglis' reading is wonderful. I ordered this version because it is unabridged, but was prepared to be unhappy with the reading of Mr. Inglis. I am very happy with his reading. The inflection and phrasing is very well done. I am enjoying it immensely. If you would like to hear the whole story- buy it without hesitation."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I am not one for fantasy books, but I somehow fell in love with the Lord of the Rings movies. I put it off for a while, but a week ago I bit the bullet and started reading The Fellowship of the Ring. Am I glad I did!Many of you probably know the storyline, but for those of you whom don't, I will briefly put it out. Frodo Baggins lives in the secluded Shire, far away from the real world of elves, men, dwarves, and other creatures. As a hobbit, he lives without much interruption. One day, he discovers his uncle left him a ring with evil powers. His friend, Gandalf discovers this, and they decide they must get rid of it. So Frodo travels with his friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin to Rivendale, to Elrond, a wise elf that will know what to do with it. Along the way, they have many adventures, and almost loose their lives several times. Once there, it is decided that there should be a group, or \\"fellowship\\", that will take the ring to Mount Doom, the only place it can be destroyed. The group is made up of nine: Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gimli the dwarf, Legolas the elf, Boromir the man, Aragorn the man and heir to Gondor, and Gandalf the wizard. They soon realize the quest shan't be as easy as they thought, and the fellowship threatens to break.Once again, I am glad I read this book! Although I knew most of it, it was fun reading it and finding out the history of everything and the new scenes and characters. The first thirty pages or so are hard to get through because it is basically a history of hobbits with a bunch of foreign names and places. Once you get through that, it becomes of wonderful read. Even though they say you should read the book before you watch the movie, I disagree. There was so much description and complicated plots that you should know the story first."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Lord of the Rings the Fellowship of the Ring, By J.R.R. Tolkien is a fantasy. It is about a hobbit, Frodo, who has been told by a wizard, Gandalf, to destroy an evil ring, the one ring of power before it falls in to the hands of Sauron who will use the ring to destroy middle-earth. But the only place to destroy the ring is in the fires of mount doom witch is in the middle of Sauron's kingdom.The only thing with this book is the Cliffhangers in this book are slightly annoying but it does keep you attached to the book.In my mind I think this book is very entertaining and interesting in the description the author use in the many situations Frodo gets into.This book had many good features about it and manly the plot makes you need to read the other books in the series The Two Towers, and The Retune of the King.I would recommend this book to first anyone who has seen the movie because the movie was great and the book is even better, anyone who likes fantasy, anyone who likes adventure, or just anyone looking for a good read."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"What is there left to say about The Lord of the Rings? I believe that, on this very website, the trilogy was named the best novel of the twentieth century. Now that the movies have come out, everyone is familiar with the story. It is unfair to come to the books for the first time now, with so many expectations built up. As good as the book is, it is still only a book. Frodo will not leap off the page, put his arm around you, and make you feel good about yourself. I fear people will be disappointed. Also, there is a very large contingent of people who HATE Tolkien.So where does that leave us?I have just finished reading The Fellowship of the Ring for the second time. For me, it was more enjoyable reading the book AFTER I'd seen the movie. Middle-earth is such a complex universe that it is easy to get lost. Do not read these novels if you are fixed on getting to the ending. Here especially, the journey is the thing. LOTR is about going places, meeting people, and having new adventures. The movies told this story from a modern vantage point - emphasizing action. In the book, the action is not as prevalent.I had the opportunity of traveling to Oxfordshire recently (Tolkien's old neighborhood) and I had the feeling that I was traveling to Middle-earth myself. That is the feeling Tolkien wishes to convey. He loved nature, loved traveling, and he wanted to write a book that expressed his love. I think the book succeeds admirably. To be sure, there is enough magic and monsters to hold your attention as well.Come to this book on its own terms. Get ready for a nice leisurely read. Don't expect a transcription of the movies and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book was amazing...one of those &quot;can't put it down&quot; kinda books. I definitly recommend it to people who need an escape from they're every day life. Tolkien will take you through an adventure that you will become hooked to. After seeing the movie, I definitley thought that the book could not be better. Once again, the theory of &quot;the book is always better than the movie&quot; is proven true."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Those unfamiliar with J. R. R. Tolkien's book or have seen only Peter Jackson's splendid cinematic adaptation, may not realize that &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is part one of a nearly fifteen hundred page novel which was divided into three parts by Tolkien's English publisher, Allen and Unwin in the mid 1950's. The entire saga should be seen best as a very long novel, with each volume representing a third of the saga. In &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; we are introduced to Frodo Baggins, his servant Samwise Gamgee, and his friends and cousins Meriadoc &quot;Merry&quot; Brandybuck and Perigrin &quot;Pippin&quot; Took, hobbits of the Shire, an obscure corner of the land of Middle Earth, located in the former realm of Arnor. In stark contrast to Peter Jackson's film, Frodo Baggins is depicted as a mature scholar familiar with Elvish lore; a younger, more dynamic version of his uncle Bilbo Baggins, whose most important adventure was recounted in Tolkien's &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. His cousin Merry is also portrayed as a wiser, more thoughtful person than he is seen initially in Jackson's film. And Gandalf, their wizard friend, comes across as a bit more reckless than he is portrayed in the film by actor Ian McKellen.After celebrating his 111th birthday, Bilbo Baggins disappears in front of an astonished crowd of family, friends and neighbors in Hobbiton. His old friend Gandalf persuades Bilbo to give up the magic ring responsible for his disappearance, which he leaves to his nephew and heir Frodo. Years pass before Gandalf returns with some ill news regarding the ring. It is the One ring, the all powerful ring forged in secret by the Dark Lord Sauron; the ultimate weapon for seizing control of Middle Earth and plunging it into darkness. Over a thousand years before Frodo's time, at the end of the Second Age, a last alliance of men and elves fight Sauron in the land of Mordor; their victory is assured only when the ring is cut off from Sauron's hand. Isildur, son of the slain king Elendil, cuts the ring and takes it for his own, with dire consquences for him. The ring is lost, found hundreds of years later by the creature Gollum, and is lost again, found in Gollum's cave by Bilbo Baggins.Gandalf urges Frodo to flee to Bree, since Sauron's deadly servants, the nine Nazgul or ringwraiths, are in pursuit of the one who bears the One Ring. Sam, Merry and Pippin join Frodo in his quest. Before leaving the shire they meet the mysterious Tom Bombadill, who recommends to Frodo that they seek Gandalf in Bree at the Prancing Pony inn. At Bree they meet instead the ranger Strider aka Aragorn, the last of the Dunedain, the direct descendants of the kings of the lost realm of Arnor. He leads them eventually to Rivendell, after a perilous chase by the Nazgul, in which Frodo is stabbed in the shoulder by the Nazgul leader. Finally, in Rivendell, at the home of Elrond Halfelven, Frodo is reunited with Gandalf, who warns of his fellow wizard Saruman's treachery.Elrond assembles a council to determine the ring's fate. It is decided that the ring should be brought to Mordor, to be destroyed in the firy chasm of Mount Doom. Isildur's broken sword Narsil is reforged and presented to Aragorn as the sword that was broken and remade, Andruil. Frodo volunteers to serve as the Ring Bearer, with Gandalf, Aragorn, Sam, Merry and Pippin joining the Fellowship of the Ring. Boromir, son of Denethor, the Steward of Gondor, also joins the fellowship, along with the dwarf Gimli and the elf Legolas. The fellowship is ordered to accompany Frodo for as long as it is feasible, with some of the fellowship thinking of accompanying Boromir back to his home city and capital of Gondor, Minas Tirith.Gandalf, leading the Fellowship, tries to take them across the snowy pass of Caradhras. Defeated by extreme cold and a blinding snowstorm, and an attack by wargs (wolves), the Fellowship turns back and is taken through the Mines of Moria. Inside the darkened halls of the deserted dwarf city of Dwarrowdelf, the Fellowship is attacked by orcs and a demon from the First Age, a Balrog. Gandalf confronts the Balrog on the Bridge of K'hazakdum, and is swept by the Balrog into the abyss.In mourning, the Fellowship flees Moria and ventures out into the open, finding sanctuary in the enchanted forest of Lothlorien, home of the Elven king and queen Celeborn and Galadriel. After receiving parting gifts from Galadriel, the company journeys by boat towards the Falls of Rauros. Attacked once more by orcs near the falls, the company disperses, with Frodo and Sam making the perilous journey to Mordor on their own.I have provided the reader a brief sketch of the plot in the &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, which does differ, in some substantial detail, from Peter Jackson's acclaimed film version. Yet I hope that those unfamiliar with the written text of Tolkien's words will be sufficiently intrigued to pick up this volume. Without a doubt, it is the great beginning of what many regard as the finest fantasy epic ever written."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I received J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" for Christmas and had them sitting around on my shelf for a long time; I wanted to read \\"The Hobbit\\" first. But I had a burning desire to read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and so I set \\"The Hobbit\\" down and read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". I obviously started with the first of the trilogy: \\"The Fellowship of the Ring.\\"\\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" starts of in a small area of Middle-Earth called the Shire. We are introduced to our main character named Frodo Baggins, who is the nephew of Bilbo Baggins. During a visit to the Shire, Bilbo's longtime friend Gandalf the wizard discovers a mysterious ring in Bilbo's possession. So Gandalf leaves to do some research. He returns, after Bilbo has left the Shire, leaving the ring behind. Gandalf speaks to Frodo, telling him of the horrors that he discovered about the Ring. Many ages ago, one ring was forged in the fires of Mount Doom by the dark lord Sauron, and into the ring Sauron put all of his evil powers. The ring was made for only one purpose: to give the ring-bearer ultimate ruling power over all peoples of Middle-Earth.But in a battle at Sauron's fortress, Isildur, the son of the King of Middle-Earth, cut the ring from the hand of Sauron. So Sauron lost all of his power and vanished. But his spirit still existed, and it searched for the One Ring. The ring was lost but was found by Bilbo who brought it to the Shire. After telling the story, Gandalf tells Frodo to go south to the Elven village of Rivendell and seek the advice of Elrond, Rivendell's ruler, so Frodo journeys south with his friends Sam, Pippin and Merry.At Rivendell, they learn that the Ring cannot be destroyed in any way other than being thrown into the fires of Mount Doom where it was first forged. Only then will Sauron lose all of his power and diminish. Elrond advises everyone that the ring must go south to Mordor, the lands where Mount Doom and Sauron's fortress reside. Knowing what must be done, Frodo, having taken the task of ring-bearer, journeys south with a fellowship organized by Elrond. The fellowship includes: Sam, Pippin, Merry, Gandalf, Aragorn, Boromir, Gimli the Dwarf, and Legolas the Elf.So that was the premise of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", set up in the first of the trilogy, \\"The Fellowship of the Ring. While reading the book, I could tell that the story was a great story and it is. What makes the story so great is that as the Fellowship gets nearer to Mordor, the harder their journey becomes, and no matter what they face, they have to get to Mordor and destroy the Ring. What also help the story are the places that we visit. Places like the Shire and Rivendell are described as beautiful places. It is through these descriptions that we can see a part of what is at stake here if the One Ring should return to Sauron, and Sauron claim ruler ship over Middle-Earth.What I really liked, apart from the story, was Tolkien's writing style. He would always describe everything in many details, making it easy for the reader to visualize what is going on, therefore enhancing the story. The descriptions really help not hinder the book.For this review, I decided that a description of the plot would be more important than talking about literary mechanics that made the book something enjoyable for me to read. I would recommend this book to everyone, but if you don't like the plot then don't read the book, because the plot is what \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\" is all about. It is a masterpiece, and I am looking forward to reading \\"The Two Towers\\", the second book in the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is a great book. You'd be surprised to see how different the movie and the book are. And they are so different, that it would not be good to read the Two Towers after watching the Fellowship of the Ring movie. You would miss so much. And I would also recomend reading The Hobbit. But anyway, the story is about a Hobbit named Frodo. In the beginning Bilbo, Frodo's uncle (who you will find more about in The Hobbit), is visited by an old friend: Gandalf the Grey. Bilbo announces that \\"This is the end\\", and he slips on the ring, and leaves Hobbiton in the Shire. I do not think that it would be a good idea to tell you much more, so you'll just have to read it. But remember, it will not work seeing the Fellowship and then reading the Two Towers."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"\\"One Ring to rule them all. One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.\\"This proverb sums up the main theme of The Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring in one carefully-worded phrase; indeed, this thematic saying is repeated several times throughout the novel. The legend-like story was written by J.R.R Tolkien to supplement the almost nonexistent native lore from his own country, England. This mythical style imparts a sense that the fantastic occurrences of the novel actually happened; while reading it, it seems as if you've simply stumbled upon a dusty scroll which matter-of-factly chronicles history.Like the unconcerned, humanoid Hobbits that the novel centers on, the story starts off very slowly, spending twenty pages detailing the history of Middle Earth and of the One Ring, which becomes tedious as the names of obscure places, people, and things quickly become muddled. Finally, the real story begins, only to stall a few dozen pages later when all the information scrupulously reported in the Prologue is then accounted again in another wearisomely long--though watered-down--history to Frodo Baggins, the Hobbit protagonist of the tale and the Ring-bearer. This lecture, given by Gandalf the Grey (another character crucial to the plot) becomes tedious after the first paragraph. The novel then continues with the action, and after another 100 pages, finally takes Frodo and his willing friends out of the agrarian Shire and into the real beginning of his dramatic and exciting quest. Frodo has been enjoined to take the evil Ring and destroy it in its birthplace, Mt. Doom, in the gloomy and disheartening land of Mordor, making Middle Earth safe from the dominion of the evil Sauron, whose gloved hand created the Ring long ago. At this point, the suspense level of the novel, which had previously been set at about two (Move Along, Please) skyrockets to twelve and a half out of ten (Under the Covers With a Flashlight).Though it starts off slow and plodding, The Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring develops into an engrossing tale of incredible mythology. Since its first publishing in the 1950s, the novel has remained a bestseller- a fitting tribute to a genius such as Tolkien, who created the complex Middle Earth while holding down another job as an English professor. The history and legends extend far beyond the novels themselves, but unlike other less complicated fabrications, never double-crosses itself.This novel, an enduring classic, has been made into a multi-million dollar movie, filmed in the breathtaking landscapes of New Zealand. Surprisingly, most of the literally millions of viewers had never read Tolkien's works. In fact, the majority of people who have watched the popular movie have never read the novel, which remains the best introduction to Middle-Earth. This stands as another reason to begin the daunting, though highly satisfying, undertaking of reading the three volume, 1100 page epic."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Don't miss the opportunity to partake in one of the most fascinating, enthralling, and indepth stories of all time!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Fellowship of the RingBy: J.R.R.

But few writers since then have posessed such a magical writing style, or such a knack for memorable characters. Middle Earth is a world the reader can get lost in, yet Tolkien knew when to stop describing and let the reader's imagination take over (something a number of recent writers ought to take to heart). In short, Tolkien is one of the most often imitated writers for a reason..."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings five years ago, and then again earlier this year. They are wonderful. The Lord of the Rings, however, is much darker than The Hobbit. In The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins found a powerful ring. Now, his nephew Frodo is on a mission to destroy it, before it can be used to overpower all that is good in Middle-Earth. The characters are complex and believable, the land itself is the most detailed fantasy world ever created; it has a very vivid history.

It provides a stage where creatures of all kinds and, contrary to less-informed reviewers, both sexes triumph over seemingly insurmountable pride and arrogance. It capitalizes on our inner belief that who we are is far more important than how we appear and gives physical forms to our best aspirations.If I were an Egyptian Pharaoh and able to take only one work of fiction with me on my next journey, The Lord of the Rings would be it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"My aunt read The Hobbit to me when I was a child, and as soon as I could manage The Lord of the Rings, I did.

The characters are mostly good, but sometimes they do things totally without reason. It's a little bit plain, and would have been better if there were at least one person who wasn't white, black or absolutely gray (yes, that's possible). My main complaint however is that there are no women! They simply don't exist in the book, one of the biggest signs of tFotR's writing-date.

They truly evolve as the books go on, none are left untouched by what they encounter. There are huge battles, character conflicts, monsters, demons, and excitement galore. Yet, what keeps the Lord of the Rings unique is that he believes in the individual. All those battles and glorious deeds, while exciting, are ultimately unimportant.

I had the impression that he's a much-beloved character (at least in some circles)---but good grief, he makes even the elves seem hardly sappy at all by comparison! That whole section of the book was completely ridiculous---no wonder they left it out of the movie versions.One aspect of the book that the movie didn't fully capture, though, was Tolkein's portrayal of power-lust, especially through the characters of Saruman and Boromir. The ring represents a somewhat different temptation for the halflings (particularly Smeagol and Bilbo), a sort of unhealthy obsession with material objects, similar to that represented by Voldemort's horcruxes in Harry Potter (which also symbolize power-lust and a neurotic fear of death). The discussions between Gandalf and Saruman, and Frodo and Boromir, which were much better in the book and the movies should have used more of that dialogue or at least stayed truer to its spirit. They really helped bring out some of the basic themes of the novels more explicitly, but in the movie they were really watered down and generic by comparison, which really weakened the impact not only of those particular scenes, but of the movies overall.I've also heard it complained that the movies tried to force non-existent and vaguely hinted at romances to the fore, but I actually thought strengthening some of the romantic storylines was one of the better changes made by the adapters. It helped emphasize the values at stake, and in some cases actually tightened the plot and cut out unnecessary characters. For example, it was much better to have Arwen meet Aragorn and the hobbits on their way to Rivendell instead of some other random elf who played no further role in the story, rather than just having her be present at the feast given for Frodo after his recovery and then occasionally dropping subtle hints that Aragorn is in love with her. Tolkein basically just told us that there was a romance between them---the movie dramatizes it. Sam's interest in Rosie the barmaid also gives him a stronger reason to want to return to the Shire other than just that he longs for a peaceful, quiet life of gardening, and thereby raises the stakes for his character. I know the peaceful quiet life of gardening was really the whole point for Tolkein, but let's face it, he was a bit fruity on the subject (as witness the whole Tom Bombadil fiasco).As to this audio edition, Rob Inglis's narration is quite good---I enjoyed listening to his characterizations and performances of the songs and so forth. Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I found the book to be rather tedious.

Since I read it long after seeing the movies I was not prepared for what I read, there are so many small parts that either were left out or changed slightly that its like reading a story you don't know entirely. I have to say that I love the movies and if not for them I would never have wanted to read the books.

In the beginning it was a little slow, it was also hard because it was in old language. I liked this book because it had surprises, adventures and danger. This is the first book of The Lord of The Ring series, the second book is called The Two Tower and the third book is called The Return of the King.Frodo, nephew and heir of Bilbo Baggins inherits the ring after Bilbo's elventy -first birthday. When the old wizard Gandalf the Grey finds out that the ring was made by Sauron, the dark lord, and it is the ruling ring Frodo begins a dangerous guest to destroy the ring. Along with his fellow hobbits Sam, Merry, and Pippin, Frodo journeys towards the House of Elrond where they hope to meet Gandalf. While they're on the road they find it isn't going to be very easy since Sauron already is looking for the ring. Dressed all in black and riding black horse the Black Riders are drawn to the ring - to Frodo making traveling on the road hard. They decide to travel through The Old Forest and they meet tom Bombadil who gets them safely out of the forest. They then set off for an inn called The Prancing Pony where they meet a mysterious man who is a ranger. His name is Aragon but is called strider leads them to Elrond though Frodo has an encounter with the Black Riders and now has a deep gash on his shoulder. Glorfindel, an elf, saves Frodo when Black riders chase him. He then wakes to find himself in Elrond. There he sees Bilbo and Gandalf and some dwarves that journeyed with Bilbo when he went on a journey. While at Elrond the council of Elrond decides Frodo is to be the bearer of the ring and shall bring it to Mount Doom to destroy it. They begin The Fellowship of The Ring. That includes one dwarf, Gimili, one elf, Legolas, two men, Boromir and Strider, one wizard, Gandalf, and three hobbits Merry, Pippin, and Sam. After many obstacles they head to Moria, the old under ground dwarf kingdom. When they escape Moria their numbers are one less as they lose Gandalf. With Strider leading the make their way to Lothlorien, an elf territory. The company rest and they meet the Lord and the Lady thin king and Queen of the elves. Sam and Frodo have a chance to look through the Mirror of Galadriel. They see horrible things but they decide to go on. When they leave after many farewell gifts they travel down the great Anduin River. The time has come for Frodo to choose which way to go. Boromir has started to go mad because of the effect of the ring. So without telling anyone Frodo leaves by himself down the river but Sam who is devoted to him catches him. Frodo lets Sam come with him and they head towards Mount Doom to destroy the ring.I recommend this book to anyone who's a good reader because it's a challenging. I suggest that you read The Hobbit first because you'll understand this book better. If you like to read book with adventures and hardship and danger you'll like this book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Long ago in a distant land, there were nineteen magic rings forged for the Elven-kings, Dwarf-lords, and mortal men. The rings were magical and had bound in them the strength and will to rule. They were all deceived because the giver of this great knowledge was Sauron. Sauron then forged a powerful ring to rule all. Sauron takes advantage of this new knowledge by conquering Middle Earth. But not all resisted to Sauron. There were men who fought against Sauron to destroy his powerful and ominous empire. There was a great battle in Middle Earth. The battle was fought for the freedom of the men and other creatures for Middle Earth. During the battle, Isildur, heir of the throne of Gondor cut the Sauron's powerful ring from his hand. Isildur then tries to use the ominous power of the ring to perform the acts of good. One day Isildur was heading toward Minis Tirith, his home city, when an orc killed him. The ring left him. The ring was then lost, until a hobbit named Bilbo found the one ring of power.... If you want to find out the rest of the story, read the book!I loved the book for its exquisite details and amazing plot! This book will awe readers' imaginations. It gives readers a sense of hope as Frodo pursues to destroy the ring of power.

It is time for the big party of Bilbo's and Frodo's birthday parties. When Gandalf realizes that the ring that bilbo has is actually the ring of power that the evil lord is seeking. This time is when Frodo goes off on an adventure to destroy the ring of power before it falls in the hands of the enemy. An ingaging and spellbinding beginning to a trilogy of books. Almost everyone will be brought to a new world in which we have never been before(except in Tolkien's writing).

It gives him long life and youth, but it also eats away at his mind. When Bilbo leaves the Ring to his nephew he also gives him a quest that takes him across Middle Earth, meeting strange folk and fighting fierce battles, where Frodo witnesses true loyalty.This is a red-letter book with a plot that runs as thick as it's spine. I would also recommend The Two Towers, and The Return of the King. The author, J.R.R. Tolkien, with descriptions of breathtaking battles and characters that rise up out of the pages, conveys the message of the book very well. I believe that the message is: sometimes the smallest people do the greatest things."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Two years ago, at the age of eleven, I came across a book known as The Hobbit. A simple book as it was, it became the stepping stone to probably one of the greatest writings of all time. The Hobbit was my favorite book, and two years later, the memory of Middle-earth and all its splendor came to me, again. I decided to pick up The Lord of the Rings, a story much more in depth than The Hobbit, much more dark and mysterious than a simple journey to the East to retrieve a dragon's loot. It tells of an Evil coming over the magical land of Middle-earth, and a simple hobbit's quest to destory the One Ring that could save them all. It is but a simple, unadorned ring, just as this story is a short, simple story, and yet underneath the surface, it is much more than what it seems to be.When you read The Lord of the Rings, you are drawn into the mystical land that J.R.R. Tolkien, a genius way ahead of his time, drew from the imagination of all those who dare to imagine. You will find yourself reading on, flipping the page and wondering what you are about to stumble upon next. It was not at all a rare sight when I would be reading late into the night, with my mother begging me to go to bed, while I would be saying, &quot;One more page, okay?&quot; You will not be able to stop!Tolkien's work is sheer poetry; not &quot;boring&quot; at all. I find myself reading hundreds of pages in only a short amount of time, as anyone who has half of a brain will. So, don't be discouraged by those who say that he is monotonous or that the writing is slow-moving. I don't think so at all. There is much mystery and intrigue in the story; you will end up wondering whether Middle-earth exists or not, for he comes up with such a deep and rich history and so many tales of woe and tragedy, and of valor and hope. This is a must-read!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"One word can describe the writing of Tolkien: excellence. Tolkien has mastered the arts of story telling, language, and writing. Nothing can be said about this book that is not of a positive nature. Tolkien has written a believable story that gives his readers an adventure too incredible for the common man. In some ways, Tolkien gives readers something for which to strive. His characters put themselves at risk to protect the freedom of the land. The characters of the book are what we all desire to be, heroes. These characters serve a higher purpose than self. People long to be heroes and guardians of justice. This book gives readers a sense of satisfaction that can only be felt in the imagination.The Fellowship of the Ring and the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of the greatest fictional tales ever told. I plan to read all of the books J. R. R. Tolkien. I would recommend a Tolkien book to anybody who is creative and open minded. I would also recommend reading The Hobbit, prelude to the Lord of the Rings, and then moving into the trilogy. These books offer so much to the open-minded reader. Satisfaction, adventure, and an all around incredible story are just a few things Tolkien has given to so many readers."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Words cannot describe how much I enjoyed reading the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy! It's one of those classics where you can just keep on reading on and on and you don't want to finish. Yes, this book just captivated me with the adventure, suspense, excitement, and humor.&quot;The Fellowship of the Rings&quot; is the first book of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. Hobbit Frodo Baggins, the nephew of the famous Bilbo Baggins (read J.R.R. Tolkiens prelude to the trilogy, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;) is visited by the wizard Gandalf. When Bilbo had left years ago he had left his magical and mystical Ring which he had taken from Gollum in his earlier adventures to Frodo. From Gandalf Frodo learns that this Ring is actually the Ring of Power from the Elven lore:One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind themLost for centures, if this ring should fall back into the hands of the evil Sauron, he would be enabled to destory everything which is good in Middle-earth, bringing the land into darkness. Frodo and his hobbit friends Sam, Pippin, and Merry travel to the Rivendell to seek counsel from the Elf Elrond on what to do with the ring. There he finds out that he must destroy the Ring and to do that, must cast it into Mount Doom, located at the very center of Sauron's dark kingdom. Thus the Fellowship is created to help Frodo in his journey. The Fellowship consists of Frodo, Gandalf, Sam, Pippin, Merry, Aragorn the Ranger who is not what he seems, Legolas of the Elves of Mirkwood, Boromir a man of Gondor, and Gimli the dwarf from the Lonely Mountains. Together the nine set out for Mount Doom. But the way is treacherous and the dark, evil Ringwraiths are searching for them.But the story doesn't end here. If you have never read the books and you want to try it out, I suggest that you get all three books, not just the first one because this. If you like it, I assure you that you will be in agony at the end to find out what happens. The books are very addictive and it's very hard to stop at just &quot;The Fellowship of the Rings&quot;. Have &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and &quot;The Return of the King&quot; on hand.My favorite character has got to be the Elf, Legolas. Elves have always fascinated me, for their mysterious, quiet, and almost immortal ways. I love it also how Legolas and Gimli the Dwarf in this book are sort of unfriendly towards each other since Elves and Dwarves usually do not get along. But towards the end of this book and the rest of the trilogy, they're the greatest of friends and inseparable.Another good character is Pippin the hobbit with his bright and cheerful ways. One of the youngest of the group of hobbits, he is always in a positive mood but somehow manages to get in trouble often.All of the books in the trilogy are must reads. Also the prelude to the trilogy, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, should also be read to understand the events which had happened before the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. Though it is written mostly for adults, I'm sure teenagers wil also love it, though younger kids might not be able to understand it. Enjoy, this book will have you fascinated and keep you in total suspense!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I know that I'm in quite a minority, but on re-reading &quot;The Fellowship...&quot; in anticipation for the film, I'm finding it quite dull. (And I'm someone who loved &quot;War and Peace.&quot;) Don't get me wrong: the story of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is fantastic, and Tolkien has my undying admiration for the magical world he has created. But his writing is not -- to me -- particularly interesting. There are far too many topographical passages, along the lines of &quot;Their way wound along the floor of the hollow, and round the green feet of a steep hill into another deeper and broader valley, and then over the shoulder of further hills, and down their long limbs, and up their smooth sides again, up on to new hill-tops and down into new valleys.&quot; And then there are the historical passages: &quot;Under [the mountains] lies Khazad-dum, the Dwarrowdelf, that is now called the Black Pit...Yonder stands Barazinbar, the Redhorn, cruel Caradhras; and beyond him are Silvertine and Cloudyhead: Celebdil the White, and Fanuidhol the Grey, that we call Zirakzigil and Bundudshathur...between their arms lies the deep-shadowed valley which we cannot forget: Azanulbizar, the Dimril Dale, which the Elves call Nanduhirion.&quot; And on and on and on. Sorry, folks, but I can't get into it. If that makes me a philistine, so be it. If the above sounds good to you, by all means, get this and the other Tolkien books and join the millions of fans around the world who love them."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Another review on Tolkien's work. Do we need it? Probably not. However, I would like to say that, if you are new to Tolkien's work and are thinking about reading The Lord of the Rings because of the impending movie then I can say that The Fellowship of the Ring is the easiest of the three books to read that make up the trilogy. The film that is to be released in December is this part of the story, with the other 2 films (The Two Towers and The Return of the King) to be made next year and the year after. The Fellowship of the Ring is such a good book to read. It is full of innocence, magic, terror and wonder. Tolkien conjurs this world of loveable Hobbits and ultimate, brooding evil. In this, the first book, you get a real insight into hobbit life and the beginnings of the adventures that Frodo makes to destroy the one ring. The other two books are great, of course, but the story gets more political and I feel they demand much more from the reader, especially The Return of the King. If you want to dabble in a bit of fantasy literature, then you can do no better than this book. I know people go on and on about The Lord of the Rings but there is a reason for that and I feel a newcomer with an open mind to this genre will be even more rewarded when reading these stories than a hardened fantasy buff. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"It is quite difficult to review a book which is generally acknowledged as a masterpiece; there is the danger of merely repeating the praises heaped on the book by earlier reviewers, and there is also the difficulty of doing justice to the book's greatness. Fortunately, the release of Peter Jackson's excellent film adaptation of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" gives me a fresh perspective from which to review J.R.R. Tolkien's novel.If you enjoyed the movie, you should read the book, which you will almost certainly also enjoy, even if in a different way. One of the glories of Jackson's film is its great richness and depth, the feeling it gives the viewer of stepping into an unfamiliar but real world with a long history. The reason Jackson's film is able to produce this effect is that the world in which it takes place had already been created, and imagined in almost unbelievable detail, by J.R.R. Tolkien. Far more even than the movie, Tolkien's book lets the reader share the hobbits' experience of wandering out of their doors into a world with a detailed and believable history, a multitude of different mortal and immortal races with distinct cultures and languages, and a well-defined geography (maps are included in the book). I must place special emphasis on the linguistic depth of Tolkien's world: Tolkien, a distinguished philologist, invented around fifteen languages for the inhabitants of his imaginary world to speak. (The \\"Star Trek\\" Universe, by contrast, contains only one language, Klingon, which has been devised in any detail.)Moreover, as with any cinematic adaptation of a work of literature, Jackson's movie leaves out characters, events and scenes from the book. These elements are waiting in Tolkien's text for fans of the movie to discover them. In particular, the chapters involving a character named Tom Bombadil are among the best parts of the book, although they had to be left out of the movie to keep it down to a reasonable length.Anyone who has not yet seen the movie should certainly read the book first; it's best if you imagine the characters and events of the book yourself and then compare your visions to the movie version.Like the movie, Tolkien's book is often astonishingly relevant to our post-September 11 world. The film's exchange between Frodo and Gandalf in which Frodo wishes the Shadow of evil had not arisen in his time comes directly from the book, which also contains a few other moments that resonate strongly with the current world situation. Tolkien was writing \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" during World War II, but he did not intend it as an allegory of that war or of any other specific situation; rather, he hoped that readers would feel free to find his work applicable to any scenario they might see reflected in it.\\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" is, in fact, not a novel, but the first volume of the three-part novel \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" Anyone who reads the book and sees the movie of \\"Fellowship\\" will surely want to read the two subsequent volumes, \\"The Two Towers\\" and \\"The Return of the King,\\" to find out what happens to the characters without having to wait for the release of the two subsequent movies at Christmas in 2002 and 2003."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I'd been a fantasy binge as of late and decided to pick up the first installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy since the movie is due out soon. Why did I wait so long to read this? Actually I can remember starting this book at an earlier time but I got bogged down in the detail. This time through the detail didn't stop me and I screamed through it. Tolkien has woven together a very intricate adventure with characters that are both likable and believable(in the sense that they have flaws as well as attributes) in land that you can easily visualize. When I was finished I ran out right away and purchased the second installment and hope to start it shortly. I would recommend this book to anyone....even if you aren't a fantasy fan, because you soon will be. The only reason I didn't give the book five stars is the fact that there were a few sections where the action seemed to slow down, but theses sectoins were short and easy to read through."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"After reading this book, I was surprised to see that so many of the reviews here were written by young people. Naturally fantasy tends to be very popular with young adults (it was with me), but Tolkien's work seems to transcend demographics. This is not a book for escapists nor for those who prefer a reality that is in opposition to our own. This is a book for those who desire to understand reality and look for magic in the process of discovery. Tolkien uses human traits and physical realities to create a world of complicated and mysterious morality - a world where a wizard Gandalf the Grey is somehow more pure than his colleague, Saruman the White.People are rarely what they appear to be and neither are hobbits. Frodo Baggins, the protagonist hobbit, is the ring bearer. He like many human heros in other books carries an unasked and heavy burden. He does not carry it with a saint's gracious self-immolation, but rather with a determination to do what he thinks is right for himself and those who depend on him. Like anyone in a situation like this, he desires to cast his burden off, but gathers the courage to continue. The admirable thing about Tolkien is that Frodo does not make these decisions based on some blind fervor for an unattainable ideal, but rather through a series of inductive steps. In this way Frodo transforms the ideal of saintliness into syllogism.Frodo would prefer to kick back with a pint of ale beneath a tree, but he doesn't. Through logic and reason, he determines that unless he begins his perilous journey and defeats the great evil spreading across the land, neither he nor anyone else will ever be able to see simple joy again.It is a story about magic of course, but the magic serves as an ideal that the realists strive to protect, not worship. They are rooted in reality, as is this tale. All fantasy writers since Tolkien owe a great deal to the style and imagination of this writer, but the greatest gift he gave them was the gift of realist fantasy. Rest assured that Tolkien is not simply the progenitor of a generation of better writers. He is a master among masters."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I guess a little over two years ago I saw the Fellowship movie, and I was blown away and went out the next day to buy the boxed set...I mean, if the movie was that good, the book must be ten times better right? WRONG! The Hobbit was pretty decent; I finished that in a few days. Then I started Fellowship. After 150 pages I couldn't take it anymore! I put it back in the box and forgot about it. I made a second attempt a year later, but only made it to page 50. I am now on my third attempt and I am GOING to finish it this time because it's driving me MAD.Now, it's not that it's not a good story. I respect Tolkien for his imagination and creativity. You can tell that he put his whole soul into this book and you can't bash someone's soul (reason for the 3 stars...), but clearly, not everybody's souls match up, so to speak. Personally, I like to feel a certain degree of empathy for characters in a story. I don't care how many leaves the 52nd tree to the north has, but I would like care about the characters. This book leaves you identifying more with topography and three page long descriptions of sunsets and such than with the characters. And I don't understand what the deal with the songs are. I hope they aren't that important because I just skip them. Derry dol, Merry dol, who cares? Jeez.Obviously, there are people who like this book, and if you're the type of person who likes to be given vast descriptions of things for the neurons in your brain to construct, then you should get this. Maybe you will even feel something for the characters. Everyone's different, otherwise this book would be as beloved as it is. If you would rather read something that moves you and stirs empathy, then go for something else.I haven't said anything new, but I need to suggestion this: I made assumptions and wasted $30 on a boxed set that I will probably never finish. PLEASE don't buy the boxed set! Just buy the first book to see if you like it, and then if you don't, you won't feel OBLIGED to read them like I do. (I guess I just have OCD or something. LOL I feel like I can't buy any other books til I read these.)"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Frodo Baggins was a simple Hobbit with a normal life, until he was chosen to be the heir of Bilbo, a Hobbit with a long history, and inherits an evil ring that will send him on a quest that was started long ago. On his quest he faces many dangers and meets many friends that accompany him, including an old wizard named Gandalf who seems to have started the whole quest; Sam and Merry, two Hobbits with very little taste for adventure; Strider, a Ranger with an Elven lineage, and many more people whom he befriends. During the entire journey he travels out of the boundaries of his home, the Shire, and ends up in cursed forests, abondoned Orc camps, great Dwarven and Elven cities, and a dark kingdom where he must destroy the ring which could give the dark prince the power to bring all the other rings of power together and rule Middle-Earth, destroying all good with in it.This book is for only the most serious fantasy and adventure fans because you must understand a lot about fantasies, Dwarves, Elves, Hobbits, and Wizards. This book is the first in a three-part story that will leave you wanting to know what the author has in store for our heroes."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The first three times I tried to read the Fellowship of the Ring, I couldn't do it. It was too slow, and I hadn't really read too much of anything in the fantasy realm. However, now that my interest in fantasy stuff has gone up, I gave the book another try, which was a great thing to do.Ok, so the story is still slow at the beginning when Tolkien has the obligatory \\"Introduce the characters for 150 pages\\". Sure, that's boring after awhile, but it is needed. All the boring character development lets you read about the character...developing.After you get past all of that, the good stuff starts. The epic jounrey to destroy the One Ring begins as you read about the Company's travels to Bree and eventually to Mordor. The book does a great job with giving all sorts of in-depth detail about the setting where you can actually imagine what everything looks like. Truthfully, it helps if you've seen the movie just so you can get a really good visual picture of what everything looks like, which did actually help me when I was reading.There are also battles! Who doesn't like some mindless killing with orcs or Balrogs in the middle of a book? It's great. Plus, the end of the book leaves you at a sort of a climax for the second one to start. It makes you ask yourself, \\"What happens to Frodo and Sam?\\" and \\"They can't kill Gandalf...can they?!\\" Stuff like that.I recommend this book for any fledglings in the fantasy genre as it seems to be a must have. And for that matter, I suggest the other two books in the trilogy, The Two Towers and The Return of the King as well."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I have heard many people critisize the works of J.R.R. Tolkien after reading only one if not even finishing one book. This particular book is more often than not the choice that most of these people choose to voice their uneducated opinions on. By uneducated, I do not intend it to mean stupid or flawed, only that they don't understand HOW to read a Tolkien book. It is important to know that to understand J.R.R. Tolkiens work, such as the Lord of the Rings series, you have to read ALL of them. In reality, The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King, are all one book, not three seperate books. One probably won't get the depth they expected from the Fellowship because it's only 1/3 of a book. This application for almost all of Tolkien's works. There will be a lot of things that you won't understand when you first read The Lord of the Rings, especially if it is your first time, but that is the true genius of Tolkien. All of his books tie in to become a realistic history, so to understand that history and what causes it, you have to read another one of his books. Just try it, if you aren't impressed by the Fellowship, go ahead and finish the series. Only then is it fair to make a judgement of Tolkien's literature."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, is certainly a work of art.

By not defining every excruciating detail in his book, I was able to create a world in my mind that could never be described with words.The Lord of the Rings is set in almost a medieval period, with a magical twist to it, where everything is possible. It all begins with a jolly hobbit named Frodo Baggins. Shielded from anything outside the Shire (his home), everything he knew was beautiful.

TolkienReviewed by Enaud Ekralc9/20/02This summer I read the best book ever. It's called The Lord of the Rings, by Jr.r. Tolkien. The story begins in the shire, which is where Hobbits live. A Hobbit is a little creature that looks like us and has hairy feet. Frodo is very nice and worry free, until the ring falls into his hands. A Hobbit called Frodo receives a ring that has great power; the evil lord made it himself. Frodo must take a journey to destroy the ring. Only there is one problem, the only place the ring can be destroyed is Mt. Doom. Mt. Doom is Sauron's fortress. Frodo must go through a lot of frightful tasks.There are a lot of characters in the novel. Here are my favorites; first you have Strider who is a mysterious fighter who can beat any demon, then there is Gandolf, a wizard who is loved by everyone for his firework displays. I like Strider because he is really strong and he tricks the evil demons. Gandolf has great power that helps a lot of people. I like Gandolf because he makes people laugh and smile. Both Gandolf and Strider help Frodo through this task. They both play an important roll in The Lord of the Rings.I really enjoyed The Lord of the Rings. It has a lot of adventure that kept me reading. Anyone who likes adventure and fantasy books would love The Lord of the Rings. Tolkien made up a lot of characters that are mean, nice, ugly etc. I would recommend this book to all of my friends and my family. I think that everybody should read The Lord of the Rings. I really liked The Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I enjoyed \\"Fellowship of the Rings,\\" a lot. \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" is such a great trilogy and I can't wait to read all the other books! J.R.R Tolkien gives such great descriptions and details in his books, and makes you think that you're in the book yourself, going through the adventure! J.R.R. had such good ideas in his writing; you're in the place called \\"Middle earth,\\" with hobbits, and wizards, orcs, and elves, ringwraiths, rangers, and a single ring to bring darkness to all that is good, a hobbit named Frodo is stuck with the ring. J.R.R. Tolkien is a genius, I want to read all of his books!!!!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is J.R.R Tolkein's magnificent start of an epic fantasy trilogy that continues in The Two Towers and climaxes in book three, Return of the King. In my opinion, it is the greatest fantasy epic of our time. The Fellowship of the Ring is the story of Frodo Baggins, who becomes the unwilling heir to the One Ring forged by Sauron the Dark Lord in the dark and foreboding land of Mordor. The Ring had come to be in the possession of his uncle, Bilbo Baggins, who kept the Ring hidden in the Shire for sixty years, ever since discovering it while lost deep under the Misty Mountains. The book goes into much more in-depth detail than the movie does. In the book, when Gandalf the wizard discovers the nature and origin of the Ring, he speaks to Frodo things concerning the shadow of the past, tracing the history of the Ring from its making to the present, unlike the film, due to time constraints. Frodo then realizes that he must flee his homeland the Shire, and journey to Rivendell, home of the Elves, as Gandalf suggested. After narrowly surviving perils of his journey, Frodo arrives in Rivendell, where the Council of Elrond is held. There it is decided that since the Ring is the work of Sauron the Dark Lord of Mordor, it must be destroyed in order to save Middle-earth from total annihilation, for annihilation is what would occur if Sauron ever reclaimed this One Ring of Power. Frodo embarks on a perlious Quest, his destination being the Cracks of Doom in the very center of the Sauron's dark realm. He is accompanied by Gandalf, and an Elf, a Dwarf, two Humans, and three of his Hobbit companions.Brilliantly written, The Fellowship of the Ring is a work of art with a broad scope. It is filled with adventure, drama, and magnificence. 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I first read this book when I was 13 and fell in love with story. I must admit that Tolkien's writing style is bit hard to read at first but once you get into the story, it's hard to put down. Don't expect the book to be exactly like the movie. There are a lot more things in the book that were left out of the movie for time reasons. Tolkien's characters are wonderfully written and the detail of the scenery is spectacular. I would have done with out the songs but they do fit in the story nicely. If you liked the movies then I recommend getting the \\"whole\\" story by reading the books. I mainly liked this book the best because I liked the story of Frodo and he was in the entire book, but not in all of the Two Towers and Return of the King."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I really liked this book. It was very detailed and informitive. I feel as if I am really there. You can almost picture all the trees and other places in the book. The pages seem to disappear and I become a part of the book. I like the book for all of its unquie uses of names of places and characters. The book took you somewhere and it was hard to go back. It was the best book I have ever read. I would suggest his book to any fantasy fan out there."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The reading by Rob Inglis is of the first order. He has just the right type of British voice to bring the Tolkien books to life. I don't want to rehash the many other favourable reviews. This review is relevant for anyone who wants to make mp3's out of the CD's. Since the boxes are so large, and the cd's so numerous (I bought all three volumes) it is a logical step to rip the cd's and put them on your ipod or other mp3 player. This is where the glitches arise. Although the Ipod cd database found the tracks, the naming of the cd volumes and the individual tracks is inconsistent and confusing so you can't logically navigate through the discs. Each cd seems to have its own naming convention in some sort of secret geek code understood only by the inventor. I eventually solved the problem by making each disc into a playlist on its own so I could go back to the relevant disc and track number at will. This seems a very odd technical oversight in this day and age, unless it was done deliberately to prevent illegal file sharing on the internet. This fortunately does not detract from the otherwise excellent quality of the product."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Can you imagine being a bearer for a ring that is pure gold? It sounds easy but it is not because the ring has dark powers from an evil ruler. The ring can turn you invisible if you put it on but it is not good because it has a mind of its own. It can turn you evil. There is a hobbit named Frodo who has to be the ring bearer for that dark and evil ring Frodo also has to destroy this evil ring by taking it to a place of great danger called Mount Doom. Frodo's quest will be long and adventurous. But right now he does have some companions and they are Sam, Merry, Pippin, and Gandalf.The Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring is a really great book. It is very suspenseful and as I was reading it I could hardly wait to find out what happened next. I really like the way that Tolkien describes the forest -- it made me feel like I was actually in that setting. The characters in the book are really cool like the Hobbits, Black Riders and the wizard. One thing I did not like was how long the book was but this particular long book made me use my imagination. Another scene I could really imagine in my head was when Frodo, Sam, Pippin, and Merry were in a barrow and it was really dark, misty and cold. The reason that they were all in the barrow was because they were attacked by barrow-wights."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"When Bilbo Baggins of the shire has a birthday party Gandalf,the wizard,notices something different.

Simply summed up then Fellowship of the Ring is the continuation of THE HOBBIT OR THERE AND BACK AGAIN, which recounts the (mis)adventures of a hobbit, Mr. Bilbo Baggins and a ring. FELLOWSHIP, focuses on Bilbo's heir Frodo Baggins who when Bilbo in his aged state decides to leave his home in Middle-Earths shire, home to hobbits, leaves everything to Frodo. The mysterious yet kind wizard Gandolf drops hints to Frodo that the magic ring is not some parlour trinket, but of a dark design once owned by the evil Sauron, who seeks to claim &quot;the one true ring to rule them all again.&quot; Hence Frodo and his friends begin their journey to destroy the Ring before the forces of evil can destroy them.Might be hyperbole, but this is debatably the greatest fantasy epic ever written. The measuring stick against which all fantastic tales written since has been measured. Tolkien's gift of language and descriptive detail is second to none, possibly he was a magician in England conjuring stories in reaction to his keen distaste for what he saw the Industrial revolution doing. Read in that context adds an additional layer to a tale into which depths more than one hobbit, elf, dwarf and yes human has fallen."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I realize that I will be ridiculed for giving this book such a low rating. However, it took me almost 2 years to finish it. Not having been a Tolkein aficionado, it was difficult at times to realize who was who in the narrative. After seeing the film by Peter Jackson, I was able to visualize, with greater ease, the cast of characters. Overall the book is very good, filled with everything you would expect from a fantasy novel, because in essence Tolkein created the Fantasy novel.

It starts out in the possession of Bilbo Baggins of Bag End in the Shire. At his eleventy first birthday he leaves on journey, giving the ring to his nephew and heir, Frodo. Gandalf the Grey, a wizard, soon learns of the true identity of this ring and tells Frodo to hide it in Bag End. After learning that the ring is indeed the One Ring, Gandalf returns to the shire to warn Frodo. It is then decided that the ring must go to Rivendell and the last homely home in the west. With the help of Samwise Gamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck, and Peregrin Took, Frodo manages to get Bree. It is here where the group meets Aragorn, one of the Rangers from the north, and one of the last of the race of Numenor.(sp?) Aragorn says he will guide them to rivendell. At camp at Weathertop, the Nazgul attack the party, and the Witch King of Angmar pierces Frodo with his blade. The group flees from the place and make haste towards rivendell where Elrond Halfelven might use his healing ablilities to cure Frodo's wound. After several days of travel, an elven rider comes to the aid of the party and takes Frodo with speed towards rivendell. At length, a host of all the peoples of middle earth is brought to rivendell to decide on the fate of the One Ring; it must not stay in rivendell. A fellowship of nine vows to take the ring to Mordor and the fires of Mount Doom, the place it was made and the only place where it can be unmade. The group sets out from rivendell and heads towards mordor. After being defeated at the pass of Cara...(i don't remember) the fellowship decides to brave the mines of moria. All turns ill when they discover the ancient dwarve city was over run by goblins and cave trolls. Escaping from the battle over the bridge of Khazad-dum, Gandalf is struck down by a Balrog; the rest of the fellowship continues on without him. in the forest of Lothlorien, Frodo sees a glimpse of his future shown to him by Lady Galadriel. After a stay in the forest, the Elves see the fellowship off with gifts such as cloaks, rope, food, hair(for gimli) and a vial containing the light of Galadriel(something to do with the silmarils, can't really remember) down the river, the group encounters a Nazgul on a flying creature that Legolas shoots down. At the very end of the book, Boromir is overcome with greed for the ring and chases Frodo off, when he decides to leave the fellowship for his own safety.

At the start of it, there are some quite boring parts, including Tomm Bombadil and the Barrow Downs.

I do find reading the trilogy through adult eyes to be a very different experience than that which I had as a child. One focuses more upon the historical detail of the epic, like a connoisseur savoring the undertones of a rare vintage, rather than letting the adventure of consumption dictate the pace of the novel. Minutia surrounding the days of Numenor is appreciated more, as are references to the events of earlier days, such as the fate of the kings of Arnor. Personages like Elrond and Galadriel loom more powerfully due to their connection to the Eldar Days.The experience is also changed now due to the ever-present figure of Peter Jackson lurking just behind the text. At first, I found myself confounded by images of Elijah Wood as Frodo (despite the obvious age mismatch), Ian McKellan as Gandalf, and other character associations from Jackson's epic. As the story unfolded, however, I found Tolkien's characters emerge from out of the shadow of their silver screen brethren. (Indeed, it was partly to emancipate my imagination from the tyranny of the screen that I chose to re-read FOTR at this time.)Ultimately, the story springs forth just as magically as it did when I first encountered it at the age of twelve, with important differences. Above all else, I feel the great sadness of characters like Galadriel, who realize that their time in Middle Earth is finally drawing to a close no matter what the outcome of the quest. An unfulfilled longing lies beneath the text which surprised me as something I had not felt so keenly before.The word reserved for such books is overused, but nonetheless appropos:Masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The fellowship of the ring is the first instalment in J.R.R.

On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron. It inevitably corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him, that will take him across Middle-Earth to the evil land of Mordor.Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (although they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were when the book was first penned.Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as \\"The Hobbit\\": it's lighter and more cheerful, since it opens in the Shire. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't elaborate on the such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers.Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions.

Now older, Bilbo is ready to leave his beloved home in the Shire, passing most of his possessions (including the Magic Ring he aquired in The Hobbit) to his nephew Frodo.

In fact had it not been for this very version of the story I might never have been able to read the trilogy in its unabridged form. The Library of Congress version, better known to some of you as the Talking Book version recorded mainly for blind would-be readers, just didn't capture the story at all. Because of the narrator's voice I just couldn't get into it.Then along came Recorded Books Incorporated with their unabridged recordings. In fact when I have a choice of audio book companies I generally go with them because of their excellent narrators. British stage actor Rob Inglis does a fine job of bringing these classic novels to life, and Fellowship of the Ring is no exception.The book comes in a very portable box and consists of about sixteen disks in four cardboard holders, although only the actual novel and the afterward that Tolkien wrote are featured here. The Concerning Hobbits material found at the beginning of the book is absent, but it can fortunately be found on one of the final two disks of Return of the King. It's actually quite a nice setup. In fact I've got the entire trilogy, now including the Hobbit, stacked on my dresser beside my bed, next to a small boom box for easy listening.As for the performance, as I said, Rob Inglis does a very admirable job. With his deep, calm English voice he's able to convey the narrative quite well, and while his voices aren't extremely varied it's still easy to tell who's speaking, whether it be Aragorn, Boromir or one of the hobbits. I particularly like the fawning yet sinister portrayal he gives to Gollum.All in all this is an excellent version, not the least because it includes the entire novel unlike other performances I've heard. An excellent narrator only makes things better. It's great for lying at home reading or taking a long trip in the car.

But when the hobbits reach Bree Tolkien's writing becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. And the plot darkens as well -- Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul and begins to slowly \\"fade\\" into one of them, as well as the increasingly harrowing journey through the Dwarf mines and into an orc-infested forest, where one of Frodo's friends turns against him.Tolkien wraps this seemingly simple plot in great swathes of atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the snuffling undead Black Riders, the shining beauty and immortal sadness of the Elves, the decay of the vast underground kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn and the elf queen Galadriel. And in some matters -- such as the demonic Balrog -- Tolkien paints an outline with his words and allows the reader's imagination to colour it.Even more impressive is his ability to craft a true epic Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles -- and by showing the slow spread of Sauron's influence throughout Middle Earth.Frodo himself is the quintessential \\"little guy\\" hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when Gandalf reveals what he has to do. He has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him on his quest to destroy Sauron. He's simply an ordinary person, and therein lies his charm and his strength.We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of \\"Hobbit\\" -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. And Frodo is surrounded by a well-rounded cast of characters -- the most prominent is his loyal gardener Sam and his charmingly sneaky cousins Merry and Pippin. But the other characters -- ethereal Elves such as the Wood-Elf Legolas, gruff dwarf Gimli and the mysterious king-in-waiting Aragorn -- are also fleshed out nicely, and given their own litle quirks and strengths.Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today. \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is a magnificent start to a deservingly classic trilogy, and it only gets better after this."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"If you are a fan of The Lord of the Rings, this audio recording is must-have for your collection. I love to read and re-read the trilogy; there is something magical about these books. Sometimes I focus on the poems, sometimes the characters, sometimes I just read them because they are familiar and comforting.This unabridged audio recording brings the book to life in a new and wonderful way. The narrator's voice is a perfect match for the story. Rob Inglis gives each character an appropriate voice, and his reading of the narrative is excellent. It's wonderful to listen to the story read aloud by such a fine actor!I've purchased dramatic abridgements of the trilogy, and was disappointed. So much was left out! With an unabridged reading, I can enjoy the whole story. If a poem or passage strikes my fancy, I can listen to it again.I am very pleased with this version, and highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good audio version."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I know people always hear how Tolkien is so great and it is a must read. I am just writing this to say that it is completely true. This book was outstanding.It's the tale of young Frodo Baggins coming across the one ring of power given to him by Bilbo Baggins. Throughout the story there are exciting battle scenes. My favorite of all being the Balrog in the mines of moria.I encourage people of all ages to start reading the LOTR series you won't regret it. Even if you don't read very often this is a good book to start you reading."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"When his uncle disappears, Frodo receives his uncle's magic ring. The ring has the ancient power to make the person who wears it invisible. The only catch is, if worn too long, the wearer will begin to fade, and soon become invisible altogether. The ring can also make it's possessor very powerful when used correctly. Soon it becomes apparent that there is someone who wants the ring for himself, so Frodo and his friends set off to take it to the only place it can be destroyed, the heart of the enemies fortress, The Cracks of Doom.I liked this book a lot because there is a large amount of suspense and really exciting action. The characters are really interesting, have deep backgrounds, and interact with each other very well, to create a great story. J.R.R Tolken uses incredible description to paint a detailed picture in the readers mind. This book could be considered a Harry Potter of its time. I recommend this book to people with patience, and an iterest in fantasy. I suggest that children under 9 do not read this book (they may not have the patience to anyway.)"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I thought tolkeins books were gonna be lame and dumb. whell at least the begining was. i started out reading &quot;THE HOBBIT&quot; the first of tolkeins series. mr. baggins was sitting down at home and then was doing something he never thought he would ever do ever, he went on a journey a few years long. he went through many dangers to lead him to his final task, destroy the evil dragon smog. when he came home he then realized that his house was being sold.after i read that book i got really happy to notice that i had tolkeins next book the lord of the rings. i read it very quickly for it was outstanding. when mr. baggins left the ring for frodo his adventure truly began. my favorite part of the story was when they were stuck in the room of records were the great balin died. when the orcs attacked it was suspensful to know if they would make it out alive. of course all did but gandalf the grey. there were many happy times like when they came to lothlorien and bad times when they found balin dead. these books may be stupid at first but almost all books are and then become more interesting through the end. so buy these books if you dont have them there outstanding!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"It's good book to start your acquaintance with world of fantasy.

It had a lot of the same charecters and some new ones the main charecter was Frodo. They treavled far to destroy the ring Biblo found in the HOBBIT.

The Hobbit had a lot more action in it but the Fellowship of the Ring is explained better. I still liked the Fellowship of the Ring; it is a good book and is worth reading."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I know that I will probably go to hell for saying this, but I do not understand why Tolkien remains so popular.Don't get me wrong, I can not deny the man's intelligence nor the work he put into his stories. However, the fact is, if Tolkien were to publish his &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; series today, it would undoubtedly flop.His plot is cliche. Yes, I know that it is the protype for most fantasy books today, and in his day it may have been original-- but not now. His characters are flat. People rave about Gandalf, Bilbo, Frodo and Strider, but can they compare to the type of characters we demand from modern authors who show us every characteristic quirk, gesture, opinion, thought and history of their personalities-- and at the same time not telling or showing us too much? Tolkien also packs his stories with details that modern authors could not get away with today. You think Robert Jordan or Terry Goodkind could tell a story and describe every tree, fern, hill, rock, road and river and expect their books to still be popular? No. Not anymore.It took me forever to read this book. I found it slow and often boring, but I read it because this was Tolkien-- the master. I believe that many writers feel the way I do, but are afraid to express their feelings for fear of being shunned for blasphemy. I have respect for Tolkien's stories and it is true that he is the father of modern fantasy, but his style is now extinct."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Writing Quality: 6/10.Tolkien is a capable writer, but not a great one. He periodically injects humor into the tale, but it is sometimes inconsistent, and rarely truly witty, as opposed to what someone like T. H. White does in The Once and Future King. There is an intriguing, archaic storytelling quality to his stories, a product of his respected academic work with such early works as Beowulf and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. It's consistent, and immersing. But the real draw of Tolkien's work, in my opinion, has less to do with his prose, and more to do with his storytelling, which is something more difficult to define, but has more to do with ideas and less with artistic craft. His descriptions sometimes feel like they bog the story down, and even his most-quoted and well-loved lines -- \\"Not all who wander are lost\\" and \\"All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us\\" -- are not the creations of a wordsmith, but simple philosophical aphorisms that have been made memorable by a memorable story.Depth of Concept: 8/10.Tolkien himself chafed at the idea that his tales would be picked apart in classrooms, and he very much resisted the idea that they were allegorical. It's just a story, he would say, just enjoy it in whatever way works for you. But Tolkien, as an academic, was also steeped in allegory and myth creation, in studies of hero journeys and tragic flaws. What Tolkien really means is that The Lord of the Rings is not merely allegory, not merely something to dissect and explain. Instead, he also hopes for it to touch something more primitive and inexpressible in the psyche, something that can elicit visceral and emotional responses without having to be deconstructed. It certainly has proven to do that, but as such a rich work of mythopoeia, the multiple interpretive meanings available in the story are also very rich.Rounded Characters: 6/10.This is a tough one to score. On one hand, many of the characters are very flat, undergo very little change, or have very little ambiguity in their personalities. Aragorn, for example, is a pretty one-dimensional hero figure, albeit a cool one. But the depth of his character is perhaps a \\"3.\\" The development of loyalty and friendship in Sam is perhaps a little more rounded. But the reason I scored Tolkien as high as a 6 here, was because of Gollum's developmental process through the novels, which I think was highlighted well in the Peter Jackson movies. If there is an interesting story of redemption in all of Tolkien's work, Gollum is it. For him, I'd rate something around an 8 or 9, balancing out many of the other less-developed characters.Well-Developed World: 10/10.Of course, this is where Tolkien has to score the highest. His world-building isn't as existential or all-encompassing as what you can find in Moby Dick or Midnight's Children, but the great care and thoughtful planning of a whole, mostly original mythology is astonishing. It's too bad that so many fantasy writers connected so strongly with Tolkien's truly great accomplishment, and then tried to mimic him in inferior ways. The difference between what Tolkien did and what his imitators (Terry Brooks, Robert Jordan, etc.) do is that he truly understood what makes a meaningful, ambiguous, expansive world, one that is more than the sum of its parts and that draws meaningful parallels with other mythologies from around the world. Reading Tolkien's works feels like the real deal, a real body of myth and legend handed down from generation to generation. Tolkien's imitators always seem to focus most on cool characters, exotic lands, and fun magic systems, and present a painfully muddled, and even careless understanding of what makes myth and legend stay pertinent over eons. Tolkien drew from his vast knowledge of Germanic mythology and philology in writing his novels; people like Brooks and Jordan appear to have used only Tolkien's novels as their foundation.Page Turner: 7/10.I debated how to score this category, because I've come to realize that as a kid I must have skimmed and skipped much of The Lord of the Rings in order to get to the \\"good stuff,\\" the battles and adventurous portions. When I go back and read now, it's not so much that the prose feels dense, as that much of it seems unnecessary. It's not hard reading . . . it's just that it often seems to take so long for a character to get from one place to another, without what appears to be sufficient justification. I wouldn't want to merely have the \\"good stuff\\" and none of the rest of Tolkien's rambling explorations, because then I might as well just be reading Brooks' The Sword of Shannara or something. But I wonder what a really aggressive but erudite editor might have done to streamline Tolkien's prose and tighten up his story. Ultimately, the book doesn't feel particularly well-paced, but Tolkien accomplishes such a rich and appealing atmosphere that it can be hard to put it down, even when you wish things would move a little quicker.Kept Me Thinking: 7/10.This wasn't like Moby Dick for me, where there were so many fantastic philosophical concepts running about in my head that I almost felt like I was achieving Burke's sublime. Rather, Tolkien created such a powerful other world that I can't help daydreaming about his world even after putting the book down. It's justifiable to question whether the thinking about Tolkien's Middle-earth is of as high quality as the thinking engendered in me after reading Moby Dick, but there is no doubt that The Fellowship of the Ring stayed in my head long after I turned the final page. And perhaps where that rumination can be particularly useful is asking why it stuck in my head, and dissecting the common human connection with myth. Enter Joseph Campbell and The Hero with a Thousand Faces.__________________________________________________Overall Recommendation: 9/10.You could get by without reading The Lord of the Rings, although it seems silly to willfully ignore something that is so present in the modern psyche, and that is the best example of its kind by which you can judge the mediocrity all around us today, both in literature and in film. It is perhaps most interesting when paired with a thoughtful study of myths in general, but it's also important as one of the defining novels in modern British literature. You don't need to love it, but by understanding it you'll be enriched by a better understanding of culture, mythology, religion, and nationality.See my profile web site for an expanded review."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Book Review on Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the RingA Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins found a Ring with magical powers. Each time he put it on, he was able to disappear. Later he found out that the Ring was sending signals to the Ring wraiths, evil beings that were searching for it. Bilbo knew this Ring had to be destroyed, so he sent Frodo and Sam on a journey to Mt. Doom, the center of Mordor which is the birth-place of the Ring.The theme of this book is Fantasy. You will be introduced to many unusual characters such as: hobbits, dwarves, elves, and wizards. They all have unique powers to help Frodo and Sam on their journey across Middle-earth.The main characters are Frodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee, both Hobbits. Frodo is in charge of taking the Ring back to its birth-place. Sam is protecting Frodo on his journey. Gandalf the Grey is a wizard. He is leading Frodo and Sam to Mt. Doom. Legolas, an elf, Gimli, a dwarf, and Aragorn, a human, are creating a safe path for everyone. Sauruman is an evil wizard.

I'm just finishing up The Fellowship of the Ring now, and I must admit, I had to skip some parts out of sheer boredom. I love the storyline and the character development, but some of the detail just seems kind of, well, not desperate, but Tolkien seemed determined to make this the longest book ever. I don't think all the descriptions were absolutely necessary for the story, nor were they really enjoyable either.I love everything in, and not in the movie, especially Tom Bombadil, who brings life and happiness to a very dark story. Over all, it is a very, very well written book, but a warning: There are parts you might have to skip, and don't worry, most of them aren't that important to the story.I'd suggest this to any Lord of the Rings fan, absolutely, and also to anyone who loves a great fantasy novel. It's very intriguing and entertaining, and there are many awesome poems and songs, but just be aware that the prologue makes it seem like it won't be a good book.

However, it's not the Bible, or the new I Ching. It's just a story; but besides creating an entirely complete world of its own that you can all but touch, it speaks volumes about human will, passion, and the motivation to do the right thing despite how uncomfortable it is.

The only thing that I really dislike about Tolkien's world is the elves. They strike me as silly and unmotivated, and even though they have infinite wisdom and strength they send in a bunch of untrained hobbits to do the dirty work of getting rid of the ring.

The characters are fairly one-dimensional, the story is not all that interesting, and nothing happens as a result of the main characters. The fellowship moves along on their quest, but don't seem to do anything.The book's strength lies in the encompassing nature of the world that Tolkien has created. A long history of all the denziens of Middle Earth exists and you get the feeling that Tolkien may be more interested in the past of his world than the current story of Frodo and the Ring. The number of races (elves, hobbits, orcs), their interrelations, and their place is all of interest, but not enough to keep me interested in Frodo's dull quest in which he takes no action.Because the book ends without resolution, I will continue to read the trilogy and hope that Frodo becomes a more active character as he seems to try to become in the last chapter of the book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"As a self-professed nerd I wanted tot love this.

However, his writing style is so verbose that by the time he explains whose talking to whom you can't remeber what's being talked about.

So the whole story is about wizards, hobbits, who are like humans only a little smaller and fatter. Then there are elves and black knights. And naturally the ring plays an important role, because there are also other rings around but only one is able to rule them all and he was created by the dark ruler of the land of Mordor, which tries to conquer the world.

Tolkien's THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is the first volume of The Lord of the Rings, the 20th century's most important epic fantasy and a perennial for all ages. It presents a young hobbit, Frodo Baggins, as he discovers that a family heirloom is actually a magic ring devised and then lost by a Dark Lord, and then sets off to destroy the ring before it can be seized back. Frodo and his company pass through many parts of Tolkien world of Middle-Earth, filled with many races of mythical beings.There are several ways to approach the work, and for myself the most fulfilling has been from a philological perspective. Tolkien was enamoured with languages of all kinds, and over the course of his life he created many, giving special attention and care to two, Quenya and Sindarin. These two constructed languages are loved by many fans of linguistics, and it is precisely in FELLOWSHIP that we have the most important example of mature Quenya. There are also several important snippets of Sindarin here, especially among place-names.Approaching the work as just good literature will be disappointing, however. Tolkien, a specialist on Anglo-Saxon, tended to write mostly in a faux-archaic style reminiscent of BEOWULF or &quot;The Battle at Maldon&quot;. This tone, outdated and overly simplistic, will soon annoy the reader. Fitting in with the style, cliches and repetition abound. How many times must the reader be told Aragon suddenly seems not ragged anymore, but kingly and proud? Also, there are no narrative illusions here; the plot moves as it is overtly presented. If you like untrustworthy narrators, and thin and nebulous accounts where the reader must carefully fill in the blanks, as is common with such writers as Vladimir Nabokov and Gene Wolfe, Tolkien will seem infantile to you.I do recommend reading THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and even moving on the all of the Lord of the Rings.

If you are just looking for fine literature to enjoy, however, then it would probably be best to read something by an author with a more modern tone and better academic reception."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Fellowship of the rings: it has been over sixty years since Bilbo Baggins went on the famous adventure and found the ring. This is what Frodo the adopted heir of Bilbo must take and bear and all cost. The fellowship itself is four hobbits, two men, a dwarf, an elf, and Gandalf the Grey. They travel with Frodo to protect and help guard the ring from the eye of sauron and the greedy hands of Saruman and Gollum. They take them all they way to mordor with great trouble but then...Tolkien wins again. After the hobbit you could only hope of a repeat and he gives to you and some. It is another epic fantasy that only Tolkien can write. Read it if you can, you will love it.By: Michael"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Why read this book? You'd miss an awful lot if you omitted it! I decided to read the Hobbit because a friend of mine told me that it was the most beautiful English book she ever read. (She was only partly right: The Lord of the Rings (or the part I have read until now) is even greater.) After that I couldn't do without reading the Lord of the Rings.The complex and beautiful world Tolkien created and described is without doubt the work of a genius. I can't remember ever seeing the land a book described so clear before my eyes like I did while reading this book. The story is a sad one, unlike the Hobbit. It's more serious and much deeper, and for my taste too realistic in some ways (I'm not going to spoil it and tell you in which:P). I still hope that it turns out better than in seemes to do now, at the end of book one, and I really can't wait until I have read the next part!Don't let yourself being disheartened by the slow start and by the way some things need their time to devenlop, for without these slow parts one'd have no idea of what is going on in the story! I recommend leaving out the prolouge, for that can really be nerve-racking.And if you're still undecided whether to read it or not: This book is nothing for you only if you hate everything that you can't be sure of to exist in real."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Althought slow to begin with, The Fellowship of the Rings really grasps you into's its world, introducing some really interesting characters and plot lines.

This book was incredible in that it kept my attention throughout the whole book; and that, my friend is not an easy task. No event in this series comes expected. It is impossible to put this book down once you get past the first chapter. I do very highly recommend reading The Hobbit first because the LOTR trilogy often refers to events which took place in that book. But all in all, this was the book which made me fall in love with JRR Tolkein and his works."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I think this book is more than just a fantasy book. I think it is good because it has showed me alot of quality writing, and it is a complex book because of the inclusion of a separate language, maps of the landscape, and the in depth thought it must of took to create such a master piece.It has become a part of history and imagination. It is similar to folklore, we may not love it, but it has it's place in teaching us of the trials and errors, as well as the cermonies, of the past which we have all forgotten. As well as the important intiations of life that we as humans, need to feel more alive and to gauge where we are in our development. I feel like I'm visiting these characters every time I open the book, like old friends, like visiting old traditions, that by way of getting rid of them in present day life, has left this world a bit more empty.

But I had always found it to be a tough read. The language is old, the locations are confusing, the implied histories of the civilizations... it all got to me. In fact, I don't believe I had ever progressed as far as completing The Return of the King. However, the ideas behind the story have always appealed to me and never stopped me from coming back to the books time and again. I recently sat down and read \\"The Hobbit\\" to my seven-year old son, and that really whetted my appetite for more. This is the first opportunity that I've taken to read The Fellowship of the Ring after the Peter Jackson movies.I've watched the Peter Jackson films repeatedly. I estimate close to a dozen times on The Fellowship, so I'd like to think I'm well versed in the movie adaptations. So with this in mind, I began my own personal quest to read The Fellowship. I realize that I don't think \\"big\\" enough when reading epic novels. I can't picture so grand a scale for something so foreign to me. But with visuals from Jackson's movies in my head, I could better envision the story as it unfolded in the pages in front of me. The books and the movies are not the same, and I appreciate that. The film adaptations move parts around to make the flow more natural, and omit areas that would drag in a movie, but it gave me the basis for the proper mental visual.Reading it on a Kindle adds a new dynamic to clear another of my hurdles - the language. Not so much the created language of the elves and dwarves etc, but the use of old English verbage that is not in common use. I had come across many words I do not understand and with the press of a key I could get the translation and move on, not bewildered.And so with the issues of verbage set aside, and the trick to getting past my own mental block of not thinking \\"big\\" enough with the imagery now taken care of, I was able to sit down and ENJOY the book as it was meant to be enjoyed. I didn't find myself skipping passages, I found myself compelled to read more, I didn't feel like I was forcing myself into a chore, and thankfully, did not find myself comparing the novel to the film adaptations. For the first time, I felt like I appreciated Frodo (all previous reads, I thought to myself he was a second-rate Bilbo). The characters really are compelling if not somewhat mysterious. The pacing is questionable at times but the scope of the story is absolutely stunning."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"My opinion: Brilliant. Simply brilliant. This is the best book I've read in a long time. The characters are realistic, the action is-edge-of-your-seat, and the setting is incredibly believable. This is good stuff. Most people have told me that The Fellowship of the Ring is a boring book, but I completly disagree. Reccomended to anybody."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" has never appealed to the literati. Your English professor would hate it. It is wordy, conventional, direct, stereotypical, repetitive, bombastic and overly descriptive. But with so many faults, why is it still so good? Because ultimately, these are faults only of style, not of substance. Judged by its substance, this book has few peers.You must not approach this book lightly. Those who take up this work expecting the easy rewards of \\"Harry Potter\\" will quickly bog down in its philology, its faux history, its detours into song and verse, its cast of thousands, its sheer quantity of verbiage. \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is not a book that is read; one must be prepared to soak in it and absorb it through one's pores. Tolkien has painstakingly created a world so vivid that it exists in a parallel universe of heightened reality. It is more vibrant and more vital than our own world, but this sense unfolds slowly through a meandering plot filled with flashbacks and disjointed narrative. The opening chapters that introduce us to Hobbits, to the Shire and to the back-story consume over seventy pages and constitute a small novella of content. Yet nothing much happens in this time: it is all about history and premonitions and plans. If this sort of sustained and protracted build-up bores you, then frankly, you should save yourself the bother of starting.But if you have the determination to stick with it, the rewards are without equal. No other book in the past century so effectively addresses questions like \\"For what do I struggle\\", \\"For what do I live\\", \\"Why go on\\", and \\"Who am I\\"? Most writing struggles with simply asking such questions; \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" gifts us with the most inspiring of answers.By now, the plot is so well known that it is unnecessary to describe it. However, it would be a mistake to think that the book is just an adventure story about hobbits who save Middle Earth, or just an epic saga about courage and sacrifice. It is essentially a spiritual quest in which heroes--especially little ones--affirm what we struggle for, what we live for, why we go on, and ultimately, who we are.This work is so strongly identified with its genre that we tend to overlook its genius as pure literature. The themes that Tolkien evokes are the kind typical to the great books: life and death, good and evil, preservation and corruption, redemption and sacrifice. Not least we deal with pity and grace. We could be speaking of \\"Les Miserables\\". But in setting his creation to fantasy, Tolkien imbues it with a mythic aura that allows \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" to share in the conventions of fantasy while going beyond the genre's limitations. Few other works manage to surpass their genres, and none do so more skilfully.I used to think that to read this book is to love it. Time and age have taught me that this is not so. This book requires a determination and a forbearance that does not come easily to the modern mind. We are now so addicted to instant gratification that we no longer savour expectation--nor are we prepared to toil for our rewards. But if you are one who can still appreciate the art of waiting and can see beyond the book's stylistic faults, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" will inspire you with a transcendent experience unique in all of literature."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I generally don't reread books. I have so many waiting in the queue (two years backlog at last count, when friends recommend a book to me I ask them to check back in 2007 to see what I thought of it) that I don't really have time to go back and read stuff that I finished years ago, no matter how much I enjoyed it. And yet here I am, going through the famed trilogy again. I first read LOTR when I was about ten years old and while many of the finer details were absent from my memory, I managed enough of a general gist of the books to avoid going back to them, even resisting the urge when the movies came out to dive into a reread frenzy, even as the rest of my friends were tearing through them (plus I had a certain satisfaction, having gotten to them years before, first on the block syndrome and all that). And I did successfully resist through the three years of movie releases. But when I saw the extended version of the final movie, I was struck by a few scenes that I didn't remember that clearly, as well as reading some articles on the differences between the books and the movies, what was left in, left out, changed, etc. With all that in mind, I figured it was worth a shot to go through the books again, with an adult mind (in theory), since I don't know if I appreciated them enough as a kid. Of course, there was also a risk I would find them tedious and dull and just ruin all the magic but it was one I was willing to take. And it turned out to be a good idea. I firmly believe the reason Middle-Earth has remained stuck in everyone's consciousness over the years was because Tolkien treated it like a real place, made it a living, breathing world, down to the nuts and bolts of its history and as such it almost became a place you wanted to live. I've never encountered a made up place that feels as solid as Tolkien's creation does. That said, Fellowship of the Ring is interesting but also acts as setup, putting everything in place for the events that would happen in later volumes. The pace is far slower than I remembered, when I reached page two hundred and they hadn't left the Shire I knew I was in for a long haul. But you know what? I barely noticed. All the templates of modern epic fantasy are here and done right, by contrasting the average lives of the \\"little people\\" with the actions of the big important immortal people and mixing them all together, he really creates a world shaking feel, that big events are just around the corner and going to change everything. His writing has a casual ease to it, sure everyone speaks in stilted fantasy dialogue but it reads easy and the going went much faster than I would have thought. His gift for description is amazing, he relates enough to develop a sense of wonder but doesn't bog down the proceedings by describing every leaf and blade of grass. Those looking for action will probably be sorely disappointed, as will those looking for women characters (saving the world was man's work apparently, but it was a different time, kids) and yes, if you boil it down to the basics, you can summarize it, in the words of my brother so many years ago, as \\"all they do is walk around!\\" True, in a sense, but it's how they do it that matters and if you let yourself be immersed in the epic sweep of affairs, you'll be walking right along with them. The movie is what it is, and was a great experience, but they had to cut corners, literally transferring this novel to screen, as much as it alarmed purists would have made a dull movie. So think of the movie as the Cliffs Notes version of the book, I heartily recommend both, but if you want the full effect, the text is the way to go. This will be one reread I won't regret."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"No words can due justice to this audio book. It is incredible. The reading by Rob Inglis is beyond belief. He is so consistent with the character's voices throughout the reading, I wondered how he kept all of the characters straight in his mind while maintaining the dramatic content. There are over 20(+/-) major characters along with many characters involved in sub-plots, WOW!I listened to the entire Trilogy and to The Hobbit as well. I have thought about listening to the entire series again (I am in the car a lot). It is a performance worth taking the time to listen to and the financial investment to purchase. All totaled the four volumes consist of about 60 CD's, over 70 hours of listening time.

But, all the hoopla over the movie had me curious as to what is so intriguing about a bunch of mythical nonsense. Anyway, Tolkein starts off the story as can be expected, with a LOT of detail and character development. This seemed to drag on until at least the middle of the book with moments of excitement in between. I almost tossed it a few times at this point. Luckily when I did arrive to the later half and the begining half of the second book, it made it all worth while.

Shaan is left at the altar by her handsome groom, Piers, who marries another woman. Piers' brooding brother, Rafe, steps in and convinces the devastated bride to marry him instead. Shaan is determined not to see the truth---that Rafe loves her deeply---because she is in a distraught haze over Piers' desertion and over her belief that Rafe is really in love with the woman Piers has married. Rafe uses whatever means necessary---bullying, coddling, spoiling---to restore Shaan's self-esteem and force her out of her despondency. The newspapers add to Shaan's unhappiness by reporting that the wealthy brothers have switched brides, which, coupled with other twists and turns, leads to a final confrontation involving the three major characters. Why did Piers leave? Does he love Shaan? Does Shaan love Rafe or will her heart forever belong to Piers? What is the relationship between Piers' wife and Rafe? What really caused all of these problems to begin with? This book keeps you turning page after page to discover the answers.

I enjoyed this book very much."},{"Title":"Marriage on the Rebound (Harlequin Presents, No 1973)","review":"Pros:- The writer is very skillful, and brings the locations (Hong Kong in particular) brilliantly to life and kept me invested enough in the story of two really damaged people to finish the book.- The best friend character, who is the only sane person in the book, was fun to have around, if only as a novelty. For some reason in this kind of Harlequin novel (older Mediterranean man meets meek, mild virgin) there are almost never any decent parents, siblings or friends around- they tend to be populated by horrible people (my suspicion is that with a solid 60% of the genre having one person with a lick of sense around would make it impossible for the stories to happen as written).- The setting was really dramatic and intense. I genuinely wanted to know what would happen next- all credit is given to the writer for ensuring that.Cons:- The hero's actions are absolutely ridiculous. Him loving her from the beginning is sweet enough (I guess), but bullying a severely traumatized 22-year old into marriage is really heartless, no matter what the circumstances. I think that the setting merited a longer book, one which would have fully fleshed out the consequences of his actions instead of moving directly into the HEA (a la Susan Mallery- she does a GREAT job writing heroes who have to redeem themselves).- I have to agree with another reviewer, the heroine really is spineless. I know she's traumatized, but to let the brother of the man who you feel ruined and defiled you take your life over makes absolutely no sense. At all. She has no ambitions and is totally content to let pretty much everyone else in the book run her life. She's pretty, but not particularly smart, savvy or in possession of large amounts of common sense. Total doormat.I enjoyed reading this book, and even re-read it when I was done, so I could see if the ending stood up. It did. Unfortunately the hero and heroine just aren't really up to par- there is no way to cure the massive case of plot-convenient stupidity that the book rests on to keep moving. I'd recommend it if you love this author particularly, but otherwise you are ok taking a pass on this."},{"Title":"Marriage on the Rebound (Harlequin Presents, No 1973)","review":"Back Cover description: INSTANT BRIDEGROOM.

Now, with the same ruthless determination, Rafe insisted that she become his bride instead. Dazed, Shaan accepted his proposal, but she was also confused: until this moment, Rafe had acted as if he despised her. Suddenly he wanted to proclaim her to the world as his wife and, behind closed doors, to have her in his bed!Not her best. I didn't like this one.

The very un-PC title's use of Redman reflects his times.

Indeed, I think Ernest Seton hates his own race.rnrnFull of quotes and observations from plenty of other respectables sources, Seton puts forth his views on Native American spirituality, society, and world view, all in thought-provoking praise. And Seton truly knows his subject and most assuredly points out discrepencies with the still-current view that Native Americans are stoic, ultra-noble beings.

The story of 20 year old Catherine's journey halfway around the world to \\"find herself\\" could have easily turned into a travelogue. It didn't. If you happen to be looking for a tourist's guide to Spain, I would recommond Fodor's... not this novel. What it did turn into is the story of a very real girl who is battling with the same demons many of us do... self image, past relationships, the desire to make the right decisions.I was thrilled to find a protagonist I could relate to for once. The girl has issues... She knows she has issues, but she is a little confused about what those issues are... and as a refreshing change, those issues do not involve the family fortune, finding a new husband to finance a Park Avenue penthouse, or terminal illness. Those issues do involve being a child of divorce and alcoholism, and an all consuming need to succeed on her own, emotionally and financially. It is that need that we see constantly driving Catherine as she navigates her way through the unfamiliar territory of Madrid.For me, this was a five star novel; however, I have to admit that Fitzpatrick can be a bit long winded at times. For the lines I decided to skip over here and there because they seemed a bit irrelevant, I have deducted one star. Also in the spirit of fairness, I should caution that this is not a \\"feel good\\" novel. Although I wouldn't necessarily characterize it as \\"dark\\", it is a bit moody, and does not wrap everything up in a nice, neat bow at the end as many would prefer for a novel to do."},{"Title":"What's the Girl Worth?","review":"Engulfing Christina's treats in just two days, I long for more. What's the girl worth? I'm thinking a lot. While a pretty girl in a strange land always makes for story, a dark western eye's subtle slice through Europe is entriguing. Ms. Fitzpatrick offers the sol y sombra of Madrid, battling her amorous and paternal demons with the distilled emotion and stabbing sincerity of a matador. While her problems are salt of the earth, her texture is sublime. Although she may fall at times, you'll want to lift her up. I can't wait to lift her up again."},{"Title":"What's the Girl Worth?","review":"The novel What's the Girl Worth? written by Christina Fitzpatrick is worth four stars. It's a story about Catherine, cocktail waitress by night and college student by day, who takes a summer internship in Madrid, Spain. While in Spain she learned about Spanish culture as well as herself.I really liked this book because through the plot the reader learns about Spanish culture. During her trip Catherine went to a bull fight accompanied by her father. It was very descriptive, making you feel for the bulls. Most things are more laid back in Spain. In the story Catherine and her friends go out to bars and clubs all the time. During Catherine's father's visit he went with them to these places because everything was more mellow then they are back in America. Also in Madrid they have siesta everyday which is a time for resting or relaxing. Stores and restaurants close and everything is quiet and peaceful. L liked how everybody does this at the same time every day.Through Catherine's journey in Spain, she also had a personal journey. She overcame and accepted things about her father. I liked how in accepting these things from the past, she also learned new things about herself.I really enjoyed reading this book and I would recommend it."},{"Title":"What's the Girl Worth?","review":"Initially, I started reading this book because it is about someone who went to BU (where I am currently an undergrad).

I could relate to her problems, but not to her tendency to do nothing but whine about them. Overall, I found I spent the entire book just waiting for it to be over.

This book reminded me of the novels by Arturo Perez-Reverte; similar writing, arcane/spiritual nuances, good versus evil, who's in control and who's being controlled.I enjoyed the &quot;religious&quot; subtleties in the book and also how Williams plays with the concept of God in the paradox of good and evil. In essence, the individual, in creating their own reality, also creates their own eternal life."},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"I really enjoyed this novel, but I can't imagine recommending it to anyone, because the author's perspective is very hard to ascertain. The prose is cleaner and easier to read than \\"All Hallows Eve\\", and the atmosphere is definitely less ethereal. the story is such a strange mix of Victorian and modern ideas; imagine if H.P. Lovecraft and G.K Chesterton wrote a Father Brown mystery, and then made the mystery a subplot. Again in this work, as with the previously mentioned \\"All Hallows Eve\\", Williams does an excellent job bringing his characters to life.I must admit I began reading Williams because of his association with the Inklings and C.S.

And, of course, can't recall the last person that I lent it to. Sigh. So this time I played it smart. I purchased this version in paperback, my favorite and part of a publishers series. And I bought a hard cover edition at the same time. Now if I could only recover the edition that I bought at a used bookstore in Oxford. Thankfully, Amazon is a good place to begin a book search and doesn't require a plane ticket to England.By the way, Amazon gets no star for its description of the author, Charles Williams.The Williams who wrote this particular novel was not the author from Texas that you post as its writer. I cannot seem to find a way to communicate this through any of the options that you provide. And I wonder if you will ever see this comment. The Charles William who authored War in Heaven was an Englishman who met Lewis and Tolkien while in Oxford during World War 2. I wish that I could figure out contact you to request a correction. Sigh.Warning to those who review this site with no knowledge about Williams as one of the origial Inklings, this site credits the wrong author for this chilling but hopeful tale of the war between good and evil.See: http://www.amazon.com/War-Heaven-Novel-Charles-Williams/dp/0802812198/ref=la_B000AP8XJU_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1357146786&sr;=1-1"},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"Williams masterfully weaves the reader through history, classic vs. evil, and absurd mystical perversion simultaneously. All this while your asking for more."},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"This was the first book by Charles Williams I ever read and that was over thirty years ago. I have returned to this book time and time again, as I have with the others of his the seven supernatural thrillers. What is it that makes Charles Williams so special? The answer is the depth of his spirituality. His understanding of the coinherence and substitutional love is reflected in the seven novels (especially \\"Descent into Hell\\"). His theological writings are impressive.The thrillers point out what happens when things of great spiritual power, whether they be for good or for evil, come in contact with the average person. \\"War in Heaven\\" takes its title directly from Dante, an author whom Williams so greatly admired that he makes frequent references, whether direct or indirect, in almost all of his writings. Williams was steeped in the mystical forms of spirituality. It has taken me half a lifetime to really get to understand all that he is trying to say. \\"War in Heaven\\" is probably the most easily understood of the novels for the beginner. It takes the reader on a spiritual quest which forces one to really reflect on the importance, not in the Holy Graal as a specific object, but in the blessedness of the sanctification of the elements in the Mass. The chalice, identified as the \\"Holy Graal\\", is also considered and reflected upon most wisely as, \\"This is Thou, yet this is not Thou.\\" The sanctified elements give it its sacred power through the coinherence, and that is the point that Williams is trying to get across in this book. Evil cannot prevail because of its own sterility resulting from the eternal sacrifice that Messias gave with His Body and Blood for our redemption and salvation."},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"I really, really enjoyed this book, probably the most out of all of Charles Williams/s stories I've read so far (War in Heaven, (The Place of the Lion, (Many Dimensions, and (Descent into Hell).I think Karl missed out at least one other John. That is St John the Evangelist (who wrote the Book of Revelation). John is supposed to have taken Mary, Jesus' mother, to the town of Ephasus after the crucifixion and eventually died in Ephasus after returning from exile on Patmos(?). In pictures of him he is often shown holding a chalice with a snake in it, which represents his being able to make a miracle to clear the poison out of a drink he was given in an attempt to kill him."},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"There can't be much argument against the claim that such popularity as Williams enjoys today is due entirely to his association with C. S. Lewis. Having attempted to read _War_in_Heaven_, and struggling mightily to make it midway before surrendering, I cannot understand what Lewis saw in him. Perhaps it was hope that he had potential worth nurturing. The book does have some surprising and novel religious insights, and (like Blake) there's more wisdom in Williams' blasphemies than in most people's unthinking pieties. But the surprise comes mainly from the contrast against the flat narrative and amateurish plot. I could never complete the suspension of disbelief. Frankly, _War_in_Heaven_ struck me as being like second-rate Chesterton with a pulp fiction aesthetic.Special advisory: This book has two characters referred to as the Jew and the Greek. The Pauline reference is obvious enough, but the characterization of the Jew is not likely to sit well with readers in an era highly alert to antisemitic currents in the history of Christianity. &quot;They build and we destroy....One day we shall destroy the world.&quot; That would be unacceptable in a modern author and I have to believe it was unacceptable in Williams' day. I don't want to make the claim that Williams was an antisemite -- I think he was trying to be allegorical and failed clumsily -- but you should be forewarned.I hate to write negative reviews, for a number of reasons I won't go into, but I don't mind giving warnings from my personal experience. Check out Williams for yourself before you buy one of his books, at the risk of a serious case of buyer's remorse."},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"But perhaps it is because I am not a great mystery fan, or the classics. [I mean, did the question, \\"Heautontimoroumentos?\\" really make immediate sense to anyone else?]In any case, I found by keeping a score card so that I could track all the players, and parsing several passages in order to figure out the nuances of the author's syntax, I could plug on into the last few chapters which, though possibly the most surreal, were, IMO, the most accessible.I would recommend looking for a copy to borrow before buying if you were, like myself, considering reading it because of Williams' ties to the Inklings."},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"Charles Williams' War In Heaven starts with the finding of a corpse in a London publishing house. The tone is very light and the reader is ready for a screwball adventure. But with the introduction of Gregory Persimmons the story turns darker. Persimmons has been searching for the Holy Graal (sic), and seeks to use its power to perform occult ceremonies. He believes it now resides in a country parish of Fardles. He resolves to steal it but is foiled by the Archdeacon of Fardles. As the struggle for the Graal continues both Persimmons and the Archdeacon gain unexpected allies.War In Heaven is reminiscent of CS Lewis' cosmic trilogy. Not surprisingly since Chalres Williams was a member of the Inklings, whose members also included CS Lewis and JRR Tolkien."},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"Some people 'get it' and some don't. CS Lewis got it, and admired Williams enormously. This is a great book, though people should remember the era it was written in. Few will understand its layered meanings and significances but even if some escape you the journey is a marvel."},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"Williams' common theme to his novels is the interaction of the natural world with the supernatural, more specifically Heaven and Hell. The result is usually a terrible clash. In this story the Holy Grail is discovered by an obscure passage of a book , a passage not to be published in the final work. Three characters who revere the Grail for its religious and literary significance try to protect it. Three men want it for its occult power. A fight ensues, though on a much smaller scale than those legendary of the Knights of the Round Table. Nonetheless it reflects the war between Heaven and Hell.The story and the characters are very English. It is set at a wealthy man's estate, Cully, or a duke's home, or a church at Castra Parvulorum, a.k.a. Fardes. The characters include the masters of these locales, as well as the staff of a publishing company, (Williams using his background in the story). The use of the occult in this setting - including Black Mass and a chemist's shop with magic item - prompted visions of Hammer horror films. It's a fun read."},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"Charles Williams died in 1945, aged fifty-nine, and I acquired three of his novels recently from a second-hand stall. This is the first one I've read. I found myself thinking of the differences between modern writing and the stories of not-too-long ago, remembering reading Dickens as a young teen and coping fine with long descriptions that would later bore my sons, knowing as I read that \\"this is a good author\\" therefore trusting the story to come. Not that Charles Williams writes like Dickens, but his stories do have longer paragraphs and more description than modern fiction. If War in heaven is anything to go by, they also have fascinating plots, up-to-date mysteries--even a Holy Graal--and complex characters with no simple bad guy/good guy denotations.That last point makes me think they may represent better story-telling than many recent Christian novels I've read, though some of the plot-lines make me wonder if they'd be accepted by a modern Christian publishing house.In case you can't tell, I really rather enjoyed reading War in Heaven. The author paints the English town and countryside very convincingly, making me think of home. And he writes the dialog delightfully, with half the truths lying unspoken between the lines. There's a murder on page one, and an absolutely perfect first line that declares the phone's ringing unanswered \\"since there was no-one in the room but the corpse.\\" And even as mystery piles on mystery, that corpse lies waiting to be identified, the cause of death unknown till the story's end.There's a country pastor, a Duke, a mad archeologist, strange chemists brewing even stranger potions, and innocent book publishers just trying to get on with their lives. There are deaths as well, not just the corpse; crazy chases; magical mists and mysterious strangers. And there are long and fascinating conversations like sitting by the fireside listening in while those with serious opinions opine.It's a zany mad-cap adventure, told slowly and leisurely. And I find myself wondering if, in a world with fewer authors and fewer books, perhaps it was easier to know \\"this is a good author\\" and trust the tale to come. Perhaps we need our fast pace and instant action when we read today because the reader's probably not heard of the author before. If we're not caught straight away in the story's net what reason will we have to invest the time?Ah well, that's my two-pennorth. And when I get time, I'll invest it in reading and reviewing another of Charles Williams' books."},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"Before you pay for the hardcover you should know that this edition looks like it's been incompetently scanned. It has run-together words (theGraal instead of the Graal) and underlines instead of text format changes and randome question marks scattered about in the middle of the dialog. The paperback version is a much better bet (and cheaper)."},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"I read this book after being introduced to Charles Williams in David Downing's EXCELLENT 2010 novel \\"Looking for the King\\" (you'll find the book and my 5-star review on amazon).I began my reading with War in Heaven as I understand it is Williams' first novel and because the subject was close to the subject of Looking/King.War in Heaven is unlike any other book I have ever read, and I mean that in a good way.The writing style is a bit stilted but as many other reviewers here have noted it is the style of a British writer of the early 20th century.What struck me most about the book was how the evil was palpable and not comical (as in, say, Indiana Jones)...this comes from a writer who was inspired by reading theology and literature and not by watching movies (like Spielberg...God Bless him, though). The scenes of the occult ceremonies gave me the creeps...honestly some of the scariest stuff I've ever read. What is really provoking, though, is how the evil people in this book attacked a family that had done them no harm...it makes the point that while you may not do evil yourself, others may use you for their own evil and to their own ends. One must be on guard and protect one's family as well.I wish I had known a bit more about the mythology surrounding the Grail (or Graal, as Williams refers to it) and the Crusades...a character is introduced towards the end that may be more familiar to people steeped in Dark/Middle Age history than I am...I think I would have appreciated it more...I think perhaps Americans are so steeped in our own mythology that we are losing touch with the \\"ancients\\" and that's unfortunate.I can't wait to read my next Williams novel...not sure what I'll pick.I highly recommend War in Heaven."},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"There exists nothing like Charles Williams novels, in extraordinary Christian fantasy. He was a genius, who saw into the depths of spiritually, beyond religious orientations, and glorified God in every novel he wrote. Next to the Bible, his works are my favorites, in all of the Christian fiction literature that I own."},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"I approached this book with an awareness of Williams' reputation as an obscure and difficult writer, but was pleasantly surprised at how engaging and accessible it is. The surface of the book is interesting and creative; the symbolism is layered and thought-provoking. In the conversation between Batesby and the &quot;man in the grey suit,&quot; Williams contrasts the deeply thoughtful faith of the Archdeacon (and perhaps also the fear and insecurity of the &quot;saved&quot; Methodist), with the kind of one-dimensional thinking and certitude that can be found in any branch of religious practice. I was unpleasantly surprised to discover that only three of Williams' seven novels are currently in-print."},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"War in Heaven is not a bad place to start for readers new to Williams. The story is fairly straight-forward and entertaining and the book explores a few major Williams themes without getting too wacky. These themes include understanding evil as a privation, recognizing the awful omnipotence of God, and believing in a sort of spiritual architecture to the physical universe. Some of Williams' ideas are a bit heterodox, but, assuming you are not going to Williams for your religious formation, an orthodox reader should be safe enough puzzling over a few of Williams' more benign conceptions.The book narrates a battle between good and evil for &quot;control&quot; of the Holy Grail. The alliance defending the Grail is composed of: (1) an Anglican Arch-Deacon who desires to prevent the Grail from being misused, although he reckons God can defend his own cup if he so desires, (2) a Catholic zealous to obtain the relic and ship it to Rome for protection, and (3) a somewhat Romantic literary-type who wants to keep the Grail out of harm's way. The interaction between these three characters is one of the more interesting aspects of the book and, I suspect, reveals much of Williams' own thoughts on religion.Despite Williams' gentle ribbing of the One True Church, War in Heaven is an excellent read, but one wonders if Williams might have profited from the advice of a fellow Inkling: &quot;Never laugh at live dragons.&quot;"},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"Why only three stars? Because, as strong as my feelings are towards the book, I cannot recommend it to everyone. As will be clear.I was a huge fellow traveler with CS Lewis, his journey with God and mine being almost exactly parallel, through adolescence to mid-life, anyway (I have not yet felt compelled to marry for... read for yourself why!); many years ago I believe that I read everything that he ever published, and I still consider him an ultimate source. Perhaps because I read so much of Lewis and so little of the competition, the Inklings did not penetrate my consciousness until recently; once I became aware of Mr. Williams, this book promptly hit the reading list.I utterly fail to grasp why The Great Divorce is mentioned by other reviewers as the point of departure from Lewis when that position is very clearly held by That Hideous Strength. Both are works of utterly nondidactic fiction, which spin narratives that so compelling engender the feel of the presence of evil in ordinary life as to nearly impel one to halt reading briefly to check one's perimeter to ensure one's personal security. Whilst War depends more than does Strength upon some appreciation of Britishism (eg, the foreign-to-an-American unique societal position of the peerage just prior to its destruction and of class in general), War is somewhat more compelling because it Could Have Happened, under the radar screen, whereas Strength - well, more of an \\"alternate universe\\" play, about whose events one would have read in the newspapers.As outstanding as I found the book (I'm taking another bite of the apple; Descent into Hell awaits on my Kindle) there are three caveats, in ascending order of difficulty: First, the aforementioned cultural issues: Britain was, at least until well after this book was written, a very different place; although Williams backfills some of that which one needs to know, there will probably be distractions amongst those not at least steeped in Conan Doyle, Wells, and Verne, if not in the classic British literature. Second, there are treatments of other religions and cultures that are less than delicate; those who insist upon judging works of an earlier age by the standards of our own will not be pleased. And finally, a person not of faith will probably not see the point of the whole thing at all.Pity for such a person; he misses a hugely enjoyable ride."},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"I loved C.S. Lewis' _The Great Divorce_, and I was hoping to find something similarly imaginative here. But the writing was so stilted that I couldn't read past the first three chapters."},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"Jesus answered and said to him, &quot;Because I said to you, 'I saw you under the fig tree,' do you believe? You will see greater things than these...Most assuredly, I say to you, hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.&quot; (John 1:50-51)&quot;War in Heaven,&quot; much like the story of humanity, is all about the invasion of the supernatural--the divine and the demonic--into the mundane settings of everyday life.Charles Williams has a keen sense of what Thoreau called the &quot;lives of quiet desperation&quot; that most people live. The characters in &quot;War in Heaven&quot; are plagued by everyday demons long before they encounter any exceptional ones...Williams takes these lives, and in a most un-quiet way...builds an entrancing story--one that shakes the reader to the core.This is one of the scariest books I've read in a long while. The presence of evil is palpably felt in the antagonist of the book...a very creepy kind of evil...not your run of the mill stuff.I don't want to spoil the plot (not to mention that the plot is a little hard to describe-owing to the fact that so much of what is import in this book has little to do with story line--so much of it is &quot;in the moment.&quot;) So all I will say here is that the conclusion is well worth the &quot;dry spots&quot; one finds in the prose. It is one of the most beautifully written scenes I have ever come across in English Literature.I recommend this book...but not to the faint of heart."},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"Let's start by granting all the cavils of the critics: Charles Walter Stansby Williams wrote bad poetry, worse plays, and worst of all, a handful of obscure, nearly unreadable novels. Nevertheless, Charles Williams is my favorite writer, and War in Heaven my favorite of his books. Let me proceed to explain why.CW's poetry may miss the mark of some poetic standard, but even now I can recite pieces from Taliessin Through Logres, while I usually find modern poetry uninspiring. His plays may not hold up well in some conventional sense of what plays are supposed to be, but they contain some of the most quotable lines I've ever read, and I would drive to the next state to see one put on. His novels may be dismissed as dense and obscure, but they are among the most gripping books I've ever read. War in Heaven isn't his best novel--that would be All Hallows Eve-- yet it's my favorite. I'm finally up to the point of saying why.Some college lit classes read Descent into Hell because it takes place on a number of well-defined levels. War in Heaven has wheels within wheels as well, but they aren't so clearly defined. It's not quite his easiest to read novel--that would be Many Dimensions--but it's still one of the easiest. Of all his novels, War in Heaven perhaps falls over into the most categories--it's a supernatural thriller that is sort of a detective novel, kind of a suspense novel, in a way about relationships, about self-growth, spiritual search and discovery, but not in a traditional sense.Everything that conventional novels are supposed to be these novels are not, which is why people like me who have no desire to read the bestsellers at the supermarket checkout stand yet find themselves taken with Williams' novels. One popular book report topic in college lit classes is to show how the characters &quot;grow&quot; through the book. With War in Heaven I found this difficult to do because reading a Williams book, it seems it's more like the reader who grows. Although the little group who throw in their lot with the Archdeacon in War in Heaven come to live by a typically Williams-esque maxim, &quot;Believe and doubt well,&quot; the book seems to end where it began, yet somehow everything is new."},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"It gives essentially none of the story away to reveal that the plot of \\"War in Heaven\\" revolves around the Graal (per Williams's preferred spelling). Williams's first published novel is full of the blurring of reality that one finds in all of his fiction and, like \\"The da Vinci Code\\", involves a struggle between opposing groups drawn into conflict by the Graal. However, unlike \\"The da Vinci Code\\"'s ersatz, vapid spirituality--which, where it has flavor at all tastes merely of cheap sideshow spiritualism--\\"War in Heaven\\" depicts allies of darkness that are rank with evil even as its friends of light savor of ultimate goodness. In \\"War in Heaven\\" one gets a glimpse beyond the veil to see ultimate spiritual reality consisting of powers and principalities swarming in defiance of a holy throne even as the King of Light engages all according to his overarching plan and by his undeniable power. By contrast, in \\"The da Vinci Code\\" one finds that the ultimate reality beyond the veil is tantamount to a group of 7 year-olds playing with a Ouija board at a slumber party. So, if you're looking for a \\"spiritual thriller\\" of substance that involves the Holy Grail, \\"War in Heaven\\" trumps (perhaps greatly trumps?) \\"The da Vinci Code.\\" 5 stars. An excellent book."},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"&quot;War in Heaven&quot; is a must for any serious reader of Christian fiction. It begins with an interesting murder and quickly evolves into a Quest for the Holy Grail,thus assuming that Those Feet in ancient times, did indeed wander England's mountains green. Along the way, an unlikely triumverate (or should we say Trinity) of good guys battles some very sinister fellows. Touches of humor grace the book, and the theology and the message are sound and inspiring.Williams was one of a trio of great early 20th century Christian authors, in a little club (The Inklings) with fellow dons C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien. Today, Tolkien is most remembered for fiction, and Clive Staples Lewis for theology. This is, in part, because Williams wrote in a more formidable style. However, once you get into the syntax and rythym, his words flow smoothly and he is very readable. Press on through the first few pages of any Williams book, and you will be rewarded with a &quot;ripping yarn&quot; on many levels.This book is recommended not only for those who love Williams' other fiction (Descent into Hell, Place of the Lion, etc.) and nonfiction (Descent of the Dove), but for anyone who would enjoy a serious Christian adventure novel.There is a strong message of the role of faith, and of eccumenical Christianity in &quot;War in Heaven.&quot; Maybe it isn't for sticklers on one denomination's doctrine, but for most, it is well worth ordering."},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"Just in case you overlooked the Amazon.com review (above), the opening paragraph of this book is well worth repeating as being one of the most outstanding introductions to a detective/mystery/horror novel you've ever come across:&quot;The telephone bell was rininging wildly, but without result, since there was no-one in the room but the corpse.&quot;And that isn't just a fluke.On the contrary, I'd suggest that this is probably one of Williams' most effective novels, in terms of plain story telling, especially in the case of the extremely powerful climax.Like &quot;Many Dimensions&quot; (which is best read after &quot;War in Heaven&quot;, because one character appears in both of those books, but doesn't survive the second), I've only given this book 4 stars because, as other reviewers have indicated, the British literary style of the 1930s is not to everyone's taste - and as far as his style of writing is concerned, Williams' work fits fairly comfortably into that general genre.Having said that, I'd thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys novels of the occult that invite the reader to go for something more than a mindless blood bath or demonfest.Owen Barfield, also a member of the Inklings - the writing circle that included Tolkein, C.S. Lewis and Williams - is quoted on the back cover as saying:&quot;Charles Williams's firm conviction that the spiritual world is not simply a reality parallel with that of the material one, but is rather its source and its abiding infrastructure, is explicit in both the manner and matter of all he wrote.&quot;Well, I haven't read *all* that Williams ever wrote, but I'd say it was most certainly true of this novel, where this interlacing and interaction is an integral part of the plot.Indeed, far from being a mere examination of &quot;the distinction between magic and religion&quot; (back cover of the book), if you want to look for deeper meanings, the story line holds up well as an allegory of the state of all mankind - those who build, and those who destroy; those who believe, those who only *think* they believe, and those who believe they have no belief; and so on and so on.As to the apparently antisemitic element in the story, two things are relevant:Firstly, it was very common in the Britain of the 1930s for the middle and upper classes to regard Jews with a certain amount of disdain. But this was not 'antisemitism' as such. Rather there was a distrust of Levanters (Lebanese, Syrians, Jews/Palestinians and, to a lesser extent, Turks and Greeks) in general which persisted at least into the 1950s.Secondly, in the passage referred to in a previous review:&quot;They build and we destroy....One day we shall destroy the world.&quot;The speaker, a character called Manasseh, who is initially introduced into the story as simply &quot;a Jew&quot;, is using the word &quot;we&quot; in relation to Satanists, not Jews.So 'zenophobia', perhaps, but 'antisemitism', I think probably not.Incidentally, if you haven't yet read the book, or you're planning to read it again, you might be interested in the significance of the name &quot;John&quot;, as used in the novel:1. &quot;John&quot;, from the Hebrew &quot;Jochanan&quot; means &quot;God is gracious&quot;2. The book &quot;The Ascent of Mount Carmel&quot;, referred to in the story, on the face of it for no apparent reason, is a real book, a mystical work written by St. John of the Cross.3. Prester John was, in legend, apparently immortal. In the 12th century he was referred to as the Christian Emperor of Asia. Marco Polo (13th-14th centuries) wrote about him as the lord of the Tartars. In the 14th century he had allegedly become the Emperor of Abyssinia and was still said to hold that office a century later."},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"Like several previous reviewers, I read this book because of Charles Williams's connection with C.S Lewis and Tolkein. This book has not achieved the lasting fame and adulation of Lewis's Space Trilogy or The Lord of the Rings, and for good reasons. The plot is almost amateurish, and Williams simply could not write as well as Lewis or Tolkien.BUT, Willims had gifts of another sort. Williams was able to write about spiritual experience in ways that Dan Brown (or pick some other thriller of-the-day writer) could never hope to equal. War In Heaven will challenge the reader to sweat through long stretches of unremarkable prose, that could easily have come from yesterdays advertisements, but perseverence will be rewarded with sweet draughts of unforgettable holiness.The privilege of reading Chapter X titled The Second Attempt on the Graal, made up for all the book's low points. The internal reaction of Mornington and the Duke to the Graal, and the description of the united effort at prayer to resist the unholy assault on the Graal, represent one of the clearest articulations of faith as the \\"substance of things to be hoped for\\" that I have ever yet encountered . In the end, passages like this are the only reason I read fiction at all. Its the reason why War in Heaven must be read."},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"Williams' ability to craft a great story nearly escapes the reader because his style is so subtle, and the narrative flows so seamlessly. It is also brilliantly and creatively imagined. He weaves the deft mystery style of Chesterton and Doyle with his own religious background and spiritual experiences. Were it written today, this story might be mistakenly tossed into the same bland, agenda-driven genre of evangelical \\"spiritual\\" thrillers, but Williams avoids such a trap by giving his spiritual hero, the Archdeacon of Fardles, a sometimes wavering confidence in his chosen path, and a battle with his own desire to give up.While the book is certainly not one for those who feel immediately alienated by religious context and setting, it does not require or expect conversion or spiritual agreement in order to be enjoyed. Williams is the forgotten member of the Inklings (C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, and others), but his writing, especially War In Heaven, stands toe-to-toe with the other great works to emerge from that group."},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"Williams has often been -- unfairly -- compared to Lewis and Tolkien. Both the other writers are much loved and well-read. Williams' books, however, were very different. Deeper, in many respects; far more serious as literature; and far more committed overtly to Christ. He wasn't a great stylist and sometimes you feel he wrote too quickly, but the intensity of his books is unmatched. WAR IN HEAVEN starts off as a murder mystery, but later becomes a Grail quest. It's the sort of book people of faith should write more of, and the sort of book by a person of faith the secular world should read and praise -- but won't."},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"This is the first book I have read by Charles Williams, and if it is indicative of what the rest of his books are like, I think I shall be a fan of his. In War in Heaven, Williams depicts a struggle between the forces of evil (which call upon the powers of Hell), and the forces of good (which call upon the power of God), over the Holy Graal, which has turned up in contemporary England (or at least it was contemporary when Williams wrote it). In the course of the struggle, each side draws upon the power of their master, Gregory Persimmons upon Hell and the Arch-Bishop upon God through prayer. It is a very good story, and it reminded me greatly of C. S. Lewis' Interplanetary series, especially That Hideous Strength. Williams wrote this first, so I wonder if this book shaped the one that Lewis wrote. I know that they read each others works, so I find it hard to believe that the fact that they are so similar is a mere coincidence.A few of Williams theological views were a bit questionable. For example, at one point he attributes evil to God, and claims that God wills evil. Near the very end of the book, it is also said that the church is one path among many to God. He seems to be advocating pluralism, but it was kind of vague, and possibly could have been saying that one can be saved without being a part of the visible church.In conclusion, this is a very good book which I would recommend to those who like philosophical fiction. If you like the modern kind of mindless reading, where you don't really need to think, you will probably not like this book, for this book makes you think. It raises philosophical questions which it does not necessarily answer, so if you do not like being troubled of mind, this is probably not the story for you. A few previous reviewers have also implied that it is a frightening story, but I do not think you need be wary of reading this if you do not like reading of occult and the such, for there are no demons, only black magic, and I did not find them particularly scary at all. Personally, I think that a few scenes of Ransom and the devil in Perelandra were far more frightening that anything in this book."},{"Title":"War In Heaven","review":"I started reading this novel merely because I wanted to read something by the least known of &quot;The Inklings.&quot; It was very slow going at first and I considered giving up several times. Once I reached Chapter 11, however, the novel really picked up. I could not put it down. The introduction of &quot;the man in grey&quot; gave the novel the air of mystery it was lacking. The book is odd and the characters are so staid and British about everything that at first there is very little suspense. The characters act as though they are discussing everyday mundanities when confronted with murder, the occult, and the miraculous. The last 100 pages of this book are brimming with thrills, atmosphere, and spiritual insight. It is well worth slogging through the first 150 pages of this work to reach the climax. I especially loved the discourse between Batesby and &quot;the man in gray&quot; a wonderful indictment of the liberal relatvist pastor. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Lewis' science fiction trilogy."},{"Title":"Existence and being","review":"This is a good book for introducing a form of thinking that may be called for on special occasions, when people have to consider what is not truly mundane. My second-hand copy of this book, the Gateway edition, published 1979, based on the First American edition published 1949, begins with a long attempt to explain Heidegger's main early work, BEING AND TIME, Part I. (1927). Way back then &quot;only the first two out of six planned sections of the book were published.&quot; (p. 8). I thought that the explanation by Werner Brock took too long to get to the items by Heidegger which finally appear from page 233 to the end of this book. As an example of the explanation for what is included, I would like to quote the following paragraph:Some of the critics seem to think that there has been a considerable change in Heidegger's outlook, if not immediately after the publication of &quot;Being and Time,&quot; at least since the first essay on Hoelderlin (1936). I for one do not share in this opinion. In my view, the themes of all the four essays, but especially of the two philosophical ones, are directly and most intimately related to &quot;Being and Time,&quot; but not so much to the first two published Sections as rather to the third one on &quot;Time and Being.&quot; (p. 119).Heidegger's Inaugural Lecture, &quot;What is Metaphysics?&quot; is included at the end of this book. On page 349, an undated &quot;Postscript&quot; admits that &quot;The question \`What is Metaphysics?' remains a question. For those who persevere with this question the following postscript is more of a foreword.&quot; The obstacles encountered in the preceding lecture are described as &quot;good. It will make our questioning more genuine.&quot; (p. 351). The first of the &quot;misgivings and misconceptions to which the lecture gives rise&quot; has been &quot;The lecture makes \`Nothing' the sole subject of metaphysics.&quot; (p. 352). The other problems are explained as mood problems we acquire when we do not &quot;shut our ears to the soundless voice which attunes us to the horrors of the abyss&quot; (p. 354) through such a concept. &quot;Without Being, whose unfathomable and manifest essence is vouchsafed us by Nothing in essential dread, everything that \`is' would remain in Beinglessness.&quot; (pp. 353-354).After long consideration of &quot;Nothing, conceived as the pure \`Other' than what-is, is the veil of Being,&quot; (p. 360) comes some ancient Greek described as the last poem of a tragedy, &quot;Oedipus in Colonos&quot; by Sophocles, and at last, an English translation that also seems fair enough to be remembered on Memorial Day, 2003:But cease now, and nevermoreLift up the lament:For all this is determined."},{"Title":"There was one Anna","review":"This book is about a relative and I love it!!!!!!!!!!!! :) My hobby is geneology and this book has not only given me in site to My Great Great Great Aunt Anna, but also gives me some other family history.

It explains in typical Cat in the Hat rhyme and stance all the different uses for maps.It explains the difference between a globe and a map, what latitudes and longitudes and other features of maps are. You learn to read a map by using the windrose or a grid.The book goes well beyond town or country maps. It features weather maps, topographical maps and even marine charts.What truly separates this book from the crowd: it is shockfull of hands-on things to do. It begins with peeling an orange while leaving the skin in one piece to demonstrate what a world map should really look like - brilliant idea! Then it goes on to make a map of your room, town, imaginary countries. Or how to measure the length of a curved road on a map using a straight ruler and string.At the end of the book you find a glossary that explains the \\"big\\" words like topographical map and others again.

I'd recommend adults read it over first, and if you are reading to--or with--kids who aren't familiar with the Seuss style, just skip over some of the names. Other kids may enjoy that part.Overall this is a great book on map reading. Parents may want to read it with their kids before going on a road trip, have them practice some map-reading skills at home (including a blueprint-style map of the rooms in their home), then try to find some very simple maps for the kids to read on the road, depending on their ages.This summer we organized some day camps to help young family members learn to read, which included numerous treasure hunts to practice reading skills. On the final day we read this book, then the big blowout treasure hunt led them to a hidden bag of puzzle pieces. When they put the puzzle together, it was a map of a couple rooms in our house, with red arrows pointing to the location of their next clue. The kids loved it (and they didn't mind the treasure chest full of little prizes after the final clue either)! I think it reinforced how much they could learn by reading books, and how they could put that knowledge to use.I haven't seen many kids' books that teach map reading, so this is a great addition to a child's library, especially if you help them follow up with some practice. We females tend to have brains that don't automatically process maps, so this may be especially helpful for young girls--if they're anything like me, anyway!"},{"Title":"There's a Map on My Lap!: All About Maps (Cat in the Hat's Learning Library)","review":"I bought this book for the Social Studies department where I work.

Highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Wishing Ball","review":"As always, Elisa Kleven's energetic tale and illustrations leap off the page and into the readers' minds and hearts. Readers can identify with the stray cat's yearning for a better life. Readers can identify with the crocodile's dreams for an extraordinary companion who offers a different perspective on existence and experience. Readers can identify with the naughty, manipulative crow who deceives and plays tricks.The Wishing Ball is a wonderful story that speaks to the very deepest, most intimate places of our own human needs: safety, shelter, food, comfort, hope, belonging, friendship, beauty, knowledge, ownership, voice, desire, empathy, love, family, and happiness. So many universal themes are packed into this little book, and each theme makes a fantastic discussion point for class story hour, family time, bedtime, etc.Adult readers, especially those in the fields of education, wellness, and psychology, can even benefit from analyzing this enigmatic little tale because its underlying messages can be equated (in basic ways) to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs: physiological needs, safety needs, belonging / social needs, self-esteem needs, growth needs, and self-actualization / purpose needs--one's striving to be or to do something of value. A useful lesson plan would be to ask students / readers to develop a Needs chart depicting elements from The Wishing Ball and then compare that chart to Maslow's theories. Ultimately, we ask the question: are people truly happy when all their needs have been met?The Wishing Ball is definitely a smart edition to any library--home, school, or otherwise."},{"Title":"The Wishing Ball","review":"My three year old daughter and I both love Elisa's books. The artwork is magical. The Wishing Ball is a beautiful piece of art and talented writing. Highly recommend it! She includes Ernst in this book too!"},{"Title":"The Vintage Book of Contemporary Chinese Fiction","review":"This book was published under the Vintage title in 2001 and in 1998 as the Picador Book of Contemporary Chinese Fiction. There were 37 works from 19 authors: 1 excerpt from a novel and 36 short stories, about a third of them micro stories of 1-2 pages. As far as could be judged, there was one story from the 1950s, two from the late 1970s, and the rest split roughly between the 80s and the 90s. About two-thirds of the translations came from the Chinese Literature Press of the PRC, and the rest from co-editor Carolyn Choa.The co-editors, born in the PRC and Hong Kong respectively but living in the UK, sought to introduce China and its people to foreign readers and make the book a bridge to Chinese culture and present-day concerns. Prominent authors included Wang Meng (1934-), Zhang Jie (1937-) Feng Jicai (1942-), Cheng Naishan (1946-), Shi Tiesheng (1951-), Wang Anyi (1954-) and Su Tong (1963-). Among the prominent authors not in the book were Bei Dao (1949-) and Mo Yan (1956-).The first few stories in the collection were the most interesting for this reader: an excerpt from co-editor David Su Liqun's novel, Beijing Opera, in which an Englishwoman sought a Chinese teacher's help in studying opera. It expressed well the viewpoint of a cultured modern-day artist. A story by Cheng Naishan followed a woman from the remnants of Shanghai's upper class who survived the Cultural Revolution with her humanity intact (\\"Hong Taitai\\"). Shi Tiesheng's story showed a young man coming to terms with an accident that changed the course of his life (\\"Fate\\"). It was a rare work that cut back and forth in time, viewing an event from many angles rather than proceeding chronologically. And a story by Wang Anyi described a courtyard inhabited by an acting troupe, where people lived on intimate terms with each other.Fables by Wang Meng poked fun at hypocrites and those who crushed others' creativity. A story by Chen Shixu followed the travails of a general who opposed the government during the rule of the Gang of Four but was vindicated when they fell from power (\\"The General and the Small Town\\"). In a story by Zhang Jie, a woman looked at her mother's life as read through the latter's journal, and the mother's feelings for a man she loved but couldn't marry (\\"Love Must Not Be Forgotten\\"). This story was worthwhile for the narrator's introspection and analysis of another's feelings.A story from the late 1950s by Zhou Libo (\\"The Family on the Other Side of the Mountain\\") showed the behavior of people at a rural wedding, interesting in that relatively few stories from 1949-76 China have seen publication in anthologies abroad. Some of the atmosphere of that period was also expressed well in a story from the late 70s by Mo Shan, in which a lazy ticket-seller at a train station was educated through criticism to become a good worker, and eventually saved someone's life (\\"The Window\\"). Most of the other stories in the book made less of an impression. It would've been appreciated if the editors' introductions had offered a bit more analysis of the stories and their context.This anthology showed the bad in China but also the good, including many characters who were adaptable, going about their lives or looking to the future. In this way, it counterbalanced the anthology Chairman Mao Would Not Be Amused (1995), edited by Howard Goldblatt, which also covered about 20 Chinese authors mainly the 1980s and 90s but emphasized misanthropy, pessimism, family dysfunction and moral conflict. Another anthology covering recent writing is Running Wild: New Chinese Writers (1994)."},{"Title":"Fortune Telling With Food: How Foods Change Your Body and Character","review":"I bought this book and we have had a lot of fun with it. I've used the self evaluation test with friends and co-workers and everybody found the results to be quite accurate. Its a fun way to take a fresh look at the foods in your diet. The compatability ratings especially among couples was very accurate and uncanny. There are also some interesting insights on the values of many common foods &amp; beverages. Its fun,light reading and doesn't pile on all of the worn out nutritional hoopla so common in other nutrition books.

These tales are from the early 1940's (and I was envisioning something more like the reprints from the 1950's that I'd read as a kid). The artwork is a bit more crude, the dialog & stories are definitely vintage. I suppose my biggest disappointment was that its not really a \\"team\\" book - the characters only get together at the \\"board meeting\\" in the beginning of each tale and then again at the \\"return meeting\\" at the end of the tale. In the middle, its all separate little stories, each featuring one hero in their own little bit. Don't expect any big \\"team\\" battles with all the characters fighting together.But all that said, if you're a comics fan, and especially if you're a collector, then all of these \\"Archive Editions\\" are a great deal! Much less expensive than buying the originals (and a darn sight sturdier than a 60-year old comic printed on cheap paper would be)! Yes, it was a different time back then, and these stories are as much a look back at those times in general as they are a look back at super heroes in the \\"golden Age\\" of comics.By the way, I bought my copy through one of Amazon's used book sellers and thus got an even better deal on it."},{"Title":"All Star Comics Archives, Vol. 2 (DC Archive Editions)","review":"DC's All Star Comics Archives Vol. 2 contains reprints of All Star Comics #7-10. For a team of superheroes so closely associated with World War II, these issues are particularly interesting because they were published in the months directly preceding and then following the events of Pearl Harbor. They deal with issues like raising money for war orphans, fifth columnists, futuristic bomb defense formulas, and eliminating Nazi spies in South America.Each character's individual adventure is illustrated by his or her regular artist, so these issues are a good snapshot of the state of the comic book industry in 1941/42. The art is crude compared to what would come later, but for every ham-fisted Johnny Thunder, there is a beautifully-rendered Hawkman or Starman story by the talented Sheldon Moldoff and Jack Burnley, respectively.Keep your eyes open for interesting signs of the times like All Star Comics #8 with the U.S. Army Air Corps logo on the front cover as well as having each member of the Justice Society integrate the war slogan \\"Keep 'em flying!\\" into their story dialogue. Issue #8 also features the first ever appearance of Wonder Woman. Also of note is issue #10 where the team travels 500 years into the future. Despite the totalitarian atmosphere and ever-present squads of flying \\"defenders\\" that arrest and imprison the JSA members, they all remark with wonder about how great the future is.Pick it up if you're a fan of Golden Age comics."},{"Title":"All Star Comics Archives, Vol. 2 (DC Archive Editions)","review":"All-Star Comics Archives Volume 2; written by Gardner F. Fox and Sheldon Mayer; illustrated by Jack Burnley, Bernard Baily, Sheldon Moldoff and others (1941-42; collected 1992): In the 1940's, the Justice Society of America (appearing in book-length adventures in All-Star Comics) was what would later be DC Comics's first group of superheroes, created in part to boost interest in the lesser-known characters of the infant DC superhero community (Superman and Batman were honourary members who didn't really participate in the adventures, while other characters that included the Flash and Green Lantern would also become honourary members once they became popular enough, though both those heroes would eventually return to active status as the superhero boom of the early 1940's started to bust at the end of World War Two).The first few appearances of the JSA involved members meeting to tell stories about recent cases. Quickly, though, All-Star Comics would showcase the evolution of the superhero group, with members first doing solo duty in individual stories oriented around a common quest and then members actually fighting together against a common foe.The main JSA members at work here include Johnny Thunder, Dr. Mid-Nite, Hawkman, Dr. Fate, the Atom, the Flash, the Spectre, and Green Lantern. We also get the first 'bonus' insert story in superhero history, as Wonder Woman gets introduced in a solo story in one issue. Eventually, the JSA would deign to make her their recording secretary, a skill I'm pretty sure life as an Amazon didn't prepare her for.In this second archive edition, the stories are firmly in the second mode, with the heroes teaming up at the end for the sake of closure. Gardner Fox and editor Shelly Mayer were inventing a sub-generic form on the fly, with no real antecedents unless you want to get goofy and claim Jason and the Argonauts as the first superhero group. Wartime concerns form the motivation for the cases in this book, as the heroes seek to raise money for European war orphans, bust saboteur rings, and secure America from aerial attack with a super-secret 'bomb shield.'This last quest -- and the last story in the book -- sees Fox finally start to write stories with a certain amount of fanciful 'oomph' to them. The JSA gets dispatched singly through a time-portal in order to retrieve plans for the bomb shield from several hundred years in the future. This allows Fox to finally play with exotic locales (cities in the sky and beneath the sea) and a certain amount of humble-pie for the JSA members, who discover that the average man of the future can mop up the floor with all but the most powerful of them.Comic-book art in the 1940's could often be pretty awful (the page rates of the time didn't exactly make for a rewarding work situation), though the craftsmanship of the artists would increase as the months flew by. Jack Burnley, a longtime 'ghost' on the Superman comics, draws the Starman episodes here with skill and a certain degree of professional slickness, while Bernard Baily on the Spectre remains one of the more idiosyncratic artists of the early Golden Age. Recommended for superhero fans."},{"Title":"All Star Comics Archives, Vol. 2 (DC Archive Editions)","review":"Quite simply the best way to live in the Golden Age of comics.

When a group of bitter soldiers stumble upon their peaceful village, they suddenly face an insidious evil ... and the ultimate test.It is then, in the midst of chaos and pain, that the Martyr's Song is first heard. It is then that the window into heaven first opens. It is then that love and beauty are shown in breathtaking reality.One of Ted Dekker's shortest works at just 111 pages, The Martyr's Song is the ultimate story of love.Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. John 15:13 [NIV]Through this very eloquent story, Dekker tells not only a story of ultimate love, but one of ultimate beauty, delivering two very critical, timely messages for our time.Young Marci is ridiculed by fellow students at her school for being ugly. When elderly Eve spies young Marci, she knows that she has to help. She knows that she has to share her story with Marci, to help Marci see her own beauty. Through Eve, we learn the story of thirteen year old Nadia, Father Michael, and how their deep love for Christ leads them both to make what for many would be an impossible decision.At just 111 pages, Martyr's Song should be read by all. We see the brutality of war, the depth of true love, and the beauty of salvation all packed into those few short pages. Kudos to Dekker for penning this touching tale!Jeff Cole is an author, blogger, and podcaster.http://www.averagejoeamerican.us"},{"Title":"The Martyr's Song - A Novel","review":"great read love all his books.... gripping novel that is full of personal trials, good verse evil, demons within us all,"},{"Title":"The Martyr's Song - A Novel","review":"This book should be read first before Heaven's Wager and When Heaven Weeps since it is referred to often in the rest of the series.

Finally, the story is just unbelievable, I cannot see an old woman walking around her house screaming \\"MARCH!\\" just because she comes across it in a story.

The whole thing about Marcia can't be resolved in a simple story telling. He doesn't realize what it's like to be a girl, to feel like you're on the outside looking in, to feel ugly. He trys, but falls short. It's hard to write from the other sex's view point, because you really can't. Girls are a lot different from boys, they're WAY more emotional. ANd the problems Marcia deals with can't be solved in an hour. The next day she has to walk back through those hallways where everyone taunts her. It's easy to feel beautiful in the safety of a room, with other people who love you. It's easy to feel \\"good\\". But those feelings drift away quickly when you step back into reality. It's not a one instance change. It takes the rest of your life. Every day yoy have to wake up, and realize you have to face the world. Realize and accept that you don't look like them. And even then, there's still so much more to deal with.So Ted Dekker, please, if you're going to write from someone's view point, why don't you go ask them what's going on rather than making up your own conclusions."},{"Title":"The Martyr's Song - A Novel","review":"I have always been a fan of Ted Dekker.

Karadzic and his men descended upon the village; Karadzic confidently, his men warily. The village would never be the same.If the story sounds familiar, and the names ring a bell, it's because the story is told in a more condensed form within When Heaven Weeps. If you've read this novel, The Martyr's Song will tell an already-told but yet brand new story of what happens when a small village is faced with the personification of evil. You'll learn how this story, impacts a girl named Marci who thinks she isn't beautiful. You'll be introduced to a bit more of side plot and back story not discussed in When Heaven Weeps. If you haven't read When Heaven Weeps, then prepare to open your eyes to see the skin beyond this world into the realer reality seen through the eyes of eternity.Karadzic orders the villagers to carry their crosses--huge gravestone crosses--on their backs. If God is with them, God will save them. If they drop their cross, the priest will die. But one young girl, Nadia, cannot bear to see the cruelty and speaks out, teaching us all a lesson about life, love, and a craving for Heaven. Amidst chaos and pain, The Martyr's Song cries out in the tiny Bosnian village. But it is a song of victory, a song that opens the gates of Heaven, a song that shows love and beauty in all its breathtaking reality."},{"Title":"The Martyr's Song - A Novel","review":"This small book provides background information for Ted Dekker's Heaven trilogy, _Heaven's Wager_, Heaven Weeps_, and _Thunder of Heaven_. The book fills in a lot of details to which Dekker reveals in the three books. Throughout the book there is an intimate sense of the presence of Heaven in all our lives. This is a story of sacrifice without regret and of the costliness of redemption for all of us. As Dietrich Bonhoeffer wrote, Grace is not cheap, it cost God the life of His son. I recommend this book and the trilogy for which it is a prequel. The four books inspired me to a closer walk with God."},{"Title":"The Martyr's Song - A Novel","review":"Friend of mine wrote a song to go with this book, and it's in the inside cover.

In it he tries to give a \\"real-life\\" example of what it means to delight in Heaven, in the world to come.The story is very interesting and often heart-wrenching. Some of the main characters give their lives valiantly for the truth and show what it means to \\"love not your life unto death\\". I recommend it above most other fiction that's available out there. It should encourage you.That being said, the one thing this book won't do is clearly share the Gospel with you. Dekker favors language about having a loving relationship with God over actually explaining what Christ did for us on the cross and what we must believe in order to be saved. The book would be much better (and infinitely more helpful for unbelievers) if he talked about both."},{"Title":"The Martyr's Song - A Novel","review":"\\"The Martyr's Song\\" is basically a reprint of the first part of Dekker's masterful novel, \\"When Heaven Weeps\\". While the story is compelling (a priest is martyred in a small Bosnian village), I'm not sure what the purpose of reprinting it this way could be. While there is a new bookend story featuring Eve from WHW, I can't say it warranted an entire novella. There's not a lot added to the core story itself, and WHW did a much better job of resolving everything with the last half of the book. Readers choosing this one over the other might be robbed of the emotional impact found at the conclusion of the original. If you've read \\"When Heaven Weeps\\", you really aren't going to miss much by skipping this one. If you haven't read WHW, I'd suggest going for that one instead of this one.

I definitely will do so now though.This is a story that is set in two different time periods. Part of it is set in Bosnia during WWII and part of it is 20 years later relating the events of the earlier period to a young girl who is struggling with being tormented by high school peers.The Bosnia part is a portrayal of Christian martyrdom that is both painful and beautiful. The 1960s part is both of those as well and contains some powerful truths that the girl can relate to her life to help her understand what is really important and enduring.I think this book would be a great gift for any young girl who is struggling with the issues mentioned above. I also think it is a good read in general. For me, it was kind of a teaser. It whetted my appetite to read the other books in this series. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Martyr's Song - A Novel","review":"Great book! Not for the weak of heart. Ted Dekker does a masterful job of using the art of storytelling to communicate some of the greatest truths about love, reality, and eternity. Attaching the CD with \\"The Martyr's Song\\" was a great idea; it was very creative and really enhanced the impact of the story. On a side note: I noticed that some other reviewers gave this book low marks because it was a shorter version of a story told in another book.

To me, it felt like a replay of a true story from Jesus Freaks or Fox's book of Martyrs, only with much more detail. Dekker does an excellent job of sucking you into the story, though I think he could have just used the Bosnia story by itself and accomplished even more (drop the outer story and go for the meat.) At any rate, this story made me address some questions about how far I would go if needed, and I felt inspired to reach for a new level in my faith. In that respect this story held real value, and for that, I'm thankful. It's definitely not the same old...same old...But, in my opinion, it was a bit too short. I would have liked to have read more about the torturers' responses to the priest's death and how it changed them, especially the writer of the novel Eve had read, rather than just hearing it from her. But that's just me."},{"Title":"The Martyr's Song - A Novel","review":"Well, the conclusion of \\"The Martyr's Song\\" is a breezy one indeed, and some might say has sadly come to an end.

Let me tell you this, it is beautiful! When my own daughter at nearly 19 months old attempted to sing this, WOW, it does have an impact.Take a journey with Marci. Enter a flower shop. Be drawn in with a story. Allow yourself to listen to the laughter, allow yourself to embrace the heartache, along with the triumph that follows! Watch something that has been beautiful since day one, discover for herself that she is indeed beautiful!Ted Dekker created a masterpiece with 3 books, and now a 4th novella has emerged. This is what made Ted Dekker who he is, and nobody can debate that.We as Christians can continue this story so graciously as Ivena did with young Marci, and simply pass the story on, and share it with others.

Made to feel inadequate?In the opening chapter of The Martyr's Song, we meet Marci, a girl who knows first-hand what it means to feel rejected. With lowered eyes, she forces herself forward, through the crowd and toward the school building and her locker. The new skirt she had saved up for months to buy no longer gave her the courage she had hoped for. Instead she is met with taunting comments.\\"Nice skirt.\\"\\"You wearing that dress tonight?\\"Nothing they could say could embarrass her any further. Of the entire eleventh grade, she was the only one not invited to tonight's party.\\"Please, she isn't even going. And if she showed up in that, we'd have to lock her in the bathroom to keep the boys from throwing up.\\"They skip away, leaving behind painful wounds and an empty school.As she stands in the vacant school hallway, a woman approaches. \\"Come to my flower shop tomorrow, and I will make you beautiful,\\" the woman promises.Marci is stung by the woman's words, angered that even this stranger has the nerve to call her \`ugly'. The next day Marci does go to the flower shop, not to let the woman \`make her beautiful' but to tell the woman exactly what she thinks of her, and her offer.But when Marci arrives at the shop, she discovers that the woman, Eve, wasn't talking about physical beauty, or even inner beauty.Eve tells Marci that true beauty will come to her only when she embraces a long-forgotten story. Eve then tells Marci the story of Father Michael and thirteen-year-old Nadia, a child considered ugly with her coarse looks, blotchy freckles, and left leg two inches shorter than her right.And so begins Dekker's story within a story, a retelling of a tale contained in the opening pages of Ted Dekker's When Heaven Weeps, the second title of his earlier Martyr's Song series.The story is set in war torn Bosnia, in the 1940s. A group of soldiers, lead by Commander Karadzic, comes across a small village, untouched by the combat that surrounds it. Karadzic is intent on restoring Serbia, purging anyone he doesn't consider a good Serb, especially Franciscans who approved the murder of hundreds of thousands of Serbs by Yugoslavia's Ustashe army.Unable to understand why this church remains standing when all the others within a hundred kilometres have been burned to the ground, Karadzic becomes convinced it is a Franciscan church, protected by the Ustashe. When he finds Father Michael and the remaining villagers in the church courtyard celebrating Nadia's birthday, he decides to put the villagers' faith to the test, with deadly results.As Karadzic's inhuman game unfolds, readers glimpse life beyond the present through the eyes of Father Michael. The skin of this world peels away to reveal the world that awaits; a world full of laughter and a song that caresses the soul. A world where Nadia is beautiful.By the time Eve finishes the story, Marci knows a secret that will change her life forever. She learns that in the eyes of heaven we are all beautiful, even her.The Martyr's Song, poignant in its first telling within When Heaven Weeps, is even more so in this novella which includes a CD of a song performed by Todd Agnew and co-written by Agnew and Dekker exclusively for this book. A list of discussion questions at the back of the book draws readers deeper into the book's theme. Dekker invites us to search our souls and discover if we are in true anticipation of heaven, or simply enamored with our temporal life on earth.This book struck my heart in a powerful way. Like Marci, I struggled with feelings of insignificance, and fought to fit in when considered the \`outsider'. Unlike Marci, I didn't have an Eve in my life to teach me what every child in this situation needs to learn.I believe this book is a must read for any teenager who struggles with issues of self-worth, or who faces peer pressure to conform to today's standards. Once more Dekker reaches out through story to expand our imagination and teach a timeless message. Once more I have been changed as a result.Featured by World Vision during its 30 Hour Famine campaign, THE MARTYR'S SONG is set to reach the youth of today with a powerful message to love all that cross our path."},{"Title":"The Martyr's Song - A Novel","review":"The setting: Atlanta, Georgia. The year: 1964. An elderly woman approaches a typical, non-descript high school on a seemingly non-consequential errand. Oblivious to the students standing around the school, and with a will of its own reckoning, Eve's thoughts turn to a scene in Bosnia many years earlier. She has recounted these ominous words so many times that they've become part of her body and soul. Its recollection is a scene of impending disaster, terror even, yet Eve is compelled to relive its memory time and again. Shaken to the present by someone's shout, Eve is drawn back to the moment as she remembers the reason for her presence in this schoolyard: the delivery of a dozen rare roses. And still, there's more here --- a deeper, more beckoning call. Eve spots her, and the likeness is uncanny. It can't be...and yet it is. Who is that girl and what is her story?Marci, a high school junior, stands rooted to the spot, paralyzed by fear. If she moves, she loses. If she stands still, she loses. It doesn't matter what Marci does. She's a loser, and the whole school knows it, confirming it with every callous, cutting remark. Yet no one can remain inert forever, and so Marci summons what meager resource of courage she has and enters the school. The taunting is merciless and the humiliation now complete.With her roses Eve approaches Marci, and to the already emotionally damaged girl speaks the words aloud that Marci has been replaying her entire life: \\"You hate yourself because you don't think you're beautiful, is that it?\\" In the next moment, Eve offers an invitation of a lifetime: \\"Come to my flower shop tomorrow, and I will make you beautiful.\\" How could she? Marci ranted, anger now swelling. How could this stranger be so cruel? And yet, the next morning, there she stands at the old woman's flower shop. And after a short attempt at spewing vindictives, Marci accepts Eve's invitation to be transformed and made beautiful.Eve opens the door to her home. The gauntlet is laid down, and the real story now begins. Eve tells Marci to listen carefully and discover which of the tale's characters she is. Marci is in the story --- there's no doubt --- but she must pay close attention to discern the truth of it and the mystery it holds. Eve's mental recitation from the day before is the same as the opening words to the book she now shares with Marci. This is the story of five ruthless, desperate soldiers, and a small town filled with women, children, and their beloved priest.On this particular day, 13-year-old Nadia was celebrating her birthday with those who made up her corner of the world. Father Michael --- he with his hunched back, tender in his concern for Nadia, with her plain looks and disfigured leg (due to polio) --- was the first to notice the soldiers' approach. His spirit clenched and he prayed, \\"Dear Father, protect us.\\" It wasn't long before mercy deserted the scene and the soldiers followed the orders of their crazed inhumane leader to carry out unspeakable acts of cruelty. Nadia's secret wish was that these soldiers would not ruin her birthday party; little did she know how eternity would enter the formerly picturesque scene.Eve continues to turn pages while speaking and remembering. Marci listens, then understands and believes. The truth is haunting and the song piercing. It is true. Eve has accomplished the unimaginable --- Marci is now beautiful. It's a miracle. Still, both Eve and Marci have paid dearly for the change. Lives have been sacrificed and torn asunder. Yet there is a promise to be embraced, shared, and bestowed. It is enough, and really more than enough.--- Reviewed by Michele Howe"},{"Title":"The Martyr's Song - A Novel","review":"_The Martyr's Song_ is pure and simple, Ted Dekker at his best. The story is riveting and moving. It's a novella, so you can read the whole book in one sitting, but its punch far outweighs its length. Get it, read it, be moved by it. Dekker writes with passion and the reader can feel it. By the way, the Todd Agnew song on the CD it comes with is great, too. You'll listen to it over and over again."},{"Title":"The Martyr's Song - A Novel","review":"The Martyr's Song is the last of four in a series. Each one stands on its own but the last, The Martyr's Song, is where the first ones began.Ted Dekker applies the command in Luke 9:23-27 to unimaginable circumstances in a Bosnian village at the end WWII--the physical act of taking up a cross to save the ones you love.The book shifts time frames between the devilish acts of a Serbian commander and his soldiers who've stumbled on to a village of believers and 1960's America where an elderly woman shares a story so transforming it has the power to physically change ugly to beautiful.There's no doubt who the commander follows, as he declares \\"Christ was a fool. Now he's a dead fool,\\" and taunts the villagers to call on Him to save them. There's also no doubt who the villagers serve as they glimpse the promised world beyond this one.I can't remember the last time my faith was so impacted by a work of fiction! The Martyr's Song casts a shadow as long as Christ's on the cross, with hope in portions only God can provide.Contained in a plastic envelope at the back of the book is a CD of the song, The Martyr's Song performed by Todd Agnew as well as an interview with the author.Armchair Interviews says: In addition to this being a very impacting read, the author has also provided a study guide appropriate for spurring discussion in bible study or secular reading groups or for your own personal reflection."},{"Title":"Qualitative elemental analysis","review":"This is an excellent book on inorganic chemical analysis before the days of million dollar instrumentation.Very concise with clear guidelines and with enough theory to understand the recommendations.

Perhaps the greatest revelation to me was that many are confused about the meaning of sexual \\"abstinence,\\" thinking it refers only to refraining from coitus. The book also supplies interesting tidbits about condoms and condom-related behavior.My biggest complaints are not so big: charts using three-dimensional bars rather than two-dimensional bars are unfortunate (see Edward R.

Reading more like an extended fanzine article than full-fledged bio, author David Konow gives readers an engaging tour of Adamson's career as a director of low-brow, low-budget movies that his partner Sam Sherman (whose recollections make up the bulk of this book) booked in drive-ins during the 1960s and '70s. Konow's affection for his subject is contagious as he giddily tells of the making of \\"Satan's Sadists,\\" \\"Dracula vs. Frankenstein\\" and the incoherent \\"Blood of Ghastly Horror\\" (essentially three different movies patched together). Self-identified horror fan Konow gives short shrift to Adamson's forays into sexploitation and blaxploitation, however, offering anemic two and three paragraph synopses to such films as \\"Angel's Wild Women\\" and \\"The Black Samurai\\" and very little background about the making of these movies. In fact, \\"Schlock-o-Rama\\" offers very little insight to what made Adamson, who was murdered in the mid-90s, tick. Konow includes a lot of redundant quotes, \\"sidebars\\" that could just as well been part of the main text and is overly fond of exclamation points. But while his writing lacks sophistication, Konow's enthusiasm for the amiable director who loved Kentucky Fried Chicken and his wife and frequent star Regina Carrol, makes \\"Schlock-o-Rama\\" a worthwhile textbook for all fans of trash cinema."},{"Title":"Schlock-O-Rama: The Films of Al Adamson","review":"David Konow gives the fans of Mr. Adamson what they want in this book. He was able to meet Al and set his story straight and put it in a good-looking-easy-to-read fashion.

My favorite book."},{"Title":"Schlock-O-Rama: The Films of Al Adamson","review":"If famed director Roger Corman was the King of the Bs thanks to his low-budget favorites, then Al Adamson was the Sultan of the Zs, a filmmaker who devoted a career to bargain basement productions. David Konow provides an overview of the filmmaker's often hard-edged drive-in favorites from the 1960s, '70s and early 80s. Those titles include Satan's Sadists, Dracula vs. Frankenstein, The Naughty Stewardesses. Colonel Sanders of Kentucky Fried Chicken fame appeared in Hell's Bloody Devils. None of Al's films made the AFI list of the greatest 100 movies. Al's female films were groundbreaking for their strong roles for women. Al's women were tough; they were not victims. Men were the enemy and were often branded and killed like animals..

The golden age (ahem) of micro-focused film studies, outside of the ususal high-budget/high-gloss realm, is in full swing, and Adamson's films can lay some claim to personifying the basis of such writings. Sure, this critical sub-genre is motivated as much by nostalgia as anything else, but it has a place in the body of work detailing film history. So does Adamson.Konow's book, a work of clear adoration, sidesteps overt critical intent; the author presents a combined personal reflection and verbal history of Adamson's movies and his era. It works on a sheer fan basis, and fans (I'm one) will appreciate the glee and the inside information. If we leave wanting more, we must ask ourselves: Does the world really need two books on Al Adamson? Well, sure - why not? The only thing we have to lose is... paper.

For instance, when's the last time you read an interview with \`70s exploitation film star Sondra Currie? . . . this is a valuable, intriguing book, worthhile for its earnest collected voices and the portait that emerges not only of the late Adamson, who was murdered in 1995, but of the fiercely independent spirit that drove his filmmaking.

The book appears to be a very condensed version of Jackson's life. If all you need is a basic outline this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Thomas J. Stonewall Jackson","review":"Although this book was a good read when I used it as the basis for a paper in seventh grade, I reread it again after studying more about \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, and found this to be very inaccuarate. Either Bronwyn Mills did not study that much about him, or she read all the \\"Politically Correct\\" info about him. Some of the inaccuracies I noticed:1) The book states that General Richard S. Ewell was killed at Second Manassas. In truth, Ewell was wounded, and lost a leg. This is false because Ewell took command of half of Jackson's Corps after his death, and his command led to disaster at Gettysburg.2) The book states that Cavalry General J.E.B. Stuart was killed on May 12, two days after Jackson. In truth, Stuart did die on that date, but it was May 12, 1864, over two YEARS after Jackson's death.3) The book suggested that Jackson was for slavery, and felt that the blacks were a bunch of murderous types. This is totally false! Jackson was very uncompfortable with slavery. But his beliefs were that everything was a part of God's will, and knew that slavery would be abolished, but in God's time. One thing not mentioned much is the fact that Jackson sent in funds to aid in the creation of a Sunday School for African Americans, and he regularly went there to see how things were going, and even joined in prayer services there.In short, this book mostly conforms to the \\"Politically Correct\\" version of \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson. If you want the truth, read James I. Robertson's Biography, and see the film \\"Gods and Generals.\\" Grade: D+"},{"Title":"Marine Atlas, Volume II","review":"Well,I own the german original edition of this book,which I got before it was released in english,but it\`s the same book. I can still read some german - it\`s an easy language to understand.Anyway,I prefer to write a review in english.When I got the first book about two or three years ago,I thought there was something missing. There was only fishes of the order Perciformes,and the only invertebrates included were crustaceans and some anemones. I thought that was very strange. As there was some trouble when making this massive seven-book series,the second volume should have included other fish,but instead,here comes the missed invertebrates. It begins with a lot of sponges.Although care advices are beeing given,sponges are NOT recommended as aquarium animals,due to their feeding habits. Therefore,all of them has a high difficult grade. But if you shall go diving in the caribbean or something,it could be valueable as a marine life identification guide.The next chapter are treating the missing cnidarians from the first book,with stony corals and soft corals,and even some jellyfish!This section is taking up almost the half of the book,but as the corals is a rather dominating group of marine animals,that is completley understandable. Practical advice are beeing given for all of them. After reading it,I would mostly recommend the leather corals as suitable aquarium animals. Forget the jellyfish. The stony corals often have beautifull shapes but they\`re not very colourfull. After this huge chapter,the next animal group dealt with are the flatworms. We often think of worms as disgusting animals,but these are very beutifull,but difficult too keep in an aquarium as they eat sponges. They are often mistaken for sea snails,but they have no gills on their back. Also included are the comb jellyfishes,a rare group of pelagic sea animals related to jellyfishes.The final chapter are dealing with the molluscs,a very diverse group of marine animals. Here,we can see mostly shells of different kinds,and they are very beautifull and varied. Especially the small,but incredible section for nudibranchs. Some of these shells,altough not the cowries,can be kept in a marine aquarium very easily. So far,this book has been a valueable resource for me,as it has so many species included. Do not forget to buy the first and third volume,while volume 4-7 are additional species introduced. I do not own volume 5,but I\`ll get that some time too. But so far,volume 1,2,3,4,6 &amp; 7 are the BEST marine life identification guides available!"},{"Title":"Marine Atlas, Volume II","review":"A good book if you are a diver and collect your own specimens and need to identify them, Pictures are well done and in color and makes for good and enjoyable reading. The chart at the bottom shows a nice table for suggesting watermovement, temperature range, difficulty factor for raising, availability in the trade.I give it one star because although nicely done 90% of the speciments pictures are listed as unavailable to the trade or protected species and unavailable. 90% are also recommended for people with at least two years of marine experience. It was written at a college level as to a lot of the terms. To be fair I believe two items were listed as a difficulty level of one (snails) and maybe three or four in the level three catagory. Level 4 being the highest degree of difficulty.There is not very much for a beginner or intermediate aquarist looking for things to add to their aquarium since they are listed as unavailable. It would of been much better if it had listed more items readily available and in the easy to moderate range of difficulty. I would not recommend this book to anyone trying to find, identify, or purchase items for an aquarium, especially beginners. For the advanced marine aquarist it has some beautiful pictures and info.However this was an atlas and not necessarily intended for aquarium buffs."},{"Title":"Fateful Harvest: The True Story of a Small Town, a Global Industry, and a Toxic Secret","review":"My eyes raced through Duff Wilson's \\"Fateful Harvest\\" spotting characters I know from an issue with which I have been acquainted for some time.

Patty, snarfing out the truth about hazardous waste being turned into fertilizer as doggedly as Hercule Poirot unknowingly crosses paths with a toxic issue in Missouri.Leslie Warden, stubborn like Patty, is trying to save the people in her town, where the Doe Run a lead smelter is contaminating the homes and may be contributing to the early deaths of the people in Herculaneum.When I read in \\"Fateful Harvest\\" that \\"baghouse dust\\" being used to make fertilizer, my heart sank to below my feet. A baghouse is a filter for a smelter to trap fugitive dust particles of lead, cadmium, arsenic, zinc and other heavy metals. The smelter has other \\"waste products\\" like black acid, a witches brew of sulfuric acid and heavy metals. Doe Run just about gives this away to Frit Industries in Walnut Ridge, Arkansas. Bingo! This company that Leslie and others are fighting because it's poisoning their town is suddenly in the middle of Patty Martin's fight. She is trying to convince the American people that Doe Run and a myriad of other dirty businesses are solving their toxic waste disposal problems by feeding it to all of us. If that is not the most stupid idea, a more hideously stupid one is that the EPA and Congress are allowing this to go on. It is totally LEGAL!!!The Doe Run and Frit connection is only one of many.

What's most scary to me is that the scandal is still going on! -- toxic waste is called &quot;fertilizer,&quot; then dumped on farm land; but the politicians shrug while lives are destroyed. Wilson, an experienced investigative reporter, does a great job of distilling the science (and the politics) behind the news story. He effectively weaves the crucial discoveries of an unlikely rural heroine into the larger perspective. Believe it or not, there's even humor in the absurdity.

Since that time little has changed and few states have initiated laws regulating the so-called recycling of hazardous waste by calling it fertilizer and selling it to an unsuspecting public, farmers and gardeners alike. It has become a way of life in a world overflowing with hazardous waste and overfull landfills. Deciding just how much build up of hazardous metals and other wastes, the citizenry of the planet can tolerate in their diets is the rationale the EPA operates by. I wish I could say I too am hopeful, but like a dead canary in a coal mine, the planet keeps sending signals through the likes of mass bird deaths, bee colony collapse, deformed fish, contaminated foods and polluted waters and soils, to let us know that this does not bode well for our future.

In this impressive work of muckracking journalism, the author tells the story of Patty Martin, Dennis DeYoung, and the various other protagonists and antagonists set in Quincy, Washington. Mayor Martin begins to notice in the 1990s that some of the farmers in her town are suffering sudden, catastrophic failurs of crops and livestock deaths. Many of these failures share similar symptoms. She and some others in this small town also notice that individuals within their community are falling sick and dying from rare diseases and cancers. Thru hard work, personal charisma, patience, and a bit of paranoia, the mayor and some friends begin to piece together a picture of how companies sell toxic waste to fertilizer companies, which in turn sell them to farmers. In essence, they hope that the solution to pollution is dilution. And it is all entirely legal according to federal and many state laws. Mayor Martin and her friends; who call themselves the Water Group, start to publicize this knowledge and challenge the practices. In return, they get ostracized by their fellow citizens, their former friends, even their own family members.In steps Duff Wilson of the Seattle Times. Suddenly this story picks up traction in the national press and government regulators come calling. The ensuing revelations show that this practice is actually well-known within the EPA and government circles, but they in effect obey industry. The amount of money saved by companies, both the fertilizer companies and the original generators of the toxic waste, are too much to turn down for many companies.Because of the press, some charges are filed and some fines are levied. A happy ending you suppose? No, Mayor Martin loses re-election; her allies in Quincy suffer bankrupties, social isolation, some move away to other states, and others just plain give up the struggle. Cenex is the primary culprit in the case of Quincy, but there is enough blame to go around. Many of the locals don't want to hear any word of this because they fear it will damage their livelihoods as farmers. Some get retribution in return. Several of Martin's critics and enemies and some of the primary defenders of Cenex within the community start falling sick from rare illnesses and die.

I was previously of the opinion that &quot;all that bad toxic waste stuff&quot; used to happen when I was a kid! RCRA, CERCLIS, and the NPL Superfund Program, to me, symbolized a change in the way companies dealt with waste. There was an unprecedented enforcement of laws enacted to stop big industry and small-time polluters from engaging in unhealthy practices. Add my naivity about current practices to the fact that I am currently an environmental consultant (although one who mostly deals with petroleum issues)and you can see my frustration. I am frustrated for the protagonist becuase I would have felt the same things as she, but I would've fought my battle with more science and less rhetoric. Less emotional, more methodical. Yet, that doesn't make her battle any less real or worth fighting. If it hasn't already begun, then this book will instigate and generate REAL tox studies, REAL reporting, and non-partisan results. We will start to see legitimate fate and transport models of heavy metals through soil, roots, and into food. Hopefully, the inorganic fertilizer makers who prefer to keep ethics in their lives and heavy metals out of their fertilizers, will become models of their industry. Good luck!"},{"Title":"Fateful Harvest: The True Story of a Small Town, a Global Industry, and a Toxic Secret","review":"Very intriguing book about the unregulated fertilizer industries. Dilution, the real solution to pollution? This book will make you mad and rightly so. Patty dedicates everything to reveal the truth. People, animals, our lands, are becoming ill, and the cover-ups that go along with this knowledge will make you think. If you buy gypsum or vermiculite even labeled natural, the fact of certain rare diseases prominent in farming communities and their children, the science that has been proved, will keep you suspiciously fascinated.

Lay people who agree with the book's thesis are quoted liberally.By the time I got to the Brahma bull that calved (bulls don't bear offspring, folks)on page 44, I was convinced of only one thing: this book cannot deliver on its publisher's hype.Disappointing."},{"Title":"Fateful Harvest: The True Story of a Small Town, a Global Industry, and a Toxic Secret","review":"A book is a terrible thing to waste. This is an example of American &quot;journalism&quot; at its worst -- a crusading reporter picks a side, does all he can to discredit anybody who offers contrary evidence, and uses his position and reporting to gather intelligence for those he has joined.The thesis is &quot;hazardous&quot; waste is used to make fertilizer that corrupts our food supply. Yet no reporting is done on the toxicology of the &quot;hazards&quot; involved. A description of potential health effects of the metals involved and in what doses those hazards might occur would have added some substance.Words and concepts not understood by the author were merely denigrated. For instance, while the concept of &quot;agronomic&quot; rates of nutrients is important to farmers trying to raise a crop, the author simply derides the use of this word, and never attempts to define or explain it.Worst of all, this book is poorly and sophomorically written. Despite my intense interest in the subject matter, it was a real struggle to read through this book. A real opportunity to educate the public was given up for the chance to try to scare the public.The only honest admission came in the epilogue, where the author stated his commitment to the precautionary principle while deriding the concept of risk assessment. Risk assessment is a fundamental regulatory tool used in our country to make judgements about the safety of products and practices -- but explaining that seemed too hard for this author, who resorted merely to denigrating ideas and people he didn't agree with.If you don't like science and don't mind facts being jettisoned in an attempt to make a good story, you might try this book."},{"Title":"Fateful Harvest: The True Story of a Small Town, a Global Industry, and a Toxic Secret","review":"Duff Wilson can create a drama, and can paint the &quot;good vs evil&quot; scenario very well, and develop and animate characters.

If anyone takes this book seriously, and is genuinely scared about the health risk of North American food, please look into the true facts behind this or any other similar fear mongering story.

The zinger was, as Wilson discovered, it was entirely legal!Imagine this: big industrial companies, growing increasingly displeased with having to pay for the cost of disposing of their hazardous waste materials, typically with unsafe amounts of heavy metals, find through a loophole in the law that they can declare the waste a \\"product\\" and sell it as fertilizer! Instead of paying perhaps a hundred dollars a barrel to get rid of the stuff, they can sell it to firms that add a little lime or some other soil conditioner and abracadabra! peddle it as fertilizer. Sound like a Greenpeace scare story? A nightmare dreamed up by disgruntled employees? \\"Bad\\" farmers looking to blame somebody for their failed Frankenfeed crops? The fertilizer industry would like us to think so, but this story about Patty Martin and her brave and lonely crusade against the dumping of hazard waste on farmlands tells us otherwise.The terrible thing is that, although Wilson's original story, \\"Fear in the Fields--How Hazardous Wastes Become Fertilizer,\\" first appeared in July of 1997, as the book closes in 2001, the loophole in the law has not been plugged, congress has not acted, and the polluters are still turning hazardous waste infused with cadmium, lead, arsenic, etc., into stuff smeared on farmlands. It gets into the crops farmers grow and ends up in the food on our dining room tables. It blows off the fields when it's dry and into the lungs of people. The workers in these fertilizer plants have elevated levels of cancer and lung scaring disease, and the sad thing is some of them are so wedded to the company that they are blind to what is destroying their bodies.Wilson names names and gives examples. He cites the chemical analyses and he quotes the industry apologists and the look-the-other-way bureaucrats in the oversight agencies. But clearly the real culprits are those people at the top of our state and federal governments who are doing nothing stop this dangerous pollution.This is the kind of story that'll make you hopping mad and wonder about the morality (and sanity) of people who would, to save a few bucks on the bottom line, poison us, themselves and our children."},{"Title":"Fateful Harvest: The True Story of a Small Town, a Global Industry, and a Toxic Secret","review":"It is simple.

I was more blown away by 'Fateful Harvest' than by 'A Civil Action' or 'Erin Brockovich'.

What's most scary is that the scandal is still going on! -- toxic waste is turned into fertilizer, and spread on the food supply; but the politicians shrug while lives are destroyed. Wilson, an experienced investigative reporter, does a great job of distilling the science (and the politics) behind the news story. He effectively weaves the life of an unlikely small-town heroine into the larger perspective. It's definitely a compelling and accessible read.

It makes no difference how nasty or radioactive the mix, the minute it is mixed with fillers and placed in a bag with a fertilizer or soil amendments label the industries were home free--no regulation, no problem. It is certainly curious that it took so long for this to come out. There is an international treaty to prevent toxic waste dumping abroad that the U.S. has not signed. After the treaty was created Greenpeace activists noticed that the definition of \\"hazardous waste\\" was changed. \\"In other words rather than trying to eliminate hazardous wastes, governments are trying to eliminate hazardous waste definitions.\\" The story broke, though, not because of some international activist organization, but because the bright and persistent mayor of a small agricultural town with a fertilizer plant was concerned about the health of local school children. By the time the townspeople demanded that she shut up, it was too late, the press was on the scene. Recounting this much of the adventure takes us about two-thirds of the way through the book. From there on the author carries on alone moving from the local level to the national level. His newly developed sources confirmed that this was not just a local problem of renegade \\"recylcers\\" near Hanford Washington, but a nationwide set of standard operating procedures uniformly practiced by the largest U.S. Corporations. The next step was not too hard, the author went to a home and garden store down the street, bought twenty kinds of fertilizer and had them analyzed for fourteen toxic metals. He went to the companies that made the really toxic ones like NuLife and Ironite. NuLife was so toxic it would have to be disposed of in a fenced landfill with double plastic lining, until, that is, it was labeled as fertilizer, then it could go in a child's sandbox. A Washington state warning bulletin was issued concerning Ironite. Five of the fertilizers tested \\"cleaner in toxic metals that the background level in the soil\\" including MiracleGro. The test results are listed on www.seattletimes.com as part of his first article. The press services carried it, the New York Times ignored it. Heavy metals do not biodegrade, they bioaccumulate. The land get sicker and sicker each year until the land is barren as happened to some farmers in the Mayor's town. This toxicity induce immune deficiency diseases that are reinforced year after year. Hundreds of companies legally dump hundreds of millions of pounds of toxics via the fertilizer backdoor. Lead content in fertilizer, for example, may be one hundred times what would be considered safe if measured in residential. One pilot study found that 14 million pounds of this waste is carcinogenic. The biggest offenders were Frit Industries (a Superfund site) and Bay Zinc. Richard Camp, Jr who owns Bay Zinc now has to duck catcalls of \\"baby murderer.\\" Also W.R.Grace&Co. sells vermiculite which contains eighty times the amount of asbestos allowable by worker safety standards. When the mayor was voted out, they did the State of Washington a big favor, now she can work full time with activists at a higher level to bring change. Washington became the first state in the nation to have a (watered down to be less than Canadian standards) law that monitors, regulates and labels fertilizers. If you have internet access you can read the labels on-line at www.wa.gov/agr/. If you happen to be in a store reading the label to make a buying decision, too bad, no information is required there. \\"What should be done next? I think we need real oversight and testing and disclosure and change. Part of the answer may be found in nature. Why not seek to remove the toxins as our legacy to the land, or at the very least, limit them to the natural background level of the soil? Roughly a third of our fertilizers would pass that test today. What is sold as fertilizer simply ought to be cleaner than dirt.\\" The book is well-footnoted and has a quality index. It is well-paced with lots of human interest too.

In any event, it's obvious that we ought not to be taking toxic waste collected from smokestacks and dumping it on the food supply.

So it becomes obvious that the negative reviews written here are likely from industry dogs.Government officials who first ignored the findings and claims of PATTY MARTIN in Quincy, Washington were simply following the bureaucratic pattern of ignorance and non-action. But an unrelenting MARTIN and others held their ground and the chemical companies like CENEX were caught with conclusive evidence of their crimes.

Dust masks are be mandatory just to handle many such formulations.Most farmers, consumers, and regulators have no idea these toxins are being plowed into the soil.

Taking cues from more recent scholarship (including an admitted debt to Natalie Davis), Diefendorf states in her introduction that she is specifically writing to refute an earlier analysis of the French Wars of Religion. Previously seen through the lens of political history, the Wars of Religion had been examined as the violent manifestation of political conflicts among the French nobility, with religion being used merely as a convenient \\"cover story\\" as nobles attempted to buck the authority of the monarchy. In contrast, five of Diefendorf's ten chapters deal with explicitly religious themes, almost to the exclusion of the politics of the high court. Although she states that she feels she has tried to walk the middle ground between the traditionalist political history and a too-radical confessional narrative, there can be no doubt that Diefendorf sees the conflicts in mid-sixteenth century Paris as almost entirely religious.The book's organization is straight forward and the writing is lively. Chapters are devoted to descriptions of the physical and social milieu of Paris, the public practice of Catholicism, clear narratives of the civil wars of religion that wracked France from 1557 to 1572, and the events of the massacre itself. Diefendorf devotes the last third of the book to analysis of her central themes: the structure of the Reformed church within Paris; the most powerful (if not the most openly advertised) beliefs and practices of the Protestants; the venomous preaching of fire-brand Catholic priests against the heretics (and also against those who would tolerate heresy, including the king!); and the culpability of the civil militias and the citizens of Paris in the massacre.Diefendorf's main thesis is that the actions of all sides in the conflict, from the viciousness of Catholic massacre participants to the almost bovine stoicism of Protestants who simply refused to renounce their religion or home city, were the result of religious faith. The inextricably linked fusion of municipal, monarchical, and ecclesiastical authority that was the chief attribute of Parisian Catholicism convinced faithful Catholics of the rightness of their cause, supported by their community, their king, and their God. At the same time, Protestant devotion to particular aspects of their confession, especially a fascination with the Davidic Psalms and the message encoded therein, bolstered the faith of this extremely persecuted minority, to the point that one marvels that there were still Protestants left in Paris to massacre in August of 1572. Diefendorf argues that religious principles were \\"real\\" enough to serve as the primary impetus for Catholic and Protestant actions, against the conventional perspective of the animating power of politics. Careful to illustrate the political consequences of religiously-inspired actions, Diefendorf does indeed manage to tread the middle ground and provides her readers with a successful portrait of Catholic and Protestant clashes in sixteenth century Paris."},{"Title":"Beneath the Cross: Catholics and Huguenots in Sixteenth-Century Paris","review":"Diefendorf's work shines as an excellent book on the battle between the Catholics and the Hugenots in 16th Century Paris. She has clearly done a lot of work on the subject. While the book can be long winded at times, she tries to keep the reader interested with many anecdotes. Truly a fantastic work. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Calvinist or Catholic history or to anyone interested in French history."},{"Title":"Beneath the Cross: Catholics and Huguenots in Sixteenth-Century Paris","review":"In Beneath the Cross, Barbara Diefendorf clearly, eloquently, and persuasively argues that the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre must be examined not as an isolated incident, rather through the illuminating lens of the religious wars of the preceding 15 years to more completely understand the horrific events of 24 August 1572 and to properly place them within France's complex political, social, and religious sixteenth-century history.Traditional histories of the event fail to appreciate the city of Paris (and the larger French population) as inextricably bound together in \\"the body social, the body politic, and the body of Christ\\"-each corps mutually affirmed through \\"civic, monarchial, and Catholic symbols.\\"Diefendorf's broader scope illuminates the gradual weakening of the societal triad under the strains of deepened resilience of Calvinists that encouraged their increasing number; radical preaching that steered (a portion of) the predominantly Catholic population toward salvific violence; extremist militia members that exploited civic authority to carry out religious retribution; and royal efforts at moderation that fueled fanaticism.Beneath the Cross also argues that the massacre, despite the orthodox depiction as a calculated consequence, resulted from the limited call by the king for the assassination of Huguenot leaders that mixed with (at least15) years of Catholic fear of a Protestant takeover; disparate views of heresy between commoners and magistrates; and a faithful response to calls to manifest God's justice upon heretics that culminated in the slaughter of Protestants.Paris-site of the royal court, a strong judicial apparatus, the University, predominant Catholic parishes, the Reformed Church, plagues, and famines-grabs and maintains center stage throughout the book.Beneath the Cross is a must-read for the novice, scholar, or admirer of French religious history. Diefendorf's work is an exemplar for clarity of argument, integrity of narrative, and precision of analysis."},{"Title":"Beneath the Cross: Catholics and Huguenots in Sixteenth-Century Paris","review":"What was the role of popular religious sentiment in the infamous massacre of Huguenots on St. Bartholomew's Day in 1572? According to Barbara Diefendorf, traditional historiography has focused almost exclusively on the political dimension which framed this tragedy (Barbara B. Diefendorf, Beneath the Cross: Catholics and Huguenots in Sixteenth-Century Paris (New York, Ny.: Oxford University Press, 1991), p. 4). In her view, this exclusive focus on the political dynamic fails to adequately take into account the popular pressures that were exerted on the king and court during this period. In fact, Diefendorf's chief contention in this book is that the period prior to and extending through the massacre of Huguenots in Paris on 24 August 1572 can only be properly understood when one factors in both the political and religious aspects of this turbulent era. In other words, Diefendorf hopes to steer a middle course through the historiographical landscape of the \\"Wars of Religion\\" during this period, and she hopes to avoid both the purely political or the purely religious interpretation of the motivation that shaped these conflicts.Because Diefendorf attempts to approach the religious conflicts of sixteenth-century France from a variety of perspectives, the book alternates between narrative and analytic modes of presentation. In the opening chapters of the book, she analyzes what preexisting social, economic, political and religious tensions contributed to the conflicts. Diefendorf argues that Paris in the mid-sixteenth century was a city that was substantially weakened by the internal strains of 1) the increasing poverty among the working class and the poor, 2) a growing indebtedness among the population along with the concomitant possibility of losing one's property, 3) the price inflation of essential commodities, and 4) an increasing indigent population that was dependent on public support (Diefendorf, Beneath the Cross, pp. 21-22). She also argues that maintaining order in the Capitol city was becoming increasingly difficult due to the overlapping jurisdiction of the various authorities. Further, the social equilibrium between the governing elite and the masses was demonstrating its increasingly fragile character. From a religious perspective, Diefendorf analyzes the complexities of Parisian Catholicism during this era. She argues that Catholic piety demanded religious unity (both personal and public) as a vital condition for individual and collective salvation since society was perceived an organic whole (Diefendorf, Beneath the Cross, p. 38). Additionally, Diefendorf analyzes the religious processions of the era and argues that they vividly reinforced the perception in the minds of the people of the inseparable relationship between the civic authority, the monarchy, and the Catholic faith (Diefendorf, Beneath the Cross, p. 48). To the Catholics of mid-sixteenth century Paris, Diefendorf argues that unity in the body of Christ demanded a unified city and State under the aegis of Catholicism. She asserts that all of these factors (social, economic, political, and religious) contributed to an increasingly volatile environment that provides the crucial framework for understanding the religious conflicts of this era.Diefendorf then provides a vivid narrative account of the cycle of religious malice and violence, beginning in 1557, that finally culminated in the massacre of the Protestants in Paris in 1572 (Diefendorf, Beneath the Cross, pp. 49-106). It was during this cycle of war and peace, Diefendorf argues, that religious hatred intensified to such a degree that the murderous events of St. Bartholomew's Day can be legitimately conceived of as a natural extension of the trajectory begun years earlier. What fueled this extreme animus? In answer to this question, Diefendorf examines the Reformed Christianity of Paris and the militant Catholicism (which she labels \\"extremist\\" and contrasts with moderate Catholicism) of the day. Examining the extant sermon manuscripts from the Catholic pulpits of the day, Diefendorf paints a seditious picture of Catholic preachers, whom inflamed the masses in their religious hatred of the practitioners of the new religion. She implicates these inflammatory Catholic preachers in ultimately exerting the pressure upon the civic authorities and monarchy that eventually led to the massacre of Saint Bartholomew's Day.In the final analysis, Diefendorf argues that the massacre of the Parisian Protestants was not pursued by all Catholics equally, but rather was primarily engineered by the radical and extremist faction of Parisian Catholics who exerted important pressure upon the king and civic authorities and who took the city to the brink of anarchy in their murderous enterprise.This book paints a complex portrait of the religious wars of mid-sixteenth century France, and it is made all the more interesting by the engaging narrative the author provides of the religious conflicts of the era. The author demonstrates her point well concerning the militant influence of extremist Catholic preachers by citing the extant sermons available which seem to substantiate her point. Although the author is probably correct in noting the dual influence of politics and religion in the conflicts of the period, the book suffers from a few weaknesses. First, her use and interpretation of the Catholic processions seems tenuous at best. Would the average Catholic observing these processions have made the same conclusion regarding the inseparable nature of Catholic faith and crown as a result of merely observing these processions as Diefendorf alleges? Additionally, this reviewer truly wonders how independently the masses actually acted in the St. Bartholomew's day massacre. In spite of Diefendorf's valiant efforts, the suspicion of a higher level of monarchical involvement lingers in the mind of this reviewer. Perhaps the greatest weakness, however, is the author's failure to adequately substantiate the existence of a \\"moderate faction\\" within Parisian Catholicism. Surely there were Catholics who were more militant in their faith than others, but was there a sizable moderate faction in existence who would have actively opposed their militant brethren in any substantive way? This reviewer doesn't find any conclusive proof in Diefendorf's book to establish such a premise. It is true that later historical developments in France (which Diefendorf does not address in this work) would seem to support this thesis. On the other hand, the history of the massacre and the triumphant procession of the king and court before the approving masses after the slaughter suggest perhaps the opposite conclusion."},{"Title":"Mother India","review":"The positive impact that this controversial book had created in the Indian nationalism and feminism during the early 20th century cannot be belittled even while the motives behind such a polemic work on the Indian social life of the colonial India can undoubtedly be questioned.One cannot disagree to the fact that Mayo's book came as quite a surprise to the leaders of Indian national congress and social reforms at a time when the whole country is engaged in a political struggle with the colonial government. Historians are of the opinion that her work neither revealed anything new of the prevailing social decadence nor gave viable solutions to them. The social movements and women liberation advocates existed at the time even before this book was written, got their much needed impetus with the release of her work. Though the mainstream orthodox Hindu groups were on the constant collision course with these movements with jarring opposition, the members of the national congress could not keep their eyes closed on the women issues in the wake of Mayo's book and gave wholehearted support for questioning the intransigence on religious orthodoxy and the indifference of the colonial government on the issues concerning women. On the political front, Mayo's work could neither dampen the enthusiasm of freedom \`fighters' nor could bring the west, who condemned her work as negative American journalism, to consensus with her.It is interesting to note that though Mayo were able to put forward a number of theories both economical and social for the existing moral turpitude in Indian social life, she did not suggest any solutions for it and one would suspect that such solutions if suggested could have been carried out only in the form of reforms on the existing British policies rather than as reforms in the minds and hearts of Indian people, undermining the very objective for which Mayo created her work in the first place.Mrinalini Sinha, who wrote an excellent introduction to \`Mother India' in a different publication, has given many evidences for Mayo's secret collaboration with the British in misrepresenting India. It was widely believed that the targeted audience of Mayo's work was United States who had been pushing British for granting more political freedom for Indians. One can easily notice in her book that her smear campaign was targeted towards Hindu religion, the religion of most of the nationalistic leaders of the time who were demanding home rule. In her opinion the Hindu nationalism was causing \`problems' for the British by their campaign of non-cooperation, civil disobedience and instillation of rural masses when British were doing everything to improve the conditions in India like incorporation of Indians in the administrating positions, improving the economical infrastructure, revival of village industries etc. She was insinuating that Hindus should first address the appalling social conditions in India and then learn, with the help of the British, how to administer a country before clamoring for independence that she thought Indians were still unqualified for. The British on the other hand were delighted to have such a work published around the time when situations were so tensed all around the country following the Rowlatt act, problems in Punjab and most importantly Jalianwala Bagh massacre.Mayo's revulsion towards Hindu religion and its \`superstitions' can be seen all over her work where as she conveniently ignored many of the disgusted customs of Islam, may be fearing a fatwa declared on her by the Muslim community lest she repudiated their customs and traditions. Her rather soft approach towards Islam was due to the fact that most of the Muslim population supported the British rule and alienating them from the British interests in India would be the last thing in her agenda. Being a minority, Muslims always believed that their interests would be better protected under a British rule than under a self-rule with Hindu majority at its helm. In spite of all the venom the book emits, there are some interesting and worth pondering narrations of many Hindu customs in it and how Brahman upper class was able to keep the lower caste people in submission. Chapters \`Brahman' and \`Sacred cow' deserve special accolade.In the chapter, \`Psychological glimpses through the economic lens', she was giving rather clever explanations for why British rule in India is a boon not a bane for both Indians and the rest of the world. The Indian nationalist leaders' claim that the British was plundering India and fleecing its wealth for the benefit of people of Briton is also questioned in the chapter. She draws sloppy comparison between India and USA, some of the countries to which Britain sold clothes. Her argument was that both America and India exported cotton to Britain and if America had no problem buying clothes from UK in return why India should then had problems doing the same? Her rather superficial comparison reveals how badly was she aware of the realities to which Indian cotton industry was submitted to by the British. Then, she has her own arguments for the India's high military expenditure and high remunerations of Indian civil servants (all of them were British). She seemed to have totally unaware of the fact that her very arguments for British's expensive administration were the reasons why nationalists including Gandhi were asking British to leave; a pompous alien power needs more money to run India than what would Indians need to run their own country - the economic disparity between India and Britain had always caused hardship for India.Many controversial topics in her book are related to the moral ascendance of Hindu; practices on marriage and sex such as child marriages, pre-pubertal sexual relations, young pregnancy, Devadasi system, Suttee practices, widow issues etc. Her gross exaggerations of numbers are challenged by many historians, one example being the percentage of Indians inflicted by venereal diseases is only 10% not 90% unlike Mayo reported. On the subject of child marriage, she interpreted totally out of context the comments made by Tagore and Gandhi. At the end, Gandhi's response to Mayo, \`A Drain inspector's report' (published in Young India journal) truly encompasses the spirit with which Gandhi exhorted Indian populace to remain calm but respond positively to Mayo's challenges.However, the truth of the matter is that many of the social blots of the Indian society that Mayo reported in her book were true in a sense that it existed at many places in India as acknowledged by prominent leaders of the time as Gandhi, Nehru and Bose though more patriotic nationalists deprecated Mayo's report outright. What was not true is her generalization. Her language is so powerful to cause a casual reader to mistake the identity of India. Her British friends warned her that India cannot be generalized with a few samples of cases taken from few villages; nevertheless she embarked on her work with a British agenda of slandering India.Ancient or modern, any civilization in the world always has its share of social and moral issues, including one of the so called most civilized countries as Mayo's own. Most recently, the church scandals came in light in the Unites States of incidents happened decades ago in most of the American churches are good examples of where minors are mistreated by the people associated with God (Mayo draw similar cases with priests in Indian temples). Also, the horrible treatment the whites meted out to their blacks brethren in the United States during the same period was no different from the upper caste Hindus' treatment towards \`untouchables'.Mayo's plea at the end of her book to the readers of India to consider her \`pain' as the \`faithful wounds of a friend' was not well received in India. Had only such a work as Mayo's even with its direct attack on many controversial fronts is produced by a scholar who have spent years in India with a genuine concern for the social problems of India could the same be considered as the \`faithful wounds of a friend'. Mayo who just spent three months during 1925-26 to produce such a work and claiming herself to be a benefactor of India and her women community does not deserve the friendship of India as aptly commented by Haribilas Sarda (the architect of the Sarda Act also known as Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929). Ironically, it is Mayo to whom the supporters of the act should thank for the passage of the act would not have been smoother probably without her work.The British who welcomed an average American journalist's inferior work with both hands banned the publication of an excellent impartial book \`India in Bondage - Her right to Freedom and a Place Among the Great Nations' two years later, written by an other American, Jabez T. Sunderland, who was an authoritative on the subject and was a former president of the India information Bureau of America, twice Special Commissioner and lecturer to India and the author of a number of books on India, on the apprehension that they will loose their ground in the west as well as in the east in holding India still in subjugation.Comments of some of the western personalities on the Mayo's book are worth quoting here (from \`India in Bondage' by Sunderland, P.510).Professor Franklin Edgerton of Yale University wrote: \\"I hope you and others in India will believe that there are some of us in America who know how to appraise justly Miss Mayo's scurrilous book. We are deeply ashamed to acknowledge her as our fellow countrywoman, and we neglect no chance to deny the truth of the picture of India which she draws.\\"Mrs. Annie Besant writes with indignation of \`Mother India': \\"Miss Mayo has published a wicked book, slandering the whole of the Indian people...I have spent in India the greater part of my time since 1893, living as an Indian, welcomed in their homes as though I were one of their own people, and I have never come across the horrors she describes...The writer seems to have merely sought for filth. Does she imagine that if her presentation were an accurate picture of Hindu civilization that Hinduism could have produced a civilization in India dating from thousands of years before the Christian era? It would have been smothered in its own putrefaction.\\"This book is good read to understand the social problems existed in colonial India, sadly, some of them still exist in many parts of India and one who genuinely concerned about India cannot disregard these social issues that are challenging India in the 21st century. Though Mayo's work by no means an academic classic, the book has enough stuff to catch the attention of readers and make them ponder over it. But readers are warned not to get prejudiced over India by her work but are encouraged to read many great impartial books written about India and its great culture, social issues, and many other aspects of its social life.Before I end my commentary let me quote a statement Mayo made in her book to compare it with a more \`civilized' act of the same nature. Mayo \`found out' that Indian parents fed opium to their whining kids. While that may be true of uncivilized colonial India, the board certified doctors from Mayo's own country, United States of America , the \`most civilized' country on the planet, are prescribing Tylenol, a medicine that provides almost the same effect as opium does to young children, in the place of opium."},{"Title":"Mother India","review":"This is a great take on the original \\"Mother India\\" written in the 1920s by Katherine Mayo. Sinha notes that Mayo's book, in spite of being one of the most viciously racist and imperialistic (and badly written) books ever, served as a guide for US policy makers until the 1980s! Going by Sinha's analysis, it's pretty clear that Mayo was more demagogue than scholar, and very interesting that lots of people cared about her views. That alone makes it worth examining what Mayo said. Sinha takes a good look at (a) Mayo's career and political leanings, (b) new research about her sources of \\"information\\" about India, (c) possible sources of funding for her book, and (d) what Indians at the time had to say about it. Through all this, Sinha does a great job of contextualizing Mayo's book, and provokes readers to think about the powerful seduction that oversimplified (dis)information and propaganda hold for the uncritical mind. In the first part of the book, Sinha presents background and analysis. The rest of the book consists of excerpts from Mayo's original text."},{"Title":"Mother India","review":"The positive impact that this controversial book created in the Indian nationalism and feminism during the early part of the 20th century cannot be belittled even when the motives behind such a polemic work on the social and political life of colonial India can undoubtedly be questioned.Historians would not disagree to the fact that Mayo's book came as a bolt from the blue to the leaders of the Indian national congress and social reformers at a time when the whole country was engaged in a political struggle with the colonial government. Historians are of the opinion that her work neither revealed anything new of the then prevailing social decadence nor gave any viable solutions to them. Instead, the social movements and the women liberation advocates that existed long before this book was written got their much needed impetus with the release of this book. Though the mainstream orthodox Hindu groups were on the constant collision course with these movements with jarring opposition, the members of the national congress could not keep their eyes closed in the wake of Mayo's book and gave wholehearted support for questioning the intransigence on the religious orthodoxy and the indifference of the colonial government on the issues concerning women. On the political front, Mayo's work could neither dampen the enthusiasm of freedom fighters nor could bring the west, which condemned her work as negative American journalism, to consensus with her.It is interesting to note that though Mayo was able to put forward a number of theories, including economical and social, for the moral turpitude that existed in the Indian social life, she could not suggest any solutions for it, and so one could easily suspect that any solutions if suggested could only had been carried out in the form of reforms on the existing British policies rather than as reforms in the minds and hearts of Indian people, and thus undermining the very objective for which Mayo created her work in the first place.Mrinalini Sinha, who wrote an excellent academic introduction to \`Mother India' in a different publication,Mother India: Selections from the Controversial 1927 Text, Edited and with an Introduction by Mrinalini Sinhahas given many evidences for Mayo's secret collaboration with the British in misrepresenting India. It was widely believed that the targeted audience of Mayo's work was United States which had been pushing British for granting more political freedom for India. One can easily notice that Mayo's target was the Hindu religion, the religion of most of the nationalistic leaders of the time who were demanding home rule.

Mrinalini Sinha's introduction is written from research standpoint where she tracing back in history and explaining the backdrop of Mayo's work. She also studies both the positive and negative impact the book had on colonial India. This book gives lot of additional information and references to one who is looking for a detailed study of the social issues of colonial India, customs and practices of Hindus, sources and reliability of the data that Mayo used in her book. Also, additional comments have been given at the bottom of pages for Mayo's claims, wherever possible.In tracing back Mayo's career, however, one cannot see her anti-third world sentiments. She had been an average journalist and her life before or after the publication of \`Mother India' does not show her antipathy or affinity towards third world countries. This leads one to believe that her agenda was enforced by external sources, namely political.One would not wonder if this book has been used by the United States government as an introductory book on India until 70s especially when considering America's intolerance and knowledge on the east!Sinha's introduction and comments are invaluable source of information for scholars, historians and even politicians alike. This book does not contain the full text of Mayo's \`Mother India' (don't know why the book is published this way, may be with a business mind), for which one has to read one of the available editions of Mayo's original publication."},{"Title":"Mother India","review":"Katherine Mayo originally published her book, _Mother India_, in 1927, when not only was there still a &quot;British India&quot;, but there were still people who thought it was a good thing. This review is based on that original work. I do not know how this new paperback edition has been edited, but since &quot;Mrinalini Sinha (Editor)&quot; has been added to the authorship, I assume there are some differences. In the original work, Mayo, no fan of Mr. Gandhi, outlined in well-documented detail the problems of India at that time (child marriages, health problems caused by lack of hygiene, caste rigidities, the economy, etc.) and presented solutions from a western point of view. She was also no fan of Hinduism, but there is no attack in the book on the religion per se, only on the negative effects that she felt flowed from it. She is a good writer and the book is very easy to read. The political parts were not as interesting to me as the parts about the social problems. Hopefully the editor deleted some of the more tedious passages of old politics. For the most part, I found it fascinating."},{"Title":"On Persephone's Island: A Sicilian Journal","review":"This book really gave an insightful and intriguing depiction of Sicily, its traditions and its history.

Even if you have no plans to travel there, this book offers a close-up view of this ancient, magic island and the forces that made her the way she is. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"On Persephone's Island: A Sicilian Journal","review":"As a young student from New York Mary Taylor Simeti came to Sicily, fell in love, married and lived her life on the island as an expatriate. This means she is the double-role of an insider and an outsider and thus the perfect reporter on atmosphere, life and customs on Sicily, far better than any journalist traveling around for some months.The book is organized following the seasons of the year thus showing the close relationship of life on Sicily to nature. Farming, plants, flowers, climate, public holidays and harvesting are important parts of her life. But the author also writes about her husband's family and how she integrated step-by-step into the Sicilian society. Greek mythology does not play a central role but it is interesting to see how the author makes practical use of otherwise only academically treated myths. Life with the silent presence of the Mafia is a topic as well as customs like Easter processions and the widely unknown virgineddu. As an American the author wonders how Sicilians organize themselves, such as concerning her children's school or how to get entrance to a historical building on a military site.The book covers the time of the 1970s and 1980s and shows many features of the time: The author came to Sicily to support Danilo Dolci driven by a somewhat romantic social idealism, then we read again and again how she marched in demonstrations against American missiles on Sicily, or against the Mafia, or to protect a natural reserve. The author declares to be glad that anti-communism lost its strength. Old fotographs on the Web site of her winery \\"Bosco Falconeria\\" show the typical beards and clothings of leftist students around 1968. From today's point of view (2013) this does not seem so political any more but rather like folklore of these times in a certain social milieu. All in all Mary Taylor Simeti did not strive for communism but lived a good life as owner of several houses in Palermo and Alcamo and of course the farm Bosco Falconeria near Palermo, and she lets us readers take part in the sufferings and rewards of such a Sicilian life. Thank you!"},{"Title":"On Persephone's Island: A Sicilian Journal","review":"PERSEPHONE'S ISLAND was of interest to me since I was going to Italy this winter. I had forgotten this island was the place where Hades was entranced by Persephone and lured her into the nether world. The braiding of myths of the island with the events of the author's life there made this a more interesting look at life in Sicily."},{"Title":"On Persephone's Island: A Sicilian Journal","review":"Author Mary Taylor Simeti is a Radcliffe educated New Yorker married to a Sicilian agronomist. She first traveled to Sicily between college and graduate school to work with author and social reformer Danilo Dolci in Partinico creating sustainable living communities and helping the Sicilian poor, a progressive idea for its time in the region. It was there she met her husband to be.The book chronicles the author's fascination with her adopted home, the books she has read about Sicilian history, the marvelous metaphors of Sicilian dialect, life on an ancestral farm, and everything from almond paste to sbirgi (a rare variety of pale green nectarines) to the ritualized way of life and folk traditions.I was particularly eager to read about Mary's discoveries as I had also traveled to and lived in Sicily (primarily Corleone and Palermo). She has captured the essence of the unique island, its extraordinary history, and the people.I like the synchronicity that my undergraduate thesis traced the myth of Persephone and Demeter on that island through art, folklore, religion, rituals, and symbolism. I can unequivocally affirm this book is valid and worth reading. Mary's first-hand experiences and her passion for her subject make her stories come alive.

I was not disappointed in this book. Simeti plans her book around a year, starting with the old New Year that occurred November 1st, with the Feast of the Dead, and gradually working her way around the seasons so that the end of the book finished one year later.Although she spends much time discussing her garden and her various meanderings around the Sicilian countryside with her family, this book is also a snapshot of life in Sicily during 1982-1983. I was a young woman then, freshly married, and her vivid prose enabled me to go back in time nearly thirty years ago, to re-remember events that I had completely gotten, such as the Italian government's successful attempts to divert the lava flow of Mount Etna, so that it did not go into populated areas. (They did this using dynamite). But I loved this book because of Simeti's relentless quest for the shadow of Persephone and the Greek civilization that existed on Sicily so many years ago.

That any publisher found ON PERSEPHONE'S ISLAND worthy of print astounds me! Be warned, you get exactly what is promised, a journal! Simeti's is a dry account, devoid of humor, insight and passion and is written with a lofty phraseology: a deadly combination that had better not be contagious! To be honest, I found the book so dull I was unable to read it straight through, so after eighty pages, I began skiping around in search of entertainment, since there is no story. I found none!If you're searching for an escape to another place, a glimpse into another life or culture, or just plain fun, look elsewhere! You will find none of the above here!

The author, a graduate of a prestigious American college and a person not of Italian background, proves to have written an almost poetic journal of her family's life over the course of the four seasons on this enigmatic island. She combines a beautifully descriptive knowledge of the infinitely varied flora of Sicily with a close acquaintance with the political and social mores of its inhabitants. Moreover, her many references to the Greek origins of the island give the reader a perspective not commonly found. Her marriage to a middle class Sicilian university professor and her approach to raising two children in this unusual environment gives the book a personal slant not always available to one trying to get a handle on life in this ancient land.I heartily recommend this book to anyone wishing to learn about the real Sicily."},{"Title":"On Persephone's Island: A Sicilian Journal","review":"This is one of the loveliest books I've read in a longtime...so much so that I ended up travelling to Sicily, dog-eared bookin tow, to taste the pasta reale (marzipan) and arancini di riso (rice croquettes), stay at Villa Igiea in Palermo, visit the temple of Segesta, and meet the warm, friendly Sicilian people. This is a book to be savored. It is full of humor and tenderness. It is about living in Sicily, it is about Sicilian food and culture, and it is for folks who wish they could travel there and never will, as well as for those who vow that now, they really must see this phenomenal Italian island."},{"Title":"On Persephone's Island: A Sicilian Journal","review":"Mary Simeti and I are star-crossed. We both had the exact experience with some notable difference. She married an Alcamese and stayed in Sicily. I married an Alcamese and brought him to America. I believe she made the wiser choice as her book clearly demonstrated to me that while an American can become a Sicilian, a Sicilian can never become a true American. I was impressed by her use of language and how she managed to masterfully depict Sicily. It is obvious that she has been seduced by the Sicilian way of life but still clings to her American origins. I had the pleasure of meeting her in person and she is as lovely as her book would convey. This is not just a book about Sicily--it is an intelligent, scholarly work from a writer mesmorized by a mysterious but wondrous culture.

The story works well on two levels - discussing the mythology, history, and culture of Sicily, but also weaving in her responses, frustrations, fears, and joys about her life as an American woman turned Italian wife and mother. One of my favorite books about Italy."},{"Title":"On Persephone's Island: A Sicilian Journal","review":"Picked this book because of its previous rating and read it prior to visiting Sicily. I found the book a delightful read and Simeti's images to accurately describe the Sicily we saw four weeks after finishing the book. She describes well a beautiful and complex island as enjoyable to visit as her book is to read."},{"Title":"On Persephone's Island: A Sicilian Journal","review":"I couldn't put this book down. Surely it's partially because my heritage is from that area of Sicily and I haven't ever been there. Mary Taylor Simeti's book was so descriptive that I now feel like I've actually visited. The dialect of the people is as if I was reading about my own grandparents. As an American she true-ly captured the flavor of the Sicilian people so vividly that I sometimes could smell the food as I was reading the pages. I also recieved an education on Greek Myth. Gratzia Mary Taylor Simeti from Denise"},{"Title":"On Persephone's Island: A Sicilian Journal","review":"Simeti has crafted an unflinchingly honest, intellegent, and evocative portrait of Sicily. By refusing to romanticize the island, or overlook its flaws, she manages to bring out an image of a beautiful, conflicted, and vital culture. Her descriptions of the people and the countryside make this a wonderful book to curl up with; her scholarly tidbits make you want to learn more about mythology. A wonderful read."},{"Title":"On Persephone's Island: A Sicilian Journal","review":"Although it sometimes seemed padded, I enjoyed Mary Taylor Simeti's journal of the changing seasons and their festivals in northwestern Sicily (Palermo and her husband's ancestral estate southwest of the city) in 1992-93. In the year covered by the book she also makes or recalls visits to a number of other sites, mostly in western Sicily, and draws on many earlier accounts of how festivals were celebrated in ancient Magna Grecia and in 18th and 19th century Sicily.Although preoccupied with ancient Greek celebrations, particularly their botanical foci, and with the disappearances and revivals of Sicilian folk culture, Simeti's account does not ignore the Mafia. 1992 was the year in which General dalla Chiesa and his young wife wereassassinated. Outrage at that marked the beginning of public condemnation of the Mafia and the violence that culminated in the 1996 assassinations of the magistrates investigating the Mafia was escalating. (And 1993 was the year that a lava flow from Mt. Etna was diverted by dynamite.)Focusing on Demeter and Persephone has a clear feminist agenda. Simeti expresses eloquently her ambivalence as an expatriate American (of 20 years standing at the time), alternately enchanted and infuriated by Sicilian ways. I was particularly struck by the more widespread (than Sicily) resentment at \\"living in a world where rite and tradition are becoming ever more a private affair that has fallen squarely into the woman's lap\\" (66-- I know that ancestor worship is similarly being increasingly dumped on wives in Taiwan, for another instance).The characters are not as clear as those in _Out of Africa_ or _Cross Creek_, but in writing engagingly about residence in a land that is strange to the author, Simeti deserves a place on the shelf with those much-loved classics."},{"Title":"On Persephone's Island: A Sicilian Journal","review":"If you are even remotely thinking about going to Sicily, you should read this wonderful book. Deep understanding of this unique, strange amazing island, seen also with an American's eye. I was reading it while I was there, and it opened up everything I saw in ways that would have been impossible. Like being with a Sicilian friend."},{"Title":"36 Children","review":"Many time teachers don't see success in the class room but somewhere deep down know they are making a difference.

I would say that Kozol had a better experience than Kohl, and he was a better teacher. But Kohl's book is valuable because it is brutally honest about the selfish motivations of the average teacher, as well as the difficulties, stereotypes and misunderstandings that get in the way of good teaching.Another difference between Kohl and Kozol is that Kozol had one class of children to teach, while Kohl was teaching children who were 1 or 2 years older and split into separate classes. It makes me wonder if it is easier to teach kids in a single class rather then divide them up into periods so that the teachers keep changing.Other books to recommend in this genre are &quot;Savage Inequalities&quot; by Jonathan Kozol, &quot;Children of crisis&quot; by Robert Coles, and &quot;Ghetto schooling&quot; by Jean Anyon."},{"Title":"36 Children","review":"Dr. Kohl's look inside a Harlem public school classroom is sobering. Fresh out of college and eager to teach, the reality of 36 children, none to whom the \\"system\\" expected to deliver anything resembling education, nearly left the young teacher depressed. But he did what great teachers always do: He met the students where they were, instead of forcing them into some pedogogical mode.Yet, after a year of accomplishment, Kohl looked on in despair as the \\"system\\" once again absorbed his 36 children into its mediocre attempt to do not much more than warehouse them for another year. A few of his children carried forward their one year with him into a lifetime of accomplishment, and for this he is pleased.This book provides a critical look inside the flawed presuppositions of a system of education that relies on mainlining children, rather than letting them become what God intended them to be."},{"Title":"Everyday Life in Ancient Rome","review":"Isaac Asimov once told Casson he used to get &quot;wrapped-up&quot; in his books. I fell victim to this with Everyday Life in Ancient Rome. I've read a couple books on this subject of how the ordinary citizen spent their day in ancient Rome. Casson's book is much more readable than any other I've read on the subject. His prose are more personable. He doesn't get bogged down in too much background and footnote information. The subject is relatively easy and Casson makes it seem that way and makes it accessible to the non-academician type reader. The book is divided into subject chapters. The Times, The Family, In The City, The Slave, The Soldier, The Engineer, On The Road. These are some of the chapter titles. It is easiest to read straight through, but you could bounce from chapter to chapter with no problems. Some of the usual big names are in this book like Augustus, Cicero, Pliny the Younger, Dio, Trajan, and Hadrian to name a few. However, he also talks about how slaves fit into everyday society and how important their role was. His description of cities like Ostia and Pompeii are dead-on and he talks about what life was like at each. There are a few illustrations, but nothing really useful. The words are enough to get a good image in your mind. This edition is a revised one of his 1975 Daily Life in Ancient Rome. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Everyday Life in Ancient Rome","review":"Everyday Life in Ancient Rome is a fascinating, engaging, brief study of the social history of Rome during the 1st and 2nd centuries A.D., the period when Imperial Rome was at its height. Casson, the author, provides brief vignettes of family life; farming; the organization, administration, and life of the city; slavery; the life of soldiers; how Romans traveled; the emperor, etc. His history digs deeper into social issues than the typical history book which tends to focus on key individuals and major political events. Each of the vignettes provides fascinating information about how Romans lived; e.g., the life within apartment complexes; the engineering feat of providing water to city dwellers; the various forms of entertainment provided to Roman citizens. Each of the vignettes are quite brief, and I was left with wanting more. It also seemed that the vignette on slavery overemphasized its positive aspects, and the vignette on the Emperor focused exclusively on Hadrian, rather than also commenting on other emperors of the period. Nevertheless, this is an excellent, well written study of Roman times and is highly recommended. Casson's book, Travel in the Ancient World, is also quite good."},{"Title":"Everyday Life in Ancient Rome","review":"History is usually measured by the reigns of rulers, wars, battles, treaties between nations, breaches of treaties between nations, cataclysmic events, shifts in political idealogies and the discovery of new lands. While all of these things are certainly important, what sometimes gets lost is what the routines of life were like for &quot;ordinary&quot; denizens of the remote past.Enter Lionel Casson. In this book, Casson attempts to disinter what life was like for the longest-lasting major empire in world history. Rome was founded (according to the Romans themselves) in 753B.C.E., had a meteoric rise in power in the 3rd century B.C.E., and saw the fall of her empire around 473 A.D. The present work details what life was like for her citizens, particularly in the age of the Antonine emperors and just before.To justify his conclusions, Casson invokes archeology, the literature of the time, coinage, political &amp; legal writings, plus a host of historical anecdotes.From this array of reference material, Casson sketches for us what life was like for various levels of Roman society, from slaves and gladiators to wealthy patricians to the all-powerful emperor himself. We learn a great deal about the mores of Roman life, what travelling abroad must have been like, what the most preferred forms of entertainment were as well as how sundry religions were interwoven into their way of life.One of the best chapters deals with archeological excavations of Pompeii and Ostia, the latter being a thriving coastal port during the prime of the empire. As much of these cities remains unchanged over the past 2,000 years, archeologists are able to discern many aspects of the typical activities of its long dead citizens.[It must be noted Ostia and Pompeii can tell us a lot about ancient Rome. Being a Roman citizen did not NECESSARILY = living in Rome. One could live throughout the Roman empire and still possess the rights and privileges of a full Roman citizen. It was not uncommon, in fact, for full citizens to live in places like North Africa, for instance, and never witness for themselves the pines of Rome. Herein lies the relevance of these two cities in this work.]Some day, I will see with my own eyes the Pantheon, the Collosseum, Trajan's column, Hadrian's villa, the Baths of Caracalla and all the splendour of modern Rome. As I gaze around, I will wonder what it was like when Romans stood in my spot some 2,000 years ago. Thanks to Lionel Casson, I'll now be able to envision the lives of those remote denizens with far more veracity."},{"Title":"Everyday Life in Ancient Rome","review":"I had recourse to this book to provide background for a series of lectures in historical interior design. As such a vehicle, this is an excellent book, slender though it is. It seems well-researched, and the end notes suggest a keen working-knowledge of the subject. The style is conversational rather than academic, which makes it an ideal point of entry for high school students, under graduates and others who are just looking for a fairly simple backdrop to deeper research in more focussed areas. There are more thorough studies of family life, slavery and religion available, but as a springboard into such studies, this work is perhaps ideal. Finally, anyone look for pertinent illustrations for lectures on the subject of ancient Roman everyday life should look elsewhere: the second-rate illustrations are black and white and few in number."},{"Title":"Everyday Life in Ancient Rome","review":"Relatively quick & easy read on early Roman Republic up to Hadrian.

As a boy, Dwight Enhart found himself enmeshed in the fogs of an ordinary teenage boyhood in 1946 as a young man who had development into a shy, yet respected leader in his high school, The Fading Of The Scars is an engaging tale of the young discovery of God through friendships and social barriers that eventually break through as a message of enlightenment.

I couldn't put it down. What a terrific writer and an absorbing story.

As a researcher who has developed a vaccine for AIDS, he is faced with a horrific dilemma when he realizes that, improperly used, it is capable of global destruction.The author has developed the character of Jacob with such subtle efficiency that the reader lives through his travails, in his &quot;skin&quot;, as it were, and consequently shares the full gamut of his emotions.The reader is taken on a journey rife with secret societies so well cloaked in benign - even spiritual - facades that plans for A New World Order are executed with the finesse of rhetoric, luring the innocent, uninformed, and compliant.The impact on the reader is such that one experiences the likes of the most fearsome of roller coasters: the knot in the pit of the stomach, the rush of adrenaline that comes with an ominous expectation, and the solace of survival that is experienced at the end of the ride.This is a complex read that encompasses many layers. The characters have depth and credibility, as does the narrative, which leaves one considering the possibility (probability?) of the fulfillment of the Prophecy.If the reader embraces a thought-provoking challenge and the adrenaline rush of trepidation, this book is for you! There is much fodder for discussioin and is an ideal pick for literary groups. The message is clear: stay informed, stay involved, and don't forget to vote!!"},{"Title":"Jacob's Fire","review":"Jacob's Fire is way ahead of other books on Bible prophecy and events like the rapture. This is a solidly developed plot proving excellent writing skills,and a storyline that makes the readers want to keep turning the pages. The characters and settings are bona fide to readers and the narrative is one bang up, helluva thriller. Hayes writes this novel with in-you-face reality.

She takes us behind the scenes of government and the Catholic church and the Vatican.I rarely reread a book , but this book is one I plan on rereading"},{"Title":"Jacob's Fire","review":"Ms. Hayes has outdone herself this time. Jacob's Fire is non-stop entertainment from start to finish. Her words are food for thought, providing a feast before my eyes. I couldn't turn the pages quick enough! You won't want to miss this one...."},{"Title":"Jacob's Fire","review":"Dr. Hayes introduces us to the main character, Jacob, just before the halfway point in the seven-year tribulation spoken of in the New Testament book of Revelation. It's amazing, but our hero is totally unaware of God' plan for Salvation and the Tribulation because of the religious tradition he was raised in. This gifted professor/scientist has everything to look forward to; a formula to cure AIDS that's worth billions, a wonderful wife and a darling daughter. But, under the dark cloud of the antichrist system all these joyful blessings are in great jeopardy. I worried about all of them constantly.Strap on your seat belts because the action is swift, the scenes constantly change. What I liked most about the book is the author's ability to make the scenes so real, the people so alive, the tension so dramatic that I hated to lay the book down. I suspect that all fiction novels will become more real...more intimate if you read them in long settings. If I were a reader, I wouldn't start reading &quot;Jacob&quot; again unless I could have two or more hours to devote to it.It is obvious that a lot of research went into the writing of this book. The author's knowledge of the Eschatology she used is reflected in the plot and subplots with great detail. Her knowledge of the Vatican, Israel, and the Italian and Yiddish langue is impressive.We are privy to several Machiavellian conversations between the charismatic Anti-Christ and his ruthless False Prophet. And we cringe anxiously as we endure our hero's opportune and prophetic moments with them.As Jacob goes through his fiery trials in these worst of times he meets several new Christians who keep showing him in the Scriptures that they are watching end-time prophecy become living history. I kept wondering when Jacob would ever receive Jesus Christ as his Lord, Saviour, and Messiah as the non-Christians had. For someone so brilliant, Jake was sure was slow about believing in the Truth while seeing, and sometimes even participating in, the fulfillments of prophesy. I think the author wanted her readers to identify with our hero as he struggled between what he had believed for over 60 years, and what the Bible was clearly revealing as living history. Traditions die hard, but God is gracious and merciful.The ending caught me off guard. That is not what I expected at all. In fact it caught me so off guard that I gasped....I cried. What an ending!"},{"Title":"Jacob's Fire","review":"Having been a Christian for years and participating in debates about the rapture, I was very impressed with Dr. Hayes' presentation through the words of Isleen. Dr. Hays also appears very knowledgeable of the Catholic religion and the questions that Jews have similar to Dr. Jacob Ben Abrams concerning the end times. Although Jacob's Fire is fiction, her insight to world situations stimulates the reader's imagination to the possibilities of what could be presently happening. The developing plot leads the reader anxiously awaiting the next possible twist. I highly recommend Jacob's Fire to readers of all faiths in order to affirm what they believe about their role in this world and eternity."},{"Title":"Jacob's Fire","review":"Per chance, I purchased this novel at my local book store.

She displays her broad knowledge base with integrity and decorum-- allowing readers to realize the truth on their own terms. In a time when one only need go as far as the evening news to confirm the seriousness of the subject matter, I applaud this knowledgeable author for pointing out the obvious in such an entertaining method.

I look forward to more from this author!"},{"Title":"Babylon revisited and other stories","review":"I bought this volume of stories simply to get a copy of Fitzgerald's &quot;May Day&quot; which I'd read in one of my college texts and then could not find for years. I have always felt that &quot;May Day&quot; would make a superb film--and the screenwriter could lift most of the dialogue right out of the story. It is that good and simple and dramatic. Actually every one of the stories in this collection is first rate. Here is Fitzgerald, only in his 20's, writing of American aspirations before, during and after World War I. And no one wrote about this subject better than he did. The characters are rich and complex, all of them dissatisfied with the bones that life has thrown them, all of them desiring what others have. The reader sees their foibles and loves them anyway. These are not perfect people. They are real people in a time of trouble--fighting, most of them, simply to stay afloat in a world changing faster than anyone would have thought possible. I cannot recommend these brilliant stories highly enough. There is also a brief life and appreciation of Fitzgerald in this lovely Scribner edition."},{"Title":"Babylon revisited and other stories","review":"I've just started on this book and already the stories I've read so far I have to rate as among the best short stories I have ever read. &quot;Winter Dreams&quot; was just exquisitely gorgeous, &quot;The Diamond as Big as the Ritz&quot; is a fantasy of astonishing invention, and &quot;May Day&quot; really opened my eyes to the unlimited terrain the short format offers. Fitzgerald is a genius--his ability to evoke imagery and illusion is absolutely breathtaking!"},{"Title":"Babylon revisited and other stories","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald is one of our greatest writers. He is best known today for his many wonderful novels, especially The Great Gatsby. As time has passed, his marvelous magazine stories have faded from sight . . . even though those were more widely read than his novels when they were written.In Babylon Revisited: And Other Stories you will deepen your understanding of the novels . . . and of their author in these often semi-autobiographical tales. The best stories have as much impact as any of the novels in a spare exposition that adds to their power.Each story deals with the same general theme: We live on hope which is based on illusions about reality. When faced with reality, we happily escape into new hopes based on different illusions. We are sort of like Peter Pan: We don't want to grow up.The theme comes across with startling persuasiveness as Fitzgerald unpeels the many forms of hopeful illusions that will seem familiar to every reader.The stories build chronologically across the backdrop of the United States after World War I in the 20's and 30's. That shift in authorship times also inadvertently adds the drama of seeing how the psychology of the young and educated changed as American went from mindless boom to seemingly unending bust.Fitzgerald has a rich imagination to makes his world open up for readers so that you can feel both the physical sensations and the emotions of the characters . . . and become the characters while you are reading.The stories themselves have that delightful quality of exaggeration that makes his points indelible.The Ice Palace explores a Southern beauty's pursuit of an advantageous marriage in the frozen tundra of Minnesota in winter. May Day recounts the pursuit of pleasure and accomplishment by those of various social classes and beliefs. The Diamond as Big as the Ritz is a wild tale of a mythical place and the consequences of unlimited wealth. Winter Dreams deals with the painful consequences of acting on the illusions of romantic love. Absolution is an amazing story about how we can carelessly end up being untrue to God and ourselves. The Rich Boy considers how being rich and powerful can get in the way of being close to others. The Freshest Boy looks at being an awkward teenage boy and how he came to make peace with the world. Babylon Revisited shows how our mistakes can come home to roost after we believe we are invulnerable. Crazy Sunday is an astonishing look at the psychology of how we connect to one another through others. The Long Way Out is about a woman who suffers from a mental collapse and is now ready to return to her husband . . . when fate steps in.My favorite stories in the book are May Day, The Diamond as Big as the Ritz, The Freshest Boy, Babylon Revisited and Crazy Sunday.If you haven't read these stories before, you have a great treat ahead of you. If you can find a copy of George Guidall's narration for Recorded Books, your pleasure will be even greater."},{"Title":"Babylon revisited and other stories","review":"Buy this book for &quot;Absolution&quot; alone. (incidentally, it was originally intended as a childhood scene for THE GREAT GATSBY, but was cut and turned into a short story). &quot;Absolution&quot; is easily one the greatest short stories I've ever read. &quot;The Rich Boy&quot; is another masterpiece, and the title story is wonderful, too."},{"Title":"Babylon revisited and other stories","review":"The Book of Revelations in the New Testament is the most likely source from which F. Scott Fitzgerald draws his \\"Babylon Revisited\\". In Revelations, Babylon the Great (also an ancient Near Eastern city of materialism and sexual excess) is the \`mother of whores' and the source of all evil in the Roman Empire. She is said to have been defeated by God and judged for her excessive sin. Upon her destruction, the saints rejoice while the merchants and hedonistic pleasure seekers morn. Symbolism abounds in this revision of the timeless tale and the choice of Fitzgerald's title could not be more appropriate.Charlie himself is the regeneration of Babylon. During the economic boom of the 20's, Charlie and his wife lived life to its fullest and most shallow degree. They partied until sunup. They squandered wealth. We even get the impression that there was a significant amount of infidelity existing on both sides. As with Babylon, Charlie is punished: The stock market crash in 1929 liberates him of a fortune, \\"his child [is] taken from his control, [and] his wife escaped to a grave in Vermont.\\"As with Babylon, Charlie's fall had its rejoicers and mourners. Marion, his wife's bereaved sister, saw Charlie's fall as an opportunity to gain control of his child, and with sincere intentions rid her family of the sinner. Though she doesn't expressly rejoice in her brother-in-laws demise, she does blame him for her sister's death and understands why his life has turned out askew. Duncan and Lorraine, on the other hand, mourned the loss of their sinister partner in indulgence.This story is complete with all of the historic reference and symbolism that has come to define F. Scott Fitzgerald. What a fantastic, unbelievably creative writer. It's amazing how timeless his writings are, and \\"Babylon Revisited\\" is the perfect example of that fact. It really makes you think about your own life."},{"Title":"Babylon revisited and other stories","review":"The literary voice of the ninteen-twenties' \\"Jazz Age,\\" F. Scott Fitzgerald was out of step with the grimmer thirties. Facing his wife's insanity, increasing alcoholism, and his own obsolesence as a writer, the stories collected here show Fitzgerald facing his demons in bracingly honest prose. If \\"Crazy Sunday\\" and the other tales of the adventures of Pat Hobby, down-and-out screenwriter, feel a bit like autobiographical wallow, and \\"Family In The Wind,\\" about a doctor in the midst of a country tornado, is an interesting if uncharacteristic journey into Steinbeck country, it's the title story of the collection that's worth the price of admission.Charlie Wales is an ex-broker, returned to Paris after all the good times have gone, with only the goal of regaining custody of his daughter after the death of his wife. A thinly veiled take on Fitzgerald's own troubled relations with daughter Scottie after wife Zelda's madness, it's at once a suspenseful, moving, and lyrical story. All his powers are at work here, as if he knew this was his last shot at literary immortality, and he was just about right."},{"Title":"Babylon revisited and other stories","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald was as much a master of the short story as he was the novel, and some of these tales attain the classical status achieved by The Great Gatsby. From the O.Henry-like fable of &quot;The Ice Palace&quot; to such masterpieces as &quot;May Day&quot; and the title story, Fitzgerald moves easily from mere entertainment to highbrow artistry, often creating a blend of the two as in the outlandish fantasy &quot;The Diamond as Big as the Ritz&quot;. In &quot;The Rich Boy,&quot; Fitzgerald creates a character every bit as believable as Nick Carraway and every bit as heartbreaking as Gatsby. This is also the story that gave rise to the famous Fitzgerald maxim that the rich &quot;are very different than you and me.&quot;This collection comes highly recommended to anyone interested in American Classics and short-story masterpieces."},{"Title":"Babylon revisited and other stories","review":"The king of the 1920's Lit World wrote short stories for big money in Scribner's Magazine, Collier's, Esquire, and Saturday Evening Post. His first novel made him famous, This Side of Paradise, but his subsequent novels including The Great Gatsby sold meagerly. Zelda and Scott went through dough like drunken sailors, so Scott wrote short stories for a quick buck. This group of stories is among his best and though some or all were written commercially, Scott's talent was so huge that they rival his chief competitor's: Hemingway, Parker, Anderson, and Larder in charm and precision.Above all, Fitzgerald is charming. The drunken rich boys of May Day are close to the authors experience and poignantly revealing. Scott was the son of a failed businessman. His mother's family was well to do and Scott associated with rich beauties that seemed always just beyond a snow covered golf course as in Winter Dreams. His experience with his future wife, Zelda Sear, an Alabama debutante is cloaked in fantasy in Ice Palace. Surely newlyweds are surprised to find they have married strangers. In that there is no secret, but Fitzgerald gives his bride a hysterical nightmare in a St Paul carnival ice maze. The reader loves Sally Carrol and is genuinely caught up in her dilemma of Minnesota in-laws and a suddenly stern husband.Fitzgerald was a dreamer and The Diamond As Big As the Ritz is a parable about a family so rich, and so self-centered in their luxuries, they murder their guests less the secret of the their wealth be known. In an era where a million dollars could buy a country, Fitzgerald's fascination with success and the rich permeates his work."},{"Title":"Babylon revisited and other stories","review":"In the boom economy of today, with a bust probably around the corner, Fitzgerald's stories of American dreams, aspirations to riches and ultimate human frailty have a renewed relevance and poignancy. This collection is worth getting if only for 'The Ice Palace' and 'Babylon Revisited'. Also great reading is 'The Rich Boy', 'The Freshest Boy', and 'Crazy Sunday'. Other stories in this collection are 'May Day', 'The Diamond Big as the Ritz', 'Winter Dreams', 'Absolution', and 'The Long Way Out'."},{"Title":"Babylon revisited and other stories","review":"Used book very good condition.

LEWIS ON GRIEF","review":"The central problem I have with these four little volumes, although I must confess to having only seen (and bought) one, rests in the fact they are very short, they do injustice to Lewis's thoughts on the subjects simply because the selection is not wide enough, and, especially on Grief, A GRIEF OBESERVED works so much better as a healing and theraputic book than this little tome ever could. If you're going to get into C. S. Lewis's thought, even if only a sampler, get something like THE BUSINESS OF HEAVEN or THE ESSENTIAL C. S. LEWIS or THE QUOTABLE LEWIS? Items like these characterize the industy that has grown up around C. S. Lewis: all sorts of merchandise is being published cashing in on Lewis and his life -- with Hooper largely at the back of it. If you want a novelty item (which is all this will ever be) or just a little gift I guess you could buy these, but why not spend a little more and buy a real C. S. Lewis book?

Dr. Brantley explains that the science of archaeology (as is true of any other science), is incapable of disproving or &quot;proving&quot; divine revelation. It does, however, offer fascinating cultural insights into what otherwise might be obscure or confusing texts. A must read for Christian teachers and preachers."},{"Title":"Digging for Answers: Has Archaeology Disproved the Bible?","review":"This is an outstanding work. I read quite a lot of theology and apologetic work in particular, and this is one of the most readable that I have ever come across. It should be read by all students taking courses in Old Testament Introduction or biblical archaeology, especially those in liberal colleges and seminaries.The book lays out the issues clearly, while acknowledging areas of difficulty for evangelical approaches to Old Testament Introduction and background issues. The approach is irenic for the most part, although Brantley does make clear the need to always examine the presuppositions of archaeologists and others working in areas where biblical studies and archaeology interact.The only caveat that I have with the title at the present time is that, due to its 1995 publication date, there have doubtless been some changes in the disciplines covered, so readers should do some additional reading in more current journal articles for updated information. This being said, Brantley's overall approach can be used as a guide when examining more recent research."},{"Title":"Photoshop 7 Killer Tips","review":"If you are looking for a 'How To' book, you may want to pick up one of the other fantastic Photoshop books recently published (my current favorite is Bert Monroy's - Wow! a must have for anyone looking for in depth Photoshop tips!).This book is a real treat! Even advanced users will find tips in here that will make them slap their heads and say 'Jeesh, I wish I had known that years ago!'I admit that at first, going through the very first few pages, it seemed there would not be much for someone already familiar with Photoshop. Then I read a tip about finding the center of any document. This is something that can be done fairly easily, but it takes a few minutes and time wasted is money lost!It turns out (as some of you probably know) all you have to do is have snap to guide turned on, create a new layer, fill it with your foreground color, drag a guide from the horizontal ruler - it automatically will snap to the center - and finally, drag a vertical guide - it too will snap to the center. Time saved and a perfectly positioned center of your document has been created in less then 30 seconds!Photoshop 7 Killer Tips is FULL of what I call Golden Nuggets just like this. It is a lot of fun to pick up the book and open it randomly. It never takes more then turning two or three pages before one of those slap your forehead tips presents itself.Have fun while you build your PS skills!

Each is given half of one page so the information is in concise form. You won't have to read a chapter to find out how to do the tip. Also, each tip contains at least one graphic to visually explain what is going on.The down side of this book is the way the Chapters are named and the tips indexed. If you are looking for a specific topic, you better know how the authors think because the Chapters have such names as Greased Lightnin' and Fast &amp; Furious. While these names are cute, they do nothing to help a reader locate what they need.Also the names of each tip in the Chapters are not listed in alphabetical order. For example, the first tip in Chapter 5, Fast &amp; Furious is Zoom Out for Sharper Web Images and the second to last is Exercising Your Influence on GIFs. Neither Zoom or Exercising tells you what the tip is about; you have to read the whole name. So even if they were in alphabetical order, it wouldn't help.The bottom line: Get the book if you want to do some reading to locate your needs.

I have had an original issue for over twenty five years, about as long a time as I have been collecting personal narratives of the revolutionary period. I have spent many days through the years in my office and living room armchair, and in dusty libraries winkling out articles snd passages from periodicals, both real time snd later, and from memoirs and autobiographies. The latter are often miscataloged (assuming that they were found in OCLC at all.}The work herein considered is one of the lengthier which covers exclusively the Revolution and well deserves reprinting. I found my copy in a pleasant little book store located in the courtyard of an old building a block or so from the Plaza in the center of Santa Fe, and around the corner from the courthouse.Willism B. Davis was a physician living in the American colony located in Guadalahara south of Mexico City on the Pacific coast. This was the largest gathering of American residents in the country sfter Mexico.In that time consuls were appointed in several ranks; the lowest of which was as an additional part time sideline; the individual was not on salary. The lower ranks were compensated by a percentage of the customs fees collected on items exported to the US. All consuls, regardless of rank, also served as a sort of diplomat, assisting US citizens and other foreigners alike in dealing with the local authorities. (The most well known part-time consul at the time, was George C. Carothers, who served as a sort of ambassador accompaning Pancho Villa on his campaigns during the Mexican Civil War which followed the Revolution.)During times of crisis during the revolution consuls of whatever rank, often interceded with the rebels and Federales alike in efforts to avoid collateral injury snd death resulting from the fighting, snd prevent pillage of the propery of foreign residents of whatever nationality.When the US occupied Vera Cruz in 1914, many of the American residents fled back to the US. As most contemporary reporting originated in El Paso, there was very little published exclusively in books snd articles on experiences in other parts of Mexico. Usually one finds a chapter or passage buried in a more wide ranging memoir.Numerous articles appeared in the daily press and in weekly and monthly periodicsls such as Collier's, the SEP, World's Work, and Outlook, a news magazine such as Newsweek used to be.This book covers only the Revolution and period of evacuation and thus should be found cataloged under F1234 in major university collections, however, it is well worth one's purchase rather than fiddling sbout with interlibrsry loans."},{"Title":"Finite State Morphology","review":"I was waiting for this book to be published. I've been waiting for its publication since I attended a finite state morphology course at XRCE instructed by Ken Beesley. The ability of Ken to describe complex issues and processes in simple terms and to build a clear path using step by step approach using many useful examples of what you should and should not do (and why!) is exceptional! This attitude is very much reflected in the book. Reading previous academic publications of Beesley and Karttunen will make one realize that these two know their business and that they know to describe it well.The book is intended for linguists and not for computer scientists. If you are interested to read about the theory of finite state technology, algorithms, and implementation issues then this is not the book. However, if you are a linguist planning to develop a system using finite state tools and you need an introduction to the subject, a tutorial for the xerox finite state tools and a lot of good and useful advice, this book is for you. Although this book's focus is on the Xerox finite state tools, much of the advice and tips given throughout the book is relevant to any finite state based project.The book explains why finite state methods in general (regular languages and regular relations) and the xerox finite state tools in particular are a good choice for describing and actually building lexical transducers (which can be further extended into applications such as a morphological analyzer and generator, spell-checker, part of speech disambiguator, and more based on the same technology). It then teaches you about the syntax and usage of the Xerox finite state tools and explains a lot about various aspects of development using helpful examples, exercises and wisdom. The book has a CD containing licensed software which enables you to actually build your own systems using the Xerox finite state tools.Although this book is a great text for any linguist using some finite state engine, it is specifically targeted at the xerox finite state tools. Note that the Xerox tools are not the only finite state tools available; Other implementations are available, notably FSA (http://odur.let.rug.nl/~vannoord/Fsa/) by Gertjan van Noord and AT&T;'s FSM toolset by Mohri, Pereira, Riley (http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/fsm). This is a good time to say that the software available on CD with the book is a commercial software and the license is very restrictive and allows you to basically try it for yourself and nothing beyone that. The software itself, on the other hand, is not crippled (so it is stated) in any way. If you are interested in a software for finite state programming which has a more relaxed license than FSA util, whose license is under the GPL, is what you're looking for.Quoting from the book: \\"The lesson is this: study the language and do some old-fashined pure linguistic modeling before jumping into the coding. Your programs will never be better than the linguistic model behind them.\\" And indeed, the book does not teach you linguistics. Don't be fooled that just being a native speaker and understanding the text in the book is enough to be able to produce a useful linguistic tool using xfst and lexc. It takes a lot more than that, and the result is usually as good and robust as its foundations.If you have some programming background note that finite state programming is very different than functional, object oriented or procedural programming. If you are familiar with Perl or unix like regular expressions, you will soon find out that the term 'regular' was severely abused on those systems, so the calculus described in the book is in many ways different: computationally weaker in some ways, more elegant in other ways. Nonetheless, linguists are bound to feel more comfortable with the Xerox tools' syntax as it was desined to suite the needs of linguists describing morphology and phonology.Years of experience teaching how to use the tools, using the tools for various implementation of morphological analyzers, and quite a few drafts of the text which eventually turned out and materialized as this book. The organization of the text, and the terminology used makes it easy for the reader to understand new concepts. Each term is defined, explained and then examples follow. Difficult concepts are releatedly explained throughout the book. This is a fun read and I enjoyed reading it. While reading the book, whenever I felt I needed a little more explanation or another example, I just had to keep reading as the needed information was just in the next paragraph.The first chapter is a gentle introduction to the concepts of finite state programming. The second chapter is a more systematic introduction. The exercises are useful for understanding the material. The third and fourth chapters explain xfst and lexc languages, respectively. The fifth chapter is a useful discussion about various aspects of a project and what pitfalls are expected along the way and which tools and techniques can be used to avoid or handle such pitfalls. Reading this chapter is just like reading the journal of a guru summarizing great tips. Chapter 6 on testing and debugging is yet another valuable source of information useful in many projects. The tips and lessons in chapters 5 and 6 are important to any software project, but especially using the Xerox tools, you will quickly see that the lack of a development environment and debugging tools and the flat structure of the code (allowing very limited ability to maintain your code as a set of \\"black box\\" parts with an easy interface) are a source for many problems. So following the good advice in these chapters is useful. Chapters 7 and 8 describe mechanisms implemented into the calculus which allow you to do some hacking into your code and do some \\"shortcuts\\" which allow some more expressiveness and some memory usage optimizations. Not many users will probably go ahead and use these features up front. Some may never use them at all. Chapter 9 describe useful tools and methods for automation and integration of your system as a component in a larger system.One thing I didn't like about the book: There are many issues mentioned in brief and a footnote tells you to go to the book's web site .... to read more about it. When you actually go to the site you discover that there is no trace or evidence of that information."},{"Title":"Baby Fun: Games and Activities to Promote Your Baby's Mental, Physical and Social Development (Play Laugh & Learn)","review":"When we had our baby my husband was really at a loss for how to interact with a baby. A lot of the things this book tells you to do are fairly common sense to me but were like complete news flashes to my husband. It is really nicely organized by age and easy to read quickly. I like how many of the toys, etc you can fashion yourself. Now that I look around I see tons of toys that achieve the same goals but it is nice to make things for my baby and way cheaper! As a teacher who has worked with many children with special needs I was really excited for how this book specifically helps develop sensory integration skills. My baby seems to be typically developing so far (but you never know) and would probably be fine regardless. But if your baby does develop issues with sensory integration it is really beneficial if you have been working on it with them from birth!All the exercises have been really enjoyable so far and we have just gotten started! The rolling side to side has been a lifesaver, whenever he gets suddenly upset it is a surefire distraction (used only of course when we know he has just been fed and has a clean diaper etc)"},{"Title":"All Hallow's Eve","review":"It's 1945, and coming out of a funk, Lester Furnival finds herself on Westminster Bridge in a seemingly deserted London. Confused, she decides to start walking and to find out what has happened to her and around her. As she wanders she comes across her friend and companion Evelyn and they decide to continue their travels together to find out what is causing or has caused their circumstances. It is during their travels that they realize that they have both just been killed during one of WWII's blitzkriegs.She has left behind her loving husband Richard, who, a month after her funeral is still suffering, and being unable to function at his job accepts a dinner invitation from his friend and popular artist Jonathan Drayton. Drayton has just completed a portrait of the hot new religious leader Clerk Simon that has been commissioned by Simon's acolyte Lady Wallingford, and Jonathan wants Richard's opinion of the painting.Lady Wallingford arrives to inspect the piece soon after Richard has arrived, and she is disturbed and displeased by the canvas. Outraged, she immediately cancels the engagement between her daughter Evelyn and Richard. Evelyn, cowed by her mother accepts the decision and both exit stage left leaving Jonathan shocked by Lady Wallingford's reaction.Secretly, Lady Wallingford is abusing her daughter and was just looking for an excuse to break the engagement as it would be just another reason to make Evelyn suffer. Unbeknownst to Lady Wallingford however, Simon Clerk will soon visit Richard, and after viewing Jonathan's portrait, Simon declares he likes it.Simon, who seems based on the then popular Alistair Crowley, practices black magician and he is very good at it. He's also very arrogant, and has plans, and those plans are to use his powers to take over the world. One of the things that he will use is Evelyn and her ability to astral project, even though this is killing her.At first this novel skips from one character to another, with one character taking up a whole long chapter, until later in the novel as the plot speeds up and the viewpoint starts to switch more quickly from character to another.And yet, despite having an intriguing and interesting plotline \\"All Hallows' Eve\\" is almost unreadable. One problem is that, simply, Williams just can not write. Oh, I'm sure that all the commas, periods and semi-colons are all in the right place, but the end result is an example of total incompetence in story-telling which Williams clutters up with some truly god-awful clumsy sentences.Williams favors long, long meandering paragraphs, some of which reach two pages and which will often wander from one point to another, as either the narrator or the author will was philosophically on something not even vaguely related to paragraph's original subject. The effect often being like being stuck at a bar with a verbose drunk who insists on telling a story, but who's attention keeps wandering all over the landscape. The reader will often just want to shake the narrator to get them to get it together and just get back to their point.As previously mentioned, Williams has an almost awesome ability to write some wrenched and incomprehensible sentences. An example would be \\"She could hardly there be said to have heard it.\\" Say what? And we can get sentence after sentence of this stuff combined into paragraph after paragraph, which turns into page after page of meandering, wandering, and obtuse writing, making the reading of this novel one slow slog.And then there are the novel's characters. Egads sir, they are truly one dull, uninteresting, or unsympathetic lot. And sometimes they can be all three at once. Lester is a rather characterless and distant person, who only gathers some interest late in the novel; Evelyn, who is Lester's counterpoint, is an empty, weak, sniveling, whiny coward, and who finds fault with everything and virtue in nothing. Lady Wallingford is a cruel, vicious, mean little toad and slug. Simon Clerk is just arrogant in the manner that only the entitled can truly be, and as emotionless and distant as an author can make a character.Only Richard and Jonathan show any character, willing to bet life and soul on the chance to save their loved ones. They suffer horribly however at the hands of one of literature's worst villains, the bad writer. Williams died in 1945 and this novel was published in 1948 and I can only wonder if \\"All Hallows' Eve\\" is a first draft, and that Williams died before he could give his prose the final polish that it so desperately needs.\\"All Hallows Eve\\" is all that is wrong with literary fantasy. Slow, glacial, and turgid, too long, obtuse and meandering, somberly pretentious, peopled with uninteresting characters, and way too full of, and reliant on, symbols and symbolism that will only be interesting or understandable to those with the ability to decipher them. Williams may have had something to say, but this Christian writer simply didn't seem to have the ability to tell a story so that this \\"something\\" could be appreciated. You really do expect more from a writer who was, along with C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, part of the Inklings writing group.This edition (William B. Eerdman, 1982) has a longish interesting introduction by T. S. Elliott in which he gives an informative, and emotional, eulogy to his friend, and is worth reading all on its own. In his introduction Elliott mentions that this novel needs to read multiple times to truly appreciate it. I have read it twice, and life is too short to give it another chance, too bad as this seems to be Williams best known work. I would only recommend it to those with severe heart conditions for whom watching grass grow would be a too strenuous entertainment."},{"Title":"All Hallow's Eve","review":"This is one of the greatest novels I've ever been forced to read in school.

For example, as you read through the rest of the reviews on this page you might want to bear in mind that:- The \\"baddy\\" - Simon the Clerk - is NOT \\"American\\", nor is he a \\"Satanist\\" and he doesn't practice \\"black\\" magic;- There are no lawyers in the book;- Betty is not simply Simon's \\"dupe\\", nor just the daughter of an acolyte;- Evelyn, one of the two \\"ghosts\\", has never been married;- The artist plans to marry Betty;- The civil servant is the husband of Lester, the second \\"ghost\\" (and for clarification Lester is indeed female);- Throughout the book \\"The city\\" is as often as not used metaphorically and does not always refer to the City of London (just sometimes!);- And Williams does NOT write about \\"parallel\\" worlds - he writes about worlds which intersect (this is an idea he visited in several of his books, most notably in \\"The Place of the Lion\\" and \\"The Greater Trumps\\");We also need to remember that although Williams was nominally a \\"mystical Roman Catholic\\", he was also heavily into outright occultism, albeit of the more benign kind.All Hallow's Eve is in fact October 31st, the \\"eve\\" of Halloween (also known to Roman Catholics as \\"All Hallows Day\\" or more usually \\"All Saint's Day\\"). In pagan terms, however, it is the old Celtic festival of Samhain - literally \\"summer's end\\", but more accurately autumn's end - equivalent to our \\"New Year's Eve\\" in that it symbolically marked the death of the fruitful old year and the onset of winter, with all that implied.It is widely recognised that Halloween, though its name has Christian origins (\\"All Hallow's Eve\\" -> \\"Hallow E'en\\" ->), is yet another case of a pagan festival being taken over by the Roman church in an attempt to obscure its original meaning/purpose.These connotations have a strong bearing on the basic storyline in Williams' book, which readers who only take account of the Christian elements of Williams' world view tend to overlook.I won't spoil it for you by detailing exactly how these various ideas fit together except to say that part of the mythology of Samhain, being a \\"feast of the dead\\", held that people who had died during the previous year were supposedly able - if they wished - to temporarily return to the land of the living to join in the celebrations with their family, tribe or clan.My personal feeling is that Simon the Clerk, despite being the pivotal figure in the plot, comes across as being a rather obvious \\"loser\\" from very early on in the story. The implication that he is immensely skilled as a sorcerer, with tremendous charisma which allows him to bend almost anyone to his will, just didn't seem believable to me.Having said that, I enjoyed the story as an entertainment, and did feel that the characters of Lester, Betty, Evelyn and Lady Wallingford were each developed (in line with their respective destinies) in a very satisfying way, even if Betty was a bit of a \\"late developer\\", so to speak.The reason I only gave the book three stars is that I can't say the same for the male characters - Richard, Jonathan and Simon - none of whom really got very far beyond the \\"cardboard cutout\\" stage.Still, it certainly isn't a waste of time, and no doubt I'll want to read it again sooner or later ;-)"},{"Title":"All Hallow's Eve","review":"If I could have rated this book lower than 1 star, I would have done so in a minute! In the 6 years that our book club has been together, I can think of only one other time that we ALL disliked a book so completely. Specifically, we had trouble understanding the point of the book (other than good vs evil), found his writing to be pedantic, and his characters without depth. I chose the book for our October read, to tie it in with Halloween. I should have chosen Charlie Brown's Great Pumpkin!"},{"Title":"All Hallow's Eve","review":"A decent \\"purgatorial\\" novel about the redemption of a soul and what it takes. I often found myself thinking of Lewis's space trilogy during the read especially the last volume. I'd put this on a reading list of books about the theology of purgation; The Divine Comedy, The Great Divorce, etc.At times I found Williams writing style a bit thick but I suspect that was intentional. I particularly enjoyed what seemed to be a slam on logical positivism and literary post-modernism in the character of the clerk.Some classify this as horror and perhaps it is but it wasn't really scary to me. In fact, the clerk just winds up looking like a boob. Maybe the scariest thing about it is the choice one of the characters makes for hell."},{"Title":"All Hallow's Eve","review":"This is my favorite of the seven \\"metaphysical thrillers\\" by the British writer Charles Williams, and one of my favorite books. Some say that it is the hardest read, but others say that about \\"Descent into Hell\\" (and I agree). Regardless, this is the best one; it is the last one he wrote (it was published posthumously) and apparently he had the other Inklings to give him advice. \\"Descent into Hell\\" is perhaps the best embodiment of his idea of \\"coinherence,\\" but it is here that you meet his depth of vision as a storyteller. If you have any interest in the writings of Charles Williams, you should definitely get this book."},{"Title":"All Hallow's Eve","review":"This is a good book or rather its part great and part a potboiler. Many who have lost a loved one have had similar spiritual experiences. Of course skeptics would regard these as hallucinations but no one who has had such an encounter would regard the skeptical explanation as satisfactory. Williams is able to beautifully describe this type of waking phenomenon. He also is able to create a nether world where the dead and the living may interact and where the recently departed actually work their final destiny based on their character in this life.Unfortunately a novel has to be about something and this is where the story, in my opinion, falters. The plot about a kabbalist magician who is trying to take over the world is hard to swallow and Williams doesn't seem to care about it enough to flesh it out. I wont speak further because I don't to give too much away to people who haven't read it.Despite this I would definitely read more of Williams's work since he seems to be writing about matters with which he has had some experience. This isn't the naturalistic fiction of Zola of Dreiser but for those who believe that its possible that \\"there are more things on Heaven and Earth than are dreamed of in our philosophy I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"All Hallow's Eve","review":"I have an older copy printed in 1948. This was my first Charles Williams. I was drawn to it by the introduction by C.S. Lewis. This is an excellent read yet, I too, have to admit one of the strangest books I've read all year. It is very well written.Each character in the book has to come to the realization of \\"their purpose\\" in life and/or death (as Lester and Evelyn's spirits couldn't move on until they figured this out).Meanwhile, everyone was being \\"necromanced\\" by the evil sorcerer Simon the Clerk. The City- not London all the time, is meant to be the heavens and also some sort of \\"charmed\\" circle in the roomp260 [they were in the city]p261[at that moment Betty entered the circle and the rain rushed in].I also like the way in which Williams portrays the demise of Simon,as his own vision of his own Hell-being consumed by GOD in the form of a ROSE an RAIN. Holy...rain? water the ultimate cleanser and as Satan hates water!You will not be disappointed in this book."},{"Title":"All Hallow's Eve","review":"This work of fiction by a colleague of C.S. Lewis et al is gripping, entertaining, amusing and challenging.It explores a world parrallel to our own and the interactions of it's inhabitants with ours.Charles Williams writes of the supernatural with the ease of familiarity, making the fantastic believable.I found the characters and their development convicting and caused me to examine myself critically.I recommend this and the other six novels by the same author to anyone interested in spiritual thrillers."},{"Title":"All Hallow's Eve","review":"Regent College has done us all a service by reprinting Charles Williams' best novel. Oddly enough, it's the one many readers have missed because it wasn't reprinted when Eerdmans brought out the various editions of his other half dozen novels. This is thinking man's(or woman's) Goth; there are more ideas in one chapter than in an entire Stephen King novel. Another difference is it's the Good and not evil that is truly terrifying (evil is a shade or shadow of the Good). The occultic plots are somewhat drawn from Williams' involvement in The Order of the Golden Dawn, a secret society headed by A.E.Waite, best known for the Waite Tarot Deck. Its members variously included poet W.B.Yeats (known for his poem, &quot;The Second Coming&quot;) and Evelyn Underhill, author of Mysticism. At one point, Aleister Crowley, the self-styled &quot;Great Beast,&quot; attempted to wrestle control of The Golden Dawn, and one can only speculate what the outcome would have been had the many converts to Crowley's &quot;Magick&quot; have stumbled on Williams' books instead. Instead of &quot;Mr. Crowley,&quot; would Ozzy be singing &quot;Mr. Williams?&quot; Instead of buying Crowley's mansion and opening occult bookstores to propagate his teachings, would Jimmy Page have renovated Williams' tiny flat and opened Golden Dawn branches all over England? Would &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; be about the Web of Souls and Exchange and the Way of Affirmation and vicariously bearing burdens and the Holy Graal and coinherence and all the rest of Williams' dazzling ideas? Who knows? But this reader joins the many who, having encountered Charles Williams, will never be the same."},{"Title":"All Hallow's Eve","review":"I agree with all the 1-star reviewers. Paragraphs never end, and Williams keeps saying the same things over and over again. The most interesting character was the little deformed 'dwarf woman' and the croaking sounds she made in lieu of speech. I scared myself trying to make sounds like she must have made. That was the worst scare this book gave me. Simon is a pretty lame excuse for pure evil. He is easily defeated, and he looks like an 'imbecile,' according to several characters and the author himself. There was not much to like about this book."},{"Title":"All Hallow's Eve","review":"No one joins the worlds of the natural and the supernatural as well as Charles Williams. In his book, \\"All Hallows Eve,\\" the author achieves this union of the seen and the unseen in a riveting fashion. He also leads to his triumphant conclusion through the willing sacrifice of one person, inviting us to understand that the offering of self up for the good is often the only means to eternal joy."},{"Title":"All Hallow's Eve","review":"This is a short one, only ~200 pages. Don't let that deceive you; it will take you a while to read!This is a dense little book, surprising, exciting, well worth your time. Charles Williams's stories remind me of C.S. Lewis, but they are actually very different. I can see the influence that Williams had over Lewis, particularly in That Hideous Strength. Like that book, All Hallows' Eve is weighed down with a sense that Something Big is happening: something that will transcend individual lives.I usually read right before bed, and this book is a little too complex for that. I can only read a few pages before my exhausted college student brain starts to shut off. So, I have to read this book when I'm awake. But that isn't the book's problem, it's my problem!This is a good book that will require some concentration on your part. Don't let that stop you."},{"Title":"All Hallow's Eve","review":"I had high expectations of and genuinely looked forward to reading \\"All Hallows' Eve,\\" knowing that the author, Charles Williams, was one of the famous Inklings, a small literary group that included the great J.R.R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis. If you're a fan of Tolkien or Lewis, dial down your expectations for \\"All Hallows' Eve.\\"I know I will not win any plaudits or \\"Recommend this review\\" for my review, but this is my honest reaction, so take it for what it's worth.The book, as any one reading this no doubt has already gathered, is about a twilight world inhabited by the souls of the dead, which is beside our world of the living. In fact, the entire first chapter is about one of the characters, a recently-deceased woman named Lester, who just realized she has died and is wandering the twilight version of London. The chapter, as is the entire book, is composed of very very long paragraphs about Lester's \\"inner life\\" of meandering thoughts. This alone should be a warning to any potential reader that this book is not reader-friendly.The rest of the book is about how the twilight world intersects with the world of the living, centering on 7 characters. They are Lester & her friend Evelyn (an unpleasant character), both of the twilight world; Lester's husband, Richard; a friend of Richard, an artist named Jonathan; Jonathan's paramour, Betty; Betty's adopted mother, an imperious Lady Wallingford; and Father Simon, aka Simon Le Clerc (Simon the Clerk). The latter pretends to be a Christian minister, but is really a sorcerer, magus, or magician who practices the dark arts of the occult. Simon wields a hynoptic mesmerizing power over his \\"congregation,\\" including Lady Wallingford. Simon also means to take over & rule both worlds.Since I'm an academic, I'm used to reading dense & reader-unfriendly writing. But I found myself unable to get through this book. I do not care for Charles Williams' writing (the long paragraphs & the focus on a character's interior life). I found the main characters to be unappealing & unengaging; I could not even find ONE character whom I like. One of the reviewers here lauded the book on its use of & descriptions of two paintings by Jonathan. While I concur, that only made me compare \\"All Hallows' Eve\\" to Oscar Wilde's \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\" Alas, the comparison is not to Charles Williams' favor."},{"Title":"All Hallow's Eve","review":"This probably qualifies as the strangest book i've read all year. I was reminded of Williams by reading C.S. Lewis's letters; i had read one of his books before, \\"Descent into Hell\\" i think, and remembered the strangeness, but this really is amazing. How many other books do you know in which one of the two main characters is dead, in which the dead and living can communicate almost as easily as we do every day, in which magic is serious and scary? Mainstream books, that is, not Goosebumps, with an introduction by T.S. Eliot, with the whole thing to be understood as at least feasible if not truth. This is unusual. And yet, and yet the whole thing works. It is the story of two dead women, killed during an air raid on war-torn London, and the choices they make ~ or the choices they made while alive ~ and how they affect the world of the still living. It is also the story of an evil (American) magus, Simon, who practises (actually, he's very good at it) real black magic. His desire to rule the world, and the plan he has to use his daughter to gain the power to do so, is in the end defeated by Lester, one of the dead women, her husband, his friend, and the friend's fianc&eacute;e ~ Simon the Clerk's daughter. The evil is real, overbearing, even, though it is bizarre; one gets the idea that all the Clerk does is feasible, that Williams has experienced evil in his life, that he knows whereof he writes. The descriptions of the dead, of the City they inhabit (both London and not-London), are also real, persuasive; Williams must have had some foreknowledge, one feels, to write the way he wrote. Reading him takes quite an investment, of time, of thought, of disbelief suspension; it is, however, well worth the cost: The payoff is a gripping book, plenty of thought, and a clearer vision of life. I shall have to read another Williams, but perhaps not too soon."},{"Title":"All Hallow's Eve","review":"Published in 1945 and still in print, this is the last of the novels of Charles Williams, who along with J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis was one of the Oxford literary group the Inklings. The recent increase in popularity of his fiction, initially boosted by his association with the Inklings, is probably due to the current success of the Frank Peretti thrillers, and the LaHaye-Jenkins 'Left Behind' series. However, in contrast to the current populists Mr Williams is intellectually quite a demanding read.All Hallows Eve is another Williams ghost story, gently told in his own highly unorthodox style. Two young women have been killed in an accident in the aftermath of the WWII air raids on London, but their ghostly participation in the story is as real as that of any of the living people. It is probably fair to say that this novel, as with most Charles Williams fiction, is not recommended for the overly sensitive person, and could easily be misinterpreted the overly hasty.Simon LeClerk is a powerful mage, more a Saruman than a Gandalf, and his plan is domination of this world and - more worryingly - any other that he can access. His adoring acolytes form the powerbase of his support for a new world religion. Betty, daughter of one of these acolytes, is the unwilling dupe of the magician, and the key subject in his most daring and horrible experiment. An artist is the bereaved husband of Evelyn, one of the ghosts, and a civil servant is Betty's intended husband.The characters have depth and robust individual style. While many an author can paint real villains doing convincingly bad things, Williams is unusual in that his good characters and their goodness are equally if not more convincing. Their goodness is genuinely felt and is strongly attractive. There is no hint that the villains have all the fun or that the author really has little idea of how to portray true goodness, or even what it is.From this novel I also gained a valuable insight into the true nature and function of art. Rather like 'The Picture of Dorian Gray', two of the artist's paintings play a pivotal part in the story. The artist manages in one picture to catch and portray something of a hidden truth about the city of London, and in the other something about the magician himself (who approves of the picture). As these things could not be captured by any mere photograph, the art has to say what can best be said, or perhaps only be said, in a painting."},{"Title":"All Hallow's Eve","review":"While the premise of ghosts as major characters took a little bit to adjust to, I found that Williams developed supernatural characters and a supernatural world that seemed as solid and &quot;real&quot; as the natural world. It is a wonderful novel that explores so many deep concepts - heaven and hell, the reality of the supernatural, the nature of evil and its limitations, body and soul,... In fact, the main difficulty with the novel is the fact that it explores so many deep questions, and dwells so much on the inner thoughts of the characters. These aspects make the novel a difficult (yet rewarding) read. I found that I needed several hours of completely uninterrupted time to really get into the novel. Then, I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"All Hallow's Eve","review":"Whatever your ideas of heaven and hell, they will never be the same after reading Charles Williams. Whether the new images will be comfortable or not is another question. In some ways Williams's picture of heaven is, if anything, more frightening than the conventional depiction of hell. It's certainly considerably more compelling. His dead protagonist was one scared woman--and so was I, for most of the novel. In &quot;All Hallows' Eve&quot; Williams gives his eschatological images expression in their leanest, purest form, mingled with other terrific and similarly life-threatening images of the war that was then engulfing the world. Read it!"},{"Title":"All Hallow's Eve","review":"Creepiest book I've ever read. The occult, the dead, evil magicians, ordinary colourless people, and a conspiracy of a changing malevolent world order just beneath the surface of things.The story arc is difficult to describe, but the two lead characters are dead girls operating in a depopulated limbo, with occasional glimpses of where they are heading (Hell and Heaven) and where they have been (the mortal world). Secondary characters include well-intentioned, but hapless young men, an evil grand dame, her suppressed daughter, and a monster of a necromancer intent on enslaving humanity and the dead alike.Williams narrative style borrows much from philology, for the precise and poetic way in which he uses words lulls us into other worlds. This is in fact his thesis, that words are a link to another world, which is why spells and prayers are effective beyond their mere utterance. One wonders what Heidegger and Wittgenstein would have thought, for this is the novelisation and narrative explication of Heidegger's conceptions of being-there, and the refutation of the reductionism inherent in wordly precision that Wittgenstein refuted his own Tractatus and sought the rest of his life in the elusive and indefinable power of mytho-poetic language.Soft souls avoid, for this is a challenging supernatural read."},{"Title":"All Hallow's Eve","review":"All Hallows Eve starts with a detailed scene of a young woman standing at night in a park waiting for her fiance to arrive. She knows that even if he arrives, he will not see her, as she is dead. She has been killed by a 2nd World War aircraft that has just fallen on her. The remainder of the book chronicles her various encounters with strange indivduals, one of whom, of course, is a Satan figure. Williams points discretely and concretely to the presence of God --but of course the reader does not feel set upon by any pentecostal fervor. All of Charles Williams&quot; books entered the scene apropol of the times. Now, seventy years later at the turn of the century, they seem more appropriate than ever. It's really too bad that the publisher has allowed this book to go &quot;out of print&quot;, since (1)Charles Williams was a major literary figure of his time, and knew T.S. Eliot, George MacDonald and C.S. Lewis--and they knew and appreciated him as an author and religious mystic. Williams believed he was always in contact with the supernatural or &quot;the other side&quot; --and believed that death was an illusion and delusion. Apparently individuals in the publishing &quot;industry&quot; are only concerned with the immediate profits that they can read on the bottom line. May all of you be visited with some particularly illustrative ghosts. If you read Charles Williams, you will come to conclude that you are not crazy, but have encountered a perception that you can think of as utterly, terrifyingly real. Good luck Charles Williams, whose ever living room desk you are stiting at these days."},{"Title":"All Hallow's Eve","review":"All Hallows Eve starts with a detailed scene of a young woman standing at night in a park waiting for her fiance to arrive.

And he does this without resorting to traditional western occult conventions or by trying to frighten or mystify anyone. This story includes some characters who are alive and some who are dead, some are magicians and some are lawyers. And yet, they are all treated with the same emphasis and value, their motives and feelings are well within our understanding. Their lives intersect and interesting things happen.Williams has a very christian theology but christian tradition discourages any interest in the occult. William's writings are doubly fascinating for this."},{"Title":"All Hallow's Eve","review":"This is a ghost story, but not a horror story. You may get chills reading it, but not always from \\"the creeps\\". On the other hand, you may finish it wondering just what the heck you just read. I submit to you All Hallows' Eve-- definitely not for everybody.All Hallows' Eve is Charles Williams' last novel, written and set in WW2 England. It starts shortly after the tragic deaths of two women friends, Evalyn and Lester, in a bizarre collision, and neither is aware at first that they have died. They wander a weirdly deserted London separately for a brief time before meeting up, which gives the author an opportunity to focus on Lester's inner spiritual journey as she slowly confronts some unattractive truths about herself and her important relationships with her husband and her friends. In a separate but intersecting storyarc, Lester's surviving husband and his artist friend cross paths with a popular cult leader, Simon Le Clerc. This disturbing figure has a hidden past that is revealed only to us, the readers, as the plot unfolds. He is shaping up to be something not unlike an antichrist of sorts who is conducting covert, occultic experiments on the artist's love interest, Betty Wallingford, who is the daughter of one of Le Clerc's most devoted followers.Williams makes use of Betty's nighttime passages to scratch the surface of an alternate universe which Evelyn, Lester and (presumably) other newly-deceased inhabit. It is simply described as the City, and although it bears a surface resemblance to London, it is more of an infrastructure to London, or perhaps the Platonic Ideal of London...possibly something more. Many things in this realm tantalize us with glimpses of hidden spiritual truths, and time itself seems to have no linear requirement; past, present and future flashbacks occur without regard to conventional order. I was left with the sense that I would have liked to discover more about this City, and as this is my first Williams novel, who knows..he may indeed refer to it in his other stories.I'm not sure what sort of person would be best prepared to read this final Charles Williams novel. The author (an Anglican, or so I've read) clearly gives his audience much credit, as he allows us to draw our own conclusions about either the allegorical or the literal truths he dallies with along the storyline; he never force-feeds or \\"preaches\\". Somebody moderately educated in various religious history and/or theology would recognize a lot of the hints and references Williams makes along the way to telling his story. I wouldn't say that you must be a Christian to appreciate it, but it might help. On the other hand, I would only recommend this book to a mature Christian who has some direct study of the bible under his belt and yet a non-legalistic attitude toward their christian fiction. Certainly the reader would benefit from an ability to appreciate mysticism.All Hallows' Eve was recommended to me by A Reader's Delight, which appeals to readers who crave rare literary treasures from various genres. Williams' writing style is rich and many-layered, so that I may have to read All Hallows' Eve several times to extract everything I should from it in time.

If we were to actually listen to the voice of Nature with sensitivity and intuition, we are told, we would hear lessons as fine as in any opus spoken with words. Ann Ree Colton wrote, \\"The smallest cognition of Nature openeth the fiery chain of universal becoming.\\"Among the many things she tells of are the role of the seasons, spiritual radiations from mountains, correspondences between thoughts and trees, the role of poisonous plants relieving the earth of poisonous emotions, how snow purifies our sight and promotes an intangible agreement between peoples.

If you want the low down on the Rhodesian war then read Chris Cocks's excellent account \\"Fireforce\\" or Charlie Warrens \\"At the going down of the sun\\".

It's written from the common soldier's point of view. That's significant for two reasons. He didn't serve in an elite unit like the SAS, Selous Scouts, or the RLI (Rhodesian Light Infantry) so what you've got here is a good story from a draftee (national serviceman), an \\"average joe\\". With that comes the sort of disgruntled outlook that you might expect from a somewhat disinterested conscript. It's a definite departure from books written by Charlie Warren, Chris Cocks, and Dennis Croukamp. I'm sure that sounds more harsh and unfair than I intended. This is not a story about a hard driving light fighter, but about an introverted kid thrown into the arena of combat with everyone else. The book is beautifully written, but at times, the smugness can get on your nerves. [In fairness to the author, he recognizes this \\"smugness\\" and charges it to youth.] His guilt about killing was a little taxing at times. It was war. You kill people because people are trying to kill you. That's all there is. Still, that's not enough to detract from the book and I heartily recommend it. Very good! Oh, I forgot the technical stuff.

The varied characters taking refuge at her inherited eastern Sicily residence make for an enjoyable read. Her interactions with locals, (including an alleged mafioso) give the reader a unique perspective into the country's citizens and their way of life on an ancient island that time has forgotten."},{"Title":"House in Sicily","review":"This book was easy to read and engaging. Her descriptive characters leaped off the page. I chuckled several times though this book. It did, however, seem that sometimes the full account was not there: As if she had left out some pertinent part of the story. This is my second time reading it and am enjoying it as much as the first."},{"Title":"Love Lyrics in Light and Shadow","review":"I received my copy of &quot;Love Lyrics in Light and Shadow&quot; and was immediately so engrossed I read it all in one sitting. Before I was finished I had tears running down my cheeks. Helen Gordon manages to speak directly to so many of the common experiences we all have in life that I was amazed. Even my husband,who never reads poetry, was impressed. This author is one talented lady!"},{"Title":"Injury-Free Horse","review":"If you are interested in learning not only how to avoid injury to your horse but improve performance, you would do well to take the practical and well-thought out advice offered by this well-respected and credentialed human and equine physiotherapist. Even the spiral binding was considered so to allow one to take it to the barn and lay it open while you practice the many simple yet effective techniques Ms. Sutton covers beside many helpful photos. As in all healthcare, in order to determine what abnormal is, one must start with a clear understanding of normal. While this may seem like \\"stating the obvious,\\" I come across enough horseowners for whom such things bear repeating. To focus solely on this, is to miss the overall value and important information this book contains. Beside massage and stretching regimens for the horse, stretching and warm up exercises for the rider are also included, so horse and rider function as a more physically harmonious unit vs. separate elements. Chock full of practical tips from hoof balance to suppling exercises, you would do well to own this book."},{"Title":"Injury-Free Horse","review":"This book is a slow read and not the most comprehensive or useful book on this topic. Mostly it covers massage and stretching. It goes over evaluation of the normal horse, identifying problems, preventing problems, massage, exercise therapy, and specific regimes for specialist disciplines. A specific regime is not included for jumpers. The massage section had lots of pictures and showed you, step-by-step, how to do it. Not worth it for me."},{"Title":"Injury-Free Horse","review":"I did not find this book helpful in any way and do not recommend purchasing it for your library. What the author considers helpful tips are statements of the obvious. For example in the Suppling Exercises Applied chapter, a Tip from the author is: &quot;You can rest yourself and the horse in between each exercise, or just continue into the next one straightaway.&quot; Advice such as &quot;blankets should fit correctly&quot; is equally ridiculous. There are many other excellent books to use as resources - feel free to pass on this one."},{"Title":"Injury-Free Horse","review":"This book is a \\"What it is\\" book rather than a \\"How to and Why to do it\\" book. The preface explains why: the author notes that in the UK it is ILLEGAL for horse owners to apply medical/specialized knowledge without the permission of a veterinarian. So- there is no detailed information, just a description of the problem and a description of the treatment. Not extremely useful."},{"Title":"Beautiful butterflies","review":"Beautiful ButterfliesBuy this book, you won't be disappointed. The prints are gorgeous!"},{"Title":"Beautiful butterflies","review":"There is a short introduction about collecting exotic butterflies but the real prize in this book has over 100 spectacular prints. These are excellent artists prints not photos presented with species name and a description. This isn't really a guide to butterflies or a biological reference. Think more along the lines of what Audobon illustrations did for birds. The only draw back is that the lilac cloth cover is a magnet for filth. It has deteriorated on most copies. I see from a check around the Internet that people like to dismantle this book and frame the prints. A copy with a trashed cover makes a tempting candidate for disassembling. Good idea if you have the framing materials. A little hint though, the pages aren't absolutely acid free and tone to a cream color. Not bad, but don't use a harsh white backing and silver frames."},{"Title":"The Amazon papers","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was humorous, and Iliked the characters. However, there were a few setbacks. I foundthe beginning somewhat boring, but it was enough to keep me going, and the rest was certinly entertaining. I would recommend The Amazon Papers for some good light reading."},{"Title":"The Amazon papers","review":"The cover and title of this book turned me off, but after reading a couple of chapters, I couldn't put it down!! It's really funny! I do think to really appreciate the one-liners and situations, the reader should be 13 to 17. Younger kids just wouldn't get the humor. Iris is hysterical, and the characters play off each other so well you wish you could meet them after you're done the book. It's hard to find a humorous young adult novel. If you appreciate funny books, don't pass this one up."},{"Title":"The Amazon papers","review":"This book wasn't good, it was rather boring and plain really...the writing style was average and could be found in any other book...the situations given were under average and could be found in any other dull book...this could have been a great book...just seemed over edited...if you know what I mean. A mere 100 or so pages just doesn't cut this out as a good book to read...another teenage heart throb book, just plainer and just plain boring. Just like cake without the icing and candles."},{"Title":"The Amazon papers","review":"How could what had happened in this book have happened at all? This is what you really call a fictional book. I was enchanted with the summary of a teenager going through those akward years, but found this book to be more about babysitting a little kid, and dealing with the kid. For simple minded females, this may just be the book you're looking for"},{"Title":"The Amazon papers","review":"This book was so short, that when I finished it, it felt like the author didn't bother to sum up a little ending at all. There was nothing that enticed me to finish and complete the book, unless you count the length. And what is it with the character? Is she a brainiac who hates members of the opposite sex? Or is she a sex crazed female who's so bubbleheaded that she can't even pay attention to her customers? This book was confusing, and nothing tied up to a complete ending. Though, the cover was nice."},{"Title":"The Amazon papers","review":"When I read Amazon Papers. I loved it! I couldn't wait to turn the page and see what kind of trouble Iris, get's herself into, also their is a romance aspect in the book that makes you think could these two get together. But it is not one of those gushy romance novels. It was very down to earth, and could easily happen to a teen ager."},{"Title":"The Amazon papers","review":"If you like non-stop, action packed books with unexpected endings you will love Amazon Papers by Beverly Keller. This book will keep you curious until the end, constantly wondering what the quirky characters will get themselves into next. Iris, a fifteen-year-old tomboy, who has never broken curfew in her life, gets herself ankle deep in trouble when her mother and her cousin leave her home for a week with her two nephews. Her Aunt Blanche, who is supposed to stay nights with the three kids, comes down with the flu and puts all responsibility on Iris. The trouble starts when Iris agrees to go on a date with Foster, a high school drop out, who works at the local pizza place. Foster's hearse breaks down and Iris volunteers to drive her mother's car, even though she does not have a license. When they arrive at the pool hall, Foster runs into his ex-girlfriend, Zelma, who not only gets Foster kicked out but breaks Iris' foot during a tantrum. Iris is forced to leave her mother's car in the parking lot and gets a ride from Zelma. Overnight her mother's car gets broken into and hundreds of dollars of parts are taken. Iris must now figure out a way to take care of the two toddlers, keep the car a secret from her mother and her Aunt, and all with a broken foot. Beverly Keller is a talented author who paints pictures for her readers. She describes the characters so in depth that you can see them in your head. She describes Aunt Blanche as the following; \\"She still wears Chanel suits with straight skirts and little straight jackets, that she picks up from thrift stores and consignment shops. She stands about five feet six in the canvas faux espadrilles she buys at the payless shoe source. Her hair is thick and wild and showing no gray, her face bears a disconcerting resemblance to that of Caesar Augustus.\\" Her writing is easy to follow and very down to earth. She uses unique wording to get an image portrayed. \\"...the parking lot desolate, with the vehicles looming like shadowy hulks of defunct Paleolithic beasts.\\" This scene is one that you really have to think about but the wording makes is all that more interesting. Amazon papers ends with a twist making you want to know more. I would recommend this book to anyone who has the patience to deal with the characters and their many troubles."},{"Title":"The Amazon papers","review":"This book is easy and short, which may appeal to weak and young readers looking for something easy, but for people who want an interesting and entertaining book to read, this is not it. Look elsewhere, anywhere else but with this book. The romance (what romance?) was dry, the situations were not believeable, and I just hate the babysitting parts, she let the kid go around crazy. Not a good example."},{"Title":"The Amazon papers","review":"I thought this book was very good overall. the begining was boring but it got much better. It was a little short though. This book would probably be good for someone who just wants a short read.

Revel's astute analyses include the observations that European culture was stagnant and that Europeans were hopelessly uninformed on the United States. Even more alarmingly, Revel reveals that already at that time the European elites were projecting their guilt and self-loathing for their own imperialistic past onto the USA. The author also explores the idea of revolution, distinguishing mere revolts that lead to worse oppression from revolutions that bring individual freedom and progress.He identifies 5 conditions & 5 solutions prerequisite for a successful revolution. There must be critiques of: 1 injustice in economic, social & racial relationships 2 management against the waste of human & material resources 3 political power, both its sources and exercise 4 culture, morality, religion, customs, art and the function of these in society 5 the old civilizational sanction and vindication of individual freedom. Revel then explains why a true revolution can take place only in the United States.Chapters 4, 5 & 6 investigate to the impossible revolution in the communist nations, in Western Europe and in the Third World. The following chapter looks at the history of revolutions whilst the next focuses on national sovereignty, international relations, multilateral & bilateral agreements and wasteful military expenditures. Revel also devotes a chapter each to violence & revolution and to the one-way street from freedom to socialism, a subject on which Hayek's Road to Serfdom remains the classical text.The phenomenon of Anti-Americanism about which he wrote a mostperceptive and witty bookin 2003, is dealt with in chapter 11. He identifies two basic kinds of anti-Americanism and subjects its causes and symptoms to close scrutiny. In this chapter he provides ample examples of its emotionally unhinged nature, its puerile sense of grievance, lack of logic,anti-Zionistand anti-Semitic undertones. America has faithfully followed its democratic institutions while Europe produced the Shoah/Holocaust, Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini, murderous collectivist ideologies and two world wars.Revel points out that the cultural is the most humiliating form of defeat. The envy & resentment arising from that fuel much of the irrational anti-Americanism found amongstEuropean elites. Several examples of verbatim conversations are provided in order to demonstrate the puerile and contradictory nature of this hatred of America. Since then, the phenomenon has grown as recorded by amongst others Andre Markovits, Bruce Bawer, Barry Rubin, David Horowitz, Paul Hollander, Jamie Glazov andCarol Gould. In addition, its close connection to anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism has become more explicit.Chapters 12 & 13 cover the dynamics of revolution and the information revolution respectively. Interestingly, Revel claims that opinions formed byPropagandaare as easy to destroy as they are to create; counterpropaganda can in one day destroy what it took the state 20 years to fabricate. I found this of interest in relation to Eric Hoffer's claim in The True Believer that propaganda only serves to reinforce existing beliefs. Chapter 15: The Rights & The Means, provides evidence of the manifold means available to US citizens to defend their constitutional rights against the federal, state or municipal governments.The final chapter which provided the title concludes that the only real revolution is taking place in America; a revolution involving culture, economic and technological power. Technological civilization is accepted as a means not an end. This revolution seeks not to destroy but to reshape society.Mary McCarthy'sAfterword is flattering to Revel as iconoclast, a witty and enjoyable read but ultimately a bit shallow and devalued by her ideological bias. Revel tactfully but effectively refutes her obscurantism in the Author's Note to the American Edition, especially brilliantly on the definition of revolution.I highly recommend Revel's How Democracies Perish along with his Anti-Americanism as well asMenace in Europeby Claire Berlinski andWhile Europe Sleptby Bruce Bawer that expose the perilous situation of Europe. The ongoing attempt by progressives to subvert the US system is informatively examined by Jonah Goldberg in Liberal Fascism while two books by the French philosopher Chantal Delsol diagnoses the current malaise of Europe with great empathy: Icarus Fallen andThe Unlearned Lessons Of the Twentieth Century: An Essay On Late Modernity."},{"Title":"Without Marx or Jesus: The new American Revolution has begun (Laurel editions)","review":"FIRST published in English in 1971, this classic work on US society and the nature of revolution proved to be prescient in many respects.

Clearly, there is something wrong about *that* scenario, LOL.It turns out that \\"revolution\\" to Revel simply means a more permissive, liberal and postmodern form of the status quo. He likes Playboy, mass consumerism and nuclear power. The author even calls for a World Government! You heard me. He doesn't like Cuba, however.I stopped reading this half-way. Honestly, what's the point? In effect, Revel is suggesting that hamburgers and french fries are \\"revolutionary\\". He is something as original as a pro-American hippie liberal.Nice try, Jean.

This is an older book and Debbie Macomber's writing has really evolved. I read the Wyoming Kid first which has the same characters but focuses on Joy and Lonny (Letty's brother). The story also occurs several years later than in this book. In Demim and Diamonds, there are passages that are amazingly the same as in The Wyoming Kid. There is part of the story that occurs in both books. That being said, I still enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"DENIM AND DIAMONDS","review":"What I love about Debbie Macomber's stories are the warm community settings centered around church. As I read along, I become immersed into the town and its residents feel like they're my real-life friends. After finishing the story, I'm always left with the wish that I lived in such a welcoming environment surrounded by such caring friends! That's what made this quick-reading story so enjoyable!Debbie Macomber usually breaks away from the tense and tired formula of other romance novels, and has her protagonists resolve their problems in a mature and respectful manner. Unfortunately, that was not the case in this older story. Although intrisically good and decent men, both Lonny and Chase were so embittered by past hurts that their words and actions were driven by a stubborn pridefulness which made them rather unlikeable. They lashed out with such venom towards the woman in the story that love came across as hate. All of their problems could have been better addressed through open and honest communcation, particularly if Letty had been upfront about why she returned to her hometown. I was a bit disappointed by this hostility, as I've grown to expect more positive and constructive interactions between Macomber's characters."},{"Title":"DENIM AND DIAMONDS","review":"Once again Debbie has a way with humor.

Rance and Mattie are the parents of four kids, Trish, Gray, Jake and Tuck. The Rivers family is scratching out a hardscrabble living by milking, planting cotton and baling hay. There's been no significant rainfall in years and the family is in danger of losing everything.The author uses Jake for his point of view. Jake is awkward and feels inadequate around his older brother Gray, but finds success on the baseball diamond in the summertime.The book has nothing to do with water and everything to do with the lack of it, both literally and figuratively.Although the book seemed to start a little slow for me, once I got into the RIVERS' FLOW, I couldn't put it down.

He transports us back to the way things really were in hard times and good times. As we witnesses the evolution of Jake, the main character, from an insecure boy to a confident young man, we are reminded of what's important in life and what isn't.

He brought back long forgotten memories. Thanks to this book, I can now remember things about my Cowboy-ish grandfather that I had forgotton.

I remember how a cotton field felt and looked - How an old grocery store could feel musty and comfortable at the same time.If you want to connect to your childhood - especially if you grew up in rural America in the 30's, 40's or 50's - this is a must read. Because of this book I have connected with my parents and grandparents in a way that hasn't happend in 15 years. Thank you Mr. Ainsworth."},{"Title":"In The Rivers' Flow","review":"Jim Ainsworth has captured life the way I remember it. Small town. Rural countryside. Poor farmers. Fighting to endure. Hoping to exist. Picking cotton. Baling hay. In those days, we weren't worried about hard times on the farm. Times were just as hard for everyone we knew. No one complained. We all just kept working, even the little guys, and I was one of the little guys. But, as was once written, we didn't know we were poor because we didn't know anyone was rich. Upon that tapestry, Jim Ainsworth has crafted a beautifully told tale of the Rivers family living on a hardscrabble farm. He knows how to tell a good story. He knows how to create characters that become our own family or at least our own neighbors. We meet them \\"In the Rivers' Flow.\\" It seems as though we have known them all of our lives. For the younger brother, Jake, baseball is his only outlet. On a baseball diamond, he can leave the hard times behind. He can find a measure of success. He finds a way to win. Baseball makes a difference in his life. He may be insecure in the cotton patch. He finds confidence with a baseball in his hand. Jim Ainsworth transports us back to the 1950s, a time when families stuck together and depended on each other. They met hard times and good times with the same stoic face. Neither good nor bad ever lasted for very long. Now Jim Ainsworth has made sure that the glorious time of the '50s will be around forever. If you want to feel good about yourself and the world around you, read \\"In the Rivers' Flow.\\" The Rivers family will make you glad that you came along for the read."},{"Title":"In The Rivers' Flow","review":"Awww.

If you read the book, you'll see what I mean."},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse","review":"EVERYONE should read this book. I find Matthiessen's writing style to be exceptionally readable and entertaining strictly on literary merits, and the topic here is riveting and disturbing. Matthiessen's pro-Indian bias in this book will be apparent to many, but nevertheless, this book's presentation of well documented evidence speaks for itself, and for Peltier's obvious railroading in a sham 'trial'. Admittedly, it may take two reads of this book to fully absorb all the information - there is a lot in there.When I first learned of Peltier's case, I was very skeptical (actually, disbelieving) of his claims. But my associates with Amnesty International encouraged me to check into the facts, the court records, legal documents, etc, and I was so utterly shocked at what I discovered, I had to change my position 180 degrees."},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse","review":"This book was on my reading list 10 plus years ago. I read it, loved it, and used the information in it widely. I've come back for another read because of the Tribal Elder in South Dakota who went to the nearest hospital in a (Rez town) for a major open heart surgery, and he was told to F off when he asked for pain pills, and he kept complaining about pain where there shouldn't have been any. His family was smart and took him home. When they changed his dressings, they found that some one in that hospital (all Caucasian) had carved KKK into his chest and belly. This book can't help monsters like them, but the rest of the American public needs to get meticulously educated on who was here first, and how we as a nation owe a debt, we can't repay."},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse","review":"THIS BOOK WAS LISTED TO BE IN GOOD CONDITION.

A++++++++++"},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse","review":"Although he admits his sympathies are with the Indians, the author has produced a remarkably thorough and sound case against the FBI's reign of terror against the American Indian Movement. But has the exposure in this book or other outrageous incidents throughout history made much difference when it comes to the acts of the white man? Sadly, no. In reality, nothing can ever make it right again. Will Leonard Peltier eventually be free? I doubt there is a white man or black man, for that matter, who has the courage to do so. I fear that only in death will that happen. Make no mistake, though, Peltier is no hero...and no martyr...but just another high-profile symbol of the injustices against Indians in this white man country. Although tremendously enlightening I couldn't help but wonder as I finished this book why Peter (or someone) has not done an update...although I understand little can or has been done to change things. I also couldn't help but fantasize about what the US government could do now as a token towards the Native American. Maybe unite as many tribes as possible and GIVE the Indians Yellowstone, Rainier, Yosemite,Zion National Parks...as well as the Mark Twain National Forest for their separate nation or states. As you might have guessed, I believe that Matthiessen has done a masterful job. Let Spirit live on..."},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse","review":"This is a sweeping history of the American Indian Movement and Indian activism in the 1960s and 1970s. It covers the major events such as the siege of Wounded Knee and the arrest of Leonard Peltier. It examines in detail the Oglala Sioux reservation at Pine Ridge and its chairman Dick Wilson and his battle with AIM and Russel Means. Other AIM leaders such as Dennis Banks are examined as are the various trials sourounding AIM activism. Those are the books strengths, its weakness is that it does not give a good overview of the state of Native Americans in the U.S in thsoe two decades, concentrating instead on the places where activism took place and where shots were fired. However their were another hundred reservations where such things did not take place, including large reservations such as the Navajos and it would have be nice to learn more about politics and economies in these places."},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse","review":"An outstanding work from an outstanding person. This book represents an extensive investigation of the way those who challenge the status quo and the lies of history are dealt with by the &quot;pillars of our society&quot;.The Indian people whose lives the book documents, like many others in our world, are in the front line of this challenge. They deserve all our support. Reading this book is the least you can do to acknowledge your own humanity."},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse","review":"This is an distubing yet fascinating book.

In 1975 members of AIM shot and killed 2 FBI agents on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Four men were accused one man Leonard Peltier went to prison for it. Peltier is considered a political prisoner. He is still imprisoned. This is the story about the political events surrounding this case. This book walks you through the timeline and events surrounding what happened on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota in 1975 and takes you through a very botched up trial.\\"Silence, they say, is the voice of complicity.But silence is impossible.Silence screams.Silence is a message,just as doing nothing is an act.\\" Leonard PeltierAt very rare times the books content was dry, it had to give you facts, so not the fault of the author. Overall, I think that it reads very well, it is a history and it is about Leonard Peltier and his trial.

I've read the author's work before (At Play in the Field of the Lords) and found it extremely impressive. I was also very interested in this subject. However, while this book is certainly exhaustive and detailed, I have two major complaints. First, I didn't think it was well written - the mass of information was not presented clearly enough. Second, the author presents the case in such a biased manner (he's just too cozy with AIM and its supporters) that it's hard to take all his arguments at face value. I found his overall bias undermined the detailed research. It's an interesting and difficult read, but ultimately a little disappointing."},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse","review":"I have read this book three times so far. It is a very interesting book which deals with the way the American Indian Movement (&quot;AIM&quot;) and Leonard Peltier were prosecuted by the government back in the sixties and seventies.

The book deals with some very difficult topics but once read, you'll walk away shaking your head and asking yourself &quot;How can this happen? This is America?&quot;"},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse","review":"Everyone should have a copy of this book to pass on to their children and their children's children. And required reading in school as well."},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse","review":"This book is an excellant read. It covers the history of the American Indian Movement (AIM) up to the point of the of Leonard Peltier. This book opens your mind to the harse reality of the U.S. Government and it's ways. If you like true stories of Gov't conspiracies and it's molestation of human rights, I recomend this book highly. I also suggest you buy the two &quot;Rage Against the Machine&quot; albums, they touch on this subject several times. Also you should take a look at the award winning documentury &quot;Incident at Oglala&quot;. A special produced by Robert Redford that also tells the story of Leonard Peltier. Fight the power!!!"},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse","review":"The net effect of Matthiessen's effort to be journalistically unbiased is that the book is a reflection of South Dakota politics. South Dakota is several times referred to as the most racist state in the union, a racism that dates at least as far back as Wounded Knee (1890). The author makes no attempt to assuage these antagonisms but just reports them.The author is much clearer than Dee Brown in the early chapters on the early antagonisms between Indian and white. For the rest, only a few episodes strike me as beingespecially interesting, just as only a few characters stand out as especially interesting, among them, Peltier of course, but also Anna Maria Asquash, Myrtle Poor Bear (both of these rather pathetic figures), Bob Robideau, Robert Hugh Wilson and on the \\"other side\\"--because that's what it is,the other side--SA David Price, Richard Wilson, and William Janklow. For the most part when Matthieson \\"sits down\\" really spends some time with an individual, interviews him or quotes him at length, then that individual comes across clearly. In between these clear passages are long passages of conflicting evidence which is a reflection of the murky nature of the case. Mathiesson also outlines the main complaints of the Indian against the white man but these passages which run the length of the book are only occasionally brought out in the crystal clear. But since the author returns to them again and again, in the context of AIM demands, by the end most readers would be convinced.Still the overall impressionistic effect of reading the book is that you will be much better informed than if you had not read it. The book also has a very cosmopolitan atmosphere which will transport the reader throughout the American West, including Los Angeles, Seattle, New Mexico, Canada, and of course the Pine Ridge Reservation. I thought the story of the Marion Penitentiary and the jailbreak from Lompoc was one of the most interesting episodes in the book. Many times the book gets bogged down in legalese jargon or in endless lists of AIM members who were present at Pine Ridge on June 26, 1975, however.One of the book's main themes,emphasized over and over again, is AIM's paranoia about the intentions of the FBI and white men in general; for the most part Matthiesson's view is that AIM's paranoia is justified, and that Peltier was just a scapegoat who was set up by the FBI to take the blame for the crime."},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse","review":"there was the genocide against the Sioux, continuing on into today, with the continued imprisonment of Leonard Peltier.Read this book, and you will question some pretty widely bandied about concepts about America.Concepts like &quot;freedom,&quot; &quot;democracy,&quot; and the &quot;rule of law.&quot;The book is lengthy, but the style fresh and poetic.Get it!"},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse","review":"Having assumed that I had read countless volumes of Native American history, here I find another compelling book that brings anger and frustration. All I can say is that I am on a mission to learn more and more about Mr. Peltier. Many books that I have read before this one did not shed the kind of light on him that was deserved. I have to admit that other AIM followers had different views of him and it only makes me courious, and again I'll find another story. But that is the greatest thing about our American History, it has never been written with the truth at the heart of the writers pen. I can only hope that one day Mr. Peltier will be free, and whatever occurred during that day of confusion will be the truth, but by then it will only be another 100 years of history gone wrong. We will probably never know the truth."},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse","review":"I have read this book (and many others) as well as other sources regarding the case of Leonard Peltier, and I find Mr. Matthiessen's work nearly flawless.

The struggles of the 20th century are brought into focus. The involvement of political movements and powerful leaders are examined in such a way as to heighten one's understanding of the culture and the sincere effort to secure justice. It is so easy for the subject to escape notice or attention in our understanding of the American experience. This book brings the history and the modern reality directly before the reader's eyes. It doesn't pander to the romantic vision of the \\" Indian\\" but offers a human understanding of the effect of the experience by the conquered who were truly never conquered even when they were nearly exterminated.

It's was hard to find this fantastic book in my local book shops, but they had them in stock on at Amazon!"},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse","review":"Like many of the five star reviewers of this book I greatly enjoyed the book to near the end of Book 2 where the Peltier Trial was starting. Towards the end of the book Matthiessen dedicates a chapter to the mysterious \\"Mr. X\\" who claims he, not Peltier shot the FBI agents. According to AIM member Dino Butler, in an interview with Serle L. Chapman found in \\" We, The People of Earth and Elders Volume II\\" this was a lie. Go check the record yourself. In that book he states that this ruse was floated by Bob Robideau, the head of the Peltier Defense Fund. Dino Butler states that Mr. Robideau was going to have Dave Hill pose as Mr. X. Mr. Butler publicly stated at the time that this was a lie and continued to do so despite Mr. Matthiessen and Bob Redfords endorsement of this ruse.Matthiessen persistently mentions FBI involvement in Anna Mae Aquash's rape and murder. Go Google that name and look at Wikipedia. Three AIM members were convicted in her murder. One plead guilty to avoid trial. The other two were tried and convicted in a court of law. The order for these three to murder her go straight to the founding members of AIM according an affadavit by an AIM member. Google Robert Robideau ( Leonard Peltier's cousin) and read his statement on the Justice for Anna Mae and Ray web site. Until his break with Peltier in 2004 over the Arlo Looking Cloud conviction, he was the director of the Leonard Peltier Defense Fund. He states the same. Matthiessen does nothing but parrot AIM conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory of FBI involvement in her murder, when in fact the perpetrators knew all along how and why the murders were committed. AIM spokesman John Trudell testified that Dennis Banks told him Anna Mae had been found on February 26th, 1976. Peltier stated on the record that he heard she had died in December of 1975. However her body was not positively identified until 6 March 1976.Google Richard Two Elk and read his interview at Indian Country News and the Justice For Annie Mae and Ray (jfamr ) web site . He talks at great length of Anna Mae, Perry Ray Robinson, Jr. and \\" The Mannequin Man\\".Ray Robinson and \\"The Mannequin Man\\" were victims at Wounded Knee. Ray Robinson was a civil rights worker who cam to Wounded Knee, was shot in the knees and left to bleed to death at the Wounded Knee Infirmary. His body has never been recovered.Perhaps even more heinously On Easter Sunday, April 22, 1973, a Caucasian Male , later dubbed the \\" Mannequin Man\\" was hung on a cross and beat to death at Wounded Knee. His body has never been recovered as well. Clyde Bellecourt stated that it was a Mannequin that was hung on the Cross, but that has been refuted by Richard Two Elk.There is no mention of AIM looting and burning the Wounded Knee Trading Post to the ground and ransacking it of all it's contents. Numerous homes were ransack there. A woman who one of the hostages at Wounded Knee was 12 at the time and alleges that she was raped by AIM members but the FBI couldn't press charges because of the lack of evidence after the 71 day standoff.Go look at the trial transcripts yourself. Leonard Peltier wasn't convicted of murder, He was convicted of aiding and abetting murder. It Only took a jury 6 hours to convict him after hearing all of the evidence. In a previous trial for those murders two AIM members walked free.Dennis Banks former wife testified that Peltier admitted to killing the FBI agents. Anna Mae stated that she was confronted and interrogated by Peltier about being an informant for the FBI ( she wasn't) and he held a gun to her head. Anna Mae Aquash was interrogated at the offices of Wounded Knee Defense/Offense Fund Lawyer Bruce Ellison ( who is Leonard Peltier's Lawyer as well). During the Grand Jury Inquiry into Anna Mae's murder and rape, Bruce Ellison pled the 5th Amendment against self incrimination.I'm sure we all feel bad about what has happened to Native Americans in the course of founding this country and Manifest Destiny. It was terrible. We can't change history. We can only take what we have and try to make this a better place. But somehow thinking that overlooking or covering up AIM's involvement in murder, rape, looting and pillaging is okay as a pay back to the wrongs that were previously committed is also wrong. It was wrong in 1874 and it's wrong now.Go look at the record yourself. This book was a carefully planned piece of propaganda. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse","review":"I picked up this book after enjoying Mathiessen's book \\"The Snow Leopard\\" and was instantly hooked. Mathiessen's abilities as a writer and a storyteller make this huge book a fascinating page-turner. The book will draw you into the incident at Oglala, and will raise your consciousness about issues affecting American Indians, especially the Lakota Indians. After reading this book, I feel I'm a changed person.I know Mathiessen has been accused of being biased towards the Indian cause, but I think actually, he takes great pains to try and present the other side, and perhaps his efforts backfire at times -- in trying to remain neutral, the story at times can seem to lack cohesion. But as a fellow truth-seeker, I appreciate the effort to present the other side. Mathiessen breathes life into court transcripts and FBI reports, and otherwise mundane events.I'll close with a quote from the book, in which he describes a scene and considers the FBI agents perhaps understandable rationale in destroying a private home:\\"The noisy assault on upon the cabins disclosed that the defenders had made a near miraculous escape through the small army of agents and police that surrounded the compound and camp area; there was nobody left here at all. The large force of sweating, nervous men in their new battle fatigues, with their sniper and chemical warfare teams, their APC's and air support, felt frustrated and foolish; after all that shooting had subsided, all the smoke and gas had blown away, there was only this solitary Indian, killed much earlier in the day, lying beside the small green cabin on the bluff. Outraged by what looked like a cold-blooded murder of their comrades, and sickened by the two dead bodies with their shattered faces, already swelling after four hours in the sun and thick heat, the frustrated men took out their wrath on the ruined cabins.\\"It is this prose, this storytelling that will draw the reader in."},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse","review":"This is a great book that exposes the wrongs with the government's treatment with the Indian people as well as showing that leonard peltier is not guilty."},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse","review":"\\"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse\\" should be required reading for anyone who wishes to graduate from college in the USA.

Not only does it fail to convince, it fails to inspire from a humanistic point of view. Where there is accurate informantion, it is almost always with regard to general Indian history of the late nineteenth century. No new ground is covered unless it is couched in falsehood and mired in misdirection in favor of what the FBI characterized as a small but threatening group of domestic terrorists. AIM. Moreover, poor documentation renders Peter Matthiessen vulnerable to charges of dereliction and lack of due diligence. Matthiessen may have fooled the media into believing his fable about a wronged man who went to prison for a crime he didn't commit (even Peltier's lawyer doesn't go that far, preferring to rely solely on parole merits), but his story doesn't fool Indian County readers. Native publisher Tim Giago says many of the book's claims in defense of Peltier are simply ridiculous and are meant to reel in liberals and gullible types of the author's stripes. This book is a stink bomb that has been repeatedly set off in academic circles and reservation communities, steadily enveloping uninformed victims. Because I was inoculated with the truth learned from another book, American Indian Mafia, I forced myself to withstand the smell and finish the chore.

That guaranteed him unlimited access. Hardly objective reporting.Matthiessen did however go through great lengths to provide a tremendous amount of detail even if the bulk of it came from the usual suspects themselves.In the end though, he was also convinced of Peltier's guilt. He shunned Peltier's only real alibi, that someone else, a Mr. X, whom they all knew and Matthiessen skeptically interviewed. Matthiessen was \\"Taken aback by this unexpected story.\\" And when it came down to the basic facts of the killing of the two FBI agents he said \\"If there is another persuasive explanation of the location and position of their cars, I cannot find it.\\"Matthiessen also reported that one of Peltier's key attorney's, Williams Kunstler believed Peltier was guilty as well: \\"I know Bill Kunstler (another of the AIM lawyers) thought they killed the agents, but he believes that they were innocent whether they did it or not.\\"But it must be inordinately embarrassing for Matthiessen, The Leonard Peltier Defense Committee, Peltier, and his supporters to know that someone of the stature of Alan M. Dershowitz, the distinguished Harvard law professor, said that Matthiessen \\"is utterly unconvincing - indeed sophomoric - when he pleads the legal innocence of the individual Indian criminals. The American Indian Movement - like every militant fringe group - contains its share of violent criminals who seek to glorify their predatory acts under the flag of the movement.\\" \\"...(and) not only fails to convince; he (Matthiessen) inadvertently makes a strong case for Mr. Peltier's guilt. (New York Times, book review March 8, 1983.)Because it provides much detail, ITSOCH is a good reference for comparing prior statements of the participants in the murders of special Agents Jack Coler and Ron Williams to their later contradictions and subsequent claims, all of which have changed over the years. It does serve as a good foundation and litmus test to further demonstrate Peltier's guilt."},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse","review":"This is a marvelously well researched book. In respsonse to some of the bad reviews I have read I have to say that yes, Matthiessen does not try to hide the fact that he sides with the Indians.

When you examine the FBI and the US Government's history of maltreatment of all minorities, especially native peoples, why should an author feel obligated to paint the establishment in a flattering light. He is simply exposing the ugly truth of the dark underbelly of our \\"democracy\\".This is hard for some people to handle, thus the poor reviews. Ask yourself this, in the midst of phenomenal violence why does the FBI never investigate dozens of unsolved murders, instead devoting lots of man-hours to tracking down Jimmy Eagle for the theft of a pair of cowboy boots???You be the judge.This is an amazing read.

The fact that it took so long to be published speaks volumes about the content."},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse","review":"Those interested in the history of Native Americans will know that relatively few books cover the travails and challenges faced by Indians in the present day. This classic by Matthiessen is one of the best investigations in recent memory of how Indians still face a variety of hardships and harassment caused both by modern social problems and the legacy of their cultural annihilation. Matthiessen's topic here is the brief notoriety of the American Indian Movement (AIM) in the early-to-mid 1970s, culminating in the much-discussed case against Leonard Peltier for the murder of two government agents.Here Matthiessen covers not just the story of Peltier and AIM, but also the historical influences that culminated in the bloody 1975 confrontation in South Dakota's Pine Ridge Reservation. Matthiessen did an immense amount of research and delivered a highly compelling account of Peltier and the shootout, revealing that the situation was far more complex than is commonly believed (or reported in the mainstream press). The reader will find that Matthiessen does not necessarily find solid proof of Peltier's innocence. However, there is overwhelming evidence that Peltier definitely did not receive a fair trial, and a litany of Constitutional violations was committed by the illegitimate tribal government and its goons (the main source of animosity with AIM), federal agents, state and federal politicians, judges and lawyers, and prison officials.The complex relationships among these parties, the unhappy history of the Pine Ridge Indians, and modern social problems were all at play in a situation far more complex than a simple shootout between an Indian militant and some agents. Government watchdogs will also be sickeningly familiar with the propaganda and misinformation exercised by the feds as Peltier was railroaded into prison, especially in view of the government's weak case against him. At the very least, Peltier's sentence was excessive and several government employees got off the hook for the horrors of that fateful day in 1975. And in the end, this powerful book proves that the railroading of Indians who resist the advance of American hegemony did not come to an end back in the 1800s. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse","review":"I'm often deeply suspicious of writing as political as one finds in this book - I greatly admire Matthiessen's writings on travel, nature and Buddhism, but found his novel \\"At Play In The Fields Of The Lord\\" a bit ham-fisted in its' approach, even when I agreed with it's sentiments.But after a few reads, several years apart, IN THE SPIRIT OF CRAZY HORSE stands as a great, damning document - it's a piece of work that is impressive and massive, and will leave you infuriated.The entire work is built around the trial and conviction of Leonard Peltier, and rather than simply recount the events or press an agenda, Matthiessen goes to meticulous lengths to contextualize and cover every side of the background. The history of the Sioux Lakota is covered extensively, as are the social conditions (health, income, education, and the infamous violence) on the Pine Ridge Reservation. The AIM (American Indian Movement) emerges on Pine Ridge, and it should be noted that the reservation is officially two counties - Shannon and Jackson, which were administered from elsewhere in the state, and run by Bureau of Indian Affairs appointees, instead of by an elected government (the case in most US counties). These appointees' extreme and unorthodox tactics in administering the reservation dovetailed nicely with FBI surveillance and subversion of suspected subversive groups, including AIM, and the paranoia generated set the stage for the firefight and subsequent trial.Matthiessen expends considerable effort in the attempt at giving both sides a space to speak, not extremely successfully from an objectivity standpoint, but well enough for the purposes of this book: Matthiessen also unearths and publishes a vast array of court transcripts and legal documents; a certain point of view does begin to emerge, and Matthiessen admits where his sympathies lie, but generally, this is a book in which the FBI and various individuals within the government of South Dakota hang themselves with their own words. And they do this consistently, over hundreds of pages, and when afforded many opportunities by Matthiessen to justify or clarify themselves, they fail to do so repeatedly.Such Machiavellian governmental machinations were an unfortunate part of the political landscape during the Nixon era (this has not necessarily changed with the passage of time); this is one of the most devastating documents of that ruthlessness (see William Shawcross' SIDESHOW for a second, scary glimpse at this political tendency), and Matthiessen - through meticulous investigation and research - goes out of his way to be fair. Give this dense and - at times - difficult book some patience; the history lessons and legalese do have both a point and a payoff - this is a far more infuriating document of injustice than any simple agenda-based hatchet job could ever be.-David Alston"},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse","review":"Why?Well, you have to read this book, but here's a synopsis that nobody but the most diehard 1970s FBI defender can try to deny.Matthiessen documents years of FBI spying on the American Indian Movement, including \\"turning\\" insiders, coupled with intimidation tactics and more. Often the FBI in South Dakota was working, if not hand in hand, at least on parallel tracks in this thuggery with folks such as a corrupt Pine Ridge Indian Reservation leadership, then-Attorney General and now disgraced former Congressman Bill Janklow, BIA cops and more.While Matthiesen looks at bits and pieces of AIM's history elsewhere, he focuses on Pine Ridge and its Sioux, as this area, through things such as a temporary takeover of Mount Rushmore, was a center of AIM activity.In trials related to the events in and around Pine Ridge, FBI agents repeatedly intimidated witnesses into changing testimony, coached witnesses, sprung last-minute surprise witnesses at trials (which is against the law, if you didn't know), suborned perjury and otherwise made a mockery of justice.Things reached a climax June 26, 1975 when two FBI agents approached the Jumping Bull property on the Pine Ridge Reservation, ostensibly looking for Jimmy Eagle on a weapons charge. According to all Indian accounts, the two agents began opening fire on the property.Both were eventually shot in a return of fire. They were later killed at close range.After three other AIM leaders at the site were all acquitted of murder charges in the FBI agents' deaths, the FBI appeared determined to hang the case on Peltier by any legal or illegal means possible.Aided by a viciously biased judge giving one-sided bench rulings, the government did exactly that.Read how things reached this point, what AIM's grievances were, how the FBI infiltrated them, and more.But, above all, read the story of Leonard Peltier both before and after his conviction.Is Leonard Peltier a political prisoner? Read this book and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse","review":"During the American Civil Rights Movement there is an area that most of the country refuses to study or examine; the struggle for civil rights among and for the native peoples. In that movement there was an organization called AIM (American Indian Movement), I guess you'd call them the Black Panthers of our movement. They did some things that I do not agree with, but their motives can't be argued with. The United States Government did some very wrong things to these civil rights activists and one of them, Leonard Peltier, is still in prison. This is a DETAILED account of the incident he is imprisoned over. I may not agree with everything this man did; but hey, looking back at my own life I don't agree with everything that I've done. That doesn't meen he did what the FBI has accused him of. And this book is the proof that he didn't.If you are a student of the American Civil Rights Movement or of Native History, or even of the History of the F.B.I., you should have this case study as a reference."},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse","review":"If you've already read \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee,\\" or any of a number of books about the shameful treatment of native Americans by white America over the past 400 years, get ready for more of the same here. It's not that this isn't an important book, but many times in the early goings, Peter Matthiessen's 1980 epic account of the American Indian Movement's early days and the prison saga of Leonard Peltier reads like a personal memoir, not objective history. Granted, native Americans rarely received objective treatment before the 1980's, and there's still much to fight for on behalf of native rights. Even now, the news about oil deposits deep under the Montana plains has avaricious corporations planning their assaults on the land once occupied by the first nations. That said, reading this book will remind the knowledgeable reader about just how badly native Americans were treated by the Europeans whom claimed the land as their own. It's enraging and its difficult to slog through page after page of reminder and mention of abrogated treaties, stolen land, slaughtered buffalo, forced assimilation and deprivation on poor reservation lands. I rarely ever give up on a book before reading it cover to cover, but this is one where my sanity requires a truce. No more will I fight the angry thoughts and foul moods created by reading this dreary, but true, history of America."},{"Title":"In the Spirit of Crazy Horse","review":"While I appreciate the authors attempt to present all the facts, I found most of the book very complicated and difficult to follow. Detailing all of the arrests, trials, convictions, allegations,etc regarding all the major players( and some of the minor ones) in the movement at the time, while it served to present the climate in which Leonard's conviction took place, left me unable to form any opinion of guilt or innocence. It was not until the final 3 or 4 chapters that the whole thing made any sense . Still it is worth reading as it is the only book that I know of on a subject, unfortunately ignored by an American Public who had become somewhat jaded about protest movements and reports of wrong-doing by government agencies once the '60's had ended."},{"Title":"Sheaves in Geometry and Logic: A First Introduction to Topos Theory (Universitext)","review":"Topos theory now has applications in fields such as music theory, quantum gravity, artificial intelligence, and computer science. It has been viewed by some as being excessively abstract and difficult to learn, and this is certainly true if one attempts to learn it from the research literature. The use of this book to learn topos theory certainly puts this view to rest, as the authors have given the readers an introduction to topos theory that is crystal clear and nicely motivated from an historical point of view. Indeed the prologue to the book gives the reader a deep appreciation of the origins of the subject, and could even serve as an introduction to a class on algebraic geometry.An understanding of sheaf theory and category theory will definitely help when attempting to learn topos theory, but the book could be read without such a background. Readers who want to read the chapters on logic and geometric morphisms will need a background in mathematical logic and set theory in order to appreciate them. Topos theory has recently been used in research in quantum gravity. A reader interested in understanding how topos theory is used in this research should concentrate on the chapter on properties of elementary topoi, the one on basic categories of topoi, and the chapter on localic topoi.The authors introduce topos theory as a tool for unifying topology with algebraic geometry and as one for unifying logic and set theory. The latter application is interesting, especially for readers (such as this reviewer), who approach the book from the standpoint of the former. Indeed, the authors discuss a fascinating use of topos theory by Paul Cohen in his proof of the independence of the Continuum Hypothesis in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.The prologue for this book is excellent, and should be read for the many insights and motivations for the subject of topos theory. The elementary category theory needed is then outlined in the next section. A \\"topos\\" is essentially a category that allows the construction of pullbacks, products, and so on, with the philosophy being that objects are to be viewed not only as things but as also having maps (functors) between them. In the section on categories of functors, this viewpoint becomes very transparent due to the many examples of categories that are also topoi are discussed. These examples are presented first so as to motivate the general definition of topos later on. Some of these categories are very familiar, such as the category of sets, the category of all representations of a fixed group, presheaves, and sheaves. Of particular interest in this section is the discussion of the propositional calculus, and its representation as a Boolean algebra. Replacing the propositional calculus with the (Heyting) intuitionistic propositional calculus results in a different representation by a Heyting algebra. From the standpoint of ordinary topology, the Heyting algebra is significant in that the algebra of open sets is not Boolean, i.e. the complement (or \\"negation\\") of an open set is closed and not open in general Instead it follows the rules of a Heyting algebra. This type of logic appears again when considering the subobjects in the sheaf category, which have a \\"negation\\" which belong to a Heyting algebra. Thus topos theory is one that follows more than not the Brouwer intuitionistic philosophy of mathematics. Recently, research in quantum gravity has indicated the need for this approach, and so readers interested in this research will find the needed background in this part of the book.After a straightforward overview of how sheaf theory fits into the topos-theoretic framework, the authors also discuss the role of the Grothendieck topology in sheaf theory. This involves thinking of an open neighborhood of a point in a space as more than just a monomorphism of that neighborhood into the space (all the open neighborhoods thus furnishing a \\"covering\\" of the space). This need was motivated by certain constructions in algebraic geometry and Galois theory, as the authors explain in fair detail. A covering of a space by open sets is replaced by a new covering by maps that are not monomorphisms. Starting with a category that allows pullbacks, an indexed family of maps to an object of this category is considered. If for each object in this category one uses a rule to select a certain set of such families, called the coverings of the object under this rule, then ordinary sheaf theory can be used on these coverings. If one desires to drop the requirement that the category have pullbacks, this can be done by introducing a category that comes with such \\"covering families.\\" This is the origin of the Grothendieck topologies, wherein the indexed families are replaced by the sieves that they generate. A Grothendieck topology on a category is thus a function that assigns to each object in the category a collection of sieves on the object (this function must have certain properties which are discussed by the authors). Several examples of categories with the Grothendieck topologies are discussed, one of these being a complete Heyting algebra. Another example discussed comes from algebraic topology, via its use of the Zariski topology for algebraic varieties. The discussion of this example is brilliant, and in fact could be viewed as a standalone discussion of algebraic geometry.When considering the notion of the Grothendieck topology, the authors define the notion of a \`site', which is essentially a (small) category along with a Grothendieck topology on the category. They then show how to define sheaves on a site, which then form a category. A \`Grothendieck topos' is then a category which is equivalent to the category of sheaves on some site. The authors then show, interestingly, that a complete Heyting algebra can be realized as a subobject lattice in a Grothendieck topos."},{"Title":"Sheaves in Geometry and Logic: A First Introduction to Topos Theory (Universitext)","review":"This book is written in the best Mac Lane style, very clear and very well organized. It also benefits from Moerdijk's extensive work organizing the theory of Grothendieck toposes by elementary means. The reader should have basic graduate knowledge of algebra and topology. The book is long because it gives very explicit descriptions of many advanced topics--you can learn a great deal from this book that, before it was published, you could only learn by knowing researchers in the field."},{"Title":"Sheaves in Geometry and Logic: A First Introduction to Topos Theory (Universitext)","review":"This is a really good book to learn sheaves, it has the \\"tree generations\\" of sheaves; with topological spaces, with Grothendieck topologies, and with Lawvere-Tirney topologies. Also a great book in topoi theory, from the basics up to the Cohen topos."},{"Title":"The Sea Monster's Darkest Night","review":"The Sea Monster's Darkest Night was written and illustrated by twelve-year-old Meryl Alyse McCurry. The book tells the story of a young sea monster that tries to tear up a ship and is captured by the townspeople. His father becomes angry and destroys the town to get his son back. The story tells of loyalty between father and son, and the length parents go through to protect their children. I would highly recommend this book for early readers. The words are easy to read and understand and the illustrations correlate perfectly with what is going on in the story. This is an excellent book from a very talented young girl. I wish her much success and hope to read future works from her.Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy ofThe RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Presence","review":"Mr. Torockio shows wonderful promise and I await his new books.

The character development is extraordinary prompting the reader to really connect with the characters. LeBlanc's presentation of the information through the perception of the messiah makes the reader want to learn more. Because there is a level of depth to this book that is hard to find elsewhere, it should be read cover-to-cover, not skimmed. LeBlanc has made an impression, and I am awaiting his next book."},{"Title":"Messiah Complex","review":"In \\"Messiah Complex,\\" a young messiah named Chris struggles to use his divine powers and knowledge responsibly, sometimes with dire earthly consequences. There is enough wit and humor to keep to the point without preaching to the reader or making a joke of religion. The book has its serious sides as well: Chris deals with the history of his conception, is ostracized from society, and struggles to maintain close relationships. LeBlanc did a good job of keeping the pretentious moments to a minimum, although a couple of moments should be expected since the main character is a messiah. LeBlanc is off to a nice start, and I'm looking forward to his next book."},{"Title":"Messiah Complex","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read.

Although I rarely agree with his reviews, the man is one of the best writers in the business, and this book, comprised of questions from readers and his answers, was a great book to start with. Being published in the late 90s dated the book somewhat - it was released before the first DVD's hit the market - but the answers Ebert provides to some pretty wacked-out questions were always excellent, and often killingly funny. He tended to use the same letter writers over and over (Andy from Westwood MA being a prime example) but that was usually because the letters were funny or outrageous and his answer was often equally as funny or outrageous. A good case in point: Ebert spends several pages on the battle to get Blockbuster to carry a letterboxed VHS of Pulp Fiction in their stores, the answers he got from the various parties involved, and how Blockbuster did indeed finally carry the version, despite complaints from not-too-knowledgeable customers that the tape was broken (nowadays, letterboxing is a common practice - ALWAYS get the letterbox), but their solution and Ebert's reaction was priceless. All in all, despite the dated aspect, the book is very worth the read, and a great introduction tothe acerbic humor that Ebert has become famous for. My grade :B+"},{"Title":"Questions For The Movie Answer Man","review":"Quite informative and not at all simply a &quot;bathroom read&quot; as one reviewer here has opined. The book covers topics from A to Z (E.g. &quot;Actors&quot;, &quot;Fireballs&quot;, &quot;Talking in the Movies&quot;). However, if your particular interest is &quot;Goofs&quot;, the basics are covered (E.g &quot;Bloopers&quot;, &quot;Boom mikes&quot;) but you'll find much more for specific movies at the Internet Movie Database (imdb.com). Another reviewer here states the index could be better. I agree. The index seems to be inconsistent, listing only some of the book's topics, but lots of movie titles and actors. For example, a question on the book jackets asks&quot; Why don't movie actors wear seatbelts?&quot;. Good luck finding the answer easily. A handful of the movies chosen for inclusion may seem obscure, but this is still an entertaining book.

And as much as I like the book, I have some doubts about Mr. Ebert's scholarship. On page 61, he says that Japanese term for the bittersweet awareness of transient things is &quot;nolo con aware,&quot; when in fact it is &quot;mono no aware&quot; (the Japanese don't even use &quot;L&quot; their language).

This time, the children desert the lake and take instead to the High Topps, prospecting for gold.While adult readers will be unable to do other than admire the children's enthusiasm (sufficiently infectious to draw most young readers into it wholesale), they will probably have a feeling of impending disaster from quite early on, in this book. The Amazons' impetuous natures, combined with the others' general inexperience and limited knowledge of mining and its chemistry, lead them all (except, perhaps, the more sensible Susan!) into more scrapes, as well as rather more dangerous situations, than usual.This leads to a different (but no less absorbing) desire to keep reading this tale than that likely to affect the more nave younger reader. Both young and old are, nevertheless, likely to spend much of the time on tenterhooks during this book, as the young prospectors explore old mine workings, try their hand at charcoal burning and build and operate a blast furnace in their camp, out on the tinder-dry fells! For once, one can only feel something of a sense of relief that times have changed since 1936, when this was written! One can't help feeling - and being grateful for the fact - that modern children would not be terribly interested in repeating some of the activities undertaken here.In summary, then, &quot;Pigeon Post&quot; is every bit as exciting (and at times far more nerve-wracking) and educational as the other books in this series: another winner from Arthur Ransome."},{"Title":"Pigeon Post","review":"This was the first of Ransome's \\"Swallows & Amazons\\" series that I ever read, and it's still my favorite. We find the Swallows (the four Walkers), the Amazons (Captain Nancy Blackett and sister-Mate Peggy), and the D's (Dick and Dorothea Callum) headquartering at Beckfoot, the old Blackett house, while impatiently waiting for Captain Flint (the Amazons' Uncle Jim) to return from South America. \\"His mine wasn't any good,\\" says Nancy, and she decides to fill in the time by searching for gold up on the high fells above the lake, following hints given by Slater Bob, a local miner. Complicating the program is the distance from Beckfoot to the target area and the fact that the Lake Country is seeing its driest summer in memory--and the presence of the mysterious lanky man the explorers call \\"Squashy Hat,\\" who seems to be looking for the same thing they are. The book takes its title from the three homing pigeons the Blacketts own and resolve to use to keep Mrs. Blackett informed of their adventures while they camp nearer to the moors. The countryside is splendidly drawn, the children are unique individuals well sketched, their adventures and inventions are so thoroughly described that an American child could probably duplicate them, and there are thrills galore when the fells catch fire. What's more, the eight actually find...but that would be telling! Read it for yourself and find out.Like most children's books of its period, this one is equally enjoyable by adults and would make a splendid family read-aloud.

Also some environmental content in the snarky view of tourists who carelessly start a fire that nearly kills the heroes.Good fun, might inspire your younguns.

Just drama. Maybe we should start with not bothering to tell girls they can do anything, because the truth is nobody can do anything. It is taken away. Everything is taken away. I'm done."},{"Title":"Off-Ramps and On-Ramps: Keeping Talented Women on the Road to Success (HBR OnPoint Enhanced Edition)","review":"\\"Off-Ramps and On-Ramps\\" takes us on an enlightening journey that goes beyond the standard business case for workplace flexibility. Sylvia Ann Howlett adds new insight to traditional models by reporting new data and best practices of company initiatives designed to keep talented women. Howlett lays the groundwork in the first half of the book and dedicates the second half to providing solutions. Each solution is presented in a brief \\"Toolkit\\" format. Take a glance into each toolkit and you will find a condensed outline that includes the scenario, business case, critical elements for success and best of all, an outline of how to get started to achieve business outcomes.Howlett's solutions include:1) Establishing Flexible Work ArrangementsFlexible work arrangements dominate women's wish lists. Solutions include flexible start and stop times, seasonal flextime, reduced-hour options, telecommuting, and job sharing.2) Creating Arc of Career FlexibilityThis new concept expands flexible work arrangements a step further to take into account the span of a woman's work life acknowledging its nonlinearity and discontinuities. Companies that are successful with providing solutions have senior executives driving these new policies who are beginning to conceptualize work in different ways.3) Reimagining Work LifeEmployees with responsibilities that go beyond biological children have needs that differ in time span and frequency. Solutions include elder care and employee assistance programs.4) Claiming and Sustaining AmbitionSustaining ambition can be a problematic issue for women. Reasons include the difficulty of recovering from off-ramps and that the glass ceiling continues to limit and constrain the career prospects of women. A key solution includes employer-sponsored women's networks, which can be extremely effective in helping women claim and sustain ambition.5) Tapping into AltruismFor women, deriving meaning and purpose from work and giving back to society are more powerful drivers than money. Solutions include companies recognizing and supporting community volunteer activity for employees.6) Combating Stigma and StereotypesFlexible work arrangements can create the unspoken negative aura that attaches to nonstandard work arrangements, virtual workplaces, etc. Solutions include tackling microinequities.My favorite quote from the book is from Maury Hanigan who expressed surprise that there is so little awareness of the costs of losing talented employees. \\"If a $2,000 desktop computer disappears from an employee's desk, I guarantee that there'll be an investigation, a big to-do. But if a $100,000-a-year executive with all kinds of client relationships gets poached by a competitor - or quits to stay home with the kids - there's no investigation. No one is called on the carpet for it.\\"This is an essential book for leaders of companies searching for effective ways to significantly improve business outcomes. Although the research in this book is representative of large employers, the concepts can be modified to fit the culture of mid and small size companies to attract, retain, and re-enter a talented work force."},{"Title":"Off-Ramps and On-Ramps: Keeping Talented Women on the Road to Success (HBR OnPoint Enhanced Edition)","review":"I actually hesitated to read Off-Ramps and On-Ramps, as it looked like a boring textbook at first glance. But, as I got into it, it was quite a provocative read and even brought up some interesting points that applied to both men and women. Here are a few highlights that struck my fancy:Chapter 1 - Why Mess with the Male Competitive Model. Good way to start a book. I think we'll be hearing more about this as generation y gets further into the workplace. While a hardcore minority will stick to the traditional Gordon Gecko \\"greed is good\\" model, we'll see countless others rebel against the values of the generations before them (as all generations before rebelled against their parent's values).Chapter 2 - Looks at how large a factor elder-care already plays in women's lives. In fact, it's larger than child-care as this affects all women. This is only going to increase as Boomers start being the ones needing care.Chapter 3 - Extreme Jobs, Extreme Demands. Thought this chapter could make a whole book. It's a great overview of how corporate America has changed. I have a friend whose parents were both big executives at major companies, yet all the time growing up, she swears that both made it home for dinner almost every single night. This is practically unheard of even for middle management these days.The latter half of the book gives examples of companies who are launching innovative programs to resolve the situation. This makes it a must-read for any management team who is struggling to keep women, OR, better yet, recognizes what a great asset they have and wants to boost them up even more! However, it still begs the question of what to do for the majority of women who do not work for the handful of Fortune 500 companies who get it, and have the funds to produce such innovative programs."},{"Title":"Off-Ramps and On-Ramps: Keeping Talented Women on the Road to Success (HBR OnPoint Enhanced Edition)","review":"It is an honor to be the first to comment on this book. Sylvia Ann Hewlett is truly a visionary in the pressing arena of work-life programs and policies. Congratulations to Ms. Hewlett for reframing the \\"opting out\\" debate in to a much more useful discussion about non-linear careers. She challenged the assumption that most women leave full time employment because of pure family reasons, and sure enough, uncovered many other reasons that lie squarely on the shoulders of corporate America. Many progressive companies, especially Lehman Brothers, get it! They care about promoting, retaining, and recruiting female talent. Will others follow suit? Well now they have no excuse. Ms. Hewlett has given them clear strategies and I hope more women will hold the companies they work for accountable for implementing them."},{"Title":"Off-Ramps and On-Ramps: Keeping Talented Women on the Road to Success (HBR OnPoint Enhanced Edition)","review":"This is a rare how-to book for both career women and the corporations they serve that is based on extensive research into what the author calls \\"the hidden brain drain\\" -- the loss of talented women workers to marriage and motherhood who may want to work later in life but can't find an \\"on-ramp\\" back to their career. Hewlett argues convincingly that it would be in the interest of all concerned for businesses to be flexible enough to retain or rehire the talented women who also want to be married and mothers.She also presents case studies of firms that have done it successfully.Solidly researched, lucidly analyzed, persuasively argued and a good read. This is a win-win book that is both good for business and good for talented women workers. If employers followed its advice they would retain talented employees --and these talented women would at last be able to have it all: marriage, family and a career. A book that all career women --and the employers that ought to love their work enough to want to retain it-- should read."},{"Title":"Off-Ramps and On-Ramps: Keeping Talented Women on the Road to Success (HBR OnPoint Enhanced Edition)","review":"This is a wonderful book and should be read by all women regardless of age as well as by all employers.

Alas, not all were realized.We all know (and the author does fine background, in case we don't) that women are fairly easily derailed from career paths by family crises, discrimination, and just the logistics of daily life in America. So far, so good.The proposed \\"solution\\" is sad: Companies need to wake up and change their dated ways to retain talented women. The author seems to believe they (1) want to keep talented women and (2) will actually change to do so.As if."},{"Title":"Off-Ramps and On-Ramps: Keeping Talented Women on the Road to Success (HBR OnPoint Enhanced Edition)","review":"If you're interested in looking at the data behind women and careers, this is the book for you. Hewlett has summarized a number of really interesting data. For example, 37% of women take time off at some point in their careers. 30% of women take advantage of part-time or other flexible programs. Hewlett's data illustrates a number of important reasons companies should care about gender diversity. After building the business case for women, she talks about how companies have created programs to make it work. One of the nice elements of this book is that she illustrates the data with personal stories. One of my favorite quotes underscores the importance of finding meaning in your job. A working mom comments, \\"when I walk out the door in the morning leaving my 2-yaer-old with the nanny, there's usually a bit of a scene. Tommy clings, pouts, and whips up the guilt. Now, I know it's not serious--most of the time he likes his nanny. But it sure makes me think about why I go to work--and why I put in a ten hour day. It's as though every day I make the following calculation: do the satisfactions I derive from my job (efficacy, recognition--a sense of stretching my mind) justify leaving Tommy? Some days it's a close run. One thing I do know. It couldn't just be the money. I need a whole lot of things to be happening for me to work.\\""},{"Title":"Off-Ramps and On-Ramps: Keeping Talented Women on the Road to Success (HBR OnPoint Enhanced Edition)","review":"This book honestly and openly explores what I believe thousands of professional women are facing today - the deep challenge of creating a successful professional life of meaning, fulfillment, and balance, in today's current dominant work model. As one who works with hundreds of professional women each year, I see over and over the ill-effects of professional women striving to fit into a model that no longer reflects our needs, priorities, and values. Hewlett's book goes a long way toward presenting beneficial new thinking and programs that, when adopted, will certainly bring about beneficial and urgently-needed change."},{"Title":"Off-Ramps and On-Ramps: Keeping Talented Women on the Road to Success (HBR OnPoint Enhanced Edition)","review":"Despite all the print about the \\"Mommy Wars\\" and whether women should or shouldn't be in the workplace, the fact is that half the U.S. workforce is currently made up of women - and the workplace will have to change to accommodate them. Sylvia Hewlett's \\"Off-Ramps and On-Ramps\\" adds new, crucial information to this discussion. She provides data about women in the work force and provides models of flexible workplace structures now being used in corporations. The book gives a convincing business case for work force diversity and for the restructuring of our career model.Hewlett's book is a must read for anyone concerned about the work force of the twenty first century."},{"Title":"Off-Ramps and On-Ramps: Keeping Talented Women on the Road to Success (HBR OnPoint Enhanced Edition)","review":"Economist Sylvia Ann Hewlett does an excellent job of outlining both subtle and bold barriers that relegate many talented women (and minorities) to the lower end of promotions and pay scales. Using ample documentation, she outlines the financial costs that corporations suffer when they operate with outdated career models designed for white male professionals. Hewlett also lines up practical solutions with real-life examples from top corporations. Though the book is marred by repetition and various examples are recycled in different chapters, overall, we consider this essential reading for senior corporate officials and staff members."},{"Title":"Faith, Love & Life A Collections of Poems & Songs","review":"Poetry can be beautiful, thoughtful, honest and the author's own interpretation of life. Mr. Alston takes three subjects: Faith; Love; and Life and expresses their sentiment in several poems and songs.Several of the poems stood out to me because of their meaning. The examples are: No Such Thing As Can't, Forgiveness, A Rose From the Garden, Nine Eleven and Ghetto Child. In each of these I was able to truly appreciate the author's quest to feel, understand and relate to what he was trying to convey.Although there are several wonderful poems and songs in this book of poetry, I found sometimes the author was trying a little bit too hard to make the poetry rhyme. Poetry doesn't necessarily have to rhyme but there must be a rhythm and cadence to the poetry that I found lacking in a few of the poems.Again, poetry is interpreted differently depending on the reader, because we have to discern our own voice to the poem.This is an overall good collection of poetry. I can see the author expanding and growing more with each collection. The author's continual growth will lead to learning to let the words flow easily without trying to make everything rhyme thereby making the words dance across the page to enlighten all his readers."},{"Title":"Faith, Love & Life A Collections of Poems & Songs","review":"Poet and songwriter Stanley E. Alston offers reflections from the heart in his book Faith, Love, and Life. A collection of poems and songs, each piece carries its own respective theme and readers will find a piece that is relatable to them. Several standout pieces include \`Jericho Road', \`Dream Your Dream', and \`Yes I Believe'. Also recommended is the companion CD where readers can listen to Alston read and perform the pieces that are featured in the book.Alston brings compelling work to the forefront, offering pieces that contain an honest sincerity. From beginning to end, his poetry touched a part of me and has made a lasting impact. If you are looking for poetry that speaks from the heart, then Faith, Love, and Life is one collection that you must read.Reviewed by Kanika (Nika) Wadeof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"To a Native Shore","review":"This book has long been out of print.

Henty.First of all, historical fiction is probably my favorite genre of writing. So far I have not found anyone like G.A. Henty with the ability to tell a tale like he does. I have read as many of his books that I could get my hands on. They are just plain hard to put down once you get started; that is if you are a fan of historical fiction like I am. Henty's stories typically revolve around a central \\"boy hero\\" character during a pivotal period in history. This \\"boy hero\\" character usually ends of accomplishing some pretty amazing (though not unrealistic) feats by the end of the story.Henty lived during Queen Victoria's reign and literary critic Kathryn Castle put it well when she said: \\"Henty...exemplified the ethos of the new imperialism, and glorified in its successes\\". He was a very strong supporter of the British Empire all of his life. Henty had some pretty amazing adventures of his own during his life, such as the Crimean War, the opening of the Suez Canal and the California gold fields to name a few.\\"With Wolfe in Canada\\" is a story that is centered on the French and Indian War of 1754 - 1763. This war was really the American theater of the Seven Years War. The \\"Wolfe\\" in the title refers to General James Wolfe the commander of the British expedition to take Quebec.The tale begins where \\"James Walsham\\", the main character, began his life; in Sidmouth, England, born the son of a country doctor who died when he was quite young. It tells of his growing up here in some detail, and of the surroundings that made up the life of a common fisherman in that day.James's mother, a school teacher, had wanted him to follow the profession of his father and become a doctor, but this was not meant to be. As James had deep love for the sea ever since he was a young boy, he naturally was around fisherman and the sea in general quite a bit. This may seem rather obvious as Sidmouth is a coastal town.It turns out that he becomes involved in a smuggling operation and is pressed into the service a British warship. Don't take this as a clue that James had turned \\"sour\\". In those days smuggling in that region of the world was not really looked on as major crime by the locals, and most of the people were in sympathy with the smugglers. The British government certainly did not think so and the law was strictly enforced by the \\"revenue men\\". James time of service on the warship is what brought him to America, and on his discharge there he decides to join General Edward Braddock in an expedition against the French. The main bulk of the story involves his adventures during his time as a scout in America, but also involves a fascinating tie with circumstances back home in Sidmouth involving some competition for his \\"girl\\" Aggie, someone that he had grown up with. Also woven throughout is the treachery of a Richard, the nephew of a friend of James's back home who was jealous of James accomplishments.Overall, \\"With Wolfe in Canada\\" is a very compelling novel that is very historically accurate and provides the perfect balance between a fictional story and the true events of the French and Indian war. It is well worth your read.G.A Henty, Blackie & Son, 1886Preston/Speed Publications, 1999[Wikipedia.org/G.A.

In this story, Joe, while hitchhiking in Montana becomes involved with members of a radical religious group (like the Branch Davidians, only this time in Alaska), and is implicated as a suspect when a gun deal gone bad results in multiple deaths. A mark of the contemporary thriller is its political correctness, in this instance making the crackerjack rebel cop both female and minority - Leanne Red Feather. Both the genre of police thrillers and our nation having endured generations of white male rule, it is a good thing in general that both society and fiction mirror the composition of the modern community. I only wish Holden hadn't been so obvious - and, it feels, almost exploitative - about his choice of hero. As the genre requires, this book chugs along nicely, and the drama never flags. The characters, however, neither make an impression nor evoke any empathy from the reader. For this reason, I must consider this book a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Last Sanctuary","review":"I read this book after having read Four Corners of Night and the River Sorrow (the author's other books).

The main character is a gulf war vet / regular guy, who becomes mixed up with murdering, thieving, scheming cult members looking for a patsy to take the fall.

There were some parts that weren't even really believable, especially the parts about Rick."},{"Title":"The Last Sanctuary","review":"Holden has a great grasp on the tragic American hero and is also able to spin highly-infectious stories. The resultant combo is best displayed in The River Sorrow. While this book starts strong and has a vice-like hold on the reader through the middle sections, I found the last section to be predictable, and even a bit corny. I was downright disappointed with Holden on this latest offering, but as I hold him to an exceptionally high standard, I still must give the book a decent review. A great one to bring to the beach; make sure you apply enough suntan lotion before starting the book as you'll have a hard time putting it down for much of the story"},{"Title":"The Last Sanctuary","review":"This is a good read. The characters in the story are very three dimensional. I especially like the FBI agent RedFeather. The ending is a bit surprising, but I don't like it.

I finally picked it up after completing Holden's first novel, &quot;The River Sorrow,&quot; anxiously looking for more of the same excellent suspenseful story telling. I was not let down.While the main character, Joe Curtis, is not all that memorable as heros go, the pace of the novel more than makes up for this. With plausible situations and personalities, entertaining twists and a climactic ending, &quot;The Last Sanctuary&quot; proves that Holden is as entertaining as Clancy, without all the technical writing. Can't wait to get started on Mr. Holden's third novel!"},{"Title":"The Last Sanctuary","review":"I liked Craig Holden's first book, The River Sorrow, so this was something of a disappointment to me. The plot is interesting, the characters are quirky and innovative, and the action's good enough to keep your interest, but somehow the sum added up to less than the parts.Joe Curtis is trying to go to Seattle to bail his brother out of trouble when his car breaks down. He decides to hitchhike the rest of the way, and winds up getting picked up by a couple. The male half of the couple robs a convenience store, shoots three people, and then tries to frame Joe for the killings. The three of them then split up, and the chase begins.There are several characters in the story, including a Native American ATF agent, an Asian one too, members and a leader of a strange religious cult, and other interesting people. Somehow, none of them are particularly compelling. You don't care, really, if any of them live or die, and you don't wonder what's going to happen to them. When the action begins, you're uninterested in what's going to happen next.I enjoyed The River Sorrow, and I suppose someone else might be more interested in this than I am. There are several annoying errors also (the Branch Davidians didn't have a .50 cal. MG, as the ATF alleged) and they detract from the story. I wouldn't recommend this book unless the person was aware of what they were getting into."},{"Title":"The Last Sanctuary","review":"The author has written a book that is better than his first - which is hard to do!

I am really glad I did, though. Anyone over 50 and anyone from a small town will instantly relate to the characters and the situations. Anyone who attended a small college will feel right at home. Schulenberg's style is witty and fast-paced. His character and scene development is precise. As I approached the end of the book, I found myself slowing down, because although I did want to know how the mystery would be solved I didn't want the book to end. I'll buy anything else this author writes. I want to see how his characters will evolve in his next book."},{"Title":"Dead at the Desk","review":"Mr. Schulenberg's \\"Dead at the Desk\\" is a quick and entertaining read. For a murder mystery, there are the obvious suspects that are targeted but the plot's twists and turns which lead to the true murderer and the reasoning behind the murder was fantastic. I was floored! Since I am from Kansas, Mr. Schulenberg's familiarity with Kansas and Missouri facts added an extra bonus to my reading enjoyment. I found myself thinking of these characters and this school during the times when I wasn't reading the book. I highly recommend \\"Dead at the Desk\\"."},{"Title":"Dead at the Desk","review":"I was lucky enough to preview this book and I highly recommend it to those who love a good mystery.

We lived on campus in veterans housing and were friends with many of our neighbors who were also students.Although the cramming for finals was not done in dorm rooms but in small quonset huts, which served as our home, I could relate to the late nights and the thrill as graduation day drew near.I especially enjoyed how the story developed. It kept me wondering if I had correctly picked out the &quot;killer&quot;. In fact, I could hardly put the book down trying to decide if I was correct. The small town Loren visited with his girlfriend could have been the same small town where I grew up. It conjured up wonderful memories of my young years.

I look forward to passing my book along to others that look foward to reading it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"Dead at the Desk","review":"It is rare for a first time novelist to accomplish so much on so many levels. DEAD AT THE DESK is far more than a murder mystery. It is a love story, a tale about becoming an adult, and a commentary on the 1960s. The author did a good job of keeping me up all night reading his book, of drawing dimensional characters, and of incorporating real clues and red herrings in his whodunit. I had no problem picturing the scenes he describes. Schulenberg drew me into the world of Loren Schneider and Amy Anderson. I was with them every inch of the way, from prologue to epilogue. I recommend this book to anyone who's looking for a good read...and am anxious to read the next book in the series...hopefully there will be a series. Maybe there'll be a movie. What a movie it would be!"},{"Title":"Dead at the Desk","review":"This book is awesome. The book kept me on the edge of my seat and wanting to get to the next page.

It's a special kind of Korean ceramic ranging in color from apple green to white, through all stages of pastel green and beige. Old pieces are rare and valuable, the target of certain collectors. Celadon pottery comes in various shapes--plates, jars, bottles, etc---and is always delicate. You could become a big collector, gather in a few dozen specimens, but, let me ask you, would you then be an expert on Korea ? No, you'd just have a nice collection of green pottery. Well, if you read Cary's book on Trieste, you'll page through his series of literary images and reminiscences about times he never knew, a place he spent a total of three weeks in, seemingly speaking to no one. You'll wind up with some delicate images, some lines of poetry, some interesting little biographies of various Trieste notables, and a bit of amateurish history. A celadon collection for sure. I admit the book is sensitively-written, sentimental, and \\"cultured\\" (whatever that may mean to you) but if you like books with a bit of focus, well, you might be disappointed here. Not a single living Triestine mars the pages full of pressed flowers. Nobody eats oysters or blows their nose. Some pale grappa once, on a single page.Cary wanders the streets thinking about three literary figures that didn't really have that much to do with one another, but whom he hoped to draw together in some literary tour-de-force---the novelist Italo Svevo, the poet Umberto Saba, and James Joyce, who taught English in Trieste for many years. Cary curls around the city like a very thin vine, clinging, touching and re-touching the same theme and subjects, calling the world he thus creates \\"ghostly\\". Here we are in the park, here we take a tram ride, we buy some old books, talk about some long-lost cultural figures and a bit about the economic boom that brought Trieste to prosperity before WW I. Italy yearned to unite with its Austrian-occupied little brother. It did at last, at an enormous cost unmentioned by Cary. No doubt our work is most ephemeral, light, fleeting. He gives up finally, realizing that his project is not feasible. If the Japanese art of ukiyo-e refers to pictures of a \\"floating world\\", Cary's book is \`ukiyo-lite\\". He himself concludes: \\"There was no actual literary Trieste. It was dead and gone. It was merely myself, poor ghost, who was literary.\\" Pathetic admission. So maybe you'll like this if your taste runs to semi-literary meanderings (well-penned, I stress), accompanied by some twee line drawings and a few photos, but a more indefinite, vague, and ghostly book would be hard to imagine. If that was the author's intention, then he succeeded magnificently. I have not read any other books like this, and I can't say that I wish to do so in future."},{"Title":"Soothe Your Nerves : The Black Woman's Guide to Understanding and Overcoming Anxiety, Panic, and Fear","review":"As a black woman who has suffered from &quot;bad nerves,&quot; Dr. Angela Neal-Barnett's book &quot;Soothe Your Nerves&quot; was a welcomed and much-needed work in my life. Everyone has heard of the SUPER WOMAN, those women who can be mother and worker and homemaker and lover, and whatever other titles there are to staple onto her. This super woman icon is even more prevalent in the black community, and when you have a culture that for the most part, would rather work out their problems themselves instead of seek outside help, it's not hard to see why thousands of black women suffer from anxiety disorders.What Neal-Barnett does in &quot;Soothe Your Nerves&quot; is first reassure women by letting them know that they are not weak because they need help, and then she explains reasons why black women-historically-have not sought outside help for their problems. From there, Neal-Barnett offers a variety of methods for women to utilize in order to begin the healing process and embark on reclaiming their lives. Outside of the great information that Neal-Barnett provides in the book, what I loved most about it is that I finally 'felt' that I was not alone, that there are others, like me, who need guidance, who need to be reassured that there is nothing wrong with them, that these problems can be removed. Neal-Barnett's book, I believe, can be used as a bridge to spark discussion and bring forth community among black women so we can create support systems and give the help that so many sisters need.Shon Bacon"},{"Title":"Soothe Your Nerves : The Black Woman's Guide to Understanding and Overcoming Anxiety, Panic, and Fear","review":"As an African American female and a doctoral student in psychology who specializes in research and treatment of anxiety disorders, I personally and professionally recommend this book to all readers who think they may suffer from &quot;bad nerves.&quot; It is difficult to discuss anxiety disorders in a community as easily &quot;spooked&quot; by talk of mental health concerns as ours is, but Dr. Barnett manages to pull it off. My only slight criticism is that Dr. Barnett seems to often make the assumption that all of her readers are not only Christian, but Southern Baptist. Other than that, this is a very much needed addition to the popular literature on anxiety in African Americans, and I hope that individuals who could benefit from this book will pick it up."},{"Title":"Soothe Your Nerves : The Black Woman's Guide to Understanding and Overcoming Anxiety, Panic, and Fear","review":"Dr. Angela Neal-Barnett practiced psychotherapy especially with black women who typically avoid such treatments because the community and family expect these super strong females to overcome their case of &quot;bad nerves&quot;. Dr. Neal-Barnett contends that \\"bad nerves\\" is a euphemism for anxiety and a myriad of fears and phobias. She ties her anecdotal findings with religious beliefs so as to make the case that more black women need professional help. However, the image of superwoman and the lack of African-American female psychotherapists lead to the use of home remedies for such problems as obsessive-compulsive disorder, overeating and drug and alcohol abuse.This book is written in such a manner as to encourage African-American females and others to seek professional help and where to go to find that assistance. Current medicines that are commonly prescribed at least in the white communities are also described. Though aimed at the black women, any person who suffers from anxiety and panic attacks will find this guide a solid first step. Dr. Neal-Barnett provides solace and assurance to overcome the fear of those first steps towards seeking help, something this reviewer first hand understands the difficulty due to the social stigmatism.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Soothe Your Nerves : The Black Woman's Guide to Understanding and Overcoming Anxiety, Panic, and Fear","review":"In her book SOOTHE YOUR NERVES, Dr. Angela Neal-Barnett tackles the most common psychological disorders afflicting women of color and presents them in a succinct, easy to read self help format, aimed at equipping black women with the necessary tools to effectively cope with these stressors. She also attempts to explode the myth of the strong black women by citing numerous case studies of black women who suffer from various forms of psychological disorders.She starts out with a definition of anxiety and fear and thenexpounds on the way they are manifested in women of color and impact their day to day existence. She includes screening tests to help recognize symptoms of mental illness and offers information on the different types of therapies and resources available to help black women battling mental health problems.SOOTHE YOUR NERVES takes the reader on a journey of self discovery as it provides step by step guidance on how to recognize and even self treat symptoms of anxiety, panic and fear. This author does a marvelous job of interpreting clinical information in a manner easily understood by the layperson. While Dr. Neal-Barnett's book appears to be specifically geared toward black women, all readers can benefit from this book.Reviewed by Autumnof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Soothe Your Nerves : The Black Woman's Guide to Understanding and Overcoming Anxiety, Panic, and Fear","review":"Soothe Your Nerves explores a topic that many women, especially black women, don?t discuss but find that we suffer from a lot. ?Nerves? is what we call it, when in fact we are suffering from a treatable and curable ailment called Anxiety. Many black women have been raised to believe that we shouldn?t seek or accept professional help for problems and we?ve been so conditioned to adapt to our problems that we readily don?t recognize we suffer from this condition. Using examples of people she?s knows and/or has treated, Dr. Angela Neal-Barnett exposes anxiety, panic and fear and gives advice on how treatment can turn a life around.Soothe Your Nerves contains self-assessments to recognize Obsessive Compulsive Disorders, examines the types of drugs commonly prescribed for treatment, and even takes the time to distinguish between psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors and lay personnel by degree and length of internship. She further lists websites and other helpful numbers for people seeking assistance with personal issues. I like the use of examples the best and while I don?t think that we are actually searching for ourselves through the pages, the subjects Dr. Neal-Barnett chooses to highlight are wonderfully illustrated with people we might encounter in our lives. We might encounter ourselves. A strong proponent of ?Sister Circles?, there are even examples of charters and step-by-step instruction on starting a circle.I am especially pleased to see that faith is mentioned in the book. Oft times, as illustrated in the book, we are taught that if we pray more and seek to turn our lives more toward our Creator, all things will be solved. It is nice to be reassured that seeking professional help for a mental issue isn?t turning away from our faith but rather allowing professionals to further enhance our faith walk. Dr. Neal-Barnett even mingles her Sister Circle concept in the church. Soothe Your Nerves has opened a door enabling more people to walk through, explore and accept. Simply by reading this book, a person is taking the first step to self-discovery and self help."},{"Title":"Soothe Your Nerves : The Black Woman's Guide to Understanding and Overcoming Anxiety, Panic, and Fear","review":"I've struggled with depression and anxiety for years and felt guilty about it because black women are taught that such things only happen to weak people or to whites.

So give the sister Dr. Angela Neal-Barnett's SOOTHE YOUR NERVES. Let's face it, Black women do have much to worry about, some of which Dr. Neal-Barnett addresses: sexual assault (women of color are twice as likely to be assaulted as white women because they are seen as \\"easy\\" or lesser), violence and violent deaths of loved ones, the \\"acting white\\" stigma, teen pregnancy, discrimination, and now the \\"down low\\" phenomenon, plus the historic strength that they have modeled in a kind of two-for-one Superwoman mold. These are realities that everyone needs to understand, especially women. By reading this book, white, Hispanic and Asian women might confront their own anxieties and their own stereotypes and offer support and help to the sistahs in their lives.However, nowhere does the book mention misogynistic hip-hop or philandering among black men. A Strong Black Woman is supposed to keep the sucker in line. Easier said than done. Nor does the book deal, except in mentioning not being able to pay for psychiatric treatment, the effect that poverty has, let alone single motherhood. Perhaps Dr. Neal-Barnett is trying to lift up the Black woman from stereotypes by portraying successful women as suffering from compulsions, anxiety, fear, and the ultimate stereotype of the Strong Black Woman, popularized in the media. She does this most effectively by portraying Black men as loving partners with frustrations of their own in dealing with their anxious mates, although not the self-destructiveness in Black men.However, treating Black women and Black men as victims is as destructive as the Superwoman myth (are you listening, Jesse Jackson?) This sensitive, intelligent treatment of a complex subject deserves to be read and reread."},{"Title":"Negative Criticism: Its Swath of Destruction and What to Do About It","review":"Very good book.

It was originally written in 1931 and has several minor limitations (modern birth control had not yet been invented), but that is also one of its strengths - there is much we can learn from the perspectives of that time. Yes, people had sex in 1931. Another limitation is a cultural bias - but he has valid insights onto relationships that can be taken separately from his cultural biases. This booklet (and, I imagine, the other works on the topic by the author) is extremely worthwhile for anyone in a committed sexual relationship, and for young people, as a great counterpoint to junk culture's ridiculous misportrayal of sexuality. Three cheers for Oliver Butterfield!"},{"Title":"Memories of Military Service: (A Teenager In Burma)","review":"Having read many historical works, both military and otherwise, I have read none finer than Mr. Bates' piece concerning his service during the Second World War. By employing both vivid descriptions and subtle imagery, Mr. Bates successfully engrosses the reader in the events that transpired around him sixty years ago. Mr. Bates also holds something that many historical authors lack: ACTUAL WRITING SKILLS! His writing style is every bit as polished as his content is absorbing.While those interested in WWII should definitely give this a look, this is a book that anyone would enjoy having. Not merely a memoir, Mr. Bates shows us the end results of the most dramatic changes a young man could undergo. This is a thoroughly impressive achievement, and offers readers a step back in time to a point that's best not forgotten."},{"Title":"Memories of Military Service: (A Teenager In Burma)","review":"Its always interesting to hear about the war from the soldier's point of view.

Well written in a down to earth style, the author seems to anticipate all sorts of questions, and then proceeds to answer them.It helped that this teenager, under the guidance of his ex-Infantryman coach, had gotten himself into supreme shape with an emphasis on both running and conditioning while in high school. Thus, when he reported to the Smokey Mountain Camp Croft for some harsh and grueling pre-combat training, it was almost a walk in the park for the author. He won competitions against the winners of 34 other training battalions, which included not only running, but vaulting walls, rope climbing and swinging over obstacles. They were required to be capable of walking, with 80-95 pound packs, 15 to 25 miles per day. On top of this, while near sighted, he was an excellent rifle shot, had both good hearing and good night vision. You are starting to see the picture that those that could handle sustained jungle combat in Burma with Merrill's Marauders were a step above an average infantryman.The battle to capture from the defending Japanese the City of Myitkyina (the airport had been taken, after weeks of fighting, on 17 May 1944 by Merrill's Marauders) lasted from 17 May to 32 August 1944. It was during the monsoon, where 430\\" of rain fell annually. Slippery and muddy going for the troops, with high mountains enclosing river valleys, which narrowed as one moved northward. They were wet constantly. Re-supply was by air-drops from C-47 cargo planes. Bamboo and brush was so thick that they could usually see only the man immediately to their side. The author went from 187 to 135 pounds. While the bearded fighters were constantly tired, their senses became heightened. Due to his scouting background, the author was transferred from the line to leading the Intelligence and Reconnaissance Scouting Platoon, and later becoming Intelligence NCO.The author's observations (for the most part in response to questions from high school students in Baraboo, Wisconsin) are interesting and educational. For example:* There was no way to have been prepared for the paralyzing effect of concentrated mortar and artillery fire, or taught the need for instinctive reactions that survival required immediate learning and adaptations;* The leadership at both the NCO and officer levels were good for the most part. The only exceptions would be the \\"deadwood that accumulated during peacetime\\" who received promotions not based on merit, but rather on seniority and/or politics;Three common traits of good leaders were - (i) unafraid to treat the troops in a civil manner; (ii) interested in getting to know their troops; (iii) intelligent in being able to honestly analyze fact situations, together with taking action to minimize risk, when possible.Weapons were a matter of life and death. He paid the highest compliment to the M1 rifle, calling it the finest weapon issued to any army, at least until late in the war when the Germans developed an assault rifle. The carbine was a worthy weapon. The BAR, while heavy and unreliable, when operating was both accurate and fast firing. The author tells the story about his fearless candor to an inspecting Inspector General's officer about the barrels of the weapons being pitted, and the resultant supply of new weapons. Another story is about General \\"Vinegar Joe\\" Stillwell, upon being made aware of the situation, broke the logjam on lack of promotions in the fighting units and the absence of OSO type entertainment, comparable to what the rear-echelon troops were enjoying.Before leaving, a company of OSS Detachment 101 trained Kachin Rangers were brought in as scouts. They were invaluable and skilled in locating enemy units in their area of operations.In summary, this book is told through the eyes of a teenager who experiences the most rugged adventure in his life, but retains a sense of humor and speaks with total integrity. You will enjoy reading his story."},{"Title":"Memories of Military Service: (A Teenager In Burma)","review":"This book is the story of an eighteen year-old who entered service in 1943, went through infantry basic training, and wound up being sent to Burma as a replacement to Merrill's Marauders in time for the siege of Myitkyina. It was written because my wife, Joyce, persuaded me to write my experiences for our six children, as I had not talked about my combat experiences except to some high school history classes.I stayed with my battalion through two campaigns in Burma, the orth Burma and Central Burma campaigns. Our battalion was incorporated into the 475 Infantry Regiment, a part of the Mars Task Force.

The authors have managed to thread through the labyrinth of institutional investing, covering multitudes of regulatory, economic, practical and theoretical issues without ever losing their readers. Astonishingly well-organized and clearly written, this book is an outstanding reference. If it has a flaw, it may be that it is almost too vast to digest. And, of course, it is rapidly becoming dated. Having been published in 2001, it could not take into account the dramatic events and implications of the dot-com bubble and the wave of corporate scandals that raised such serious questions about the role and responsibility of institutional fiduciaries. Yet it does cover, with foresight, globalization and many other trends in the world of investment. We highly recommend this book for all the knowledge it conveys to corporate finance executives and investors at every level."},{"Title":"PIC Microcontroller Project Book : For PIC Basic and PIC Basic Pro Compliers","review":"This is a good beginner's book on PIC 16F84 microcontrollers as long as you don't mind spending an additional $100 for a third party PIC BASIC code compiler. All of the book's lessons and programs are based on this BASIC compiler (no commonality to Microchip's MPLAB). There are some truly useful projects described such as serial communication, servo motor control and switch inputs, so if your goal is to get a design up and running quickly, this might be for you. It would be more accurately described as a user manual for the BASIC compiler rather than a PIC microcontroller reference. I was kinda bugged that this wasn't mentioned in the book's description."},{"Title":"PIC Microcontroller Project Book : For PIC Basic and PIC Basic Pro Compliers","review":"I'm afraid I need to disagree with the professor's review. If you are at all interested in the PIC microcontrollers and use of PIC Basic you would be best served looking elsewhere for inspiration. John Iovine's book is poorly written in so many ways that even someone new to microcontrollers would find very little use for it. Aside from his writing style being somewhat confusing, this book is full of outdated information. With a publishing date of 2004 I was suprised to find so much information applied to applications and hardware from the 90's inside. Aside from this, which in and of itself is reason enough not to waste your time or money on it, he doesn't list any resources in his text. For example, he makes mention of serial LCD's, but doesn't provide any specific examples of vendors or models and makes claim that they all work the same, which is not true. His projects are the same basic beginners projects you can find all over the internet for free and are less descriptive than those you might find elsewhere. There isn't a single PCB design in the book and he demonstrates all of his projects with a breadboard. Most unfortunate, is the pictures he provides of the finished breadboards - they are taken at an angle, far enough away from the breadboard that not only could you not use the picture to validate your own breadboard design, you can barely tell what is what on the breadboard at all. On top of everything else, he explores only the PIC16F84 chip, which while one of the more popular chipsets ever produced by Microchip, is also outdated information since Microchip has since updated this to the PIC16F84A model and he doesn't cover any other chipset in any detail. One or two of his projects and examples show a different chipset in the schematic, but that's about it. His exploration of the BASIC language is no more or less descriptive than, say, the users guide of the PIC Basic language itself (which you can get for free). There are also many omissions and errors throughout the book, specifically as they apply to his projects. For example, his H-Bridge DC motor controller design is not smokeless (you could easily fry the PIC and/or other components in this design) and is missing several key components (like capacitors) that would prevent the design from working in a real world application. He also has a half a dozen or so shameless plugs throughout the book pointing you to 'other books he has written' to get more information - if this book is any example of what you might find in his other books, you'd be best to stay away from this author altogether. The cover of this book claims it is 'Completley updated and revised' - I guess this means the first edition was really horrible, the second edition is, in my opinion, simply not worth the read."},{"Title":"PIC Microcontroller Project Book : For PIC Basic and PIC Basic Pro Compliers","review":"I'm an EE undergrad, and had several courses on programming, microcontrollers, etc. I'm using this and other books to teach myself the PIC family.

The book contains 12 projects to build, starting from simple flashing LEDs, and moving on into motor control, LCDs, A/D conversions and serial communications. All projects are explained step-by-step and are illustrated with clear schematics and photos. Material costs are minimal.

Basic issue's, like how to install software on a PC, how does a breadboard look like, what are electrical symbols and where to obtain the nessesary hardware are explained in great detail. With the subtitle &quot;A true biginners Guide To the Populair Pic microcontroler&quot; in mind the author gives us a electrical schematic, a drawing and a photograph of the breadboard of the first project, winking LED's. After this intro, the author lays out the PIC architecture, like the TRIS and port registers, the binairy calculation, reading i/o lines and the pokes and peeks of Basic - the language used to program the PIC. Once mastered this section, one of the twelve step-by-step-projects can be build. These involve for example the making of a speechsynthesizer, controlling DC stepper and Servomotors, LCD displays, reading sensors and there's even a trackerdevice that applies fuzzy logic to track light.Overall this book has a clear audience and a clear idea. The information is well structured and well edited. The layout is good, although there isn't much need for this book as a referenceguide. The author succeeded in making a very solid entrylevel book for the absolute beginner."},{"Title":"PIC Microcontroller Project Book : For PIC Basic and PIC Basic Pro Compliers","review":"The book is a very good teaching guide, but ONLY if you buy PICBASIC ( $100 ) and the EPIC Programmer ( $ 35 ). Its a nice way to get started without learning assembly, but ONLY if you buy the PICBASIC. Well written otherwise, just not the book I will use other than a reference when possible...."},{"Title":"PIC Microcontroller Project Book : For PIC Basic and PIC Basic Pro Compliers","review":"I was surprised to discover that this book is not focused on the PIC's native programming language - It is focused on PIC Basic. You will not be able to use this book unless you purchase a PIC Basic compiler for around a hundred dollars. To make matters worse, you must purchase the specific (DOS-based) one recommended in the book if you expect the examples to work as written. Other compilers have significant variations in syntax and capabilities.Not a bad book - just be aware of what you are getting."},{"Title":"PIC Microcontroller Project Book : For PIC Basic and PIC Basic Pro Compliers","review":"I highly recommend this book to the beginner getting into PIC microcontrollers. Everything is explained in enough detail for the beginner to understand. Work through the projects in this book and you should have enough background to design your own control projects. Yes, this book covers only the PIC 16F84 controller, but porting PICBASIC code to other PIC controllers is very easy. Yes, you will have to purchase the third party PICBASIC software in order to use the book. But for the hobbyist new to PIC programming, PICBASIC is the way to go--the time saved from using PICBASIC instead of Microchip Assembler is tremendous, especially for the beginner. Don't buy the software from Images. Buy it off the internet and the software should arrive the same time as the book. PIC microcontrollers really rock and this book is an excellent place to start."},{"Title":"PIC Microcontroller Project Book : For PIC Basic and PIC Basic Pro Compliers","review":"I read this book and found it very useful. The explanations, from program installation to actual PIC programming, is given in detail. The PIC Basic language is powerful and makes it easy to program PIC microcontrollers. The author stays focused on the PIC 16F84. The book projects are good; analog to digital converters, serial communication, LCD displays, neural circuits, servo motor controls, etc. I was able to build these projects and get them up and running. This is no small feat for me.I think the book is an excellant value and am looking forward to the author's next book."},{"Title":"PIC Microcontroller Project Book : For PIC Basic and PIC Basic Pro Compliers","review":"I bought this book based on the description and the reviews. Somehow during all that I missed that it was actually an &quot;Introduction to Programming and Using the PIC 16F84 with the PICBasic Compiler&quot; Given that I have no interest in PICBasic this book was a complete waste of money. If you have an interest in PICBasic this is probably a worthwile book, otherwise, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"PIC Microcontroller Project Book : For PIC Basic and PIC Basic Pro Compliers","review":"Its a very comprehensive text, especially when you are new to Pics as I'm and is about to get your feet all wet."},{"Title":"PIC Microcontroller Project Book : For PIC Basic and PIC Basic Pro Compliers","review":"The digital age moves at a great pace and any publication more than a few months old is out of date. The PIC Microcontroller Project Book is in fact such a book. However if you want to begin using PICs, then this is an excellent place to start. The book begins at the beginning and describes the use of the tools necessary to produce code to be programmed into the PIC.Further chapters give instruction on programming in PicBasic with simple examples of programs to get the PIC to do what you want. It is as it suggests a Project Book. I find that I learn faster with this structured stepwise instruction.I found the book useful and informative. The book is for the person who is starting off. To delve more deeply into programming PICs, you will need to do further reading, but, you will have a good basic understanding of the operation of PICs and their potential.I would recommend this publication highly and congratulate the author on a job well done."},{"Title":"PIC Microcontroller Project Book : For PIC Basic and PIC Basic Pro Compliers","review":"This is a great book for learning a \\"beginner's basics\\" in microcollers. I give it four stars because of the misleading cover images of robots. There is nothing in the book about making a complete robot, but there are good basic microcontroller applications that could be used in a robot. In other words, there are PIC Basic programs where the reader can see real world applications while learning how to program and set up circuits."},{"Title":"PIC Microcontroller Project Book : For PIC Basic and PIC Basic Pro Compliers","review":"When I bought the previous edition of this book, I couldn't put it down. I had no idea how easy PIC BASIC was, and that you can get PIC chips for free!Every project works and there is a thorough explanation in plain english as to how it works. The projects covered in this book are really very cool and I highly recommend it to anyone just getting into this field."},{"Title":"PIC Microcontroller Project Book : For PIC Basic and PIC Basic Pro Compliers","review":"This book is little more than a catalog for &quot;Images Company&quot;, just like all of the other John Iovine books that I've read. Of course what the author fails to mention in each book, and even on the company's web site, is that _he is the owner of said company_. And yes, you can order just about everything you need from him, but be prepared to pay as much as 600% over what you would pay anywhere else (digikey, mouser, radio shack, etc). Once again, I'm left feeling cheated.One more thing.....the book is only 195 pages long, not 272 pages."},{"Title":"PIC Microcontroller Project Book : For PIC Basic and PIC Basic Pro Compliers","review":"I recently bought this book in order to learn Pic programming and avoid learning assembly language. I tought that my begginer knowledge of C++ will be enough to understand Basic. But it was not so. Lots of program structure explanation used in Basic is omitted and simply assumed. I did not mind that the book reffers to only one tool for programming as that is the best way for the begginer to go. However, if you have no prior Basic language knowledge, stay away from this book!"},{"Title":"PIC Microcontroller Project Book : For PIC Basic and PIC Basic Pro Compliers","review":"Do not buy this book! It is nothing more than a giant catalogue for Images Co. (which the author owns). It teaches you less then any other thing you could buy (including the PICBasic assembler instruction book). It is page after page of buy this, buy that, and it doesn't teach you anything. I also belive that no one would write a good review for this book.... ... again, if you buy this book you WILL be disapointed.... I can't belive anyone would even publish this book."},{"Title":"PIC Microcontroller Project Book : For PIC Basic and PIC Basic Pro Compliers","review":"This book is ok if want to build the robots explained in the book or useit to expand your knowledge. The reason I like this book is because he use's both the PICBASIC and PICBASIC PRO to program the robots.

Still the book is great!!!"},{"Title":"PIC Microcontroller Project Book : For PIC Basic and PIC Basic Pro Compliers","review":"I read the PIC microcontroller book by John Iovine and found it very useful. I must comment on the vindictive and false review by the anonymous reader from Chandler, AZ.Anonymous' statement that the book is just a cataloge for Images Company is false. McGraw-Hill would not jeopardize its reputation by publishing a catalog and promote it as a project book. The author does reference Images Company as anonymous stated, but anonymous fails to mention that Jameco (James), JDR and Radio Shack are referenced as well.Anonymous' statement &quot;be prepared to pay 600% over...&quot; is misleading. Penny parts (resistors, caps, crystals, etc.) do cost more. A capacitor may cost 14 cents instead of 2 cents, a difference of 12 cents. To use that 12 cents to make a sweeping statement that &quot;just about everything&quot; is 600% more is misleading and unjust. The reality is that all major components outlined in the book, the PICBasic Compiler ($99.95), Epic board ($59.95) and the PIC 16F84 (6.95) cost the same from all distributors, including Images Co.Nowhere in anonymous' review is any reference to the book's content, which is quite good. Chandler AZ, in desperation to say something derogatory makes a comment on the page copunt. If Chandler AZ is so distressed with John Iovine's books, why does he keep buying them? This is suppose to be an open forum for reader reviews, not a personal vendetta against the author by someone cowardly hiding anonymously behind a facade of honest opinion. The only person left feeling cheated is anyone who puts any worth in Chandler, AZ misleading and flaccid review."},{"Title":"PIC Microcontroller Project Book : For PIC Basic and PIC Basic Pro Compliers","review":"This is one of those books that you have to read with a grain of salt. Its one of those books that want you to own the same &quot;tools&quot; that the author owns in order to &quot;use&quot; the book.This doesn't bother me. I never build any of the projects I read about in these type of books. I use them simply to learn from - then build my own projects using my own &quot;tools.&quot;So in this respect - I did learn quite a bit about pics. So my goal in buying the book was fulfilled. This book has a great mixture of hardware and software topics. This is the second book by John Iovine that I have purchased. I enjoyed both of them... They were both well written.This book was easy to follow along. Although not strictly a beginners book - this book doesn't get too complicated..."},{"Title":"PIC Microcontroller Project Book : For PIC Basic and PIC Basic Pro Compliers","review":"This is a good book for both beginners and intermediate readers alike. It guides you through the installation of the PICBasic software and your first project with detailed explanations and pictures. There are many useful projects in this book (such as a speech synthesizer, fuzzy logic, servo motor control, interfacing LCDs and a/d conversion), but you are not limited to those because once you have read it, you will be able to come up with your own unique uses for PICs.The chapters are nicely laid out, the text is clear and generally concise without getting into too much technical jargon, and the diagrams are very helpful. My only gripe is with the coding style, specificly the lack of indentation, which doesn't affect the program but helps when you have to go back and debug something. However, overall it's a great book to help get you started in PICBasic programming."},{"Title":"PIC Microcontroller Project Book : For PIC Basic and PIC Basic Pro Compliers","review":"The author did a great job writing this exelent work. Even though I am already well versed in numerous embedded micro controller platforms, I must give my highest praise to the solidity of this book. It clearly and concisely introduces and explains the difference between Harvard and von Neumann micro architectures and provides a very well organized unit on proper programming skills. Also, he provides numerous examples such as the servo motor feedback control system, the speech synthesizer circuit and the minor introduction to heuristically based neural networks incorporating the usage of fuzzy logic embedded controls.The book compares Basic Stamp, and the PIC microcontrollers providing the reader with hard information towards the differentiating technical aspects of the two. On the whole, John Iovine has done an excellent job writing this book. I must recommend this to all beginners."},{"Title":"PIC Microcontroller Project Book : For PIC Basic and PIC Basic Pro Compliers","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Since this book is suppose to take the newbie (judging from the almost agonizing explanation of binary counting)from ground zero I would extend the opinion that the errors are critical failures and eliminate the usefulness of the book. If however you are already a somewhat able &quot;hacker&quot; (or a professional Software Engineer like myself), the book is a great way of learning the basics of firmware writing and does in fact transfer the knowledge it is supposed to."},{"Title":"PIC Microcontroller Project Book : For PIC Basic and PIC Basic Pro Compliers","review":"John Iovine did a superlative and extraordinary job at writing this fine piece of exquisite work. Even though I am already well versed in numerous embedded micro controller platform manifestations, I must give my utter most commendments to the solidity of this book. John clearly and concisely introduces and thoroughly explains the difference between Harvard and von Neumann micro architectures and provides a very well organized unit on sustaining adequate and proper programming skills. Also, he provides numerous examples such as the servo motor feedback control system, the speech synthesizer circuit and the minor introduction to heuristically based neural networks incorporating the usage and wide-spread facilitation of fuzzy logic embedded controls. Furthermore, he contrast Basic Stamp PIC MCU's and Microchip MCU's providing the reader with hard information towards the differentiating technical aspects of the two. In addition, one other topic I would like to informally address is the fact that one reader mentioned above, in a rather ludicrous, vague, appalling, and demeaning manner, that John Iovine uses his book on Pic's as a mere meager and mundane catalog for the sole undefined purpose of facilitating an economic benefit by selling another companies products. Uhm, reality check, that's not what he is trying to do, of the 232 pages I only count about seven pages spent subjecting the reader to such advertisements. I too, like a fellow reviewer, find it unlikely that McGraw-Hill would allow such an atrocity to be printed in their books. On the whole, John Iovine has done an excellent job writing this book. I must recommend this to all beginners. For the record, you should take my word this is a darn good book because I am a micro assembly specialist that works for Fab 25 in Houston, Texas, I known embedded sub processor design like the back of my hand. This book really belongs too one of my engineering team mates who lent me the book to read on my vacation if I got board."},{"Title":"PIC Microcontroller Project Book : For PIC Basic and PIC Basic Pro Compliers","review":"I think this book was written just to generate revenue! While it might be OK for experienced electronic technicians, it's weak on advanced subjects. I also disagree with the author's suggestion of PicBasic over PicBasic Pro. In my opinion, 'Pro' is a better buy.Also, beginners should beware of some serious schematic errors. For example, in two circuits there's no filter capacitor between a bridge recifier and a voltage regulator. While errors like this are easy to overlook, for a newbie, it means the difference between a circuit that works and one that doesn't. I would have expected better editing on a book geared toward the beginner."},{"Title":"PIC Microcontroller Project Book : For PIC Basic and PIC Basic Pro Compliers","review":"This book is very informative; however, the author starts out telling you that he is writing as though you have no knowledge of microcontrollers, but then write the rest of the book as if you've got a little more knowledge on the subject. He explains things fairly quickly so you may feel like you're left behind. I wouldn't recommend this book if you are just barely learning about Microcontrollers.

So all books on Basic are practically useless unless you have the software or a way to get it outside of the Melabs website.The reason I bought this book was to learn how to use a simple language to program and then go onto harder stuff. I never was bothered by getting a compiler since I am a beginner. Let me warn you MPlab and MPasm are hard to learn if you don't have prior knowledge. (The basics) I Tried laid it down for another day.Second like many of you said it is out of date. It presents the EPIC Programmer board Which requires the old fashioned Printer cable. Most computers nowadays use a USB port for printers. No more printer ports. Save yourself a heart ache and get a different book.I had a hard time understanding his writing as well but was able to learn with the PBP manual and this book side by side the basics of commands.

Now that I have graduated engineering school and worked for several years in the fields of robotics and A. I., I was curious to see if the publications from TAB have improved over the years.They haven't; Not in the least.The text ventures into trying to use an \\"artificial neural circuit\\" (i.e., a single artificial neuron) for a sensor, but fails to get the circuit at all right. An artificial neuron is merely a weighted sum (i.e., dot product) followed by a step (or, alternatively, a sigmoid) function.The text neglects to include the step function. This omission turns the neural circuit into a simple FIR filter. A glaring error that anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the subject would see at a moment's glance. If the circuit was built and tested, I don't see how the error could have been missed.Other examples of sloppiness that are clear from even a cursory glance at the material include the failure to include protection diodes across inductors and motors, failure to isolate the power for a motor from the logic power, thus failing to provide clean power for the logic ICs, etc. Note that the lack of clean power could cause intermittent logic errors that would have you pulling your hair out looking for the problem. Save the hair...use a better text.Stupid, amateurish errors. Not really acceptable in any technical subject. Pretty shameful, actually.I would not start a project using this text for fear of other errors that would prove to be complete show stoppers in the project. I shall never buy a text from this sloppy publisher again. Better teachings can be found in the books by Chuck Hellebuyck.

What this book provided were software examples in PICBasic. Almost all the illustrations were of PICBasic program listings. Very little was spent going over the PIC architecture. After reading the book, things like timing functions, interrupts, triggers, Powerup routines, Watchdog examples, etc. were not covered from a microcontroller perspective. The author never explains how these PICBasic features work on the microcontroller. A better title of the book would be \\"Programming a PIC in PICBasic.\\" The PIC microcontroller instruction set was never illustrated, or referenced in the entire book. Only one block diagram of the PIC. No explanations of the reserved registers. No examples of accessing the flash or non-volatile memory. Non of the control registers were mentioned.

Browsing through the second edition, I see he's added PIC Basic \\"Pro\\" material, and filled out the chapters with more material specific to the chapter.

That is a good thing! The sub-title of this book is on target: it is a primer on open source as business strategy. To that I would add what I have recommended to the organizers of OSCON, that managers be very aware of the others opens: Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), Open Spectrum, Open Access, Open Culture, Open Innovation, Open Society, and Open Circle/Open Space.

I like my fiction with a meat-and-potatoes kind of action or adventure. But once I stuck my nose in Dave Shields' book, I couldn't put it down.Tom Lewis is a happily-married white-collar guy with his own office, an optimistic outlook and his first baby on the way. Then a chance encounter with a nigh-forgotten relative turns his world upside-down: His mother is not his mother; his uncle is not his uncle--his entire life has been a lie.I think I was more fascinated with Uncle Martin's episodic revelations than even his own nephew--the man had an unorthodox childhood, to say the least. Piece-by-piece, he presents a secret family history that will shatter our hero's identity, lead him to question his own self-worth...but, ultimately, motivate him to find and know his real father.The Pendulum's Path is set in Salt Lake City. I've passed through it a couple times, but my view from the highway gave me no insights as to how this city is different from any other. Not only does Dave Sheilds' book show us how it's different, his cultural microcosm of a Mormon family also reveals how people are so much the same, wherever and whenever they happen to live.Regardless of what you know (or don't know) about Utah, Mormonism or rock-climbing (did I fail to mention that?), The Pendulum's Path will grab you."},{"Title":"The Pendulum's Path","review":"I'm glad I read this novel.

The first impression one receives is that of careful craftsmanship in the writing, none of the sequential lapses or non-linear aberrations so common in even the best novels. The dialogues are realistic, not overdone, yet have the ring of honesty, obviously the work of a dedicated author who cares a great deal about his calling. The story is both simple and complex. On the surface, it is obviously the chronology of a man in an early mid-life crisis brought about by the startling revelation that his mother is really his aunt, his estranged uncle is his father, his grandfather was a hypocritical, mean and abusive tyrant that had affairs, yelled a lot and created an environment that screwed up the lives of all in his family and the women all had dark secrets. Wait, you&#65533;re thinking, isn&#65533;t this the Sopranos? No, believe it or not, it is about Mormons, which no doubt will not please all members of that faith since many of the characters within are &#65533;Jack&#65533; Mormons, including the main one, Tom, who drinks beer, doesn&#65533;t tithe and tells lies, but that is to be expected since he is also a mortgage broker. However in his defense, he hates his job and tries many times to work up the gumption to do something about it. I must admit this genre isn&#65533;t my normal reading fare, so my interest in Tom and his problems was lukewarm at best due to the fact he was such a wimp, having great difficulty making decisions or sticking to them, crying at the drop of a hat, which he did frequently, and whining about his oh, so hard office job lifting that heavy phone. A year on the green chain at the sawmill would have done wonders for his attitude. Despite this, his obsession with his father, new baby, and the complicated issues with all the members of his immediate family including his amazingly understanding, almost angelic wife, Sara, subtly drew me in, hooked by wondering how this loser was going to end up. In a mental ward? Rooftop sniper? Serial killer? Guest on Jerry Springer? I won&#65533;t spoil it for you, you have to read it to find out.Another interesting character, Tom&#65533;s biological father, Martin was just eccentric enough to be enjoyable. He could have easily upstaged everyone in the book with a little help and if Shields ever writes a book with Martin as the main character, I&#65533;ll buy it. Being also a compulsive-obsessive of sorts, I related to him quite well and thoroughly liked the author&#65533;s creative concept of a story within the story as Martin relates his significant memories from childhood to adulthood in his above average-dysfunctional family. The last two chapters were my reward, they actually had some genuine physical action and danger, a perfect wrap to this ingenious look at this clan from the Great Salt Lake City, which apparently only has &#65533;rusty&#65533; colored cars, no doubt due to the proximity of so much salt. You will learn much about the Mormon mindset, (Don&#65533;t care how you bringham, just bringham young) familial bonds and the stresses they often endure,(the Doctor Schwartzeneggers a baby out by the head by sheer brute force) some mundanely, expectedly normal, (Uncle John is an alcoholic politician, Grandpa LaVar, the Church Stake President practices morality, fidelity and truth Bill Clinton style)and some totally unexpected,(spacecase Martin, a computer programmer?) but this book works on a more subtle level as well as it follows an individual&#65533;s difficult journey to find himself and the true values that make life worth the hardship of living. Even blase readers will find themselves reassessing their own lives and familial obligations after reading this well-crafted novel. On it&#65533;s own merits, I have to give it top marks, for it succeeds in doing what it was written to do, entertain, inform with emotional insight and make one evaluate the meaning of true wealth: the riches of having the unconditional love of family and friends."},{"Title":"The Pendulum's Path","review":"\\"The Pendulum's Path\\" is a superb first novel for an author that shows great promise. It is a family drama that grips you and never lets go. The characters are well-defined, the dialogue crisp, the plot ever deepening, and the conclusion heart-poundly profound. I related quite well to the dysfuntional family, and liked that issues were delved into realistically. I would highly recommend reading this page turner; I myself read it till wee hours of the morning, not able to put it down. Great first effort!!!!"},{"Title":"The Pendulum's Path","review":"Dave Shields has written a forceful, emotional tale of family secrets, and their affects on a Utah family. His characters are alive; his descriptions of the Salt Lake City area are authentic; and his story is compelling. The plot is delicately woven with threads of surprise interspersed in a believable manner. It is a modern novel that develops modern problems familiar to most families. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Pendulum's Path","review":"I am normally one of those people who starts a book, gets bored quickly and never finishes. I have at least three started novels under my bed collecting dust. Since the birth of my daughter 4 months ago, my life now has no time for extracurricular anything.With that said, I couldn't put The Pendulum's Path down. I got it on a Wednesday and by the next Wednesday, I had finished the entire thing. The characters were so complex, the story is riveting and incredibly thought-provoking, and I found my emotions right on the surface from the first chapter. I identified personally with the mother/daughter relationship between Delilah and Emma. I have seen the exact same thing happen between my mother and grandmother. Dave Shields wrote a novel that shows the complexities of all families through the Crumps. Even though you don't know this family, you feel close to them instantly. A thumbs up to Mr. Shields for a great book that collected no dust in my house."},{"Title":"The Pendulum's Path","review":"How we define ourselves influences how we interact with others and what directions we take when choosing where we will journey in life. In Mr. Shields's excellent and compelling first novel, his protagonist's discovery destabilizes his entire definition of who he is. The author avoids the obvious: Tom Lewis is no drama king who dives headlong into an abyss of despair. Rather, he is a man any reader can identify with as he juggles responsibilities that seem to multiply just when he is least in a position to deal with them.It is this proliferation of crises that is the main driving force behind his story, and it works beautifully. The pacing and the reader's involvement with the character are so strong it is all but impossible to put the book down. Each event arises naturally from the groundwork Mr. Shields has made in the beginning, so there is never any sense of a conflict's being contrived or a reaction's being unmotivated.All of the characters have that deep, vibrant humanity that arouses a sense of recognition-we know these people, or wish we did.All this leads to an ending that grabs the reader by the throat and dares one to stop before the final resolution. The unspoken message is that even the worst possible life events can have meaning, depending on the choices we make when coping with them. Tom Lewis's response to his crisis is composed of equal parts confrontation and acceptance-a balanced reaction that is sharply reflected in the book's climax.Dave Shields has written an emotionally rich book that proves coming-of-age is not an adolescent phenomenon, and does it with charm and optimism that is often lacking in a time when cynicism too often prevails."},{"Title":"The Pendulum's Path","review":"&quot;The Pendulum's Path&quot; is a uniquely written, powerful tale of a family that was and shouldn't have been, and the family that wasn't, and should have been. The story, told by the lead character, in first person, takes getting used to, but moves quickly with many evocative passages. The characters are real, and their lives are possible.From Tom Lewis' cold meeting with his frosty &quot;Uncle&quot; Martin, to the exciting climax, the author, Dave Shields, takes you through a story of intrigues, lies, deceptions, trials, and reconciliations. The sins of the &quot;Father&quot; truly are visited upon the generations.If you've ever had a family, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Pendulum's Path","review":"You can feel the characters breathing on the page and in no time you are breathing with them.

It's ironic how those who love us most are often the ones who hurt us the deepest.Dave takes us on a tangled journey of a man and his family and the heartache and pain one domineering patriarch can cause to generations after him.Using mountaineering as a metaphor for life, Shields takes us on a journey inside one man's acceptance of a painful secret, and the peace and healing he brings to others.Often beautifully descriptive of the Salt Lake City area and the Wasatch mountains (where the Winter Olympics were recently held), I enjoyed &quot;Pendulum's Path&quot; and expect even greater things to come from Dave Shields.

Obviously Steve is a 'driven' man and achieves his goals. On the motivational level - I learnt about Steve the planner and organiser - especially for the longer term. Some of his plans and projects have taken many many years...

This book takes the reader through the various phases of each major feat the highlight of which is his solo circumnavigation of the globe in a balloon after six attempts. It does become a little bit belabored, but since it's such a unique account of some truly extraordinary feats you can forgive him for some of the \\"flexing\\" he does throughout. The actual biographical info on his life is somewhat scant focusing more on his many adventures. It's clear though after reading this that he never did any of this stuff for the publicity. He really wanted to challenge himself and raise the bar for others. You come away from this biography of a hyper-motivated adventurer & successful businessman feeling anything is possible with the right amount of effort and persistance.

And much, much more.The feats are truly stupendous, mind-boggling, almost unbelievable that one individual could do so many, yet as evidence that he was, indeed, human, Fossett occasionally fails (Everest climb, e.g.). We have always wondered about another of his \\"failures,\\" i.e. why Fossett seemed to fail to capture wider acclaim, at least wider vis-&agrave;-vis what we thought his status in the pantheon of pop culture should have been (when a close friend described Fossett as \\"his hero\\" we realized we had never heard that kind of acclamation applied to Fossett so we sought out this book to read his whole story). The author provides some insights on that: he says he never chased fame, the high of the accomplishment was enough. His recounting of these achievements, and they are staggering, comes off sometimes a bit like working down the Saturday to-do, he is that matter-of-fact. Maybe that was the \\"real\\" Steve...cool, calm, calculating, quiet and modest. No Superman cape. No light shows.

How could someone who planned his adventures so meticulously (he was a professional risk manager on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, after all), take off without a GPS device, thus making it impossible to track him? We'll never know, but thankfully he was stirred to lay down his account of his remarkable life before that fateful day.Another good friend, and CBOE trader, (and Mackinaw sail race winner, like the author) knew Fossett personally, and speaks highly of his personal integrity, competitiveness, and personal qualities.

Being a retired fighter pilot and airline captain, my fellow club member referred to Steve Fossett's fatal plane crash in that almost clinically detached way people do who gamble with the high risks and experience the high personal rewards.As I write this review, I keep looking at the book's cover. It is a close-up of Steve standing by the Global Flyer, the plane he flew solo around the world. He is dressed in a white \\"Right Stuff' looking flight suit. But the round face, thinning hair and cherubic smile on this 63 year old face seems incongruous for an adventurer with a list of \\"firsts' that runs for pages.This book stuffs you into the cramped cockpits of airplanes and the windswept decks of unimaginably big and fast sailboats. You and Steve are suspended in the cold thin upper atmosphere in a gas balloon or soaring to great heights and speeds in a high tech glider. He was looking forward to sharing with us his next adventure, a deep submersible trip miles down into the Marianas Trench.Published scarcely a year before his untimely death in rugged mountainous terrain, the epilogue he wrote is all the more poignant: \\"There are places yet to be explored and important records to be broken.\\" Perhaps because I know my friend has spoken with her since his death, it is Steve Fossett's wife Peggy's words, at the very beginning of the book that stick with me the most. \\"Do I worry?

Gorman examines the Pagan, Jewish, and Christian attitudes on abortion, spending more chapters breaking down Christian attitudes into the first three centuries and the fourth and fifth centuries. He then wraps up with two final paragraphs. One that rounds off the discussion of where Christian attitudes about abortion came from. Gorman concludes that Christian attitudes were heavily influenced by its Jewish history, but given Jesus' teachings on love and peace turned out to be more adamantly anti-abortion than the Jews. I suspect there is merit to this argument, but also think that much of Christianity's strong anti-abortion stance was due to its direct encounter with the pagan world. Even Jews in the diaspora tended to have their own communities and live amongst themselves. But many Christians were not only converted pagans, they were intent on spreading their own religion even deeper into Roman society. Such clashes tend to sharpen differences.Up until this point, I benefitted from every part of the book -- even if I was not convinced on every point. Gorman does a good job of providing primary sources about pagan, Christian, and Jewish attitudes on abortion. He also does a good job of explaining those sources and spends much good analysis not only on what the attitudes on abortion were, but what the core of the issue really was. For example, was abortion criticized because it was an impediment to procreation, a means of covering up sexual immorality, a threat to the woman's life as well, or as the killing of a human life? (for Christians it seems all of these were mentioned, but the driving concern was the humanity of the fetus). Nevertheless, Gorman lost a star because his final chapter swerves into very 80s territory as he launches an assault on those pro-life Christians who are pro-strong national defense, pro-capital punishment, and not strong enough on the issue of gun control. Up to this point, his discussion was unemotional, logical, even systematic. Not so here. He comes across as a man struggling to reconcile his personal liberal political beliefs with his strong pro-life beliefs. His solution it to blast both sides. Beyond its obvious tangential nature, this diabtribe is out of place because it -- unlike his excellent discussion of early Christian views on abortion -- is built not on Christian history but on his own emotional biases.Nevertheless, on the issue of abortion, this is one of the best values out there for understanding what the Church has believed on this subject -- it was immoral. And perhaps more importantly, why it believed what it did -- it was the taking of an innocent human life."},{"Title":"Abortion and the Early Church: Christian, Jewish and Pagan Attitudes in the Greco-Roman World","review":"This is well-researched and written examination of the early Christian church's position on abortion, contraception and taking of life.His looking into this reveals that they were passionately against abortion and even had pagan and Jewish voices joining with them in this.Citing early fathers the likes of Augustine, Ambrose, Jerome, Chrysostom, Hippolytus and others who wrote and spoke articulately against abortion on grounds of the murder of innocent life, the sanctity of the marriage bed and the immorality and sin of this spreading taking of life.I was frustrated with only one small part of this otherwise well done work, his final linking of abortion with nuclear arms and capital punishment. His writing as though the early church fathers were of this same mind is a matter that I honestly am not knowledgeable on, but will investigate. Suggest other readers understand a common theological problem with quoting the early church fathers, that of they wrote so much that most all sides of an issue find support in them. It is confusing.Excellent gem of work that shows abortion is not a modern problem nor is the church's countercultural witness against it either. Valuable resource to the church."},{"Title":"Abortion and the Early Church: Christian, Jewish and Pagan Attitudes in the Greco-Roman World","review":"Dr. Michael Gorman handles the question of the historic positions on abortion of major Greek philosophers (including Plato and Aristotle), Roman, Jewish, and early Christians in a very well documented text. The early Christian position stands in contrast to the others in it's overwhelming support of life at all stages. Toward the end of the book the author addresses the issue of a consistent ethic of life which elicits support for life in the context of human conflict, as well as for the unborn. Overall the book supports it's goal of presenting the issue of abortion in relation to the early church, providing many references, and a challenge for the future in addressing the issue of being pro-life in a consistent and comprehensive manner."},{"Title":"Abortion and the Early Church: Christian, Jewish and Pagan Attitudes in the Greco-Roman World","review":"Though the Bible says little about abortion per se, the Early Church adamantly opposed it. This is made clear in Michael J. Gorman's work, Abortion & the Early Church: Christian, Jewish, & Pagan Attitudes in the Greco-Roman World (Downers Grove: InterVarsity Press, c. 1982).The world into which Christianity came easily tolerated abortion. A society which allowed infanticide could not be overly exercised by abortions! The satirist Juvenal noted that Rome's wealthy women rarely got pregnant because money allowed them to purchase abortions. Some women apparently wanted to maintain their trim appearance and sought to avoid the swollen stomach and limited activities pregnancy involves.The Hippocratic Oath, of course, called physicians to \\"not give to a woman a pessary to cause abortion,\\" and some of the great \\"natural law\\" thinkers, such as Cicero, opposed it. Nero's tutor, the Stoic philosopher Seneca \\"lauded his own mother for not participating in unchastity, 'the greatest evil of our time,' and for never having 'crushed the hope of children that were being nurtured in [her] body'\\" (p. 28). Alone among ancient peoples, however, the Jews strongly condemned abortion. Though the Hebrew Bible does not clearly address it, by-and-large the Jews did not practice abortion. The only item at issue which divided the rabbis concerned the penalty necessary when \\"accidental or therapeutic abortion\\" occurred.Early Christians sided with the pro-life Stoics and Jews. The New Testament does not specifically mention abortion, but second century documents, the Didache and the Epistle of Barnabas directly denounce it. It is considered a form of murder, forbidden by the Law. The words of Athenagoras are typical: \\"What reason would we have to commit murder when we say that women who induce abortions are murderers, and will have to give account of it to God? For the same person would not regard the fetus in the womb as a living thing and therefore an object of God's care [and then kill it]\\" (p. 54). Early councils, the most influential of the Church Fathers (Tertullian, Origin, Basil of Caesarea, Ambrose, Augustine, John Chrysostom, Jerome) all adamantly condemned it. As penance, Church members who aborted a child were often barred from Communion for ten years. It was clearly considered one of the gravest of all sins.Though Gorman's work focuses on a world long gone, it reveals an issue which is quite contemporary! As paganism resurfaces, abortion becomes more acceptable. And if the Church today is to follow the example of the Church of antiquity, the church of the martyrs and saints, its position on abortion will likely be one of the indicators of its fidelity and integrity."},{"Title":"Abortion and the Early Church: Christian, Jewish and Pagan Attitudes in the Greco-Roman World","review":"It is only occasionally that a professor reads a student's paper and think that it is so profound, so timely, so scholarly, and so well written that it demands publication. The beginning of this book was such a paper. I am sure that when Bruce Metzger read his student's paper he knew that the readable style of Michael J. Gorman couples with his scholarly detail would make a great impact on a church and a culture struggling with the issue of abortion. Gorman makes the early church, as well as Judaism, come alive as he portrays their own response to a surrounding culture that treated human life with much disrespect.Gorman surveys the history of abortion in the ancient world and finds many similarities in both their motives and methods to the modern world. They used abortion to conceal illicit sexual activity as well as a means of birth control. They used both poisons and mechanical means, of which Gorman graphically illustrates, in the attempt to abort. He quotes Plato and Aristotle, as well as many others, to demonstrate that in the ancient world the individual and family were viewed as existing solely for the state. The Greek city states had problems of overpopulation, while the Romans later had problems of underpopulation. Thus they changed their policy of abortion accordingly. Although Gorman does not draw the correlation, these policies sound very similar to the abortion policies of the U.S.S.R. and Red China, as well as similar to many of the Western world scientific elite who desire such control.Even though \\"rich and poor, slave and free, young and old aborted themselves and were given abortions\\" (p. 27), various pagans in the fields of medicine, law, rhetoric, philosophy, and religion criticized some of the motives and methods of abortion. The Oath of Hippocrates included a definite promise not to perform an abortion. Inscriptions on several Greek temples indicated that abortion caused ritual, though not moral, uncleanliness. Among the Romans, Ovid, Favorinus, and especially the Stoics condemned abortion. Most believed that abortion was against the nature of sex, the logic of large families, and an offense against the gods, rather than an offense against the fetus who was considered human only after birth.Gorman discusses two Jewish views of abortion, the Alexandrian and the Palestinian, and shows that although there are some differences, they strongly unite on the most important issues. Deliberate abortion was consistently condemned as disrespectful of life and as bloodshed. Their discussions were confined to only accidental and therapeutic abortions. They also confined their discussions about the personhood of the fetus to the legal aspects rather than the moral. The Alexandrian school, as well as some of the Palestinian school, agreed that the fetus had legal personhood. The primary division of opinion was over the severity of the penalty exacted for the accidental or therapeutic abortions.Like the Jewish views, the early church was also consistently against deliberate abortion. Concern for the fetus distinguished the Christian position from pagan disapproval of abortion. Abortion was consistently viewed as murder. Abortion was a means of preventing or attacking human life, and thus wrong in the eyes of God. The early Christians, according to Gorman, were consistently pro-life and thus forbade Christian involvement in war, gladiator fights, and capital punishment, as well as abortion.Gorman draws the conclusion that Christians today are inconsistent in their positions of pro-life or pro-choice. Pro-life groups who oppose abortion usually support a strong national defense, just war, and individual ownership of handguns. Pro-choice groups who say that women should have the choice over whether or not to abort also take many pro-life positions, such as working on behalf of the poor, and standing against nuclear arms build up, individual ownership of handguns, and capital punishment. Gorman pleads for contemporary Christians to be consistently pro-life, following the example of the early church.Although Gorman had done a brilliant job discussing the early church's views on abortion in their historical context, his conclusions and applications can be criticized. \\"Pro-life\\" and \\"pro-choice\\" might not be the most accurate categories in which to place all the contemporary social issues. Those who support free market economics and a limited government that has a very limited involvement in welfare do so in the name of the poor. Those who support nuclear arms build up believe that it will prevent a war with the U.S.S.R., who have consistently broken every treaty regarding nuclear limitations and have an explicit policy of world domination. Those who support capital punishment do so in the name of justice, human creation in the imago Dei, and biblical commands. Thus, it seems that they are consistently pro-life and pro-freedom, whereas, as Gorman points out, the \\"pro-choice\\" groups are inconsistently supporting abortion."},{"Title":"Abortion and the Early Church: Christian, Jewish and Pagan Attitudes in the Greco-Roman World","review":"This is a short book, but it is long enough to cover all the known sources. Abortion was common in the Roman empire. The methods ran the gamut from various poisons to stabbing and cutting up the fetus while still in the womb.The plain fact is this: the early Christians were firmly against abortion, and their reason was their concern with the humanity of the child. In the Didache and Barnabas \\"the significance of these two writings lies both in their firm position on abortion as murder and in their development of an ethical context within which abortion should be viewed\\" (p 50).Anyone interested in this topic would benefit by the book \\"When Children Became People\\", an outstanding study of how differently Christians viewed children and family, as compared to the ancient Greeks and Romans."},{"Title":"Kentucky is Wider & Other Short Stories","review":"Jon Roket, Kentucky Is Wider and Other Short Stories (self-published?, 2004)Singer and writer Jon Roket's first book is a very small, beautifully-printed hardback that is what it says it is, no more and no less. The four short stories in this collection (of which, ironically, Kentucky Is Wider is not one) are actually related collections of pieces of what is known today as \\"flash fiction,\\" those hundred- to thousand-word pieces that are the fictive version of short poems. They are flanked by two other standalone pieces of flash fiction (of which Kentucky Is Wider is one).Roket's work, to be short about it, shows great promise. Informed by the ghosts of both dada and V. I. Lenin, but never completely kowtowing to either, Roket's mind takes him off on odd little side journeys where the only thing that matters is sound. And this is a wonderful thing, and makes the collection worth reading by itself. But when you mull on some of these little sound-composition phrases, you realize they are invested with all kinds of different meanings that do make sense within the context of the work, and that is a wonderful thing. Roket gives us stories that approximate the best of what poetry is supposed to do, but without using poetic language. It's hard to describe; read for yourself.Very recommended. Can't wait to see what he comes up with next. ***"},{"Title":"Little foxes","review":"Although this book was written in the 1850's, this book will never be outdated from a Biblical perspective.

Good, bad, ugly, and everything in between - it's all here! In addition to reading this book I have purchased and listened to the audio tape edition (available directly from David Moore or from Charles Simpson Ministries at http://www.csmpublishing.org). I found the content and the author's findings in the audio edition of this book to be the perfect companion to this edition - which is scholarly, objective, balanced, and fair.On a personal note, I entered the Shepherding/Discipleship movement in as a result of the 1977 San Francisco Men's Seminar. In fact, I discovered in this book that the seminar that I attended was the last of it's kind. (It is amusing to consider that these \\"gender specific\\" seminars were controversial at the time since they are now common place. This books helps one gain insight into how the Shepherding Movement broke ground in areas like this)Was I hurt during the Shepherding/Discipleship movement? Sure, just about everyone involved in the Shepherding Movement was to some degree - especially the leaders. I left the movement angry, bitter, and muttering, \\"Never again!\\" However, by doing personal research, reading, prayer, and a few \\"Matthew 18's\\" I consider myself healed, sealed and congealed. And, friends, there was a lot to be healed from due to the imbalances and errors of this movement! Candidly, there were personalities back then that are still alive and, in my opinion, that one would be wise to be avoid. Why? Some have learned and moved beyond the lessons from Discipleship and some have not.That is why this book is SO important. It is primarily a work of scholastic history. As the cliche' goes, \\"Those who do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat it.\\" And, yes folks there are churches repeating the errors of this movement even as you are reading this review - I can guarantee it!I say this from personal experience. You see, after I exited the Shepherding Movement (around 1990 or so) I noticed that several of the churches that we went to were practicing Discipleship - one even taught it from the pulpit - but all were in denial.One church leadership group, in particular, was brutally traumatized when I brought this fact to their attention. I was rebuked for even suggested that they were \\"like them!\\" This told me that the errors of Discipleship weren't exclusive to, \\"the big four or five\\" or even a particular movement at a particular moment in time but were simply a formalized, doctrinized form of widespread pastoral, pastoral staff, and cult-like control issues. These errors and imbalances are common to the Church universal past, present and (probably) future. Jesus referred to it as \\"the doctrine of the Nicolaitans\\" (Revelation 2:6) the word \\"Nicolaitan\\" transliterated, I was told by David Rose (who is not mentioned in the book because he was one of Derek Prince's men - the book focuses mainly on the Mumford and Simpson \\"branches\\"), to mean \\"one who gains victory over the people\\". I think that you will find this \\"doctrine of the Nicolaitans\\" in whole or in part just about everywhere there are churches filled with those sinful creatures called, \\"the sons of Adam and the daughters of Eve\\" (to borrow from C.S. Lewis). If you are one such creature, you will learn much about yourself (and maybe your church) from this book.There is also much positive to learn from the Shepherding Movement. Integrity Music was a direct by-product of the Shepherding Movement (our worship back then was legendary). Some base concepts and doctrines of Promise Keepers and the men's movement of the early 1990's were directly or indirectly influenced by the Shepherding Movement as well - whether they will admit it or not is another thing!Yes, we made a lot of mistakes but we got a lot right as well. To this day I believe that our ecclesiology was dead right but our application of those truths was dead wrong! Hey man, if you can get a bunch ex-hippies interested in Theology and historic, credal, normative Christianity THAT alone must be divine, can you dig it?At the end of it all I think that we all came to realize what depraved sinners we really are. I know what I am capable of without God and daily reliance on the Holy Spirit - and it's NOT pretty!So in the end, perhaps the BEST by-product of the Shepherding Movement was humility based on heightened self-awareness of our frailties and flaws. After THAT epiphany there ain't much to be arrogant about! As Bob Mumford said, \\"I walked in a way that is embarrassing to me now!\\" In my case I can only say, \\"Ditto!\\"Just to show you that one CAN come home again, I have returned to one of the \\"remnant churches\\" (as the author calls them) and I am very, very, very happy and content with where our local church is and where I am at.

This neopentecostal movement, led by Bible teachers Ern Baxter, Don Basham, Bob Mumford, Derek Prince, and Charles Simpson, became a house/cell church movement in the United States. The Shepherding Movement is an ecclesiological case study of an attempt at renewing church structures. Its emphasis on submission to a personal pastor, or &quot;shepherd&quot; as the movement termed it, brought accusations of authoritarianism. The Shepherding Movement's story provides a unique perspective on the history of the charismatic renewal in the United States and its struggle to handle a controversy that forever changed the Renewal's ecumenical character.About the author: S.

I was in the movement from the early teachings at the World Map confrence in Santa Cruze Ca. in 1969-1970 to the end in Ft. Lauderdale Fl.in the 1980's. The author has answered so many of my unanswered questions of why the movement came to an end. Anyone who suffered abuses while they were apart of this movement will find this book most helpful in understanding their unanswered questions."},{"Title":"Shepherding Movement (Journal of Pentecostal Theology Supplement)","review":"The Shepherding Movement was a significant and influential movement in the Charismatic Renewal (in the US) throughout the mid to late 1970s that emerged the the personal covenenting of five leading teachers, often referred to as the Fort Lauderdale Five. These five individuals (Bob Mumford, Derek Prince, Charles Simpson, Ern Baxter and Don Basham) began in a personal relationship of accountability which soon escalated as these \\"covered\\" other leaders who in turn pastored/shepherded other etc thereby creating albeit unintentionally and despite their protestations the contrary a form of denominational structure.S David Moore has attempted to produce an objective history of this controversial and evidently influential movement. Moore is not (as he admits) not an entirely external observer, he is writing \\"as a former insider of the Shepherding movement\\" and that he \\"left the movement in 1984 because of concerns over what I believed to be doctrinal and practical extremes\\" (8). This sympathy with the Shepherding ideal (as opposed to practice) does show throughout the text and this bias is present in the selection of sources. For example, while there is a lot of reference to the concerns of the shepherding movement and spiritual authoritianism and abuse there is next to no actual case studies. What is left is therefore a one-sided account on the hierarchy of the movement and the opposing charismatic leaders and not on the victims even if, as Moore highlights these victims were in a minority. What is left is therefore an incomplete and somewhat sanitised history of the movement; however, this reservation aside Moore has presented us with a readable and succinct history of the movement from its early days as a personal consolidation of resources and introduction of personal accountability to the Ft Lauderdale five through their heydey on the late 70s to the break up of the fellowhips (only Simpson remains in the Shepherding fold, albeit in a nuanced form).Moore succeeds where other sensationalist accounts fail because of its presentation both of the pettiness of many leaders (the Shepherding Critic Pat Robertson does not come out particularly well, for example) and also some of the real moral character of some of the men; this is aided by the apparently exhaustive access he managed to gain to many of the participant's personal archives of primary source material. For example, in addition to travelling many thousands of miles for the purpose of dialogue Bob Mumford in reflecting on the controversy after its disintegration publicly noted to a gathering of 1500 charismatic leaders that: \\"Accountability, personal training under the guidance of another and effective pastoral care are needed biblical concepts ... However, to my personal pain and chagrin, there particular emphases very easily lent themselves to an unhealthy submission resulting in perverse and unbiblical obedience to human leaders. Many of these abuses occurred within the spheres of my responsibilty. For the injury and shame caused to people, families, and the larger Body of Christ, I repent with sorrow and ask for your forgiveness (p. 173)\\"Whatever the failings of the movement (and there are very many) and the man I respect that honesty and vulnerability and particularly in the world of the charismatic personality circus I think he should be given some credit for this.I come to this book as fairly liberal theologically and as someone strongly influenced by the Anabaptist and believers church traditions. This background interestingly also makes this book thought provoking for me. Why? Because like the Shepherding movement I would place a premium on accountability, discipleship, and the idea of the the church as counter-cultural society (the meanings attached to the words would no doubt differ, however!). Indeed, it appears that the Shepherding movement saw themselves as heirs of this same tradition. Moore notes that Leonard Verduin's The Reformers and Their Stepchildren was recommended reading and that the \\"shepherding movement identified with the Anabaptist emphasis on the visible, believing community, comprised of those whose conduct is distinctly different from that of the world\\" (p. 152). This makes the experience of the Shepherding movement one which should not just be relegated to the annals of the history of Pentecostal-charismatic ephemera; the Shepherding movement intended to create a people of faith who could be identified as such by those looking in, the legacy of abuse means that intention was not fulfilled. I am under no illusions that this is just a conservative trait and as the call to community becomes more widespread both in the emerging church and the growth of intentional communities then the chance of history repeating itself is very real."},{"Title":"Shepherding Movement (Journal of Pentecostal Theology Supplement)","review":"It is 2011 as I write. I purchased this book earlier this year and was surprised at its clarity, objectivity and depth.

See (...)Therefore, this book has continuing relevance and should be considered a crucial piece of the puzzle that constitutes Religion in 20th Century America."},{"Title":"Shepherding Movement (Journal of Pentecostal Theology Supplement)","review":"I am literally a child of the Shepherding Movement, with my family joining while I was quite young. On balance, my experience was very positive, yet I know of others who believe their experiences were different. So when Professor Moore's book came out, I was interested to see how the overall, wider movement was evaluated.Professor Moore promises a fair and balanced look at this controversial movement. In my opinion, he delivers. He concisely lays out the history of the movement from beginning to end. Writing with a historian's eye, Moore places the rise of the Shepherding Movement in its context. The Charismatic Renewal was sweeping the nation, but many of its leaders and participants were unaccountable, unattached, and simply drifting from one meeting to the next. To foster accountability and maturity, leaders like Bob Mumford and Charles Simpson began teaching about spiritual authority and covenantal relationships. Eventually, five leaders came together to emphasize these and other teachings (the so-called \\"Ft. Lauderdale Five\\"). Moore leaves no doubt that the Shepherding Movement arose in response to a real need and with the best of intentions.Unfortunately, many of the critics also thought they were acting with the best of intentions, though a few - such as Pat Robertson - come across as self-appointed judges who felt little need to actually engage the leaders of the Shepherding movement with their concerns. Others come across concerned about losing their own turf or financial contributions to the Shepherding Movement. Jack Hayford comes across as someone concerned, but believing the best about those with whom he disagreed and attempting to engage them in direct dialogue. Indeed, it is to Moore's credit that both Charles Simpson and Jack Hayford endorse his book.I was impressed with the openness of leaders like Simpson and Mumford, who not only granted Moore several interviews but also turned over their private correspondence to him - a treasure of primary data that any historian would love to have. Moore puts it to good use, following the movement from its inception to the dissolving of the \\"Ft. Laurderdale Five,\\" then tracking the individual men in their ministries after the fact. Moore also reminds us of the benefits this movement had on the broader Christian Renewal: Hosanna/Integrity Music; the emphasis on Covenant in understanding God; the idea of spiritual mentoring; and, the emphasis on home groups and cell groups.I have always considered myself fortunate to have been involved in the Charles Simpson sphere of the Shepherding Movement. After reading this fine book, that belief is reinforced. Professor Moore deserves much credit for this concise and fair history of an influential movement within the Charismatic Renewal."},{"Title":"Shepherding Movement (Journal of Pentecostal Theology Supplement)","review":"This is very well written, balanced and well documented investigation of very questionable and controversial Shepherding Movement.

What is unique about this treatment is that it tells the story from a positive but not defensive light. For this reason, it could be influential for those leaders who have only seen the shepherding movement as falsely criticized. We get to see how 5 well intentioned and anointed men created a system with problem that hurt people in the end. David Moore repeatedly claims objectivity, and it is clear that was his intention, but in my opinion, this book tells only half of the story--the leaders/teachers half. Moore is honest enough to admit that he was a pastor in one segment of the movement. While it does identify some problems at the end that need to be corrected, it takes the same approach that the shepherds took all throughout the controversy--that the teachings were right, but the applications were wrong. This is clearly an excuse. Jesus said, \\"every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.\\" Matthew 7:17 If the doctrines are right, then the system should produce good fruit. The many damaged lives which came out of the shepherding movement, are not addressed in this book, and a complete telling of the story would need to do this. This book should be read in conjunction with Ron and Vicki Burks \\"Damaged Disciples\\" for a more complete picture. As Moore says, some of the theology in the Burks book is probably an overreaction, but the stories there will help the reader understand the \\"other side\\" of the issue.Now, I do not want to be understood to say that this movement did not produce any good fruit. I genuinely believe that these men uncovered new dimensions to Scriptural truths which are relevant and needed for our times, and that as they themsevles believed, a core element to creating a form of Christianity with the power to bring down secular humanism. To the degree that they were right, many were helped in the movement. However, something in the doctrines must have been wrong, or else there would not be so many tesimonies of people wounded so deeply by their many years in the movement. One example would be the doctrine of absolute submission to a discipler. Jesuit history should show the error of this idea. Giving *absolute* submission to anyone other than Christ is idolatry, and can lead to severe problems. You cannot serve two masters.The church needs to discover how to practice church authority in a way the helps and empowers people and has safeguards against ungodly bondage to leadership, and many are currently trying to do just that--hopefully with the lessons of the past in mind. In fact, it has been rightly recognized that certain elements of the New Apostolic (NAR) movement are similar--but hopefully now with the enslaving doctrines removed.I'm glad that Moore has written this book, and it provides a lot of needed information to place the movement in context, however I hope that those whose lives were ruined in the movement are not forgotten, and remain as a marking stone for the future path of the church."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Python in 24 Hours (Teach Yourself -- 24 Hours)","review":"the worst python book i have ever read. the teaching style is so scatterbrained that it useless to a beginner. the code snippets are worthless because he uses elements in the code,that have not been fully explained yet,stating that &quot;we will discuss that in chapter whatever&quot; then expects you to build on code you don't fully understand. this book reads like it was slapped together in a long weekend. my copy is already in the dumpster."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Python in 24 Hours (Teach Yourself -- 24 Hours)","review":"Definitely not recommended...

He has run on sentences, typo's, combined with the fact that he NEVER explains a single piece of code in the book completely, he famous lines in the book are \\"we'll discuss that later\\" which never happens, and \\"do you remember this?\\" NO, BECAUSE YOU NEVER EXPLAINED IT!!! Very frustrating, and i'm an undergrad student that has been punching out code in Java for 3 years, and I'm totally lost, how is that possible? 2 simple words for this book, don't bother.

Chun"},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Python in 24 Hours (Teach Yourself -- 24 Hours)","review":"This book is OK. The author gets lost in his pastimes, such as Mayan culture. I didn't mind this though because I was entertained by his tangents. There is a better one, namely Learning Python (Lutz)."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Python in 24 Hours (Teach Yourself -- 24 Hours)","review":"Although the book claims to be written for the novice programmer, I don't think it is really suited to such a reader. Throughout the book, the author introduces things without explanation. This is particularly a problem with the code samples. Most of the code in the book is taken from other projects that the author had worked on and is often not very illustrative of the points he is trying to make. Also, much of the code has parts that are unexplained. If I had not already been familiar with a few other languages, I don't think I could have followed this book at all.Finally, although Python is often used for text processing tasks like sys admin, cgi, etc., almost all the examples in this book revolve around calendrical calculations. Maybe fascinating for the author, but agonizingly dull for me."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Python in 24 Hours (Teach Yourself -- 24 Hours)","review":"This book looked good when I started reading it, and even though I read through the whole thing and learned a few concepts about OO and Python it is definetly not a beginner's book. Hard to follow and the examples are basically all about mayan calendrical calculations. One thing i will say for this book is that the chapters on Tcl/Tk were quite good."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Python in 24 Hours (Teach Yourself -- 24 Hours)","review":"I have tried making my way through this book many times. But I cannot get past the author's incessesant penchant for the mayan calendar. I did not find any use in going through code snippets (which are very hard to read, they are screenshots in small font)that taught me how to manipulate dates (leap years, mayan calendars etc.) I found this approach extremely boring. Infusing text with an occasionally comment of marginal wit, does not make it entertaining.The only redeeming portion of this book it that it does include a good introduction to Tkinter. I just wish someone with a better understanding of instructional writing had written it.Like so many other Python books, does every introduction to subjects such as funtions, classes, objects and methods have to be about spam? I know where python got its name...but enough already!"},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Python in 24 Hours (Teach Yourself -- 24 Hours)","review":"You are better off reading the help and intro files at the python website than buying this book. There are numerous times where code is not explained and you have to figure things out more so than you would expect from a book that costs you money.Though you can understand what the program does, the actual meanings of script and calls are left unexplained; this book lacks the precision needed to explain programming and obscures a simple and powerful language like python. This book could not possibly teach you python in 24 hours, nor will it do anything but confuse and frustrate the inexperienced programmer."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Python in 24 Hours (Teach Yourself -- 24 Hours)","review":"The book is very hard to read. It starts out fine, but the author seems to care more about Mayan calendars and Zen more than teaching Python to the reader. The first chapters about variable types don't give you anything much to practice on. The author says &quot;a simple example&quot; and doesn't explain parts of it until three chapters later. Other examples are in screen shots which can barely be read. Also annoying is the author's tendency to drift away from the subject and start talking about dead painters or other non-programming related topics. This book could use a lot of work"},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Python in 24 Hours (Teach Yourself -- 24 Hours)","review":"1. This book should be sold with a magnifying glass.

The spirit (not the soul!) is the seat of God-conscientiousness, the place in the being from which the believer can contact God (and from which unbelievers yearn for -perhaps what they don't realise- is God).&quot;God's Plan of Redemption,&quot; was originally published around 80 years ago, and went through several editions both in the UK and USA.

Never before do I think I have seen the basic truths of God's plan presented so clearly, so concisely, and yet so profoundly. The charts alone are a masterpiece. Mrs McDonough beautifully shows how God's goal in sonship is carried out through His golden divine life, by imparting Himself into our human spirits at regeneration, invading our souls in sanctification, and eventually being fully glorified in all of His children at the full \\"manifestation of the sons of God\\" (Romans 8:19).

This course is not designed to achieve A+ certification but is, instead, part of a larger program in Electronics engineering. It is for this reason that I cannot comment on the entire book as I covered only certain sections.The sections that I covered dealt with Computer and Hardware Fundamentals, Troubleshooting, Operating Systems, and Data Communications, Safety and Maintenance.In each of these chapters I found a similar characteristic. The material was concise and the reading was not overly complicated for someone with any type of computer background. My main issue was that I did not feel the chapters were well organized.In my own experience in preparation for exams I found it better to read the chapters and re-write sections of notes in a more organized way. All the relevant material is there, it is just a little difficult to sift through.That being said I found this book an acceptable text reference. And I also felt it was much more readable, and comprehensive, than many similarly intended books which I have seen.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Eliminate TMJ and Teeth Grinding","review":"I must admit that I only purchased this because a friend suggested that at worst I could use it to annoy people on halloween.The first 4 or so times I listened to it, I noticed nothing. However, I had made a promise to try it every night for a month.Gradually I realized that I was falling asleep before it was even finished and waking up without the temple and jaw pain that I have had for decades.I think this silly little CD actually works!I still wear my mouth guard every couple days just because I believe in safety first and I have been known to grind and grit my teeth so much that I have cracked a few teeth,but I am now sleeping deeper in that I do not wake up at every tiny little sound in the house. I can sleep for longer periods as well, normally I only sleep a couple hours at a time but now I am sleeping for up to 5 hours at a stretch at night!I would say this is good for relaxation as much as it is good for aiding in relaxing the jaw muscles.I am definately a total skeptic turned believer!"},{"Title":"Eliminate TMJ and Teeth Grinding","review":"Using this CD has not eliminated my TMJ (although this seems like alot to ask from a $15 product to address such a longterm issue), but I have noticed a noteworthy positive difference in my level of pain intensity I experience in the morning when I use this CD. It not only helps relax the jaw and surrounding muscles but also helps me relax in general and fall asleep as well. I have also found that it helps me with my neck pain. However, even using the CD I still have some occassional nights when I get just as sore, but this seems to be related to the stressful events of the day. In short, your TMJ probably is not going anywhere just from listening to this CD, but it may well make a difference, and my experience suggests that the modest price for this product certainly seems worthy of the results."},{"Title":"Eliminate TMJ and Teeth Grinding","review":"The main track for eliminating TMJ is OK. It doesn't quite knock me out like some other hypnosis CD's, but I do get pretty relaxed. Its definitiely beneficial, though how effective it is, is hard to say.

Exercises and other helpful information."},{"Title":"Eliminate TMJ and Teeth Grinding","review":"I have used other self-hypnosis recordings before, and I did not find this one relaxing, and because of that, not effective. The language seemed a bit clumsy and not that well thought out. The man's voice sounds like he's trying to be soothing, but it's not working. He also talks in the beginning about your skull and your heart in a very biological way--not terribly relaxing visualizations. It actually made me a little tense. He also kept saying to relax over and over...maybe it's just me, but I think it should be done more subtly--if telling someone to relax was all it took, we'd all be a lot more relaxed."},{"Title":"Eliminate TMJ and Teeth Grinding","review":"I ordered this on a bit of a lark when I was ordering \\"Taking Control of TMJ\\" by Robert O. Uppgaard. (I very highly recommend that book as well.) I was having a bad TMJ flare-up after dental work, and was buying anything I thought might help.As it turned out, there were three things that helped me the most: this CD, the exercises in the aforementioned book, and cutting waaaay back on caffeine. (Coffee seems to be much more problematic than tea.)This CD had an immediate effect. After the first use, the next morning I woke up with significantly less pain in my jaw. (That had been the worst time of day for me.) I was really relieved, as I'd been in pain for weeks!There are many different causes that can contribute to TMJ. I don't have bite or joint problems, but I do grind and carry tension in my jaw habitually, so my problems are mostly muscular. If this is your situation, I would definitely recommend you give this CD a try. I would add the caveat that this is not going to be a replacement for dental work or surgery, IF you need those things. On the other hand, this has been a lot more effective than the very expensive night guards I have tried in the past, which didn't stop me from grinding at all.It's not magic - It didn't eliminate jaw tension entirely. But I didn't expect that. It really has helped me a lot, and I continue to use it every night."},{"Title":"Eliminate TMJ and Teeth Grinding","review":"I was a bit skeptical of this, especially since the first review shown suspiciously echoes the language in the CD's marketing materials. (Hmm.)But since my $400 nightguard only protects my teeth from the grinding and doesn't actually prevent the grinding itself, and because I hope to one day be rid of the goofy, unsexy, and uncomfortable apparatus entirely, I thought I'd give it a try. On first listen, I thought, \\"OK, yeah, this is just another relaxation/guided meditation thing, with a few jaw images thrown in.\\" But I did feel more relaxed, and the whole thing takes only about 20 minutes, so I kept using it the next couple of nights. After 3 nights, I definitely noticed that my jaw and face pain had lessened during the day. I'm not sure if I've stopped grinding/clenching entirely (I tend to doubt it's 100% gone), although my husband says he doesn't hear it anymore, but my mouth and teeth feel noticeably better, and I've found that I clench and tighten less during the day too. I should also mention that my grinding was pretty severe, and I once supposedly chipped a tooth because of it. Anyway, I'd recommend this CD even if it doesn't cure you 100%, because it does help at least greatly relax the area (and your whole body, actually, and it's soothing and pleasant to listen to."},{"Title":"Eliminate TMJ and Teeth Grinding","review":"This is merely a relaxation medium. I felt like I was back in LaMaze class preparing for childbirth. It helps me to relax the jaw, something most people don't realize they are clinching when they go to sleep.

In any case, it seems to relax me enough so I don't clench my teeth, which is the problem I was trying to solve. My only complaint is that it seems to go a little fast in the beginning, and I would like a little more time to find a comfortable position, etc. The background music is nice. I can't really comment on the latter part of the CD because I never hear it."},{"Title":"Eliminate TMJ and Teeth Grinding","review":"I bought this CD thinking was going to be better than others I have tried but simply to me is not. Others I have bought seem to be lot better in time, quality and results. This cd lasts shorter than others I have heard, the instructor or man who did this cd moves to fast through the process of relaxation which I consider to fast compared with other cd's.Overall I did not like it much and I won't recommend it to someone who is looking for a deeper relaxation, smooth and slow process and a better relaxing voice. This guy does not even have the voice to relax me. Not worth the try unless you are willing to ask for a refund."},{"Title":"Eliminate TMJ and Teeth Grinding","review":"I was hoping for a guided meditation CD that was specific to TMJ. However, this CD was simply a nondescript single hypnosis session.

I would not recommend this CD if your struggling with TMJ."},{"Title":"Eliminate TMJ and Teeth Grinding","review":"I have suffered from night time bruxism (teeth grinding) and daytime jaw clenching for years, with its resultant headaches and facial/jaw pain. It has always come and gone, usually worsening about a month after a stressor. An acrylic nightguard worn during sleep used to be all it took to keep the offending behavior at bay, but that has not worked perfectly for the last year. After a particularly severe bout with all-day facial pain, I was desperate and willing to try anything. For the price, this CD seemed a reasonable solution to try. I've used it for slightly over one week now. Not only am I sleeping more soundly and waking more rested, I must be grinding less, because my facial pain is now 90% better...it was slightly better the morning after the first listen, and it's been improving ever since. Scott's voice is relaxing (though not quite as soothing as Brit Cherith Powell's voice on the cassette from \\"The Self-Hypnosis Kit\\" [which unfortunately does not come in CD form], which I also recommend), as are the visualizations, and I do prefer his technique of imagining tightening and relaxing various muscles versus actual muscle movement. I'm not certain a complete cure for bruxism exists, but I am thrilled with my current level of improvement, and will continue to listen to this CD every night before bed."},{"Title":"Eliminate TMJ and Teeth Grinding","review":"I have been suffering with TMJ syndrome for aprox 10 years...This tape has helped somewhat...while it is not a cure all...It is one part of my healing process.

Dr. Joes is appropriately critical of the strategic and tactical errors made by the political/military leaders of the United States and South Viet Nam (the assassination of Diem, failure to cut off the Ho Chi Minh Trail, difficulty of defending Hue and Da Nang, etc.) without romanticizing either the southern Viet Cong/NLF terrorist guerrillas or the totalitarian Stalinist regime of North Viet Nam. Dr. Joes' expressed sympathy for the plight of South Viet Nam and its people--the vast majority of whom did not want to be governed by a brutal and economically backward communist regime--is rare in works about the Viet Nam War. It is interesting to note that, but for the Watergate Scandal which prevented Presidents Nixon and, later, Ford from honoring U.S. committments to South Viet Nam after January 1973, there might still be an independent South Viet Nam today.My only (and minor) criticism of Dr. Joes' book is the relative sparsity of the endnotes, which is unusual for academic writing about a subject as controversial and well-commented about as the Viet Nam War."},{"Title":"Colonial Days: Discover the Past with Fun Projects, Games, Activities, and Recipes","review":"I loved this book, and the other books in the series, for completing a good, fun, study of American Colonial History.

He presented how he did each experiment and what the results were. The book was truly eye-opening, and as I adjusted my dress to his recommedations, I encountered the expected results. I was very impressed. My only complaint would be that I wanted to pick Molloy's brain even more.Then I found this book. I don't know why it took me so long. Molloy sets it straight. Just how people react to you differently depending on what you wear, they also react to you on how you talk (and not just on WHAT you say, but more HOW you say it), how you hold your shoulders, your mouth, and other behavioral mechanisms. Molloy runs through all of this, explaining the experiments he did and the results. This isn't some guy's THEORY on how to be successful, it's SCIENTIFICALLY VERIFIED TRUTH.This book is a gold mine. In one chapter, Molloy explains how he used his research to help an employee eliminate a series of body language oddities which were making people dislike him. Furthermore, he had passed these body language habits onto his kids who were unpopular in school. They all learned what they were doing and corrected it, with enormous success. That is one of the most powerful stories of self-improvement I have ever read.If you're like me and have always wondered why you weren't getting the results you worked hard for and felt you deserved, this book is an absolute MUST read."},{"Title":"Molloy's Live for Success","review":"I have an extensive library of personal development books. Molly's 'Live for Success' ranks as one of my 5 top success books. I've been studying this book for a few years now..I only wish I had read and applied this when I started my career.This book is required reading. It's brutally honest. 'Live for Success' doesn't contain positive affirmations or spritual guidance..this is a book about facts: namely that your socio-economic status (or more importantly how it is percieved by your mannerisms and vocabulary) results in a higher percentage chance of success.But Molly doesn't stop there. He goes on to explain how the physical and social characteristics of the upper middle class such as body language, face masks, clothes, and success patterns can be mimicked by beer-drinking, dirty t-shirt wearing, couch potatos in order to achieve real results. These results are professional and social successes..READ: higher income and success. He has researched examples of these techniques.Indeed, as a former beer-drinking, dirty t-shirt wearing, couch potato, I've applied them and they work effectively. I've doubled my income over 6 digits, am at the top of my game, and enjoy a bright vibrant future. And, you can do it too. Read this book, study this book, and apply it. You will be amazed.I only wish Molloy came out with more material along this line such as more socio-economic mannerisms going into grooming, looks, body types, etc.. Perhaps more material on lifestyles, what to do in certain situations, etc.. Molloy's research is eye-opening.This is a book that must be studied, not just read. I think this book is more effective than 'Think and Grow Rich'. This is the real world. Not just thinking about feeling good, but tools and techniques to shred the competition right away."},{"Title":"Molloy's Live for Success","review":"I first read this book over ten years ago when I was in college. I liked the well researched style Molloy uses. His comments and advice can be very blunt, but he makes the point. Much of this excellent advice can not be found in other books.For example he opens with a chapter on how people spot lower socioeconomic level traits in others. I see these things all the time (i.e. slouched posture, mouth resting open.) More importantly he tells you how to change your own style in case this is not something your parents taught you. The chapter on table manners is enough to buy the book.I have been in the professional world for ten years now and still recall and use something from this book at least once a month."},{"Title":"Molloy's Live for Success","review":"&quot;Class carries clout,&quot; says the author. The appearance and behavior of the upper middle class are key to success in many social situations, including sales and business. For example, if you are at a formal dinner, which fork do you use? Much of the time the answer may not matter at all. But as you move up the ladder, you will encounter more and more people who do have upper middle class breeding and who expect that behavior from those they would trust and do business with. Is this book essential? Not to lots of folks. But for someone who wishes to examine class head-on, the book is an excellent overview. And like the rest of Molloy's books, it is based on scientific research, not opinions or &quot;wishing how it ought to be.&quot;"},{"Title":"Molloy's Live for Success","review":"Molloy gives excellent advice for drinking at 'official' functions that is worth more than the price of the book.

On page 176, it says \\"One man said that his attorney, his accountant, and his lawyer were all the sons of people he had known for years\\". The book does not explain the exact difference between an attorney and a lawyer."},{"Title":"Molloy's Live for Success","review":"Even though this book was written over 20 years ago, it has a lot of real-life experiences that prove useful throughout the decades."},{"Title":"Molloy's Live for Success","review":"Let me start by stating that Mr. Malloy does know his material when it comes to corporate executive success. His guidelines pertaining to body language, posture, dress, and communication are apropos in a business setting. Even the chapters on business parties, executive spouses, and dining etiquette are sound advice for anyone striving for the epitome of the corporate world. This book left a terrible taste in my mouth. I felt compelled to write this review immediately after finishing it. The writer fails in his efforts to portray 'success' in any but an 'upper middle class' clique. If you, like myself aspire to become a 'successful' entrepeneur, investor, salesperson, etc., this book may be a disappointment. John T. Malloy writes from the perspective of a 'hoyty-toyty', 'upper-crust', 'already made it', success 'expert'. I finished reading this book because I did find it interesting, but it left me feeling as though I am just a blue-collar failure, which I AM NOT. Just the fact that you read my review shows that YOU ARE A SUCCESS too. Readers are all successful, in differing degrees. There are successful people in all walks of life. Just follow simple guidelines, follow mentors, have faith in yourself, and it will happen."},{"Title":"Tavaglione Stairs of Gold Tarot Deck","review":"I have used various decks in my life but these cards provide such depth through the blending of many systems.

But that can also work to its detriment; one can get very distracted trying to follow it all, and lose the flow of reading or meditation. Also, the cards are quite large, and I found them too awkward to hold.

This has the easiest meaning book that comes with the deck that simplifies meanings short and concise. Don't have to over complicate anything. Just gives you the option. My meaning book is taped and stapled but I still have it. It was my starter deck and I have abused my cards badly since I was 18 and enjoyed many accurate readings and it still is my favorite deck.

Some essays tell stories, while others are plain facts. This book has about 670 pages, yet it is a fast and informative read where you can't put the book down. It is organized by section of topic and gives suggested reading lists at the end of each chapter. A good introductory to Latin American studies, historically, culturally, and sociologically. It gives a lot of information for the price, you will not regret buying this book."},{"Title":"The Latino/a Condition: A Critical Reader","review":"Excellent book, but know in advance that this book is heavily skewed toward legal topics and lawyer authors. While much of the legal writing is dense for lay readers, it is often well worth the effort. The selections authored by Margaret Montoya, Kevin Johnson, editor Richard Delgado, and non-attorney Gloria Anzaldua were the very best of this remarkably well-written anthology."},{"Title":"Plato and Platonism;: A series of lectures,","review":"One gets the impression from the description that Bloom \\"edited\\" this text; so I bought it in the hope that there would be an interpretive essay on the place of these lectures in Pater's intellectual development, and some annotations on contemporary or ancient references that are a little obscure now. But in fact Bloom is the *general editor* of the series \\"Prophets of Sensibility,\\" of which this is a part. All he contributes to the volume is a 2 1/2 page preface, on these \\"Precursors of Modern Cultural Thought\\" (19th-century English critics and philosophers who Bloom thinks have been overshadowed by Nietzsche as harbingers of modernity); Pater is his prime \\"prophet,\\" but the preface focuses exclusively on Pater's *Renaissance*, and does not even so much as mention his *Plato and Platonism*! For all I know, this same preface was stuck onto the beginning of every book in the series.The text itself is nothing more than a photocopied reproduction of the 1901 edition of the lectures (which I already own, so a bit of a waste of money all round!), completely unmodified, no modern footnotes or anything like that."},{"Title":"World War Two: A Military History (Warfare and History)","review":"This is a generally well written book, easy to read (though I think the author overuses the word \\"ensure(d)\\" by a considerable margin). On the other hand, there is not a single map in the book. This may be little or no problem for a WWII afficianado, who likely has the requisite maps in his or her head, but could cause major annoyances for others, who will need a good atlas at the ready. Though primarily a military history as claimed, this is not the type of military history that focuses on the individual soldier. In fact, few military formations below the level of army group (= Russian front) are named or their movements discussed. This is definitely broad sweep military history. But some relatively obscure actions are given more space than one might expect: for example the Madagascar campaign is given half a page. On the other hand, the much longer South Pacific campaigns are relegated to a couple of pages. Author's choice, I suppose. There is some discussion of the home fronts, particularly the submarine war against England, and the bombing campaign against Germany. Munich and the lead-up to the war are covered in fair detail. All in all, an interesting read, though not the best book for the novice."},{"Title":"Lakeland to Lindisfarne: A Coast to Coast Walk from Ravenglass to Holy Island","review":"Last summer I bought a copy of Gillham's marvellous 'Ravenglass to Lindisfarne' which I used to walk coast-to-coast with a team from Chetham's School of Music, Manchester, UK and our leader, Dr Kevin B Champion.Gillham's new walk is beautiful in every respect and certainly offers a more dramatic experience than that of Wainwright. The Lake District, the highest Pennines, the Northumberland Moors, the North East Coast, Holy Island - all are awe-inspiring. It is probably the greatest experience of my life.Gillham presents his book very well - the walk descriptions are accurate and easy to follow, the photos are of high quality, and the book is a pleasure to read, both while preparing the walk, walking it, and reminiscing afterwards. I can strongly recommend it to anyone who is after a challenge.My only quibble is the recommended accommodation. Hotels and B and Bs are given, although it is probably cheaper and better to hostel and camp, but you will need to be transported sometimes. When I walked Ravenglass to Lindisfarne with Chets and Dr Kevin B Champion, we stayed at YHAs and campsites. It was an absolute pleasure!Enjoy!"},{"Title":"A World of Love: Eleanor Roosevelt and Her Friends 1943-1962","review":"This collection of letters written by Eleanor Roosevelt from 1943-1962 documents this remarkable woman's service to mankind, and the bottomless well of compassion and love that was at the center of her being.Of particular interest is her unusual and unfulfilled romantic attachment to two men: the author, Joseph P. Lash, and a doctor she met on a trip to Switzerland, Dr. David Gurewitsch.The letters reveal her devotion to her children, who were a source of frequent disappointment and frustration. They also are a testament to her unbelievable energy. Mrs. Roosevelt's travel schedule, even in her final years, would be a challenge to the youngest and heartiest of globetrotters.The book does have weaknesses. The author seems to make the assumption that the reader is either familiar with his earlier books about the Roosevelts, or has some other source of knowledge about Mrs. Roosevelt's relationships to the persons to whom she writes in A World of Love.More background information about the recipients of the letters is needed throughout, and this is particularly true in the case of Mrs. Roosevelt's relationship to Mr. Lash and his wife, Trude. Also, the two should be included in the picture sections of the book. Perhaps the fact that they are not is a sign of the author's modesty but, nevertheless, it is a definite oversight.A World of Love is a worthwhile read for any admirer of one of history's most dynamic and selfless women. But this book could have been a world better if the narrative had included more information about the people who were fortunate enough to attract Eleanor Roosevelt's attention and affection."},{"Title":"Indians in Prison: Incarcerated Native Americans in Nebraska","review":"The author details the unique factors that affect Native American prisoners. She asks and answers why they are disproportionately incarcerated and have trouble obeying parole. She analyzes whether correctional facilities are allowing them to practice their religion as courts have demanded. I love a Native American man in jail and it was fascinating to have this book that discusses the issues that he and many others face.This book says a lot about prison matters that affect inmates of all races. This would be a useful text for the loved ones of any inmate. As a non-Native man of color, I imagine that many people of color will relate to what is described here. Like Natives, Blacks and Latinos are also disproportionately represented in prison. Many Blacks and Latinos may feel uncomfortable in prison programs where they are the minority or their cultural concerns are not addressed. Many members of minority groups worry that the failure of one person may have a negative impact upon the entire community.The book focuses on men because they are the grand majority of inmates, regardless of race. Still, the author mentions when rules or programs differ for female inmates. The book never addresses masculinity, or many of the concerns in men's studies, but this does not diminish from the text. Kansas was at the forefront of litigation for Native prisoners; this state was not selected just because that is where the author teaches. Though the area of inquiry is not the Dakotas, most of the subjects in this work are of the Lakota (which the author spells \\"Lakh'ota\\") Nation.As a reader, it continually surprised me how different these Native Americans viewed the majority country and its culture. Yes, reservation life is supposed to have its own vibe and uniqueness. Still, all Natives were deemed American citizens in the 1930s. Native Americans speak English, watch American TV, etc. This book implies that they just cannot relate to the larger culture. I don't doubt it, but I'm surprised how separate the nations can be more than a half-millennium after Columbus' voyage and especially given the large amount of miscegenation between Native Americans and European Americans.Many readers will be pleased that this is book is neither rigorous statistics nor gushy personal narratives. Still, there is a way in which this author is just summarizing stuff. It's not terribly academic. The figures she presents I'm almost sure were collected by various prison bureaux anyway. I loved this book, but it sure isn't tenure material. You can tell the author admires the Native inmates that she met. However, in her introduction, she makes them look TERRIBLE and cites phenomena that will only revive racist images of Native Americans, and men of color generally."},{"Title":"Into the Dream (The Secret of the Unicorn Queen, Book 4)","review":"I found this book at a library a long time ago, and was imediatly intrigued from the first sentance on.

The lessons move along at a reasonable pace, and they explain everything thats important in easy to understand lessons. They have just enough homework for each concept and because of the good examples it usually doesnt need lots of explanation. All the important vocabulary is repeated at the end of every chapter so studying from long lists is easy, if thats your style. The lessons and vocabulary are presented in an order that makes sense and rarely do you have to jump around the book to figure anything out. The included CD is very basic and only has about 15 minutes of audio, I think. It just corresponds to a handful of the homework problems and isnt used for actual lessons. The online component has to be purchased separately if you buy the book used. The online part is actually very good with extra homework and practice, as well as a BUNCH of pronunciation lessons which are essential to understanding spanish.I think most instructors would be just fine teaching lessons straight from the book without dropping anything or making any deviations or jumping around. You would not need any extra assignments or help besides the book and the online component. The book teaches Ser and Estar pretty early, as well as how they are properly conjugated (all 6 ways). It jumps into conjugating regular verbs pretty early and moves fluidly into relfexives and verbs like Gustar. Very early on it explains gender of nouns and how articles work with them as well as how to make adjectives work. They get into past tense during chapter 4 and by that time you will have covered house and school nouns, complementing adjectives, family members, professions and of course the basics like numbers, telling time, finding places in a city and salutations. In my school we did chapters 1-4 in SPA 101, 5-8 in SPA 102, and 9-12 in SPA 201. As a general rule they often try to explain why some things are the way they are, but its always better to have a proper spanish teacher guide you if possible. By the end of the book you should be fairly fluent, provided you had been practicing the whole time.My only issue with the third edition of Caminos is the excess of junk not directly related to the spanish language. It almost seems to have a hidden political motive of pushing the Hispanic agenda on english speaking Americans. The stories are cute but dont really do much to help teach the language. They just slow things down a lot. Of course, a teach could easily skip over all the cultural stuff and just stick the language. But it bugs me when college books fluff their text up so as to make the book fatter and then demand more money. They could easily remove about a 1/4 of the pages & most of the cute illustrations & full color pictures and charge a lot less for the book.But the textbook mafia would never let that happen.Anyway, if you are smart buy this used for cheap at Amazon and purchase the Quia online part separately, if you need it. Its a great way to learn in school and a smart person could even figure it out on their own if they would spent half an hour a day with it. Oh, I almost forgot, on many pages throughout the book are weblinks to other great sources of spanish language lessons that you are currently covering. They pretty much thought of everything when putting this book together.Overall an excellent guide and (aside from the forced cultural content) should be the standard for college level instruction books in any language. I also suspect the more intelligent high school students in America could make use of it."},{"Title":"Caminos","review":"This not where you rate an order from a seller.

It is easy reading with abundant facts woven into a flowing story. Chapters are short but leave you satisfied with the knowledge contained. The story and pictures of coins from pre-Spanish occupation to more recent mintings help convey the richness of the Philippines as seen from the perspective of the monetary system used to enhance trade. The book covers areas of coinage and history not as well told in other coin references. The book is a good introductory reference for those that want to taste before diving headlong into the subjects.

This book and its computer program give an accurate idea of what archaeology is all about. I would highly recommend this to anyone thinking about getting involved with archaeology. I do have a few complaints though. In order to understand the program and the way it presents data it is important to have some background in culture and anthropology in general. The program and workbook do not give you this information it is assumed you already understand it. In that sense I don't think I would recommend this to younger age groups unless they have a good source for the additional information required to understand and interpret the data. I purchased this for a required project for my college senior archaeology class. Many of the students in the class had difficulty with the data and understanding it. There were also issues with the program on the disc. Many could not get it to work for various reasons. It is essential to have the disc that comes with this book. The book is almost worthless without it. If you are interested in archaeology and want to know more about the subject then I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Adventures in Fugawiland: A Computerized Simulation in Archaeology","review":"I very much enjoyed using this with my students as an introduction to archaeology.

You can't do the notebook/project/mock dig without it! I would also recommmend getting \\"Discovering Our Past: A Brief Introduction to Archaeology\\" by Ashmore and Sharer to go with this.

My mother had the book on her bookshelves, an older edition with a painting of a turn of the century couple courting on the front. It looked vaguely impressionist, and left me to conclude that the stories inside would probably be a bunch of sentimentalist claptrap. How wrong I was!The book inside is more akin to a Hopper painting than a Degas. Anderson manages an amazing level of character development within the short stories. The stories themselves work independently, but also work together to tell the story of an American Midwestern town. And the feeling one is left with is that everything you have read is essentially and authentically American.To comment on the Kindle version specifically, it seems well formatted to this reader. I've noticed a typo here and there, but nothing glaring, and nothing that distracts from the experience of reading the book."},{"Title":"Winesburg, Ohio: A Group of Tales of Ohio Small-Town Life","review":"First published in 1919, Winesburg, Ohio is a collection of 22 interrelated stories set in a fictional small town in the American Midwest. Though each story can stand alone as an individual work, they are so closely interwoven that some consider the book to be a novel. The protagonist of each story often makes a supporting appearance in the tale of his or her neighbor, relative, friend, or lover, while dozens of other characters are encountered only in brief cameos. George Willard, a young reporter for the local newspaper, appears in almost all the stories and unifies the various tales into a cohesive book. Everyone in town seems to consider him a kindred spirit, and they seek him out, asking him to serve as their confessor, chronicler, and/or psychiatrist.In deceptively simple prose, Anderson vividly captures the everyday life of this small Ohio town during its period of transition from agrarianism to modern industrialization. The denizens of Winesburg struggle to find their place in this microcosm of modern society. Their sensitive souls are tormented by loneliness, isolation, guilt-ridden pasts, frustrated dreams, and a stifling ability to communicate their feelings and aspirations. Sinclair Lewis's novel Main Street, published about the same time and also focusing on a Midwestern town, features an ambitious dreamer, Carrie Meeber, who envisions herself a prisoner within a conservative small town full of narrow minded bumpkins. In Winesburg, Ohio, everyone is Carrie Meeber. Everyone is a prisoner to something, and everyone wants out. For many of the characters, the big city represents salvation, as if their problems would just go away if they could escape to Cleveland, Cincinnati, or Chicago. More often than not, that salvation proves false and they return to Winesburg defeated. Having grown up in a small Midwestern town myself, I can say that much of Anderson's portrayal of small town life rings true. It's unclear, however, whether he's proposing that the emotional turmoil and alienation felt by Winesburg's residents is peculiar to the experience of small town life or merely indicative of the world at large.Winesburg, Ohio is one of America's earliest examples of modernist literature. Its influence on later modernist writers is readily apparent, most notably in the works of William Faulkner. While Anderson possesses a brilliant insight into human thought and emotion and expresses his vision in a beautiful narrative voice, most of the stories end all too abruptly and thus feel incomplete. It's a conceit of modernism to think that it's enough for the author to merely offer sketches of the way things are, without providing the reader with a satisfying beginning-middle-end plot structure. In most of these stories we're deprived of an end, and one finishes each tale with the disappointment of having just read two-thirds of a novel, only to find the succeeding pages missing. The characters all finish their stories as if frozen in some tableau vivant. Reading Winesburg, Ohio is much like wandering through a gallery of Edward Hopper paintings. You've got a pretty good idea where these people have been, but you don't have a clue where they're going."},{"Title":"Winesburg, Ohio: A Group of Tales of Ohio Small-Town Life","review":"Sherwood Anderson's one great book contains the moving stories of the odd characters of one small American Midwest tone.

The book attempts to provide insight by presenting \\"grotesques\\" or caricatures of people and their lives. The major themes are loneliness and failure, and so one can imagine that the tales are not very uplifting. The book is fairly easy to read and depicts a suprising view of pre-industrial life."},{"Title":"Winesburg, Ohio: A Group of Tales of Ohio Small-Town Life","review":"This is an American classic, and as such has been reviewed, and re-reviewed countless times by people far more knowledgeable than I. And I am certain that all of them found deeper meaning than my superficial understanding - at least until the first twenty, or so pages.It is then that you realize that these stories are much more than random quilt patches temporarily stitched together awaiting a more coordinated, cohesive, and coherent arrangement. It is, of course, possible that such may be the case, but your mind won't wait for that. You want to do more than listen and observe. You want to guess where it all will go. What will he do when...? What is she trying to accomplish? You might even make a few good guesses, but that will never be enough.

Anderson's usage of characters filled with melancholy, often from loneliness or regret, definitely can weigh on emotions, but it is well worth it. One can empathize with the characters' emotions - his insight into their minds is perhaps a look into all of our lives at times (hopefully for most of us not quite as dysfunctional as many of the characters of the novel). I also felt that Anderson's collection of stories was a primer on the experiences we all go through both in growing up and after we have \\"grown up\\" - the ups and downs of life."},{"Title":"Winesburg, Ohio: A Group of Tales of Ohio Small-Town Life","review":"The book I read was a Signet classic and the work was listed as a novel. I would never consider it as such since it seemed to lack a forceful central character and to have a plot. In fact finding a central character is hard unless the reader is able to use frequency of appearance as importance in the book. If so, George Willard fills the bill, he is in almost every chapter, forcing order to be a novel, i. e. named divisions and separated works are pulled together by the inclusion of a single character despite the presence of other names who fill minor spots in the telling. Once recognizing Willard as the protagonist the chapters are collected and show the titled character as a poor, miserable individual who is ground into hopelessness by his past, essentially an inconsequential life which never even rises to notice. The titles of each chapter are given to show what aspect of life in a small town that character is most related to, whether a part of his or her character or a function he or she performs in the town and how little it matters. That is the book, now it must be graded on its effect. It was published nearly one hundred years ago, it was different from the type forming the major publishing efforts of its contemporaries and it influenced most of the better writers who followed it. It was a great accomplishment for the author, the best effort of his life and never equaled. Still Sherwood Anderson became a great author due to this book alone. Surprisingly I find it still worth reading despite being unable to empathise with any of the characters whse lives are exposed."},{"Title":"Winesburg, Ohio: A Group of Tales of Ohio Small-Town Life","review":"After reading Sherwood Anderson's book about Winesburg, Ohio I came away knowing the characters as though they were my nieghbors. It's a powerful read about plain folks who struggle with their demons, whether it's thier happiness,or unhappiness. Their loves or their imaginary loves. Thier wanting of something better from life and even somtimes from death. You will enjoy the stories as they unfold about the occupants of this small town as the pages turn from story to story.An enjoyable and must read.

Those who are married seem especially unhappy....the women are all tall and dark, the men are all \\"thinkers\\". Tho it won the Pulitzer, it was not a great book to read.

Inside each ice cube is a liquid center. Floating in each liquid center is a desperate character beating on the wall of ice that surrounds him, crying inarticulately at his isolation, trying but failing to reach the other characters locked or hiding in their own ice cubes. The observer can see the characters struggling, but the ice is thick and translucent at best, so he catches glimpses of parts of a surface, rather than a clear look at the whole. This is the position in which author Sherwood Anderson places the reader of \\"Winesburg, Ohio,\\" a collection of VERY loosely connected portraits of inhabitants of a small Ohio town around the first decade of the 20th century.Actually, saying that the book, misleadingly characterized by the Modern Library as a novel, contains portraits of inhabitants of a small Ohio town puts it too generously. Instead, the author picks off his characters' psychic scabs to show us what lies beneath. Rather than whole people, we see only bits of pain, longing, disillusionment, or regret.To be fair, the meticulously careful writing touches the border of poetry from time to time. The author does manage to create some compassion for his \\"grotesques,\\" as he calls them. But if you have the audacity to prefer actual novels, with multidimensional characters and at least a thread of plot, if you enjoy books where you wonder what happens next, you probably have better things to do in the time that remains of your reading life than linger in the dreary writing-exercise world of \\"Winesburg, Ohio.\\""},{"Title":"Winesburg, Ohio: A Group of Tales of Ohio Small-Town Life","review":"A modern reader might have some difficulties in putting up with Sherwood Anderson's \\"Winesburg Ohio\\". First, it consists of 22 short stories, which have to be taken up one after the other and which not very coherently form a picture of that little town in rural America around 1900. Next, the style may have been modern enough to inspire important modern writers to regard Anderson as their model, yet today it can strike one as being sometimes pretty old-fashioned. Why?The author is omniscient, which means that he explains a lot of what is going on in his protagonists instead of leaving it to the reader. And, in the tone of an old-fashioned chronicler, he mostly gives an introduction into the persons' families, their backgrounds first. So, all in all, his subject and his style struck me as a little heavy-going.And yet, if one reads on, the various parts begin to form an authentic picture and atmosphere. Anderson's strongest point, to my mind, is that he creates unforgettable characters. Very often these are erratic, wild, bizarre creatures who are prisoners not only of their primitive surroundings, but also of their lonely and strange personalities. Mostly their conflicts erupt in a dramatic situation, which breaks off abruptly leaving many questions open and giving food for thought. The extraordinary thing is that though these characters may appear as the more or less crippled products of their time and place, they strike one as being representative of the human situation in general. I could not help being strongly appealed to by their mostly unhappy lives, feeling that they reveal more about our human lot than the promise of constant happiness in our time.The person that seems to be relatively untouched by unhappiness is the central figure, George Willard, the young reporter of the town's newspaper. Obviously Anderson saw himself in that figure and in another artist, namely in the story \\"Loneliness\\", a painter with the telling name Enoch Robinson. Some facts of Anderson's life seem to correspond with the outline of this story, showing that he also had his share of unhappiness. The overall feeling that to me sums up the atmosphere of this book best can be found in the thoughts of George Willard as he is on the point of leaving Winesburg: \\"One shudders at the thought of the meaninglessness of life (...) while at the same instant one loves life so intensely that tears come into the eyes.\\""},{"Title":"Winesburg, Ohio: A Group of Tales of Ohio Small-Town Life","review":"Wonderful theater of the grotesque. This is a seminal work that set the stage for the modernist literary revolution in the 1920s. Anyone interested in modernist literature or American literature in the early decades of the 20th century should read these well crafted profiles."},{"Title":"Winesburg, Ohio: A Group of Tales of Ohio Small-Town Life","review":"This is a well written book that portrays small town life in the early twentieth century. Each chapter is like a separate story but they are linked together through some characters(a newspaper writer) that appear in several of them. The book is very well written and interesting but very bleak. This is a town of dashed hopes where peoples dreams are crushed over time. Very few escape but the ones that stay never enjoy a happy ending. Still, it is so well written that I am glad I read it. You better leave Winesburg if you want to chase your dreams."},{"Title":"Winesburg, Ohio: A Group of Tales of Ohio Small-Town Life","review":"I first read \\"Winesburg, Ohio\\" over 40 years ago, when I was a teenager. Back then it made a profound impression on me as being about the same yearnings, confusions, fears, and \\"growing pangs\\" that I was having--though it was about people who lived nearly 60 years before I came to it. Now that those same people have receded again--over 100 years into that dim past--I find it has lost none of its power to move me with its simple stories of hope, of dreams unfulfilled, of death, sophistication, drink, love, and departure.As others have said, George Willard, the young reporter of the town, appears in almost all the stories as a friend, aquaintance, or confessor to the lives so carefully and lovingly presented in these 22 stories/sketches. But until the end of the book, George very seldom comes into his own as a character. We know he harbors dreams about Helen White, the banker's daughter, but that's really all we know of him until the last three stories--Sophistication, Death, and Departure--where his character is explored in greater depth than at any other time in the book.I can't help making a comparison to two other of my favorite works in this vein. Joyce's \\"Dubliners\\" and Wilder's \\"Our Town.\\" Like \\"Dubliners,\\" \\"Winesburg, Ohio\\" is a collection of stories about the various citizens of a particular place at a particular time in the world. It evokes all the mystery, nobility, and even pettiness that drives these people without ever condescending to them, pitying them, or trying to make them appear better than they are. Each has a secret sorrow, and each bears it with grace and dignity. The prose is often lyrical and haunting, but it never rises to the level of greatness that Joyce achieves in his greatest story \\"The Dead.\\" To be fair, though, I can't think of ANY author whose prose achieves that lofty level, so it's perhaps not a fair comparison. Much more does \\"Winesburg\\" compare favorably with \\"Our Town.\\" In a little town in Ohio, at the turn of the century, 18 miles south of Lake Erie, the entire human drama plays out. Girls lose their virginity, a boy loses his sobriety (if only for a night), a man loses his one great love, and a mother loses her fight with death. These people, along with all the others in these stories show us that, in all times and in all places, people are the same.That's all we can ask of great books--that they unite us."},{"Title":"Winesburg, Ohio: A Group of Tales of Ohio Small-Town Life","review":"This book of connected stories contains some of the greatest prose poetry in all American literature. Winesburg's people will break your heart and make you love them all your life.

But Winesburg, Ohio, short and easy to read and utterly beautiful, is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Winesburg, Ohio: A Group of Tales of Ohio Small-Town Life","review":"This brought on a great book club discussion.

I was pleased, during the first half of the book, to be lead step-by-step through the history of the region, and -- even when my criticisms start -- I found it informative. But the author's bias is CLOYING. Much of the book is spent portraying Israel as a calm, 100% peaceful state that just wants to get along with everyone -- a huggable, squeezable state -- while the only time given to Arab grievances are terse, nasty, dismissive comments. When Israel wins a battle they are &quot;vanquishing the enemy&quot; (that's a quote), a phrase that is never used when the Arab forces win a battle. When some question is placed on the morality of Israel's motives and activities, Bard either spends a lot of time rationalizing what they've done (using a single set of statistics or a particular interpretation of a historian's comments), or he completely glosses over the issues. Not so with the question of Arab morality, which is bluntly and negatively portrayed. Hardly a page goes by without this bias being reinforced. As someone who just wants the information, I found this extremely frustrating, and far less useful than it could have been. That said, I learned a lot from it, but I had to use a kind of &quot;propaganda filter&quot; just to wade through it. I may ultimately agree with Bard's assessments, if he'd only give me a chance to make up my own mind about it, instead of constantly force-feeding his opinion to me. Bard's opinions are perfectly at place in a book for those interested in Israel's perspective. They are not at place in a book which supposedly covers the history of the region. It doesn't fulfill it's claim as &quot;cutting through the confusion&quot; or whatever...it is largely just a propaganda tool, made more annoying because it pretends not to be one."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"Sad that people might buy this misleading piece of propaganda & actually believe anything written in it.

One might even argue that an objective view does not exist. The best that one can do when writing about this subject is to be 'balanced', to give equal weight to the competing arguments, or at least attempt to do these things. This book is so biased towards the Israeli/Zionist viewpoint that when the author does in those rare moments put forward a Palestinian viewpoint (only to then post-fix it with a Zionist rebuttal), he's insulting 'our' intelligence, because he's trying to convince you and I that he is being balanced. Only a complete buffoon with the intellect of a mentally challenged amoeba could believe this book is fair and balanced. These books do not help, they are the very worst form of political literature, written by people so blinded by their own convictions (in this case Zionist ideology) that they cannot even begin to make a fair appraisal of the conflict. I would give this book 0 stars, but that option does not exist. If you want a fair and balanced reading of this most difficult and seemingly intractable conflict, then this book is not for you. If you want Zionist propaganda pumped down your throat, then this book is perfect for you."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"This book is biased, poorly written (even for a complete idiot) and is a COMPLETE waste of time.

In covering certain crucial events that have impacted the course of history in the region, the authors will make attempts to present the Israeli justifications with no or little reference to the bias sources.

If Prof bard wants to write propaganda, that's fine.But to pass it off as a supposedly mainstream, unbiased book? that's sickening. The publishers should be ashamed for allowing him to hoodwick them & their readers.It's really not that complicated of a conflict, at it's root. It's all about land. Who took it away from who, and what is to be done about it. Religion is just a smokescreen.Let me describe it a different way: If Canadians came down to your state, took your land, water, house, farm, killed your father and thousands of your neighbors and stuck your family in refugee camps for 60 years, and then, when you rebelled and killed one of the soldiers harassing your family, how would you feel if you were labeled in America as a \\"terrorist\\"? But of course we are told that all Palestinians are terrorists, therefore we should unconditionally support Israel's military, which we give 2+BILLION DOLLARS to every year in foreign aid. 40% of our entire aid budget goes to Israel for weapons to support ethnic cleansing. We also pay for the settlements that the whole world but us know are illegal & immoral. Any wonder why America's standing in the world is sliding so badly?Anyone reading this who has not made up your mind: Look at another country's description of the conflict. BBC is an excellent source. Talk to a non-American about it. They will explain what \\"apartheid\\" means and how it applies to this situation.

If you can overlook the pro-Israeli slant the book still has a lot to offer. However, if you are new to the middle east conflict beware of the biased approach. I guess the adage &quot;Know the author know the book&quot; is true in this case.

It has offered compromises in which it would divide the Holy Land , the land many believe promised to it by God. It has time and again sought ways of moving away from hostility and war to mutual respect and recognition.Even today the Israeli government is about to withdraw from Gaza( which may be a major mistake) and the Palestinians are promising that for this there will be rockets and missiles on more Israeli cities.My own sense is many Israelis would rather not be ' right' would rather have neighbors who wanted to live in peace.This work gives an accurate picture of the historical development of the Middle East conflict. And is recommended for that reason."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"I bought this book because I thought it might be a good candidate as a text for a college course I'm teaching next fall. What I was looking for was a straightforward account of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that laid the bare essentials on the table so that novices could get a good overview.To a certain extent, Bard does this. In keeping with the \\"Idiot's Guide\\" format, he tries his best to reduce huge gobs of information into digestible bites, and he frequently manages to pull it off. But people thinking about buying this book need to be aware that there's a clear pro-Israeli bias reflected in it. Again and again the Palestinians are portrayed as the culprits who break peace agreements and kill Israelis, while the Israelis are viewed for the most part as patient but beleaguered heroes.Don't misunderstand me. I'm not pro-Palestinian in this conflict. The whole mess in the Middle East is just too complicated to take sides in a knee-jerk fashion. There is right on both sides, but both sides also have committed acts that are vile and shameful. My problem with Bard's book isn't, then, that he defends a slant with which I disagree. My problem is that his book isn't the balanced account the publisher leads you to think it is. But since both Bard and a close technical reviewer of the book are associates with pro-Israeli groups, I suppose the slant is predictable.I won't be using this as one of my texts in the fall. But it's still worth taking a quick look at by anyone interested in the Middle East conflict--just so long as you keep in mind that Bard is spinning as well as describing."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"Do not be fooled by the title, this book is provides a very good overview of the Middle East conflict and what is remarkable given the emotions and misinformation surrounding the issue, it is objective.Don't mistake \\"balanced\\" for \\"objective\\". This book isn't \\"balanced\\" but it is objective. Bard doesn't give you both sides of the story in the sense of merely repeating Arab or Israeli propaganda; he gives you the facts, facts which are usually ignored and evaded in the mainstream media.For example the Palestinian grievance that the Israelis drove them from their homes, the one the media repeats without question, is simply not true. The overwhelming majority left voluntarily, after being urged to leave by Arab leaders who were about to invade Israel. In fact, Jewish leaders appealed to Arabs to stay and become Israeli citizens. The appeal was repeated in Israel's \\"Proclamation of Independence\\". Some Palestinians were forced to leave their homes but generally for legitimate security reasons. The village of Biram was an exception, there the Arabs were essentially forced to leave, and the land was turned over to Jewish settlers.Related to this is the often ignored fact that Jews in Arab countries were threatened and driven out, almost a million of them, and unlike the Arabs leaving Israel, many were forced to leave with nothing. Jewish refugees received no compensation and no international aid, while the Palestinians who left voluntarily received millions of dollars from UNWRA, including 3 million dollars from Israel.These are the kinds of facts Bard brings to the table in his discussion of this turbulent region, facts that cast a bright and cleansing light on the conflict. I suspect many people will have their preconceptions regarding the region overturned.You will also learn a whole lot more: the West's often shameful hand in the region, how the various forces of culture, population, economics and yes, oil, collide to create a gigantic conflict over a tiny sliver of desert.I highly recommend this book, both as an introduction to the Middle East conflict, and as a rebuttal and a counterweight to the Palestinian propaganda that the media uncritically broadcasts as an excuse for journalism. This book is not perfect, it doesn't go into the deepest reasons for the conflict which are philosophical, but it will open your eyes and provide you with rarely cited facts and context in which to evaluate the claims of the various participants in this conflict. And you will be well equipped to judge the objectivity of the media on this highly charged topic."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"The middle east has been a crazy episode in the world for so many years.

The Brits did everything in their power to prevent Jew from entering Palestine. Just before and during the WWII the Brits prevented Jews from entering Palestine, condemning over 1 million immigrants to the German gas chambers.When after declaring independence, Israel was attacked by all the Arab states, the Brits and Americans imposed weapon embargo on Israel, while the Brits continued supply vast quantities of weaponry to the Arabs. British officers were actively leading the Jordanian Arab Legions against Israel. British advisors were assisting the Egyptian army, and British pilots were flying the Egyptian air force.

I keep it close at hand on my book shelf and take it down whenever I want to check the facts contained in a news report, op-ed piece, or editorial on the Middle East. It's a great book."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"What an eye-opener! I found this no-nonsense, chronological history of the seemingly intransigient middle east conflict an invaluable aid in sorting out the roots of the Israeli-Arab dilemma. For example, I didn't know that the Arabs rejected the 1947 UN Partition Plan that would have given them a state larger than the one they're demanding now. Nor was I aware of the fact that the Mayor of Haifa in 1948 actually pleaded with his Arab neighbors not to flee but to stay in the city as the Arab armies were invading Israel. Thank you, Mr. Bard. I will recommend this book to all my friends."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"Having little knowledge of the history of the conflict, I was eager to learn &quot;just what is going on over there?&quot; I agree that this book is somewhat pro-Israel, but keeping that in mind I found it to be quite interesting. While the author does present some opinion, the vast majority of the book concerns factual events. The book starts with a short history of the three major religions involved (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), then covers events in the region throughout history. It moves generally chronologically, although it covers certain subjects in total; for example, the Iran-Iraq war is covered in a separate chapter, though events in other chapters occurred simultaneously. After finishing this book, I had a much greater understanding of why there is so much animosity in the middle east."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"It's hard to publish an opinion on the middle east that doesn't offend people on at least one side of this polarized political issue. I found this review to contain the most facts, the most intelligent analysis, the best timeline of information, and the best unbiased presentation of this material that I've ever read, and I've been reading a LOT about the situation in the middle east. The book also has the advantage of being fun to read, and really offering all the information in a way that even a person who has never heard of the conflict can learn all the basics fairly from one source. I've never given a five-star review before, but this book deserves it. Well done!"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"This book is an excellent source for people trying to begin to understand the current middle east. The book introduces you to all the major players and ideologies.... The book seems to present both sides' positions and does not hesitate to take shots at either Israel or the Arabs/Palestinians (or the &quot;West&quot; for that matter). [you] should find this book helpful and informative."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"I was impressed by the talent of the authors in delivering the information in a way that it was very simple and easy to understand , yet very much complete. After reading this book, I think I have a much better understanding of the conflict in that region."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"This well-balanced work shows the positive and negative of both sides of the issues in the Middle East. It goes beyond the headlines to the roots of the conflict. It focuses on more than politics and shows how other factors contribute to the conflict. The &quot;idiot&quot; title is misleading, since this is a really well-written, comprehensive overview of the history of the Middle East. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED reading."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"Like most people, I read the paper every day and try to stay up to date on what's going on in the Middle East. But also like most people, I really never had a good sense for how the conflict started, who started it and why we, as Americans, care. Every book I've picked up on the MIddle East has been written in such technical language, and is so confusing that I just get too frustrated reading it and throw it aside. I thought I'd give the Idiot's Guide another chance. And boy am I glad I did! The book covers everything you've always wanted to know about the middle east but have been afraid to ask--and more. It presents an unbiased, thorough analysis on the topic in a reader-friendly, unintimidating style. I love the fact that I finally understand the basis of the middle east conflict and where we stand today. I strongly encourage people of all ages to read it!"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"What a service to the general public to at last have a clear picture of the Middle East conflict and the history that has fueled it. I don't need opinions. I will form my own. But I need the facts that will help me formulate my opinions intellectually. This guide, idiot's or not, provides that clarity. It is even-handed and precise.Thank you for stocking it and thank you for selling it."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"A great analysis of the history of the conflicts in the region. It is factual, honest and unboased, yet easy to read and quite amusing at times. Full of information and appears to be well researched."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"Mitchell Bard has achieved the impossible: he's written a lucid, balanced and very readable history of the conflict that has torn the Middle East for the past 100 years. I had thought that there was very little for me to learn from a &quot;Complete Idiot's Guide&quot; since I am well-versed with the history of the Middle East. Mr. Bard, however, showed me the many gaps in my knowledge of the origins and key events of the conflict. I recommend this book both to &quot;Complete Idiot's&quot; and to those who think they know it all; I guarantee you will both learn a tremendous amout."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"While those with an idealogical axe to grind will no doubt find fault with this excellent, concise tome, it puts to lie many longstanding myths with carefully researched facts.Highly recommended for anyone who wants to gain a more complete understanding, without the usual left wing biases, of a highly complex but hugely important subject."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"The publishers are to be congratulated for giving us an easily understandable comprehensive account of a very difficult to comprehend situation. This book appears to have been written primarily so that non Jews and non Arabs can begin to understand the historical background that has led to the current conflict in the Middle East. Bard has done an excellent job in bringing the difficult problems facing the Jews and Arabs into perspective in modern times. The cute sidebars add to the readers enjoyment of the book, however they do not distract from the important issues which are discussed with clarity and insight. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in trying to understand the current problems facing Arabs and Jews in the Middle East. One certainly does not have to be an &quot;idiot&quot; to not only enjoy this book but to find insight and understanding of the causes of the volatility in this important area of the world. I believe this would be an excellent book for high school and college students to read"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"Here's what I expected: a completely boring dissertation about a complex subject that left me feeling like a complete idiot.Here's what I found: an interesting, informative, humerous yet appropriate presentation of a complex subject that helped me understand nuances that I had not appreciated.I liked it, and am glad I bought it (I end up giving away most of the books I buy)."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"There is a lot of &quot;political correctness&quot; out there about the conflict in the Middle East -- everyone I know, including me, believes there MUST be peace in the region, but there's a lot of murkiness about the region's history, and the two sides' claims to prior ownership. And with all the hysteria, there's quite a bit of misinformation and propaganda. But this book, which is for idiots as well as geniuses (the author, however, most definitely being the latter!), portrays the region's history (and current turmoil) with a fairhanded and most important, COMPLETELY FACTUAL hand. I was given this book as a gift, and it is indeed a gift: the gift of knowledge, pure simple and unadulterated. Buy this book, read it, and learn the facts behind the conflict. I will most certainly be giving this out for my Christmas, Chanukah and Ramahdan gift lists!"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"The Middle East is a complex world. This book gives a straight-forward analysis of the conflict between Israel and all the arab states and why Israel has had to fight a war of existence every 10 years or be wiped off the map. Concise and understandable, this guide is a wonderful reference."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"This precise history of the middle east conflict in a clear and unbiased manner, is what has been needed for some time. Anyone looking for an objective analysis and facts should make this mandatory reading. It informs candidly with factual support, as opposed to placing blame or looking for scapegoats.If you want an unbiased history of the facts, this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"Maybe I'm arrogant, but I never considered myself an idiot regarding the Middle East - until I read this book! I realized how much I didn't know before. For one thing, I thought that the Jews just up and came one day to the Holy Land and uprooted millions of Palestinians in the process - when in fact it seems that there was never any such thing as a Palestinian Arab entity or grouping until way later... I guess there will continue to be many more books on this topic, but for me, this book is exactly the right dose: cutely written, well organized, and not just a rehash of magazine articles. I'm awaiting his next book (maybe on Yugoslavia?)."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"This is a clear and penetrating analysis of the history of the conflicts in the region. It helped me to understand the historical background and causes for the Palestinian struggle and the dilemma that confronts their people."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"Mitchell Bard presents the roots of conflict between the Arabs and Jews, and follows the historical record through to the present time. It is an easy to read, non-pedantic and well annotated book. He gives a full non-judgemental exposition of the facts, and permits the readers to form their own opinions.I became so engrossed in the reading that I had to fight my impulses to continue reading, rather than moving on to other activities."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"...As a student of the Middle East for over a decade, I have found this book a handy reference guide.... In a struggle so personal, objectivity is always the first victim. The author is clearly pro-Israel, but that does not detract from the value of the text. Indeed, his willingness to actually admit his perspective is, in my opinion laudatory. Too many other &quot;scholars&quot; in this field present their opinion as if no other was legitimate.The text covers the basic facts of the Arab Israeli conflict in a highly readable manner. Subjects like the religious histories of the parties, the basic outlines of the battles, as well as the points of disagreement are given good coverage. ... Despite the complaints, this is factually correct, supported by serious historians and military analysts around the world. Others disagree with his assessment about the origins of the Arab refugee problem, a subject that remains unsettled by historians and still engenders heated debate.This book is not exhaustive. No single book could be. If you are interested in further reading on the subject, which is essential if you want to really educate yourself, I suggest that you also read the writings of Bernard Lewis, the dean of Middle East Scholars, The History of the Arab Israeli Wars by Chaim Herzog, a military history of the conflict used as a reference by both sides, and The Crusade Through Arab Eyes, an excellent book on the origin of Muslim views of the West.... As I said, no work is exhaustive, but this book is a reasonably good place to start."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"as a key note speaker on the Middle East I recommend this book fullyNeil Lazarusawesomeseminars.com"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"The title of Middle East Conflict indicates an immediate bias against the Middle East in general by identifying the region solely with the wars that have marred its twentieth century history. Still, one could have hoped that the book might have presented the the many complex facets of post-colonialism, mutually unrecognized land and human rights, and cultural and historical mistrust and miscommunication which have mired Arab, Israeli, and Iranian relations since World War I. Instead, this book focuses solely on a blithely pro-Israeli, pro-American stance which does nothing but exacerbate the existant prejudices against the Muslim world. The resultant attitude, in turn, propagates popular Middle Eastern mistrust of Israel and America. If the US makes no effort to see all sides as equals with reasonable grievances, rights, and aspirations then there can be no hope for an end to conflict in the Middle East. Clearly, in their failure to promote such understanding, neither this author nor this publisher sees such mutually acceptable peace as a goal."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"I agree, first of all, with reviewers who find it scandalous that Alpha Books would present an \\"objective\\" Idiot's book without anywhere stating the author's clear pro-Israeli bias. It took me a few chapters before I realized it, and I suspect some readers will never realize it.That said, on balance I have come to agree with the author's contention that the Palestinians and Arab countries have consistently and repeatedly negotiated in bad faith with Israel, and that the Palestinians, for the most part, are fundamentally irrational. My burning question throughout the book was: \\"Why?\\" Unfortunately, the author never provided any discussion about this and other core issues.Which leads to my second major criticism of the book. It's too much of a stream of names, dates, and incidents, most of which I'll probably forget within a few weeks. The \\"analysis\\" of each incident mostly consists of legalistic \\"who started it\\" and \\"who was right\\" types of things, which in the end accumulate into a giant defensive argument about why Isreal is the longsuffering victim. I guess that is as deeply as Mr. Bard likes to think about it.My $.02 about the conflict is that it really should be seen as a case of _class conflict_ more than a conflict of religion, race, or territorial ambition. Like the Mexican laborers in the U.S., Palestinians get the crummier jobs, and little hope of elevating their status, and that makes many of these Palestinians blindingly angry.I must admit, though, that I learned a lot from the book!"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"First off, If youre Pro-Israeli, you will love this book. It caters to the Zionist crowd, just as Mein Kampf is beloved by the Nazi's.From a more scholarly viewpoint, this book is a disgrace to both the \\"For Dummies\\" and \\"Complete Idiot's\\" series.The author \\"Mitchy\\" Bard, is a jew, and a zionist, so right off you know what side of the field he is sitting on. From the preface and on, of book you can see the little tricks Bard utlizies to dumb down the reader, and lead them to accepting his Pro-Israel/Pro-Racist arguments.Bard goes above and beyond to show the anti-Jewish quotes made in the Koran, yet there is no mention of the prejudice in Jewish holy books. Heck, according to the Holy Talmud, Gentiles like you and me are below animals (while conveniently Jews are the apple of God's eyes).Also Bard presents Jews as a descrete group of people, which in actuality is false. Jews are people who practice Judaism, not a separate racial group. Most Jews are white/european, so their claims to be Semitic and natives of the Holy Land is just absurd. I mean, people like Monica Lewinsky, Woody Allen, Sarah Michelle Gellar, etc. who are Jewish cant be considered as middle-eastern.I recently learned that Mitchell Bard graduted from UCLA. After reading this book, I strongly urgue the author to go back to campus and ask for his money back."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"This book's findings are pure fantasy and have been repudiated by the work of Norman Finkelstein. Bard's a biased author to start with AND claiming the Palestinians are not native to the land even though they speak a unique Southern Levantine dialect is patently absurd. Not recommended either for its simplicity or deliberate duplicity. Take a college course or use the web for comparative information. Otherwise, getting your info. from Bard will have left you as clueless about the region as before."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"One would have to BE a complete idiot to believe this author's version of history! It's unfortunate that this book, which is obviously marketed toward those with little knowledge about the conflicts in the Middle East, was written with such a heavy bias. I may not know much about history, but I know when someone is trying to con me. Despite this I found the book to be very helpful in providing an easy to understand general outline of the sequence of historical events. It also had many interesting tidbits, such as Theodor Herzl's 1903 proposal that the Jewish home be made in Uganda instead of &quot;Palestine!&quot; If you are looking for a fair, well rounded view of specific events you'll have to find a different book."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"I cannot believe that a book so biased and so innacurate is out there, under the disguise of a &quot;let's tell you the real deal&quot; publication. But then again it is the idiot's guide... What is so dangerous and so frightening is that it may be the only book that certain people pick up to 'get an idea' of what's going on in the Middle East and what they will get is the old worn out and overplayed idea that all the problems are the Arabs' fault and the Israeli's are just trying to work things out. I think that our (US) media has done enough of that mythmaking, we don't need any more of it. Even the most untrained eye will be able to see that all the massacres carried out by Israel are excused or glossed over or even suggested to be just made up despite the facts, while anything violent done by the Palestenians is emphasised and is turned into comic strip villiany, without even considering that they, as occupied people may have a few problems with the situation. People, read something useful and leave this pathetic attempt at propaganda to the dummies."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"I've never written a review before on amazon, but this book has ired me enough to take the time to do so. I am a complete idiot on the subject of the middle east, knowing nothing about anything in terms of arab-israeli issues. so i *thought* this book would be a good place to start. My friend warned me to make sure the book isn't slanted one way or the other or i would be misinformed greatly. i thought, how could a &quot;dummies&quot; book be controversial???Well, I couldn't even make it 4 chapters in, without being disgusted at the complete bias the author displayed. I ended up asking my history major friend on a good non-biased book and he recommended me his university textbook...A Concise History of the Middle Eastby Arthur, Jr GoldschmidtI'm reading it now, and loving it."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"Naturally, anything having to do with the mideast will be accused of being biased by one side or another, but this particular book is not only very biased, not only disingenious because it pretends to be an objective &quot;guide&quot;, but downright inaccurate! Almost all of the historical myths in this book (example: that Israel defeated superior forces in 1948, that the Palestinians left voluntarily and were not ethnically-cleansed by Israel, etc.) have been totally repudiated especially by the legitimate Israel historians such as Benny Morris and AVI Shliam."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"Contains fair amount of information; Due to ever changing conditions, the text is becoming outdated."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"It is a pretty good reference book. I have to take a class on the topic and it really help me to get the general idea."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"\\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict\\" is a good jumping point book for those who interested in the Middle East, but know little if anything about this part of the world with its perplexing and always changing state of affairs. The author's writing is very readable and well presented in a time-line format. But this book should be read with an open mind and a willingness to verify some of the \\"facts\\" given by Mitchell G Bard. Unfortunately, I did detect some Pro-Israeli bias in the author's writing and so I recommend paying close attention to details while reading; read it, enjoy it, but take nothing for granted. Please remember that nothing is \\"set (or typed) in stone\\".Few writers, even the most scholarly authors can put together a book concerning the Middle East without showing some kind of bias in their writing. Any book on the subject will offend some readers. Even the best scholarly works will create controversy and cause confusion among other readers. But if you are a novice (not an \\"Idiot\\") on the Middle East this book may be a good starting point before going on to more scholarly, well balanced works, such as, \\"What Went Wrong?: The Clash Between Islam and Modernity in the Middle East\\" and \\"Middle East: A Brief History of the Last 2,000 Years\\", both books were written by Bernard Lewis."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"I'm halfway through this book, It's an painless way to get up to speed through Biblical times and through the world wars. However, history is written by the winner I suppose. The book is loaded with Pro-israeli language. Israelis were terrorists too in the early going, yet the author justifies their actions while condeming the arabs later on. Israeli actions are always described in logical terms whereas Arabs are always potrayed as Raving Militants. This isn't a very balanced book"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"Interesting enough presentation of material. Good if you are looking for information in support of the Israeli side of the story but don't expect non-biased information. It is written by the Executive Director American-Israeli Cooperative and his bias is obvious. I am very disappointed the Idiots Guide series would select such a non-neutral author."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"On reading this book I am struck by its one-sided bias toward an Israeli view particularly of events in 1947-1949. It is frustrating and disappointing that the author chosen to write this book is a pro-Israeli activist. His pro-Israeli bias comes through clearly in the narrative of this book. It is frustrating because it becomes a propaganda piece, clothed in a garment of objectivity. A real coup for the pro-Israeli lobby, and a defeat for intellectual honesty about the historical events in this area."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"This is a very good starter for anyone wishing to learn about the battles over Israel. My one quibble is there could have been some better editing (I noticed a few typos) and he could have had more information on Arab and Muslim countries sooner in the book, and more of it. It tends cast the region's conflict in terms of how the region deals with Israel, and tends to give Israel more of the benefit of the doubt. For instance, I think he could be harder on the whole idea of the settlements. But I woulnd't accuse him of pro-Israel bias, as some of the clealry hate-filled reviewers below do. There is naturally going to be an appearance of bias in an unadorned account, because the Arabs have chosen political change through the murder of innocents. There is not moral equivalence. See the book \\"Right to Exist\\" for more on that."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"I expected an objective account. This book is clearly pro-Israel. Nevertheless, it gave a good account of the tortuous conflicts in the middle ease. I got the definite feeling, however, that I should go on to read an another account of same history to bring a better balance to the issues."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"When I purchased this book I expected a balanced analysis of the Middle East conflict. I thought the Idiot's Guide series of books sought the middle ground presenting the facts and allowing the reader to come to an informed opinion. Instead the author supplies facts sparingly and always from a Zionist perspective. Reading this book has damaged the credibility of the Idiot's Guide series for me. I wanted information. What I got was an apologia for Israel. The book could have been written by AIPAC (in fact, Mr. Bard was for three years editor of the Near East Report, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's (AIPAC) weekly newsletter on U.S. Middle East policy.) The author finds excuses for Israeli acts of terror like the bombing of the King David Hotel in 1948 (the entire passage seems based on the memoirs of Menachim Begin) or the murders of Arab residents in Deir Yassin in 1948 by the terrorist Irgun Gun or the massacres in Sabra or Shatila in 1983. Nor does the author properly detail the appropriation of land from Arab owners or the construction of illegal Jewish settlements in the Occupied Territories (no entry exists for \\"Occupied Territories\\" in the index). The Palestinians are presented as the authors of discord and the enemies of peace and any harsh measures initiated by the Israeli government are always excused as reasonable responses to Palestinian provocation. This is propaganda posing as scholarship. It should carry a proviso that reading this book may be hazardous to the truth. I do not recommend this book to anyone who seeks the truth but if you are a cheerleader for anything Israel does you'll love it."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"I have been working with Palestinian Christians for five years now in their attempts to maintain dignity and a living wage in the face of the Israeli Occupation. This book does a disservice to their plight, painting a picture of pre-Israeli Palestine as a desolate, un-developed land and the Palestinians as unorganized southern Syrians with no sense of attachment to the land. Try telling this to the men and women who harvest olive trees that their ancestors planted 1,000 years ago. Read Munib Younan's book for a better firsthand account of what life is really like for the Arab peoples."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"While quite knowledgeable about the Middle East myself, I thought this book looked quite interesting and worth reading. I particularly enjoyed reading the similar book \\"Arabs and Israel for Beginners, \\" by Ron David, which I really found to be informative and entertaining at the same time and made 6 stars on my own list. Unfortunately, \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Middle East\\" was a total disappointment. Though fascinating on the surface, the book suffers major problems having to do with its credibility and its fairness.First, not all the relevant facts are presented. Certain things are covered in great detail while other equally important facts are glossed over, or neglected completely. I understand that not everything can be covered in such an introductory guide, but this book does a terrible job presenting a balanced perspective. The Arab perspective is almost totally absent from this book. For example, it emphasizes Jewish suffering in Europe in the 1920s through 1940s while ignoring or minimizing the dispossession of Palestinians and loss of their land as a result of Jewish immigration. The book also extols Israel's \\"Law of Return\\" for allowing Jews anywhere in the world a safe-haven, but neglects to even mention that the same law forbids millions of Palestinians who were actually born on the land from returning to their homes. Likewise, the entire book is written from the point of view of Israel.Second, the title is somehow misleading. The Middle East in my mind evokes many things: the Holy Land, Islam, Arabs, Iranians, etc. If we concern ourselves with ancient history as well, as this book does, then we have a vastly broad topic that includes many things. Reading this book, however, one senses little concern for this broad coverage and focus instead on a single narrow thread connecting all these topics: Jewish history. Thus the book discusses Egypt as a prelude to the story of the Israelites and Moses. Mesopotamia is alluded to only as a prelude to the Babylonian exile. Islam is even presented mostly from the perspective of 7th century Islamic-Judaic relationships. Coming to the modern age, the centrality of Israel and the Zionist movement to this book is never far off. Many pages are spent on the Nazi Holocaust - something which never took place in the Middle East and actually has nothing to do with the Middle East. While it is of course OK to write a book on Jewish history, to call it a primer on the Middle East is misleading to readers.Understanding the conflict requires a balanced perspective, and also requires a better understanding of Islam and the Arabs since they make up the majority of that region. This book fails to deliver that. Perhaps the affiliation of Mitchell Bard with AICE (basically an Israeli PR firm) can explain the unbalanced perspective of this book?"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"This is a expansive case of Israel's case in the Middle East conflict. Often from the newspapers and media one might be unaware of the deep historic connection between the Jews and Israel. Arab propgandaists keep saying the Jews stole the Palestinians land and there is no connection of the Jews to the land. This book details the kings and prophets and judges and centuries of life in ancient Israel/Judea. And in modern times the struggles of the one Jewish state in the world - as opposed to over 20 Arab countries. It includes the attack at the start of 5 Arab armies on the modern state of Israel and the absolute rejection of the right of the Jews to their one state, where 650,000 Jews lived as of 1948 in British Palestine (not thieves of others land)."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"I thought the book balanced, factual and makes it easy for many to understand the complicated issues.

Very, Very insightful. An honest portrayal of all the events and parties involved in shaping the turmulent world of the middle east of the last three thousand years.

It makes clear all of the conflicts between the many nations involved in the long time war against israel and the jews and the frequently occurring skirmishes between neighboring arab states as well as the full scale wars. Political assassinations, suicide bombings, the looming threat of nuclear war, terrorist organizations ability to possess weapons of mass destruction and the 100+ related websites recommended in the back of the book were what i found most interesting.

His research on the missteps of all the parties involved, the outright lies and deception by the world, the anti-Jewish bias of the world press (for instance, the Sabra and Shatila massacres were nothing compared to what the PLO and PLF has done to the very same camps -- more than 4 times as people murdered by their own forces). Bard also does not mince words in pointing out Israeli desires of land expansion and harsh policies in dealing with the Arab population. Most impressive new fact? That neither Syria, Egypt, nor Jordan recognised that a separate &quot;Palestinian&quot; people even existed until around 1978. Each country's leaders and UN ambassadors viewed them as either Syrian arabs or Jordanians...."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"Being from the Middle East myself, when some of my muslim friends in the states asked me to write a review of this book which they told me was a biased and one sided whitewash of the Middle East issue, I decided to read it first.Contrary to what I was told about the book, the author is very well informed about the historical as well as current condition of the region. Being personally familiar with the background of the Ottoman occupation of the region, I found that the historical information was very well reseached and objective.Also, since I spend time in Turkey AND Israel, it appears to me that the author has a very good grasp of the mentality of the regions peoples.In general, the text is very easy to read and even enjoyable. In fact I spent a whole night reading different chapters just for fun.Anyone interested in this dramatic part of the world without all the current media hype would do well to familiarize themselves with an objective view of the Middle East as put forth by the author.And to my friends, I say 'sorry, but it's a really good book!'Istanbul, Turkey"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"Mitchell Bard's \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict\\" is an excellent introduction to the Arab-Israeli conflict, its history and context. Unfortunately, there is very little coverage of other conflicts in the region, such as the Iran-Iraq War or the Yemen War; \\"Middle East Conflict\\", even without the definite article, seems to mean the Arab-Israeli conflict.The book is comprehensive, progressing chronologically through the history of the Jews, the rise of Islam, Jewish and Arab nationalism, the wars of 1948, 1956, 1967, 1973 and 1982, the peace-process and the current turmoil, along with chapters on the importance of Jerusalem and the nature of terrorism, among other topics.It is also very detailed. However, it is written in a clear and friendly style, and is accessible to readers without any prior knowledge of the conflict. In my opinion, most people who are already familiar with the conflict will also learn a lot from this book.The book is very well organised, and makes good use of graphics. It includes a detailed index, chapter outlines and summaries, boxes with interesting quotes and trivia, a timeline and a bibliography. More maps may have been helpful, however.I think that the book gives more attention or emphasis to Israeli claims and losses than to those of the Palestinians. I am less troubled than some other reviewers by this, and maybe this reflects my own bias. However, Bard does not come across as vindictive, and the book's facticity is virtually unimpeachable.I recommend this book for those interested in the Arab-Israeli conflict. While this book may be the best introduction available, beware that it's difficult to find an author interested enough in the conflict to write a disinterested introduction. Those wanting an introduction to other conflicts in the Middle East should look elsewhere. Readers may also be interested in Bard's \\"Myths and Facts: A Guide to the Arab-Israeli Conflict\\", which can be read online."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"As a former journalist, I undertook long ago to research the history of the Middle East, from both Arab and Israeli perspectives. This book provides a backbone, chock full of events and places referred to elsewhere in more depth.It is also an excellent resource for readers wanting only one book on the subject. It provides a superb outline of the conflict's contours and history, beginning with the Israelites, and continuing through 1948 until the recent past--and will educate even the well educated.Central to that history, as the book shows, has been a pan-Arab policy of non-negotiation with the Jewish state. As the Bards note, Arabs rejected the Peel Commission's proposed partition in 1936 and the UN partition of 1947. Each would have created a second Palestinian Arab state (the first being Jordan) alongside Israel. But within 24 hours of Israel's 1948 declaration of statehood, 7 Arab states invaded, openly declaring plans for a &quot;war of annihilation&quot; to be remembered &quot;like the Crusades.&quot;Israel obtained no assistance from Western powers in that war. The book shows that the Arabs did. Israel barely won, and lost 6,373 casualties in the process--nearly 1% of her population of 650,000, proportionately equal to twice US losses in World War II. On an absolute basis, Arab losses were about half as high.The book also outlines how this pattern repeated over the next 50 years. The Israel-Egypt and Israel-Jordan peace accords brought some calm, for example, but those treaties did not eliminate the problem. The principal of non-negotiation remains a pillar of the Fateh constitution, which still calls for &quot;Complete liberation of Palestine, and eradication of Zionist economic, political, military and cultural existence.&quot;After reading this fair, balanced and solid piece of reporting, you will have a firm grasp of why the conflict has proved so frustratingly intractable.

All we get in the US is the Jewish or Isreali perspective. After doing a few years of business in Egypt and Bahrain, I at least discovered that there was a different view, and it probably was time that I (and the rest of the country) begin to do some diligence and get the full story - whatever it is. Mitchell Bard's book was my first choice in hopes that it could accellerate me through the past and present history. It did, Bard does a great job at presenting an amazing amount of detail. The only problem is that his bias begins to show after about 100 pages, and increases noticably after each page. I don't fault him for this, he is jewish, and entitled to his opinion. But it does remind me that this is only half of the story, and begs the question: is there a book covering the same material written from the Palestinean percpective?. Any recommendations?"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"Very informative book, providing background into the situation, but Bard is very biased (pro-Israeli).

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"I came to Amazon to order books by Said and Netanyahu to get both sides of the Israel/Palestine question, and happened to notice this one. I figured a book in this series would be a simplified, entertaining, unbiased summary of historical facts, so it would act as kind of a &quot;referee&quot; for the other two books. Well, I was right on one count - it's entertaining (sometimes unintentionally so!) It's organized to be an easy read in spite of the wealth of detail included - I found it very educational. However, the author makes no attempt to hide his extreme pro-Israel, anti-Arab bias. It's more like an extended Op-Ed piece than a &quot;Guide.&quot; ... However, that said, if one is aware of the bias (and it's impossible not to be), it's a user-friendly summary of (one version of) history and issues. It just needs to be balanced with propaganda from the other side."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"An excellent primer that is more important than ever.The author makes a point-by-point, untangling the convoluted history and emotions that mark the past and present conflict."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"I would say that this book is unabashedly pro-Israeli, but in fact it repeats many worn myths that even Israeli historians have long since repudiated. The section on the Deyr Yassin massacre is truly pathetic. And the description of the events surrounding the downing of an Iranian civilian airbus by the USS Vincennes in 1988 is so completely inaccurate and totally contrary to the facts (as established by a joint Newsweek and Nightline investigation, a BBC investigation, and the ICAO investigation) that I literally thought this was a work of fiction. With Daniel Pipes as a consultant, what can you expect?"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"Readers seeking to develop an understanding of the history and complexities of the middle east conflict, with no investment in advancing the cause of either side, would be much better served by a more balanced presentation. While readable enough for this kind of thumbnail overview the author betrays his pedigree as a US-Israeli PR wonk throughout. The book is rife with unsupported statements casually tossed off as fact. Statements which may well be factually accurate but are so amateurishly presented that the credibility of the author's interpretation of events is done more harm than good. Uncited sources, unattributed facts and unconcealed bias in the language...what passes for scholarly work here is at best a useful timeline couched in a long-form pro-Israeli recruitment brochure. Reviewers claiming that any suggestion of bias is merely so much more anti-Zionist rhetoric should check their own axes for signs of grinding, then check out a better book on the subject. Producing a book that's easily readable needn't mean writing it poorly or without the substantiation and professional detachment that any respectable work of this nature demands. The target readers for this book may be \\"idiots\\", but they aren't dumb. The author trivializes the suffering of the Jews whose case he obviously supports and undermines his arguement by failing to give us credit for enough intelligence to draw our own conclusions without his subtle and not so subtle nudging.Two stars if you simply want to spend half an hour skimming a what-happened-in-what-order sketch, zero if you're looking for substance, depth or well documented historical fact."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"This is the most biased book I've ever read, and with a degree in history I've read a lot of history books. The book should be called \\"The Completely biased towards Israel guide to why Israel is the best country ever\\". Every instance of terrorism which the Israelis have participated in, whether attacking U.S ships in international waters, or attacking sovereign nation's nuclear reactors, is treated as if it was a mistake, glossed over, or trumped up as Israeli courage. Mitchell Bard is a zionist (I don't want to sound conspiratorial, I've discussed this with the man himself) who is unabashedly Jewish as well as a staunch supporter of Israel.Do not look for this book to offer any insight into Arab reasoning for any of the conflicts which Israel has fought in. Do not expect anything but complete and total bias towards Israel whatsoever. The books thesis is that Israel has a right towards the land which it currently occupies, that all Palestinians are terrorists, that the UN hates Israel, and that any US president which opposes AIPAC or Israel in any way is anti-semitic.Your money is spent better in a million places, perhaps a Martin Gilbert book on Israel - just not here."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"The extremity of opinions presented evident here shows that the book was anything but unbiased. It was catered for one side, with little regard for historical facts or detached objectivity. It is within Dr. Bard's right to hold opinions and publish those. However, it is downright insincere to do it in the guise of an objective first-read for unsuspecting readers."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"I read this book to get some facts about the situation over there in order for me to make my own decision with respect to who is at fault for this conflict.

I am very disappointed in the \\"Idiot's Guide\\" publishers for saying that this book is an unbiased account of the Middle East conflict."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"There are a number of reviews of this book which imply that one has to be biased in favor of Zionism or biased against Zionism. Okay, let's say for the sake of argument that this is true.Zionism is merely Jewish nationalism. It means human rights for everyone, including Jews. Antizionism means opposition to human rights for Levantine Jews.Antizionism is a consistent position to have, but it is arbitrary and racist. And it opposes human rights.There are three reasons why one might want to be an antizionist anyway. The first is that one might feel that Jews are just too different to be admitted to human society. A second reason is that there is a war going on against the Jews that may be worth fighting out of considerations of loyalty to one's friends, no matter how wicked and racist it is. A third reason is that it is fun to tell lies and slander, rob, mistreat, and bully people, especially when it seems that you can get away with it.Very few people have the first attitude. The second attitude does not require lying about the past and present. The third attitude includes lies and taunts as part of the package. It wouldn't be any fun without constant lies. And the books that have a \\"bias\\" against Zionism are almost all representative of this point of view. Believe me, you do not want any of them, even if you are an antizionist. You want the truth no matter who you may be.You may think you can find a good book in the second category: the truth from a racist opponent of human rights. Good luck. For example, try \\"Bitter Harvest\\" by Sami Hadawi. It leaves out the entire Jewish point of view, already a big omission. On top of that, it includes a number of absurd and arbitrary lies that result in some serious self-inconsistencies in his tale.The reason that some (not all) of the pro-Zionist books on the subject are much closer to truth than the anti-Zionist ones is that most anti-Zionists have simply abandoned truth in an effort to get support from people who think they support human rights.That is why you want Bard's book as an introduction. This will give you a good foundation in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict. And after reading it, yes, you'll want to look at some other material to see a wide variety of viewpoints. But you'll never want to read something composed of pure lies which are written only to lure supporters of human rights into supporting racist opponents of those rights. And starting with the facts in Bard's book will help you avoid that."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"GIVES ALOT OF BACKGROUND INFORMATION THAT HELPS ONE UNDERSTAND THE WAY THINGS ARE TODAY."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"I was disappointed in this book and disappointed in the editors of the \\"Idiot's\\" series to have used Bard as the author. It's not possible to read this book from an independent point of view and not see the one-sidedness of it.

It's obvious that you favor one side and it's misleading to unsuspecting readers."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"To me, a successful overview of the Middle East should be (1) factual, and (2) unbiased. I read many of the reviews that stated this book was biased, but there were enough positive reviews that I figured the charges of bias were just the inevitable result of glossing over some details for brevity's sake.I was wrong. This book is so heavily biased that it reads more like propaganda than a fair account of history. After a few chapters, I found myself questioning the validity of the facts themselves -- at that point, the book was pretty much useless to me.To illustrate my point (and because I didn't heed the \\"bias\\" calls from earlier reviewers), I decided to include two quick samples of the bias in the book:-- This statement on p. 69, which is indicative of the tone of the book: \\"The Arabs weren't happy with Jewish immigration because they believed it would lead to their displacement from Palestine. This assumption simply was not the case, and subsequent history would prove it.\\"-- A recurring sidebar called \\"Tut Tut!\\" is supposed to correct common \\"mistakes & misstatements\\" about the Middle East. There are 38 of these sidebars in the book -- 28 are pro-Israeli, 13 are neutral or indeterminate, none are pro-Arab.Now, I'm not pro-Arab (or pro-Israeli, for that matter). But seriously - the most contentious subject in the history of mankind, and the author can't even find one example (out of 38 sidebars) of an incorrect statement that bolsters the Arab cause? How is this kind of bias helping us to understand (and maybe eventually solve) the problems in this region? I think a book this biased simply makes matters worse by perpetuating the arguments of one side.Bottom line -- if you're looking for a fair discussion of the Middle East, there have GOT to be better books out there -- I'd suggest moving on to another book. And if you find a good one, please post a review - I'm still looking."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"This is an excellent book regarding the roots of the current situation in the middle east. Especially amusing are the \\"Tut Tut!\\" margin notes where Bard corrects false statements made by one side or another with facts.Reading this will definately lead an open-minded, truly searching, uninformed person to a particular side of the argument. However, this is definately not a negative. ... This book sticks with specific facts and numbers instead of making the type of grand generalistic statements so many are making these days. ...Get this book along with others, get the verifiable facts, then get an opinion."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"Trough out the book, I felt there was a strong bias favoring the Israelis. It almost convinced me that the arab people where violent sadistic people, while Israel had always done its best to help palestinians. Even when Israel had to force palestinians into leaving their homes, it was a necessary thing to do. Before buying this book, I strongly suggest for you to read the author's background. Its funny that they would choose a powerfull jewish activist instead of someone more neutral."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"While I realize it's hard not to be biased about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, I think we all expect the Complete Idiot's Guide series to be more factual & even-handed, rather than grossly opinionated. Mr Bard gives no voice to the Palestinian or humanist sides of things.If you want to learn more about this subject - along with all of the Middle East, I'd recommend The Middle East for Dummies. This writer gives both sides of the story and reminds me of the diversity and plain sense of \\"just wanting to get by\\" that everyone in the world shares.Also, note that many of the reviewers for this book (as well as the Dummies book) are very biased themselves - just check out their other reviews. It's pretty shocking. Example: Jill Malter - she lists herself as a \\"zionist\\" on her profile. How do you think that affects her opinions here?"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"Anyone who wants to pick up an unbiased and informative text discussing the various conflicts of the Middle East should not bother opening this book. Dr. Bard's analysis of the Arab-Israeli issues is slanted at best and completely inaccurate at worst. His perspective reflects solely the Israeli point of view while vilifying practically every Arab action of the past 52 years. This is exactly what an introductory guidebook should not do. The Middle East is what it is today for many complex socioeconomic and political reasons. Dr. Bard focuses mainly on the religious issues, his statements serving to reinforce the Israeli right to complete control of the Holy Land by virtue of being the \\"Chosen.\\" At the same time, he distorts the undisputed facts about such atrocities as the Deir Yassin massacre. He downplays the reality of the deaths of over 200 Palestinian civilians by the Irgun Group, asserting that the women killed were actually men dressed as women. Anyone who knows anything about this tragedy must be aware that these allegations are ridiculous. If you want to learn more about the Middle East you would do much better reading &quot;A Concise History of the Middle East&quot; by Arthur Goldschmidt."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"This is an extremely biased and misleading book. Arabs are portrayed as being belligerent and religiously barbaric, while the Israelis are shown to be innocently in search of peace and at all costs willing to compromise. The core issues that sparked the ongoing Middle East conflict in the early part of the 20th century are conveniently distorted; which reflect Dr. Bard's anti-Arab views."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"The media and most of us have, for some reason, forgot and rewritten history. How dare the Israelis not want to be second class citizens in the Middle East and not want to be wiped out whenever the Arabs felt like it. The British allowed the Israelis to form a state yet also told the Arabs it's alright if they kill the Israelis, hence starting the Palestinian/Israeli conflict. Find out how the Palestinians are only victims of their present Arab countries who want nothing to do with them and offered no support. See how the Israelis and the US offered millions in aid to the Palestinian \\"refugees\\" who had willfully left to make room for the Egyptian troups who were going to come in and push every last Israeli into the sea. When this didn't happen, the Israelis offered the Palestians their land and homes back but THEY DIDN'T WANT IT! Most of the land the Israelis occupied was bought at absorbonent prices from the Arabs and was considered arid and uninhabitable.Saying this author is biased is untrue and most likely from reviewers who didn't live through that time and listen to anything the media tells them. Now years later we have a new history of the big bad Israelis and the pathetic Palestinians. You only have to look to Iran and their callous statements of killing all Israelis to know the truth.This is a great book and I hope you enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"This is an excellent book if you want to get one side of the story of the Middle East conflict. It essentially lays out the rational Israeli side and makes a fairly convincing argument for the Israeli side of the argument. This is essentially the same argument and logic that is used by major US newspapers.However the guide purports to be a non-biased, factual look at the conflict and that is simply not the case. If you do buy this book, try another book from the Palestinian perspective as well to get \\"the whole story\\".The author does a good job of explaining one side of the story, but this is precisely the problem in America-- only one side of the story is known. By relying on mostly Zionist sources, the author robs his audience of a complete view of the conflict."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"I had been reading the 2nd edtion of this book and I learned many things I never new. For example, I was suprised to know that the Israelis informed Anwar Sadat of an assasination plot before the one that took place. I knew after the first few pages of the book that the Author was pro-Israel. I didnt mind that because there are many books out there that are pro-Palestinian.The problem I had was when I reached the chapter on Islam. I found a quote that said the Prophet Muhammad said, in his last sermon before he died, to fight all non believers until they become Muslim. I am not even a Muslim, but I was curious to see if the man said this. I have checked every source of info. on that sermon and never did the Prophet utter such words.Therefore, if this author cannot be trusted in a small matter like this, how can any of his information be accepted. This book will nevertheless influence many people to love JEWS and hate Arabs. I suggest another book, even if you end up reading this anyways, ARABS AND ISRAEL FOR BEGGINERS by Ron David..just to even out the biased views."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"I read the book as an American trying to understand the motivations behind 9-11. I figured that a book on Middle Eastern Conflict would provide me with a broad summary. I soon realized that almost the entire book focused on Jewish history with Israeli/Arab conflict as a sub plot.

Instead, I was sickened to view a book that I saw as biased and misleading, giving a clear indication that Israel is the victim and has done no wrong in the history of their existence.One chapter details the Israeli casualty rate, such as the &quot;Six Day War&quot; and the &quot;War of Attrition&quot;, but fails to mention the Arab casualty rate, such as ten thousand Egyptian soldiers killed while retreating from the Israelis.The author mentions how Israel attacked Syria because it was shelling Israeli settlements, but fails to mention how Israel provoked many fights to gain more territory, as is admitted by prominent Israeli leaders.These are only two of several areas in which this book was significantly tilted toward the pro-Israeli side, disallowing the reader to gain an accurate account of what actually transpired in the Middle East.Perhaps the occupation of the author (Executive Director of the nonprofit American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise) may shed some light as his obvious one-sided accounts."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"I was excited to find an easy to read and comprehensive text on the complicated problems of the Middle East but was soon discouraged.

The first couple of chapters were somewhat informative (in a very basic kind of way) on the histories of Islam, Judaism and Christianity. Unfortunately, that is where the objectivity died.This book is an excellent source on the history of the conflict from the Jewish perspective. I blame myself for not reviewing the author's biography before purchasing it. The bias can easily be found there.I hold no partiality for any of the three religions discussed in the book.

One cannot understand the conflict without an honest and impartial writing. The author avoids professorial attitudes and writes with humor. Those who wish to re-write history will obviously not like this book.

For example, the so-called &quot;massacre&quot; at Deir Yassin and the bombing of the King David Hotel by the Irgun are two events that have been so distorted by Arabs that they have become fables.

Bard has done his homework and presented an objective and fair look at sensitive topics. This book is an excellent guide for those trying to determine whether what they read in the papers is based on fact or propaganda.

Bard and Mitchell Geoffrey Bard got their facts straight, they also provided an insightful analysis of the events and their causes. I've read number of books on the subject, and yet this book has something that most are missing, absence of bias or passion for any side/cause. The Bard's purpose is to educate, therefore they present the course of event and their analysis in a very even fashion, which is also fun to read. Unlike most authors, who write on this subject, their do not pick a bad guy and build their arguments to make their point. Neither, do they make conclusions for you, rather let you make your make up your own mind. I can see why both camps would agree with some parts of the book and choose to challenge or criticize other parts. In any case, if you are looking for an educational material, this book is for your. If you have already made up your mind and are looking for facts/arguments to make your point stronger, you may still find this book helpful."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"This is an excellent book, well- researched and accessible.

As a theologian and teacher, and with Middle Eastern tensions flaring, I decided to check this one out, and see if Bard had done his research. He had.While there is an unbiased pro-Israeli slant to the book, there is more information than you could probably digest in a year.Bard (rightly) traces the conflict back to Abraham, and follows the history factually and thoroughly. He discusses the Koran, the Bible, Mohammed, Arab oil, Jewish nationalism (1948), as well as Zionistic and Palestinian conflicts up to (nearly) current times. Virtually every cogent subject dealing with the conflict is discussed in a (reasonably) easy-to-read format.I learned much from this book, and despite the rhetoric against it in some of these reviews due to its Jewish bias, the work is well worth the reading if you REALLY want to know all the material packed within its pages...and there's an awful lot there."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"Makes a complex subject accessible and understandable. A must-read for responsible citizens of the world - especially in these tumultuous times."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"Looking at the conflicting reviews of this book you might think that the data it contains is highly contraversial. Look deeper; most of those who attack the book do not address the facts and figiures it contains, but the idea that the author is 'biased.' Of course biased is a word generally applied by people to those who hold an alternate point of view. Case in point, who do many of the negative reviewers suggest for an unbiassed view? The noted Palestinian propagandist, the late Edward Said.So, how about the actual contents of this work? Like all of the Idiot's Guides, Bard's work offers a cursory glance at the subject not a deep education. Still, he covers the bases, from ancient history, through the birth of Islam and the colonial period right up to the present day. Many oppose this view because they prefer Israel not be placed in an ancient historical context, but begining readers should understand the Jews historic attachment to the sliver of land between the Med Sea and the Jordan River.The Maps and timelines are good and informative, though again, it does not go as deep as a reader seeking real expertise would need. The author focuses most of his attention on the Arab-Israeli conflict, giving short shrift to the challenges facing Arab culture in a post Ottoman world where artifical nation states were created by europeans. Readers interested in this subject should explore the work of Prof. Bernard Lewis, particularly the 'Middle East and the West' and his more recent work 'What Went Wrong?'Bard does a good job presenting the outline of the current conflict and giving the reader a basic understanding of places, names, dates, and outstanding issues. He Does offer both sides perspectives in their own words, though he does not take these statments at face value, often challenging positions that fly in the face of fact or reason.Again, while this will not make a reader an expert, it gives a good basic background which is a good place to start."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"The author has obviously done his homework and has presented an objective and fair look at sensitive topics surrounding the conflict. This book is an excellent guide for those trying to determine whether what they read in the papers is based on fact or propaganda.The book chronicles the history of the conflict seeks to inform, not blame, which will probably anger many pro-Palestinian activists who apparently think any history of the Middle East should point the finger of blame solely at Israel."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict, 3E","review":"Short Review: This book is a good summary of Middle East history as narrated from a purely right-wing Israeli point of view as written by a well-known propagandist, and while quite informative in some aspects, must not in any way be used as the SOLE source of learning about the middle east without referring to opposing narratives from the non-Israeli (i.e. Palestinian) point of view in order to come at a more balanced perspective. Buyers should be warned that much of the so-called facts in this book are revisionist fantasies that have been discredited by Israeli historians themselves based on their actual research. Reading this book alone, without contrasting views, will only arm you with much-publicized but factually dubious pro-right-wing-Israeli talking points that will NOT provide you with a well-rounded and informative understanding of the middle east conflict.Longer Review: I was wary of this book's objectivity when I saw the name of the author, who is the Executive Director of the nonprofit American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise (AICE). That job description alone betrays the book's 'frame of reference', which is vital when reading any history book. Furthermore, the fact that Bard subscribes to right-wing revisionism when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict under the guise of 'scholarship' should be known to any purchaser of this book. This is evident in his other works that I am familiar with. Nevertheless, I picked this book up for evaluation as I assumed good faith that the author would not betray his ideology here and try to remain as neutral as possible. Sadly but not surprisingly, I was wrong. I will summarize below only a few examples and let the readers of this review be the judge:1- The book is written exclusively from a Jewish historical narrative. The middle east is, of course, rich in Jewish history and such a narrative must be included. But exclusively? And to set the scene for a future political conflict? That comes to serve less as a 'guide' and more as a piece of propaganda (again, remember the author's affiliations). The first chapters describe the religious and biblical stories of Judaism and the promised land etc as the main focus, and treat Arabs and Islam as marginal afterthoughts . As one illustration of this, one of five concluding summaries (called \\"least things to know\\") of a particular chapter is that \\"Abraham's illegitimate son Ishmael is considered to be a patriarch for the Arabs\\". The other four points are all recaps of the Israelite exodus and journey to the promised land. To have the pathetically anachronistic \\"illegitimate son\\" comment as one of only five main points in a part of the book named \\"In the beginning\\" is hardly representative or neutral of the history of the region and clearly betrays an anti-Arab agenda (again, this being no surprise given the author's allegiances).2- At one point, Bard states that \\"who was in the land first\\" is irrelevant; what is important is that the Israelis now \\"control land that the Palestinians want\\". There are two problems with this argument. First, if it is not relevant, why does the next paragraph, and indeed the rest of the chapter, go into excruciating details (using some fact and much fiction) to leave the reader convinced that this is Jewish land, and non-Jews (i.e. Arabs) are greedy imperialists? Second, this is hardly land that \\"Palestinians want\\", this is rather land that Palestinians are \\"native to\\", but are being denied universally accepted human rights by the occupying power because of the fact that they are not Jews. Contrast the fact that Palestinians are natives of this land to Bard's overly simplistic (and malicious) description of this being land that \\"Palestinians want\\", as if Palestinians just landed from Jupiter and are demanding someone else's land.3- Bard repeats some nonsense claimed by the most right-wing revisionists as simple fact. For example, he claims that when the first Zionist immigration wave occurred in the latter half of the 19th century, there were 'fewer than' 250,000 Arabs living there in 1882, the MAJORITY of which were recent arrivals!!! This is not based on any census but rather Bard's (and other revisionists') selective reliance on flawed (e.g. unscholarly press) or outright discredited (e.g. Joan Peters' \\"From Time Immemorial\\") literature used solely by propagandists. Compare these statements with research from Israel's own Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where an actual Israeli demographer using actual census data derived that the population of Palestine in 1890 was not 'fewer than 250,000' but rather 532,000, of which 43,000 were Jews (both immigrant and native). As for where these Arabs came from, we can again refer not to the ideology-based fantasies of Bard et.al but to scientific data from, yet again, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where Israeli geneticists have determined through DNA sampling that Palestinians do in fact carry genetic commonalities with Israeli Jews and are generally decended from the same forefathers as Jews, i.e. are as native to the land as Jews are and are likely converts to Islam from Christians and Jews that inhabited the territory before the Muslim invasions. Bard also states in a later chapter that, during 1947-48, only a 'handful' of Palestinian Arabs were expelled from their homes while 'thousands' were asked to leave by what he refers to as 'Arab leaders' and the majority left in order not to be caught in the crossfire. Contrast this to research done by Israeli historians themselves using recently released materials from Israel's national archives that point to 1- negligible effects of the calls of Arab leaders on Palestinians to evacuate and 2- a systematic effort by Zionist leaders at the time to depopulate the Arabs from as much of the land as possible through forcible expulsions. For more, read books by the Israeli historian Benny Morris (no left winger I assure you) or Ilan Pape's \\"The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine\\", all available from Amazon. A last example of revisionist nonsense is Bard's repeating of another aged canard that Palestinian national identity did not begin to formulate until after 1948 and especially after 1967, which are complete fabrications. For more, read Rashid Khalidi's \\"Palestinian Identity\\" and/or \\"The Iron Cage\\", also both available from Amazon.4- Bard interjects the text with his own (well known) Bard-style editorializing that would insult the intelligence of a reader (unless the reader really wants to take the title of the book quite literally). One example is when he states something to the effect that If the Palestinian Arabs had accepted the UN partition plan of Palestine into a Jewish State and an Arab State, there would never have been any Palestinian Arab refugees. The problem with such an assertion is that it completely contradicts Bard's own thesis of arguing for a Jewish state (in what he has assured the reader is historically Jewish land), because the territory designated by the UN for a Jewish State had a significant Arab population, if not an Arab majority. These Arabs would have had to be removed from their homes and 'transferred' to the Arab state in Palestine in order to have a Jewish majority in the Jewish state.In conclusion, this book is nothing more than another typical Mitchell Bard anti-Palestinian tirade of which there are plenty on the internet, most of which are much shorter (and cost-free) than this book. If you want an 'idiot's guide' to the right-wing Israeli propagandist talking-points (and there are many who will want such a list), then this book is for you. But if you want an actual 'complete' guide, then this book doesn't fulfill the task, and must be used in conjunction with other fact-based scholarly works of actual experts on the region, some of whom I referred to above."},{"Title":"El Bulli: 1998-2002","review":"I've met a lot of chefs who, like Chef DL, think way too highly of themselves to a point of being so close-minded that they can't broaden their talents and horizon. I'll also admit that I've yet to purchase El Bulli but from scanning through its glorious pages of pictures, the excitement I get from the inspiring work of art and genius of Chef Adria is overwhelming.Chef DL's comments about how Chef Adria's cuisine \\"is different and wild and unlike anything you will see in the finest of restaurants\\" is a laugh! If he's right and the wildness of Chef Adria is that difficult to swallow, then we should all be happy with burgers and fries. . . and no one would try cuisines from other countries cos its toooo different and wild.Besides, to be able to blend art and science and create something so tasty is pure genius! So many chefs and people in the food industry applaude his brilliance. . . can they ALL be wrong? For El Bulli to be the #1 destination for chefs around the world to visit during their very rare and short break tells you much about his fame and credibility. Makes me wonder where Chef DL works."},{"Title":"El Bulli: 1998-2002","review":"Nice cookbook. Great photos and naration.

I read an article about Ferran Adria in February and I thought to myself, &quot;How did I miss this guy?&quot;The food is beautiful, unusual, curious, unique, and definately showing what food can be. I'm an aspiring chef, and I've never been more impressed with a book in all my life. I have 75 cookbooks, this is the one I would keep if I had to have only one. Forget Escoffier, forget Larousse, this is the direction I want to see food go. Foams, hot jellies, using gellied consumme as pasta dough, hot maynoaise, candied olive oil... the list goes on.The recipies are not meant to be for the home cook, but anyone interested in new techniques, this book explains it all. Most of the food isn't very appealing for the Western pallate. This book, for me at least, is a wealth of information about cooking rather than recipie replication. He's very detailed in his explainations, and the book is organized very, very, very well.Ferran Adria is more interested in making new things with foodstuffs than making a million dollars. I think Adria is the most creative and interesting chef working today, he's constantly creating new ways to eat food. Looking through this book is like having a glimpse into the future when it comes to cooking. Joel Robuchon says he's the best chef in the world. Paul Bocuse says he's the most exciting chef today. Those are some powerful words coming from some of the best chefs to have ever worn a toque. What's even more impressive is that they still say he's the best after he's claimed that the French are all washed up and don't know how to cook anymore.Get this book, it's the start of something big."},{"Title":"El Bulli: 1998-2002","review":"If cooking, dining, eating, food as an art form, etc., is part of you life, then this publication has no current equal.

This is a book for the future chefs, like myself, who will take cuisine to a whole new level. Being avant-garde while respecting the old. Since this book is a little too advance for chef D-L.. I suggest buying El-bulli 1994-1997, or if that's still too innovative for him, maybe El-bulli 1983-1993, where Chef Adria was doing dishes that Chef D-L is doing now. On second thought, these books are written in Spanish, so that might be hard for him too... And by the way... since when does a chef in America get CERTIFIED to be an executive chef?

He also has a relationship with her daughter. The long, convoluted discussions of feelings become a daunting read at times and Oscar Wilde's translation does not help. But overall, it is a compelling novel. The author keeps you turn pages with unexpected twists and turns.I also found the exploration of human desire between the same and different genders and people of different ages unexpectedly open for the time in which the book was written.

His writings and criticism flowed against the tide of academic work that emerged in this time as he always considered his perspective a journalist's one. While this makes his work accessible, it is nonetheless complex and deep. This makes this Wilson reader a great place to start exploring his writing. It features selections from his major criticisms like &#34;Axel's Castle&#34; and &#34;To the Finland Station&#34; as well as essays from &#34;The New Yorker&#34;.

She finished more than 50% of the questions independently, and for the rest she needed some help or hint from parents. I think this workbook is more likely for ordinary 2nd graders, or even for lower graders if they are bright, not necessary for the gifted. I highly recommend it if it is for 2nd or lower graders.I have also found some mistakes in this book: On page 11, questions 2 and 4, the longest route should be: Anytown-Cityway- Dustyroad-Bigville-Elkfalls; and it should be 54 miles instead of 52 miles. On page 47, question 2, the definition of \\"day\\" is confusing: If \\"one day\\" is defined as 24 hours, the answer should be May 27.

Andy Milligan is a good example of this, but Clint Eastwood is not. Quiet and distant in the public eye, Eastwood has managed to create cultural icons of Godzilla proportions with the characters of The Man With No Name and Dirty Harry Callahan, yet he has also shown himself to be both a brilliant and sensitive director with films such as Bird, White Hunter, Black Heart, The Bridges of Madison County, and the Oscar winner Unforgiven. But Douglas Thompson does not shed any light whatsoever on the artist or business man (although he does let us know what Mayor Clint did for his beloved city of Carmel by the Sea), instead the author focuses on Eastwood's sketchy history of womanizing and the legal troubles stemming from his acrimonious break-up with longtime companion/lover, Sondra Locke.

In other words, reading is the linchpin of much of my work and leisure; therefore, I am always on the alert for the next &quot;great read.&quot;Not being either a fisherman or an angler, but always eager to stretch my knowledge base, I was intrigued by the title of a new book, Fishing Passion, and its tag, &quot;a lifelong love affair with angling.&quot; Happily, my curiosity led me to read Mr. Chapralis' marvelous odyssey about his incredible life...one imbued with his love and virtuosity of fishing/angling, his daring immersion in several unique business ventures, and his genius for forging remarkable and enduring friendships, including some with the rich and famous.This incredible Promethean journey, begun and centered in Chicago but encompassing every corner of the globe, is recounted by Mr. Chapralis in an engaging, humorous, and self-effacing style that is the hallmark of every accomplished raconteur. I found myself racing ahead to see what new, exciting, hilarious, and even life-threatening, adventure he would next expose to this delighted, and by now captive, reading audience. And he never disappoints--his is a career highlighted by a life-informing zest and decades of improbable encounters and feats that will not only fire your imagination but also blow your envy quotient through the roof.We should all be so lucky if a passion of ours could feed our soul, earn our bread, and burnish our existence with the joy, grace, and success that Mr. Chapralis has attained and conveys so effortlessly and convincingly in Fishing Passion. Am I ever glad that my restless inquisitiveness strongarmed me to read Fishing Passion...and so will you!Bob McFarlandSchenectady, New York"},{"Title":"FISHING PASSION","review":"Fishing Passion: A Lifelong Love Affair With Angling by international fishing pioneer Jim C. Chapralis is a unique exploration that explores not so much the &quot;how-to&quot; of fishing, as the emotional aspects of angling. Comparing the attraction and act of fishing to the condition and experience romantic love, as well as deftly capturing the passions of the sport in anecdotes, dreams, memorable personal experiences and communions with nature, Fishing Passion was written by an angler, for anglers everywhere, as it vividly communicates the true joy of a beloved and life-long pastime."},{"Title":"Impulse: Kommunikatives Deutsch Fur Die Mittelstufe","review":"the book I got had a torn cover, but that was understood before I bought it.

Ian MacDougall is a man driven by demons from his past. Marca Kenworth is a woman whose strength and love can save him, but the past that haunts him now threatens her future and the lives of everyone she loves.This novel has a solid suspense plot with a satisfyingly evil villain, a dynamite supporting cast, a heroine that's mature, warm, and very real, and a hero that really is the &quot;Perfect Hero&quot;. This is the second book I've read by this author that has been set in the college town of Bradenton, Oregon - I hope Ms. Riggs will give us more. Loved the town, loved these characters, loved this book!"},{"Title":"A PERFECT HERO","review":"A Perfect Hero is a perfect example of how Paula Detmer Riggs can take even the most horrible premise and pull out enough emotion to leave the reader panting for more. PDR has a knack for making the reader love each of her characters from the tall, dark, and too sexy hero to the ugly dog. And no one can accuse her of not making the reader stop and think. It takes true talent to pull undying love out of hate and racial tension. Ian is a man with a heart big enough to save the world and love his family on top of it."},{"Title":"Rejection Junkies - The Hidden Addiction Everyone Suffers","review":"Rejection Junkies is one of the best &quot;Recovery&quot; books I've read yet. Gary Lawrence is a straight shooter and doesn't hold back any punches with his style of presentation. This is a serious issue that everyone can relate to. It explains the root of rejection and how it is passed down and transfered and shows you how to overcome and heal scripturally. I started recommending this book before I finished reading it. Everyone in a position to help others or are seeking help for themselves should read this book."},{"Title":"Rejection Junkies - The Hidden Addiction Everyone Suffers","review":"Had a co-worker share this book with the people in my office, and it is a book I think anyone can relate to and buy to have for reference. You need to read the book to understand what I say, it's one you can read and re-read and keep on hand for future reference. It enlightens you to better understand why we do things and why other people are the way they are. A good read."},{"Title":"Rejection Junkies - The Hidden Addiction Everyone Suffers","review":"Getting rid of the bagage of rejection was brought about with reading Rejection Junkies.Good info and helpful hits how to stay away from rejection."},{"Title":"Learning To Be White -","review":"There is a line from a song in Rogers & Hammerstein's \\"South Pacific\\" that goes: \\"To hate all the people your relatives hate, you've got to be carefully taught.\\" Thandeka's book is about how children are taught racism. It begins with a series of anecdotes about how various children were taught racism; for example, one little boy invited his friends to his birthday party, to the evident consternation of his parents, who let him know in no uncertain terms that inviting black friends into his home was NOT acceptable behavior. He was made to feel that he had done something very wrong.Young children, dependent on their parents for their very survival, are in no position to question the rightness of their parents' teachings, even when they may feel something is wrong. Survival requires them to conclude that the fault is theirs, and they must accept what they are taught and adjust their feelings accordingly.As I read this book, I recognized my parents' failed attempts to teach me to be white. They started too late; I had already decided I did not want to be a racist. I grew up in a town where there were no black families, so it wasn't until I was 16 that I was subjected to an attack from my mother because I had been greatly impressed (and told her parents so) with the intelligence of a girl I had met who, unbeknownst to me, had a slight admixture of \\"Negro\\" ancestry. When the reason behind her attack finally came out, my instant response was to tell my mother that she ought to be ashamed of herself, and that I was ashamed of her for demanding that I act in a dishonorable (i. e. racist) manner, a demand that I would never consider obeying.Read this book. It will help many of you to understand your own life experience, and perhaps to overcome some conditioning you should never have had, and to avoid doing the same harm to your children. For those of you fortunate enough never to have been taught \\"to be white\\" it will help you understand and perhaps help those of your friends and acquaintences who were.This is a book that should be in every school library.watziznaym@gmail.com"},{"Title":"Learning To Be White -","review":"Dr. Thandeka, a Unitarian Universalist scholar, has written the essential recipe for those of us working collectively and individually on becoming more fully human.Clearly and compassionately written, Dr. Thandeka has the capacity to articulate the soul-destroying wounds many &quot;white&quot; people experience during formative years and frequently feel as unidentified losses(our ethnicities and working class values). Everyone, especially in this so-called era of prosperity, will take away not only a deeper historical understanding of race and class intersections,but hopefully the opportunity to redeem important human values we hold in our hearts but, sadly, are not supported in a world where market values dominate. Read it. Share the stories you thought you'd forgotten, and most importantly, share them with your children."},{"Title":"Learning To Be White -","review":"Thandeka releases a part of the &quot;white man's (real) burden&quot; by allowing Euro Americans to see what they have lost in subordinating essential humanity to the American dream. Her copiously footnoted text requires the reader suspend judgement so that she can present her case. When she has finished, she has rewarded the reader with a revealing look at him or herself and the social matrix that encompasses. This is not a long book. But is an important work. She is both concise and eloquent."},{"Title":"Learning To Be White -","review":"I found this book very readable and intellectually stimulating. The author puts forth a novel and plausible thesis regarding the impact of a racist society on the majority race. A great deal has been written about the effects racism has on the minority, but this writer examines its interplay with the psychology of the racist majority. She puts forth interesting and compelling ideas about the psychic danger, for white children, should they identify with the devalued minority. I found her study thought-provoking and engaging."},{"Title":"Learning To Be White -","review":"The pump that I see Thankdeka priming is one of dialogue. I read this book for a paper I wrote for one of my seminary classes. It was/is a provocative read. I do feel however that she could have elaborated more, but I do not see most people reading the dozens of books that she could have produced at one sitting.Thandeka does a wonderful job of weaving together allusions and stories to produce a work that is a quality resource. I think it is a beautiful start to facing our extremities interculturally. In my limited experience I have seen cultures that overlap and work well together, so when broad sweeping generalizations are required to convey I think it becomes time to pay a little more attention to the underdogs in the world. Maybe we can all learn a little humility and acceptance from a book like Thandeka's."},{"Title":"Learning To Be White -","review":"I have only recently started looking at White Priveledge and racism in a very new light. Most white people, including myself, have a true blind spot about our assumptions about people of color as well as about being white. This bookLearning to Be White: Money, Race, and God in America, which I am still reading, opened my eyes to how we, at a very young age, start learning to recognize difference between races from our caretakers.Thandeka writes about childhood incidents which are only too common, such as, parents making it clear that a new friend of color is not a welcome friend and not welcome in the home, a new boyfriend of color, also not approved of or welcome. As children we accept thi s, as we depend on our caretakers (parents) for love and a place of belonging.There is much that white people take for granted that is ours simply because we are white. As Thandeka states it, we, as white people are \\"in the driver's seat.\\"Thandeka also writes about the difficult assimilation of immigrants to the United States and how these people have been taught to become racist by the white people with power. A very difficult read at times, not a \\"fun book,\\" but very eye-opening. A book I recommend reading to illuminate those blind spots about race."},{"Title":"Learning To Be White -","review":"I found Thandeka's practically written book a breath of fresh air amidst the glut of overtheorized and overwritten studies of whiteness and racial construction in American society. I dare all white critics of the text to find the courage to play Thandeka's \\"Race Game\\" and look honestly at themselves as persons of color, with all the pain that this entails, as Learning to be White carefully explores."},{"Title":"Learning To Be White -","review":"This was a great, hard hitting book. It is about time America started discussing &quot;WHITE&quot; people and how they become white. The issues that are raised in this book apply to the majority of the white people in the USA. I would have to disagree with one reader who claims that other racial and ethnic minorites experience the same amount of shame and rejection as whites when it comes to interacial friendships because that is not true. I wonder what was the color of those who wrote negative reviews of this book? Did they go out and play the race game? This book is a break through for white identity! This book will be around for decades to come because it is already making its mark within the university."},{"Title":"Learning To Be White -","review":"I regret having to write a criticism of a fellow Unitarian's efforts on an all too important subject. The title of &quot;Learning to be White...&quot; leads one to believe that the issue discussed is, indeed, racism. When, in fact, Thandeka does little more than use race and racial references describing the human tendency to hang out with the &quot;tribe&quot;. Whether the subjects of her study are white, black, hispanic, or other tribal thinking people, the issues of moving outside one's own social group are the same. Black kids bringing home white friends suffer the same shame and threat of abandonment that white kids do. Jewish, Catholic, Italian, Christian; every group who thinks that they have a lock on the good and right life feels threatened by outside strange influences."},{"Title":"Learning To Be White -","review":"Having read this volume twice, I conclude that the author has joined a series of book reports together and ignored primary sources. Having concluded that, the next observation would be that she started with her conclusion and wrote backward. Shame to the writer for such an abuse of scholarship."},{"Title":"Learning To Be White -","review":"The thesis. The problem that the majority of Americans face is that working white Americans (i.e. the proletariat) have not shaken their false consciousness, made common cause with blacks of their class to throw off the white capitalist oppressors. If they do, then we can achieve a worker's paradise. Oh, and parents that don't see it this way are engaging in child abuse (and presumably need re-education).It is too bad that trees were sacrificed for such intellectually incoherent, obviously wrong, marxist nonsense."},{"Title":"Secrets & Lies: My Journey to Enlightenment","review":"I have been a Christian for most of my life and I am not familiar with the authors encounters. I know that many people dismiss the strange tales that come from stories like this as being something from the imagination. I am familiar with the truth that is in Christ and this book has opened my eyes to the truth that is in the spirit world also. Buy it then give it to a friend."},{"Title":"Secrets & Lies: My Journey to Enlightenment","review":"Even though I am not a Christian I was interested in what kind of experiences brought the author who had explored all sorts of New Age spiritualities to convert to Conservative Christianity. Unfortunately the book is not that well written which is the main reason for the three stars. Unfortunately, he was not able to bring out the characters in his story including himself very well.But back to his story. I am a pagan and I guess my spirituality differs a great deal from the New Age because I have had none of those experiences he had. They were very toxic and I am glad that he found an established religion that does not encourage you to have power over others. It seems that he wanted to have mastery or power from his New Age quest. Most people I know who seek a spiritual path want union with the divine, peace, and the knowing of love. But he wanted all knowledge and to essentially be a god. It was a very poisonous experience and I hope the readers of this book recognize what he was after.Thankfully, he found a religion that is pretty much the opposite. Christianity teaches humility and reverence for God. I don't understand why he chose Conservative Christianity with its odd opinions about evolution and other issues as opposed to Catholism, or some more liberal sort of Christianity but he did find a path that was true for him. I hope he realizes that it is not for everyone."},{"Title":"Secrets & Lies: My Journey to Enlightenment","review":"Could not put the book down. Loved the writing style.... very compelling. A must for the spiritual seeker.... Dr. Phillips reveals the &quot;other side&quot; to paranormal spirituality."},{"Title":"Secrets & Lies: My Journey to Enlightenment","review":"This book was definately one of the most enjoyable true stories either my husband and I have every read. It was both informative and entertaining. Once you get started it's hard to put down. The detail the author uses to describe his journey to enlightenment is incredible! Once he uncovers the truth, you rejoice with him because you fully understand the struggle. This is a must read for anyone seeking the truth. It is possible to learn from the mistakes of others."},{"Title":"Secrets & Lies: My Journey to Enlightenment","review":"I read this book knowing that the author converts to Christianity at the end but I was interested in his New Age experiences. His experiences were mainly that he sought power. He did not seek to grow spiritually in order to become closer to the divine but to gain power.As a pagan, I thought I would get insights into someone who had a bad experience with the occult but he was seeking a different goal than most people I know.Unfortunately, I did not feel he described his characters well, including himself. Maybe until he grew up, he was a shallow as he depicted himself, but I find that hard to believe. His best fleshed out character was his wife, who was a Wiccan.The book was very tolerant and described the other religions well but just not well written."},{"Title":"Secrets & Lies: My Journey to Enlightenment","review":"Because I've met the man, logic dictated to me that it ended with his conversion to Christ. But he kept me guessing. I could relate to a lot of what he shared. He opened my eyes to a lot about mysticism that I didn't know.

I would definitely read any other books he writes."},{"Title":"Secrets & Lies: My Journey to Enlightenment","review":"I could not put this book down! This story gets to the meat of today's culture where so many people are seeking to find the truth through the New Age movement, etc. This book shows that the only true truth is the Word of God.

You will read it to the end!"},{"Title":"Secrets & Lies: My Journey to Enlightenment","review":"Secrets and Lies is an intrigueing story you will not be able to put down. The author experienced nearly every possible mystic new-age method to try to fill his soul with the truth of his existence. It has a wonderful ending because the Truth found him!The book gives the reader a sensitivity for those lost in the world, who are headed down dangerous paths in their sincere quest for what life is all about. You will learn much about New Age principles and why it is so destructive and why it is all lies. Mark Phillips writes with a true passion to tell his story and most importantly, to share with the reader what the Truth really is."},{"Title":"Secrets & Lies: My Journey to Enlightenment","review":"Let me explain how this works (in Secret Societies). If the writer calls the book 'Secrets and Lies' then you have been told that the book is a book containing secrets and lies. This absolves the writer of his responsibilty to tell the truth (You have been secretly informed). This book is a blatant attack on all things not-Christian in the same manner as the murderous Crusades and the horrendous (Christian) Spanish Inquisition!Why doesn't this author come right out and say that if you do not believe in his god that you will be destroyed (just like Hitler murdered the Jews)? Because he does! This is done in a more clever way through secrets and lies and disguising the genocide as a holy act. The persecution of all religions (or beliefs) non-Christian is a hostile act upon humanity and this book attempts to persuade the reader that this same old lie (that everything non-Christian is Evil and invented as a distraction from the 'truth' by Satan) was some discovery made by investigating all possible 'other' beliefs. This book disgusted me and I would not reccommend it. I don't believe anything this writer has written."},{"Title":"Golden Fox","review":"It's also the least of the series-- all others I've read warrant at least 4 stars, and some 5. &quot;The Courtneys of Africa&quot; series is as follows: Birds of Prey, Monsoon, Blue Horizon, When The Lion Feeds, A Sound of Thunder, A Sparrow Falls, The Burning Shore, Power of the Sword, Rage, A Time to Die-- and THEN Golden Fox. So you'd be unwise to start here; I'd even say you could dispense with it altogether, as it's a weak ending to the story. But it ties up some loose ends of the 20th century version of the clan-- Centaine, born with the century, and her son Shasa, and his four children, Sean, Garry, Isabella, and Michael. The story runs from 1969 to the late 70s, and is rife with minor anachronisms-- Smith wrote this in the early nineties and forgot that kids didn't have videos to pop in and watch back then, etc. The plot is turgid romance and espionage, and the weakest book I've found from Smith-- start anywhere else but here. &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; is a solid adventure story, and will serve as an entree to the Courtneys, if you've a mind to get to know them...."},{"Title":"Golden Fox","review":"I agree with many of the comments already made. This is an exciting, readable book but the central premise is flawed. Given how close Bella is to her family and how unrebellious she appears, it seemed totally out of character for her to betray her country and family in this way. Also I found the rescue far-fetched. Smith has written many better books (personally I prefer his non-Courtney books anyway) but I think if you like action and family drama this will still prove difficult to put down."},{"Title":"Golden Fox","review":"This book is nothing like Wilburth Smith.The story has no secuence with his previous work on the Courtney series.Compared with the masterly way in wich Smith weaves history and fiction in the Power of the Sword (giving a clear picture of South Africa during WW2 and the Apartheid}, or the narrative power of Burning Shore this books is a complete nothingness.So don't judge Smith by this, his least fortunate book."},{"Title":"Golden Fox","review":"I really like all the Wilbur smiths books i have read except the 7th scroll. And even that was much more readable than this. Wilbur Smith writes yarns so I am not looking for a plausible storyline but this just reeks of a childish romance novel. the first 100-150 pages of this novel are so unremarkable that I had completely forgoten I had read this book before untl the entrance of the inimitable character of Centaine. Sasha just seems a shadow of his former self. As someone who likes this author(River God, Warlock, Monsoon, Birds of Prey, The Delta Decision, Rage are all incredible books), I would like to advise new readers, please dont form opinions based on this. Everyone is entitiled to a bad book."},{"Title":"Golden Fox","review":"I am a huge Wilbur Smith fan. &quot;River God&quot; is the best novel I have ever read. My second favorite Smith book is his newest: &quot;Monsoon&quot;, then &quot;Men of Men&quot;, then &quot;The Sunbird&quot;, then &quot;Golden Fox&quot;. This is part of the Courtney series. If you have read all the Wilbur Smith books like I have, you'll yearn for more, but it takes him years to come up with a new book these days. You might look at &quot;Churchill's Gold&quot; by James Follett after you have read all of Mr. Smith's books. It is very similar in style and quality to &quot;Golden Fox&quot;."},{"Title":"Golden Fox","review":"After enjoying the saga of the Courtneys, I found Golden Fox to be entirely out of character. It had all the appeal, and sadly the dialogue and story line of a poor romance novel. Frankly I couldn't finish it, preferring to leave the Courtneys as they were after A Time To Die. An extremely poor finish to a good series."},{"Title":"Golden Fox","review":"A KGB officer, born in Spain but educated in Cuba, sets up a South African woman to become her spy against her will.

Centaine Courtney, the matriach of the family is simply hateful, Shasa her son, one dimensional, Bella just a spoiled little tart, and the hero Sean Courtney as nasty as his opponent Ramon.

A must read for wilbur smith fans."},{"Title":"Golden Fox","review":"I have read through this book of the Courtneys of Africa series wondering just how low these despicable characters could go and surely this book is where they bottom out... I hope. Smith's yarns are spun in ways that make them difficult to put down for the excitement, predictable as it is, but after a while you start looking for something beyond his penchant for describing them in terms of sexual exploits (each and all like something right out of a porn masterpiece: those \\"books, movies, and other people's\\" lives kind of experiences); making shady, self-centered business dealings no matter who becomes flattened roadkill in the process; and carrying the whole thing on the back of the most despicable character of the bunch (Centaine the Ruthless), always lurking in the background eying her own family no differently than she would any potential competitor in terms of how manipulative she is willing to be to affect their activities.If only I didn't think Smith truly liked these people, in the manner Tom Clancy fancies himself the real Jack Ryan. There is just no counterpoint to convince me he isn't enthralled with them. For example, his treatment of racism isn't much different that a mud-puddle-deep person proclaiming some of his or her best friends are black, gay, Jewish, Martians, or whathaveyou.Oh, yes, the low point? The liberal, gay Courtney, now out of the closet, and sleeping with under-age black boys while pretending to be their friend and savior! Unfortunately, we cannot buy first-class tickets for the lot of them to sail on the Titanic. So far, each chronological book in the series has been somewhat less than its predecessor (not a great sign since I have the next three in queue).

After reading one book I went back to the beginning of this series and read the entire series. Since I began reading him, I have read all of his books in his series which has been 20 so far. He is a writer that has a story line that keeps you coming back for more and more. His characters are realistic and his descriptions and plots are well written and intriguing.

Korn's published novels, deviates slightly from the unabashed horror of his previous works to offer a homely, and at times even poignant, view of the feckless, lower middle class women who populate the countryside around Korn's hometown of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. To all appearances, they are trailer-dwelling, soap-opera-watching mediocrities who play-act the rituals of witchcraft chiefly to frighten unfriendly neighbors and schoolyard bullies. The protagonist, Keith Ogden, a student of paranormalism, is drawn into their group but has virtually dismissed them as pitiful misfits, crotchety yet harmless. Will he find out otherwise?Readers not familiar with the local color of Southeast Louisiana will chuckle at the various ailments and folk remedies catalogued in this book, ascribed to an obscure Creole monograph compiled in 1915. While the remedies are not authentic, they capture the spirit of \\"les traiteurs,\\" the traditional folk-medicine healers of Cajun Louisiana. They are the credible weapons of aspiring witches.Because of the copious details about Ms. Sally's family life (one of the leaders of the coven), Swamp Witch Piquante seems to move a bit slower than some of Korn's other works, such as \\"Confessions of a Ghoul\\" or \\"Rachmaninoff's Ghost.\\" However, this does not greatly detract from the main pulse of the story and actually fuels the paradox that at some level, even Ms. Sally is an endearing person. The brief descriptions of Miss Eileen's secret altar and unauthorized ritual are especially vivid and convincing.Recommended for devotees of the horror genre and readers drawn to eccentric local color."},{"Title":"Swamp Witch Piquante and Scream Queen Bisque (Over a Bed of Rice)","review":"-----Information about author (not part of review):-------------------------------------About MF Korn, author of twelve novels and 240 stories published:Three of MF Korn's books, CONFESSIONS OF A GHOUL AND OTHER STORIES, and ALIENS, MINIBIKES AND OTHER STAPLES OF SUBURBIA, and also SKIMMING THE GUMBO NUCLEAR were mentioned in The Year's Best Fantasy & Horror: Fifteenth Annual Collection. CONFESSIONS OF A GHOUL AND OTHER STORIES was mentioned in The Mammoth Book Of Best New Horror edited by Stephen Jones. RACHMANINOFF'S GHOST was also mentioned in The Mammoth Book Of Best New Horror edited the following year.---------------------------------------------(Here is review below)Be Careful D'awlin, Or You Might Get Yaself Stuck in the Nint Level a Hellby Tony Fonseca02/08/2005Korn, M. F. Swamp Witch Piquante and Scream Queen Bisque (Over a Bed of Rice). Silver Lake Publishing, 2004. 192 p.Mais even Boudreaux and Thibodeaux know dat's is' bad luck to sit cross-legged in a funeral home, or dat if you drop a egg, and is' rotten, dat means you husband's runnin' round behind you back, or dat if you find a nickel under the kitchen table, it means that company comin'. Bet dey even know dat if de moon got a ring around it on you birtday, that mean you gonna get married that year.Dese kind-a supa-stitions-er, I mean these kinds of superstitions-and the belief in witchcraft, is what informs the first of two early novellas by M. F. Korn, collected under the title Swamp Witch Piquante and Scream Queen Bisque. Though hardly horrific in the strictest sense of the word, \\"The White Trash Witch's Coven\\" and \\"Pavane for a Scream Queen\\" (the word \\"pavane\\" refers to the music that would accompany a stately 16th Century dance) manage to be delightful in parts, and just plain fun overall.For those of you that follow this e-zine regularly, the previous assessment might have come as a shock. After all, various Necropsy reviewers have tackled this Baton Rouge native's genre prose in the past, usually finding it lacking, and sometimes unreadable. And after actually enjoying-without equivocation-these two novellas, I think I see why: Korn seems most at home when he is writing regional fiction, especially when he has fun with his characters, creating recognizable faces for those who are familiar with an area and its inhabitants. The problem is he doesn't do this often enough.\\"The White Trash Witch's Coven,\\" by far my favorite Korn fiction to date, is full of 'Yat dialogue (a 'Yat is a person native to certain suburbs of N'awlins, and is usually known for a heavy accent and the use of the greeting \\"where y'at?\\") and down home white and black magic. It's also one of those Night Gallery type pieces where dramatic irony plays a huge role, as readers realize the downfall of the main character well before he even begins to suspect that something is amiss. In it, a curious, bored and slightly ill college drop-out named Keith Ogden meets a strange woman in a Super-Usav-Mart (Korn sometimes is over-the-top with his naming), and she recommends a home remedy for his cough, claiming to be a witch and a member of a local coven. This \\"coven\\" is made up mainly of trashy country types who live in the Baton Rouge suburb of Dunham Springs (there is actually a Denham Springs located just outside of Baton Rouge). She invites him to join the coven, and of course he accepts almost without question, out of curiosity, but mainly out of ennui. He soon discovers that the coven is composed mainly of chatty-and very catty-middle-aged women, who discuss soap operas as much as they do black magic. To make matters worse, Keith has stumbled along at a time when there is a petty power struggle within the coven. Unbeknownst to him, however, his presence will alleviate these tensions, but at a cost.Though not nearly as well-written or fun, the second novella, \\"Pavane for a Scream Queen,\\" is also one of Korn's better products. It lacks the snappy dialogue of \\"The White Trash Witch's Coven,\\" but it reads well, despite the author's tendency towards solipsism. Jeff Vincent, a budding novelist and freelance writer for Filmland Magazine, manages to land an important interview with ex cult movie starlet Aurora Sterling, a scream queen of classic 1950's B-flicks. Vincent, an interview specialist, chomps at the bit for this assignment, for he has somewhat of a fetishistic interest in the aging actress. Like the first tale of this collection, \\"Pavane\\" has a surprise ending, and again it is one that the reader sees coming well before the protagonist. But while \\"White Trash Witch's Coven\\" ends tragically for Keith, \\"Pavane\\" is a different kind of story, an homage if you will, and as such it has no need of a dark ending for Jeff.Korn is one of those writers that you just find yourself rooting for. He seems to have good ideas, but not always the discipline and the vision to create whole fictional worlds in a readable style. Perhaps this is because pure horror, that is the kind of horror that intends to instill fear or loathing in the reader, is not his forte. I've always most enjoyed his short pieces where he eschews the idea of unabashed horror and opts for poignancy and tongue-in-cheek humor, albeit it dark and oftentimes degenerate. These two novellas may not appeal entirely to devotees of the Lovecraftian vein of horror. However, those who enjoy eccentricity and local color in a dark tale will find quite a bit to like in this collection.And who knows, maybe ya'll'll learn some y'at-isms while passin' a good time readin'."},{"Title":"Salient Points Two: Cameos of the Western Front Ypres Sector 1914-1918 (v. 2)","review":"This series of books are well written, filled with little known stories of actions and the men involved that you don't read about very often. Many unique photos taken in WWI coupled with current pictures blend into an excellent collection. If you are interested in the smaller military actions during this period, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Early man,","review":"Early Man is a great book to inspire children about paleoanthropology and the evolution of humans. Some of the information is outdated, and there have been many new discoveries since the book was published, but much of the information is still correct. For my 6 1/2 year old, it is a favorite to look through. It has really fueled his imagination."},{"Title":"Early man,","review":"Early Man describes the history of hominoid fossil finds along with photographs and drawings as well as art images of the living appearances of the fossil primates. The photograph on page 17 shows a Neanderthal skullcap. The skull drawings on the right side margin of page 33 show the changing forms of the primates Plesiadapis (60-55 million years ago), Smilodectes (50-45 million years ago), Aegyptopithecus (30-28 million years ago), Pliopithecus (23-12 million years ago), and Proconsul (20-10 million years ago), showing the trend as time went on toward the shortening of the jaws and the increasing size of the cranium. The tooth drawings on the right side margin of page 35 show the four cusps of the baboon and the five cusps of the chimpanzee in what is known as a \\"Y-5\\" pattern that only apes and humans have. Pages 41-45 (with pages 41-43 as an attached fold-out) feature drawings of and the time ranges for Pliopithecus, Proconsul, Dryopithecus, Oreopithecus, Ramapithecus, Australopithecus africanus, Australopithecus robustus, advanced Austalopithecus, Homo erectus, early Homo sapiens, Solo Man, Rhodesian Man, Neanderthal Man, Cro-Magnon Man, and Modern Man. The drawings on the right side margin of page 51 contrast the pelvises of man and Australopithecus, both of which have short, broad blades and significant flanges, with the pelvis of the gorilla, which has long blades. Page 57 features a portrait drawing of Australopithecus robustus having thick brow ridges, a flattened gorilla-type nose, and projecting large jaws. The skull drawings on the bottom margin of page 81 show the inverse relationship between jaw size and brain size for the chimpanzee, Homo erectus, and man. Pages 90-99 feature art images of a Homo erectus group involved in hunting along with photographs of fossil finds. Chapter 5 -- The Tools Of Stone Age Man (pages 100-121) features drawings and photographs of various fossil tools. There are a few perception errors that show the different views in the past; Ramapithecus is now viewed as Sivapithecus sivalensis, which was a small species of Sivapithecus; the fight scene between two Australopithecus africanus males and an Australopithecus robustus group on pages 74-75 may not have actually happened in the past as Australopithecus africanus is now viewed as having lived 3-2.5 million years ago, while Australopithecus robustus lived later at 2-1.3 million years ago; Neanderthal Man is now viewed as a separate evolutionary line that was not ancestral to modern humans. The book, though, remains an important achievement in describing the history of hominoid fossil finds and showing prehistoric primate life."},{"Title":"Elizabeth, Captive Princess","review":"I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Elizabeth I. Although it is written in a storybook fashion with the characters &quot;speaking&quot; to one another, it is factually accurate and puts you in the center of the action. I think the author has done a marvellous job of interweaving actual historical facts with her character's dialog and actions. Its' writing style makes the characters seem vividly real and gets the reader emotionally involved. As a schoolboy in England, I had studied text books about Elizabeth, but this book gave me a whole new level of respect for someone who I had already held in high esteem. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Elizabeth, Captive Princess","review":"this is a fabulous book. it is a fictional story of the relationship betweenprincess elizabeth and queen mary. they were half sisters and their relationshipwas extremely complicated. they seemed to have a cat/mouse...love(?)/hate...up/down history with eachother. i think few of us would want to trade places witheither of these women! the dialog is exactly how i believe they would havespoke to eachother. the author has written a classic. this is very enjoyablefor fans of elizabeth.***as a side note,there is no \\"described\\" terror/gore in this book,only that,\\"so and so was executed\\" and it is left to the imagination.***"},{"Title":"Elizabeth, Captive Princess","review":"King Henry VIII is dead. King Edward is lying in his bed about to die as well. Who will reign next? It was thought that Lady Jane Grey would but she has been executed. Now, it is between Mary and Elizabeth. Elizabeth knows she will be a better Queen than Mary. Unfortunately because Mary is the older of the two, it makes sense that Mary would be the next Queen. Of course, Mary does becomes Queen. Though not a lot of people are happy about it. There is a plot to get Mary out of the throne. Mary is stubborn and won't give up the throne easily. Elizabeth is conniving and is trying to find a way to overthrow Mary. Will she succeed?Elizabeth, Captive Princess is book two in the Elizabeth I trilogy. I read the first book, Young Bess because I was interested in getting to know Elizabeth better. A lot of the books about the Tudors is about King Henry VIII, his wife Anne, his daughter Mary and his son, Edward but there are not a lot of books about Elizabeth. I think she is overlooked. She is very intelligent and knows what her goals are and hold to achieve them. On the flip side, while I am liking this trilogy, I found this book to be a bit slow. I didn't find the characters that interesting and at times the story moved really slowly. Though, there were some hit and misses with this book for me; I still can't wait to finish this trilogy. Elizabeth, Captive Princess is a book fit for a Princess or Queen."},{"Title":"The Bridal Canopy","review":"This is one of the most famous Agnon's novels and one that is typical of his style, which has many layers of hidden meaning.

The package weighs twelve pounds and will hardly fit any bookcase. The inside has recesses for the two books and one booklet. Black silk tape allows for easy access of the contents.TWO: A large, beautifully designed and printed, 240 page book of Marilyn photos printed on thick paper. Although the printing screen is not the highest (150 dpi) the photos leap off the page, especially the full-page color ones. Many of these photos seem to be very private shots of Marilyn that De Dienes took during her career (a few show her with other people, a hairdresser and bookseller). Several at the back of the book show Marilyn's face montaged into clouds or surrounded by celestial bodies. Between the photos, printed in silver ink and in a large typewriter font, there are excepts from De Dienes memoirs. Also printed in silver are smaller photos with his hand-written captions.THREE: A booklet with twenty-four, one to a page, magazine covers featuring De Dienes photos of Marilyn. Seventeen of them are European titles. Predictably, great photos are weakened by logos, cover lines and generally poor cropping. I thought this booklet was rather disappointing in its production.FOUR: The 608 page facsimile of De Dienes manuscript and composite book. I think this is the most fascinating item in the box because of the production problems. The original pages were typed on one side of a sheet of ordinary paper and this facsimile is on similar weight stock so that the back of each page has some text showing through, as the original (There is a production problem here though, the paper rightly has text show-through but the photos do as well, on the original paper only the white back of the photo would have been visible). Although the manuscript was in black and white it has been printed in four colors to create the aged paper look and the few handwritten numbers in green and red that De Dienes wrote on the photos. You can see all of his corrections and deletions to the manuscript and read the comments he wrote about the various contact prints of Marilyn and other printed ephemera he stuck on back of each page.The original composite section has a hundred pages (it becomes two-hundred pages in this facsimile) of cut-out contact prints which De Dienes stuck on the typewriter paper, again they are reproduced in four-color black because of the occasional handwritten colored numbers, even the image of the punched file holes on each page is reproduced. Hundreds of these contacts show how he photographed Marilyn and you can see how dozens of shots were taken of which only one or two were probably published. Most of these images have never been seen before and certainly never in the form that they are presented here.Overall I think the Marilyn Box is an amazing production package. A world famous visual icon is presented in a unique way.*** FOR A LOOK INSIDE click customer images under the contents photo."},{"Title":"Marilyn","review":"For the Marilyn fan, this is a great book. The photographs reproduced in the large book are magnificent. The large book is difficult to read with silver ink on white paper, but it is cleaned up excerpts from the smaller facsimile typed recollections of De Dienes. It is heavy, thus a sturdy coffee table is required."},{"Title":"Marilyn","review":"When I opened this box on Christmas morning, I felt like the luckiest girl in the world. A recent convert to Marilyn-ism, this was one of the first books about her I owned, and I'm so glad, because I think it's important to know Norma Jeane before you know Marilyn. These huge, glorious photographs taken by Andre de Dienes capture her innocence and natural beauty at a time when she was an unknown model. De Dienes' memoirs are touching and reveal Norma Jeane as she was to him, a man who fell in love with her, as so many would in the future. After paging through these books, you are left to feel as though Norma Jeane Dougherty would never look quite as beautiful again (and of course she would, but not in the same way). Revealing Marilyn Monroe at her earliest beginnings, this limited edition package is definitely worth the money."},{"Title":"Marilyn","review":"This book by Andre de Dienes is the most amazing title ever assembled on Marilyn Monore.

(You should really get a ruler so you get the full effect of how large it is)The large book is fantastic. It has some of the most beautiful pictures of Norma Jeane that you will ever see. (I especially adore the ones where she's makeup free) The youthfulness and charm she exudes in these photos really give you a feeling of genuine happiness which can be hard to find in her later years. Not only are the photos top shelf but Andre's writings give insight to not just his & Marilyn's lives but also to the era. The book itself is also well bound and put together, with an imprint on the first page saying the book number (Mine is 5001/20000) & the place/ time it was created. Truly wonderful.The second book is just as amazing. It's essentially Andre's journal from the time he met Norma Jeane- on. It's fascinating to read the stories of how they met and the impact that they had in each others lives. There are also many great pictures and hand written notes that give a rare glimpse into her life before she was the blonde bombshell we all came to love. The book is also very thick. (600+ pages) The slight downside of this book is the thinness of the pages. You can see through some of them, but never bad enough to make it unreadable.The last is a magazine with the 25 or so covers that Marilyn has graced. It's still very beautiful but as you will find a bit of a throw away after looking at the other two books.And who could forget the box! It might be my favorite thing strangely enough. The recreation of Andre's very own Kodak photo box is a really cool & unique piece. A work of art in its own right.Long story short this is a really amazing box set. You should snatch one up when the right opportunity arises.The only issue for me was the price.... Being in college & on a tight budget it was hard for me to splurge for a book.... Even if it is on a world icon like Marilyn Monroe. After finding it cheaper on a rival site (Sorry Amazon!) I gave in.This book is pretty amazing but don't break your bank to get it. Because of the rareness of it they typically go for $400-up, but I would hold out. $200 was my limit to spend on a book & after looking around I found one in great condition for even cheaper! So if you're interested my advice would be to shop around first. :)Still, it's a perfect treat for any Monroe fan.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! :))"},{"Title":"BATTLEFIELDS AND PLAYGROUNDS (HB)","review":"Battlefields and Playgrounds is the last word on humanity's darkest hour. A masterpiece of modern fiction, this novel is more than a novel, more than a chronicle, a memoir, a tribute to victims of persecution, holocaust and genocide. It is a celebration of life in all its glory and vulnerability, a portrait of childhood, human suffering and divine redemption. The exquisite prose, even in English translation is like a latter-day Gray's Elegy, sounding the curfew of Europe's vastest graveyard, with angels' trumpets echoing in the shadow of Death, heralding a last chance for humanity. This book restored my faith in literature, humanity and God. An unmitigated triumph of modern writing. Janos Nyiri's authorial voice rings true in a world ravaged by cruelty, bitterness and injustice. His genius lies in recording the greatest agony and evil, while reaffirming beauty, humor and innocence at the same time. By this life-affirming masterpiece, the author of Battlefields and Playgrounds restores Love, Beauty and Hope as only a child-survivor of the Holocaust can. Battlefields and Playgrounds should be required reading in every home, school, government and religion. An unforgettable book."},{"Title":"BATTLEFIELDS AND PLAYGROUNDS (HB)","review":"Fast, entertaining read. Focused entirely on a young boy and his family. More a narrative than a fact filled historical fiction but worth reading. Seeing WWII through the sometimes limited, sometimes seeing larger than life, view of a 8-12 year old child is interesting. Characters are fascinating, realistic and far from perfect. Jozsef fluctuates between innate maturity and the ability to see clearly through situations and adults to childish desire and emotions in a dangerous and desperate time. All facets of people during war are demonstrated here- the villains, saviors and the apathetic. Jozsef's many friends and teachers are hysterical but you sometimes flinch at Jozsef's cruelty."},{"Title":"BATTLEFIELDS AND PLAYGROUNDS (HB)","review":"The self-indulgent, narcisistic nature of the protagonist is the undisguised and tragic ego of the writer laid bare, both pathetic and heroic, in this brilliant if flawed Hungarian novel. An at times gripping, and always informative work, which rightly earned its place in PW's Best Fiction of 1995. An uneven masterpiece which would most probably benefit from a more literate and professional English translation. Nonetheless, the author's distinctively Hungarian, tragicomic voice is still audible despite a rather cumbersome and precious English rendition."},{"Title":"Abigail","review":"The story of the doll, ABIGAIL, is set in 1835 and tells of the Calvin family moving in a covered wagon - - from Kentucky to Indiana's hill country: Bean Blossom! (That destination helped them feel more 'at home' than adjusting to a new life as flatlanders.) Portia Sperry loved the rolling countryside. She and co-author Lois Donaldson researched the long-ago times seriously and drew an honest picture of life in the 1830s. Zabeth Selover's colorful illustrations in the original edition have an unusual folk charm, enhancing the story. The authors include an Indian tale, the requisite encounter with a bear, and square dancing at a housewarming - - with \\"Abigail\\" being the most important ingredient to this mix.I'd like to think there may be a future author who recalls the times around 2005 and builds a story around another young girl. Gwenyth Swain, who grew up in Brown County's Wallow Hollow, wrote about \\"CHIG\\" (isbn: 0440419204) & the Depression years in Brown county which was the era when the Sperry family struggled and \\"invented\\" Abigail to help with their survival.It is disappointing to not read any review from the author's family, or reviews by the many who listened to the story of the sweet little doll & then begged to have their own! The reason may be that the reviews written for the 1938 edition of \\"Abigail\\" were not transferred with the 2000 edition published by the Indiana Historical Society. \\"Abigail\\" IS STILL AVAILABLE IN ITS INDIANA HISTORICAL SOCIETY edition.Portia Sperry is remembered with admiration & affection in Nashville and Brown County. Reviewer mcHAIKU recalls many happy times with Emily Sperry Eads (that's her poem in chapter #16)! Having their friendship makes Abigail's story and the family's courage & perseverance even more special to read about."},{"Title":"Jesus the Son of man: His words and His deeds as told and recorded by those who knew Him","review":"Great book and I Love it?
