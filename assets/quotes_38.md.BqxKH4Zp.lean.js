I have read it so many times that the cover is falling off and the spine is incredibly damaged. Basically, Pride and Prejudice focuses on Elizabeth Bennet, a young and independent woman whose mother is trying to marry off her and her sisters to the highest bidder. They have several suitors, including Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Wickham. At first glance, Pride and Prejudice seems just like a regular Regency romance (making you wonder why it is such a widely acclaimed book); however, it is much more than that.In Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen offers social commentary on a wide range of subjects, including corruption of the Church, marriage, and women's rights. In addition, each time I read it, I realize more and more that not only is Jane Austen a genius, but she also has a great sense of humor (this can been seen through Mr. Collins, the wordy church leader, Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth's social-climbing mother, and many of the other characters). Several of the minor characters are used as stereotypes in order to get Austen's point across (for example, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, one of the snobbiest rich women in all of literature, and Lydia, Elizabeth's flighty youngest sister).Even if you don't care about Jane Austen's views on the society of her time, Pride and Prejudice still offers a lot. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy have perfect chemistry, as do Jane and Mr. Bingley. Elizabeth is way ahead of her time--no women of her stature were expected to be picky about who they married, but Elizabeth is not willing to settle for anything but the best. Then of course, there's the idea that you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them and that you shouldn't let your pride get in the way of your opinions about others (hence the name Pride and Prejudice).This book is great for everyone-it contains romance, comedy, and even politics of Austen's time. Although the language might be hard to understand at first, it's definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It is almost 200 years since \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was first published. It ought to be the equivalent in literature of those faded, dried flowers that used to be found pressed between the pages of the old family bible. Instead it is redolent of freshly cut flowers still carrying a sprinkling of morning dew.The freshness and the perfection of form are certainly astonishing. Jane Austin is as good as story teller as ever picked up a pen, knowing exactly how to construct plots, and what incidents and dialogues to detail in full and what to briefly summarize. Her \\"world\\" is small but intricately constructed. Every characteristic, quality and idea has a precise and fixed value, all being ranked strictly and sternly according to decorum, logic and morality.Despite its architectural perfection, however, a recent re-reading reveals one or two construction features that are questionable. How could it be, for example that Fitzwilliam Darcy could have such a dragon for an aunt? I also wonder about the friendship between Darcy and Bingley. How did it begin? It is obviously important to each, but we are given nothing of its history.Jane Austen lived long enough to see this book published and enjoyed amongst her own family and a small readership. Her mother entertained family members with it, reading it, in Jane Austen's estimation, a little too quickly. Distinguished British actress Lindsay Duncan reads it with perfect timing and inflexion in this highly recommended audio tape format, which presents the novel in an unabridged version of just over twelve hours."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is the best book I have ever read.

I highly reccomend it!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"If you like this kind of story...Pride and Prejudice is the best relationship story I have ever read. There have been many off-springs, sequels, movies etc. in the tradition of P&amp;P. Jane Austen is the master of interpersonal relationships and her tales take us back to a gentle era where things not being equal, women have to make the most of whatever situation they are born into. Austen introduces us to Elizabeth Bennett, a strong woman who is a devoted sister and daughter and very honest with her heart. She has become one of my favorite heroines in Literature not only because of her heart, but also for her ability to grow. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this book was watching as the main characters are transformed throughout the telling. Mr. Darcy, who is perhaps one of the more idealized men in fiction, recognizes his weaknesses through Elizabeth and she in turn learns from him.The cast of characters are some of Austen's most unforgettable. Mr. Collins the dim-witted cousin who thinks he is quite a pious man and a good catch for any women. The annoyingly cheeky Lydia, Mrs. Bennett the nagging mother with not much upstairs, but good intentions none the less, and many more. They all held my interest throughout the book and left me wanting more of them. I highly recommend this book to be read and re-read many times. You will see how great characters are developed and a great relationship is formed."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride And Prejudice, two of the worst things in our society (since like...forever). Elizabeth Bennet is a strong, fiesty, witty and attractive young woman who, with her five sisters and onlooking snobbish mother, finds her unexpected true love. At their first meeting, Mr. Darcy, a very wealthy very arrogant young man, shuns Elizabeth unintentially. But later, he begins to admire her and her frankness to him. With all the family difficulties (very humorous) and getting over Elizabeth's prjudice and Darcy's pride, will Elizabeth and Darcy ever stop fighting long enough to realize that their in love?"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I found that this novel is one of the best I have ever read. When I was young, I read Nancy Drew, Perry Mason, and Agatha Christie novels like food. I found the titles of such classics as Pride and Predjudice, One Flew over the cuckoos nest, The Great Gatsby, Death of a Saleman, and Wuthering Heights, to be pretentious; and if they didn't have murder and suspense, I didn't bother opening the cover. But one day while watching A&amp;E, I saw a glimpse of the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice, and I was hooked. I was amazed that a book written way before my time could be of any worth. After watching the movie, I picked up the book, and read it from cover to cover. I found that Mr. Darcy and Ms. Bennett were intriguing characters, and I was utterly surprised when Mr. Darcy confessed his &quot;ardent love&quot; for her, also when he wrote the long letter of rebuttal to her claims to his bad character. At first, you despise Mr. Darcy, but as the book progresses, you find yourself liking him more and more. This whole book was very well-written and interesting, and now ranks with my favorite novels of all time, along with the classics listed above. For those who don't see how special and unique this book is, I suggest that you watch the video (starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth), because anyone who has ever seen it that i know of has turned into a huge english literature fan."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The plot is good...but they don't tell you what each character is thinking, the don't give you an insight into each person real personality"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"As always this is an amazing book but this version was a pit disappointing.

But never would she fail to understand the unchanging character of the human condition that I wrote about in 19th & 20th century America. Her insights into the human spirit and behavior in the early 1800s, seemingly so simple and commonplace, are as deep as the most profound novelists of any age.

I have wanted to read this work for a long time after becoming interested in 19th Century classics, I wasn't disappointed. Lizzie being so bright and level headed was refreshing in comparison to her younger sisters and even with her older sister Jane, the kindest one. The one character, Mr. Darcy was hard to understand his aloofness to the point of being extremely rude just didn't seem to fit at first meeting since later in the book he showed himself to be so totally compassionate and sensitive to Lizzie's trouble's with her younger sister's plight.

My biggest impression is relief that I did not live in that era, when the most a woman could hope for was to be good at needlepoint and marry well. I understand that is how it was, but I still felt nauseous reading about all the silly, manipulative man hunting tactics of the women. The dialoge was sometimes very witty, but other times rather difficult to follow because of the older style English.I also could not stand Darcy; any man who has the audacity to say within earshot of a woman that she is too ugly to tempt him or to dance with him is a jerk, period. I would tell him to take a hike if he came around. I don't understand how women find men like Darcy, Heathcliff, and Rochester to be attractive; cold indifferent, sarcastic, and cruel men don't interest me in the slightest and I can't for the life of me understand how they get to be such great romantic interests in these type of novels.The main character, Elizabeth, is different from the others and is very likeable; she redeems the book from being a 1 star. I admire her intelligence and refusal to go along the societies norms. I don't understand how she begins to like Darcy, but I guess that is just me. Elizabeth's ability to spar with Darcy and hold her own was the best part of the book.This book is is not as good as \\"Jane Eyre\\" but is better than \\"Wuthering Heights\\" in my opinion. A decent read, but not a rave."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I am an avid reader of English classics so naturally, I came across P&amp;P fairly soon after I discovered my love of literature. I had heard so many glorious things about this novel (that it forms young women world wide, that the characters are incredibly convincing and realistic, etc.), that perhaps I was expecting a little bit more. Sure, Austen claimed she wrote about the &quot;things she knew about.&quot; Unfortunately, there were many other authors, female artists to be most specific, who were her contemporaries and wrote far more incredibly mind blowing novels (Mary Shelly comes to my mind).I will begin by saying that this book was wonderful to read. It was witty and the story line was intriguing enough that I had no trouble completing it a few days after beginning it (I will confess, I even gave up a few nights of slee to find out if Elizabeth's character flaws would resolve). The characters were convincing, the book well developed and not extremely predictable. Unfortunately, these assets did not redeem the novel in my eyes, because shortly after finishing it, I simply could not believe I had wasted a few days of valuable reading time to devote to a relatively 'numb' piece of literature. Simply put, I felt it lacked depth, and although it was witty and enjoyable to read, I do not exactly understand why it has lasted as a classic depiction of human existance. The plot was unrealistic, the ending contrived, and besides the obvious message that 'pride and prejudice are evil and indulging in either of these flaws will cause misery' I did not receive any further enlightenment by reading it. It is an excellent documentation of courting rituals during Austen's time, as well as what I imagine to be a realistic depiction of the concerns of upper-middle-class English society, but to be perfectly honest, who cares? If these subjects interest you, I'm sure you will be enthralled by Austen's work. I appreciate her and respect her because of the history she represents, and for this reason, you should NOT AVOID READING THIS BOOK, but I do not think I will ever be able to say her work moves me. Of course, I could be missing something. I'm only sixteen, so my distaste for P&amp;P could be the result of youth and foolishness. If any of you have read this novel were sincerely moved by it, I'd love to hear from you.

My favorite character would be Elizabeth Bennet, or Lizzy as she is frequently reffered. She is willing to let love walk out the door because another woman is interested. Lizzy definately dislikes competition. She does make her presence known. Not rudely, but can get very defensive and in that quite comical. Lizzy presents herself very well. Like they say &quot;A first impression is a lasting impression&quot;. I picture her as tall, very beautiful, and soft spoken. Unlike others she has a beautiful smell and good taste in clothing. Lizzy reminds me a lot of Emma Woodhouse in Emma and Elinor Dashwood in Sense and Sensability. Coincidently, both of these novels were also written by Jane Austen. The reason I believe these three characters are alike is because they each either search for love for other people and over-look their own need, in the case of Emma, or they simply allow other women to appear to fill in the role in the cases of Elinor and Lizzy. Another thing that relates Lizzy, Emma and Elinor is the fact that they are all very dependent and become so in the coarse of the novels. Their love interest are not a priority and they do not depend on their parents support emotionally. Lizzy grows as and individual when she spends two weeks at their friends house with her sister Jane. This seperation allows her to grow away from her parents to take care of Jane and make some of her own decisions. While there, she does not allow herself to show many emotions toward other people and over looks emotions displayed toward her by others. Mr. Woodhouse, Emma's father, dislikes going out past their fence and that forces Emma to go out to social events on her own. In a way she becomes too dependent and doesn't realize what she may be missing out on with other characters of the book. Elinor appears to be unconcerned. Her love interest pops in and out of the novel and her true feelings are not completely revealed until the end of the novel. Her independence comes from helping her moher raise two of her sisters, Margarette and Marianne. I would reccomend this novel to someone who is enterested in branching out their reading experiences to old English romance. I enjoyed reading this book because of its interesting characters. There was always a mdest joke or disagreement, I was never bored. I also enjoyed picturing the events in my head. Some of the scenes were so beautiful. Taking place in lovely gardens you see only in your dreams, and extremely elegant mansions. Reminding me of the time I went to Mount Vernon, the home of George Washington, and Montecello, the home of Thomas Jefferson. Back then people were so polite. Rudeness was severly frowned upon especially when directed at or in the presence of a lady. Very different from today's society. It is interesting to see what it was like back then for entertainment without a television or radio.

It is a great peice of English literature.Each family was very close..most of the time. Lizzy's family for example, was all about marrage to a wealthy man or the family name. Mr.Darcy's \\"family\\" was more of just him and his sister who were very close. Lizzy acted the same toward everyone and \\"full of life!\\" but Mr.Darcy was only truely happy with his little sister and later, Elizabeth. Otherwise he would not dance at balls (unless he danced with Lizzy) and he hardly even laughed.In the end,(without giving it away), Mr.Darcy AND Lizzy had a differnet perspective of life and family. And, each family gets a benefit.--Jane Austen is an excellent author. She has written may books before but \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" would have to be my favorite!--"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I don't know how it came about that - after avoiding it in high school and watching two movie versions of it - I found myself reading PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. I didn't think that the book would be able to much surprise me. But, my goodness, this book is one of the most delightful, compellingly readable pieces of fiction I have ever found. And, oddly enough, knowing the story through the movies made the surprises that the book has to offer all the more valuable.The language Austen uses is fantastic. The book is charming and very funny. The characters are all fully developed and funny, from the annoying Mrs. Bennet to the startling, judgmental Mr. Collins. And the romance is wonderful.Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy are great characters, and I'm glad to finally be acquainted with them in their original form."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I read the adapted version of this novel for children as a kid and I loved it. However, reading the original novel was difficult since I was used to the simple words for the children's one. I even avoided reading it for quite a while until I picked it up again a few days ago. Now I can't seem to put it down. I'm also planning to read Jane Austen's other novels as well."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I admit that when I first heard this story, I was confused by the fast pace. I watch the old movie before reading the book, so I knew what was going to happen. I heard it over again and enjoyed it a lot. Since then I've listened to it many many times. Though the reader is fast paced, I like her different voices for each character.This book is about a 20-year-old woman named Eliza. She lives with her 1 older sister and 3 younger sisters and mother and father in a small village. A new arrival comes to the town. A man named Bingley. He brings his friend Mr. Darcy and his sisters Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. Eliza's older sister Jane admires Mr. Bingley. But Eliza finds Mr. Darcy a very proud and rude man. She meets another man who catches her fancy.I recommend not reading this book once or twice, but a lot. Then you can really get the feel for what Jane Austen was writing. For me it was a lot more interesting in a fast pace listening then a slow read of the book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen's novels have a recurring theme of love and marriage and forever invoke the absurdly beautiful art of humour and irony to fabricate a mesh of interwoven ideas tied by that central idea. Detractors of this late 17th. century and early 18th. century novelist have repeatedly pointed at her unimaginative superficiality and her meek satisfaction to restrain her works on the fringes of the social chaos. Indeed austen never ventures deep into the society's demeanours but it's this contraint of her to resolve to poke fun at the society and the people who live in it by employing the canny and subtle instrument of satire sharpened by sly humour that makes Austen such a popular and hugely succesful novelist as she is. Nowhere is this attribute so vehemently explicit as in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\",regarded by many as the most accomplished work in English literature for its fairy-tale gratifications as well as for its replete involvement of humour.Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" revolves around,as the title itself sugests,the pride of a person and the prejudice of another,both so bizzarely related and paradoxically driving these two persons away from each other. But the \\"first impressions\\" that the general reader gets is only a figment of the authoress's array of ideas conjugated into a rare commodity of literature that both thrills and provokes broodings,and beyond it everything must remain a surprise. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr.Fitzwilliam Darcy are the principle characters of the novel and it's the pride of the latter that actually raiss the prejudice of the former that lents the story an excuse to stretch on as long as it does. \\"Pride and PRejudice\\" is the tale of the gradual stripping down of the prejudice simulataneous with the quiescent passing away of the pride in a quid pro quo style.The Bennets are a family of seven unique members living in the Hertfordshire village of Longbourn and from the very inception it's clear that the book is going to be a light read and a hilarious one at that. Mrs.Bennet,\\"a woman of mean understandind,little information,and uncertain temper\\" whose \\"buisness of life was to get her daughters married\\" is a constant source of laughter in the book,her husband Mr.Bennet,\\"so odd a mixture of quick parts,sarcastic humour,reserve,and caprice\\",is a man deliberately detached from the fetters of responsibility that marriage and fatherhood unfailingly brings and their five daughters are all so invariably different. The eldest,Jane,is a beautiful,placid,unassuming,innocent and believe-good-in-everything girl,Elizabeth is beautiful too and with a certain charm of intelligence and elegance of wit,Lydia and Catherine both are consumed in their false notions of love and marriage and Mary is a book-worm possessing the slightest touch of a philosopher. The story begins when a rich bachelor,a wanteed catch in the authoress's era,Mr.Charles Bingley rents a house near Longbourn. Mrs.bennet is despearate to get one of her daughters married to him and part of her wish does come true indeed when Jane and Mr.Bingley fall in love with each other. But the fairy-tale symphony stops abruptly here and under the influence of his sisters and friend Mr.Darcy---a man who likes to maintain an air of pride and aristrocracy about him and draws a line between him and others---Mr.Bingley returns to London. Of course there's the whisper of a tagedy in this sequence which is easily subdued in the vociferous humourous actions of Mr.Collins,to whom the Bennets's Longbourn estate is entailed. It's his arrival which brings forth the nature of most of the characters. Mrs.Bennet gets a scope to exhibit her want of intelligence,Mr.Bennet is openly satiric and mocking,Elizabeth is cynical though not without reason and Jane is at her inocent best. Mr.Collins proposes Elizabeth,gets rejected and goes on to marry Charlotte Lucas,doughter of the Bennets's neighbour Sir William Lucas. This is one marriage that occurs without even an iota of harmony or intelligence but has all elements of illusory marriage done in haste and without forbrooding.There's a furthur twist in the tale as Darcy conveys Elizabeth his love for her much against his \\"better judgement\\" and gets rejected. Inevitably. And from this conjuction onwards,the principle theme of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" gets its proper shape and dimension. One by one the pieces of rags of prejudice war off Elizabeth and she realises the true character of Wickham who elopes with Lydia and comprehends the man of noble character in Darcy undrneath the layer of abstract ego. Simulataneously Darcy rejects the scepticism his gentryclass has cursed him with and emerges from being \\"the most disagreeable man in the world\\" to a man with \\"no improper pride\\". The metamorphoses in both Elizabeth and Darcy are not sudden or abrupt but gradual yet stunning and reveal the genius of the script-writer to compose a novel of characters in an overtone of irony and delicate humour.In all there're four marriages accomplished in the book and all are vastly different. So a happy-ever-after ending? Yes,but at the same time not without patches of apprehension. In a fine symmetrical plot lacking a concrete stucture and a specific ambition with no specific slots of a 'hero' as such,Jane Austen has managed to portary a variety of characters segmented into different natures. The opening sentence of te novel(\\"It is a truth univerally acknowledge,that a single man in possession of a good fortune,must be in want of a wife\\".) is an ironical statement---perhaps the sharpest in the book---that has descended down the ages to be renowned as one of the better opening lines of any novel. This irony is come to realised in the first chapter itself as we discern that it's not the man who runs after the woman but just the opposite. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is scattered wit several other ironies that provide food for the subsistence of the plot. Jane Austen also hints at the grotesque pride and egomania sustained by the gentry folk and at the same instant doesn't leave the intellectually deprived petty mentality and confined ambitions of the commonfolk out of her domain of satire. In a world of two differebt parts,Elizabeth and Darcy are the sole strings that hold them together. The regal coupling of narration and dialogue exalt the quality of the novel even higher,though being marked mainly from the perspective of Elizabeth in spite of invoking an omniscient narrator the storyline does lose some gloss. But even so,in a world of imperfection and preposterous false ideas and beliefs,Jane Austen's this remarkable work of literature hints at the chimera of a fairytale translating itself into reality,or be it a hollow reality. All the characters are superbly drawn and in them as wel as in the sequence of all those marvellous events,the reader would decipher his own self and actions from his own life and surroundings. And for that he must be grateful to a writer of excellent wit and humour."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"You will find Jane Austen in high school classrooms, as inspiration for contemporary movies and fiction (Clueless, Bridget Jones' Diary), and at a book club or two. Otherwise, she is not part of us: Her laser-eyes, scathing commentary about society, and merciless fun at the expense of over-the-top piety are missing. In our current Press-Release era, where ads blanket our cities, and celebrities alter their image every other week, Jane would have a field day-- her observations would have been invaluable, her sharp humor liberating.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\"-- the story of independent-minded Elizabeth Bennet's journey to a happy marriage and her rousing rebellion against the stultifying and stale social system of 19th-Century England-- is an adrenaline-rush of a book.As Elizabeth battles the defenders of society (her marriage-obsessed mother, a condescending suitor, and several members of the \\"upper-class\\" trying to stem her promising relationship with the affluent and handsome Mr. Darcy) we sample a world where family, money, and class dictate your friends and suitors.When Elizabeth and Darcy move to his stunning home, they leave the hostility of an uncaring society behind. Through rebellion and stubbornness, they have found Eden."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"For anyone who has ever thought, &quot;I really should read the classics,&quot; 'Pride and Prejudice' is a wonderful place to begin. Why? First, the work is very readable, even though it was written well over a hundred years ago. Second, it's not too long and the chapters are very short. (I hope I'm beginning to convince you...) Third, maybe you'll see yourself in the book or someone you know. Fourth, Austen takes a humorous, entertaining, and throught-provoking look at human nature, which has not changed and probably never will.Austen's heroine, Elizabeth Bennett, is a bright, intelligent young lady who is delighted to see her older sister Jane meet and fall for an English gentleman. At the same time that her sister meets someone, Elizabeth meets a brash, arrogant man named Darcy. Darcy's manner quickly irritates and disgusts Elizabeth beyond belief. There's no way this couple could ever get together, right? :)Austen does a masterful job of telling an intelligent story that works as social commentary, a study of human nature, class distinctions, and so much more. So many subtle shades of human pride, prejudice, arrogance, condescension, and forgiveness are present in the book as they are in real life."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is my favourite book in the world!! This is a story that is full of humour, class conflict, family expectations, dancing, irony and of course, romance.I have read &quot;Pride and Prejuduce&quot; several times and it is still thrilling, waiting to see proud Darcy snub and then fall for the prejudice Lizzy, who is far from willing to give him a chance. However, they both must realise that things are not always as they appear to be.Lizzy's father, Mr Bennett, is absolutely hilarious and is so full of sarcasm and irony that he is one of the funniest characters of Austen's books. Mrs Bennett is also very funny as a hypochondriac whose husband spends most of his time in his library to get away from her! Lizzy herself has a great sense of humour and sometimes uses it to tease Darcy. I have to agree with Jane Austen, as her favourite character of her books is Miss Elizabeth Bennett.This is a book that can be read time and time again. Once you get used to the language, it becomes easier to read and hard to put down. If you ever get a chance to watch the BBC TV series box set, allow yourself lots of time as you will not be able to stop watching it... and it's 6 hours long!!This is the best story that Jane Austen wrote in her lifetime and is still fantastic after 200 years."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Every once in a while, read something which you would normally not read. Pick up something in a genre you rarely explore. Sometimes, you will be absolutely delighted.Recently, I did just that. I picked up a copy of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; -- and thoroughly enjoyed it! (Far more than I thought that I would!) Until this point, my only real exposure to Jane Austen was with the movie &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;.While (as the reader could probably assume) this form of English literature does not represent a genre I typically frequent, I'm certainly not sorry I spent the time. Austen's writing is laced with dry and subtle humor, applied with the spirit of a very generous nature. She also had the gift of being able to very perceptively observe the people around her, and those with whom she came into contact.I highly recommend this tale of young love and happy endings to any and all who need a break from the stress and fuss of the 21st century."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Humphrey Bogart's line to his secretary in &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; could as easily have been addressed to Jane Austen. Long before the woman's movement of the 60s and women's studies courses of the 70s, perceptive and discriminating readers were in agreement about Jane Austen as the supreme master of her craft. In her characterizations, plotting, and language she is the model of exactness and efficiency. There simply is no gratuitous business, no room for sentiment, no place for self-indulgence or personal fantasy. Elizabeth's world is a microcosm of the complex society we habit, each of us making daily compromises, negotiations, and decisions that allow us the maximum degree of self-expression within the limitations of our social communities and of the human condition itself. The rewards of identifying with Austen's heroines are as accessible and satisfying to male as to female readers. Above all, Austens' novels are tributes to the power of language--to create plausible worlds, to capture the meanings of the heart, and to construct the rhetoric of the &quot;self.&quot; Where lesser writers require battles and orgies to get a rise out of readers, Austen can elicit profound emotions from the most stoic readers through the description of a raised eyebrow."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Being the literary classic that it is, you can purchase Pride &amp; Prejudice in a variety of shapes, sizes, and prices. No matter which one you chose it's still the perfect love story of Elizabeth Bennet (who every woman wants to be) and Mr. Darcy (easily the sexiest literary character of all time), witty and entertaining as well as significant in its portrayal of femininity and other issues of the period in which it was written. It may be just as good a story in the cheapest edition as in the most expensive, but shelling out a couple extra dollars may get you more for your money.If you're reading for a class or for independent study, you can't go wrong (for this book or any other) with the Norton Critical Edition. Includes not only the original text and info about the author, but critical articles studying the novel from several different perspectives. This edition could easily save you a trip to the library to find those secondary sources you'll need for your research paper.If you're just reading for pleasure or think the Norton Critical Edition is a little pricey, your best bet is Penguin Classics. It's a well-edited version that's appropriate for scholarly study, but it also offers those little extras that make pleasure reading all the more pleasurable: endnotes that will help you differentiate a post-chaise from a barouche and an well-written and interesting introduction that looks at both influences on Austen's writing and Pride and Prejudice as a classic romance (scholarly enough to get you thinking, but not so much that it's boring or difficult to understand).

The main flaw in this reading is that it was too hurried. There was barely a pause between chapters and the quick speech did not do justice to all of the characters. I found the reader's voice to be as little high pitched and a little mannered, even for Austen. Flaws aside, I still got enjoyment from this reading. The speed became less distracting as I became used to it and there were some fine readings of exchanges between Elizabeth and Darcy.

Many of us have discovered that the \\"free\\" ebooks on Gutenburg and other sites frequently have such poor formatting that they are irritating to read. One can either re-edit the book to fix the problems, or just live with them and have an inferior and annoying reading experience.Penguin's P&P; is the closest ebook equivalent to the joy of reading a quality physical book--the text is perfectly formatted for the Kindle, it's been proofed, and the supplemental material is almost overwhelming. Detailed intros, useful hyperlinking and a wealth of information on Austen's times, including fashion, furniture, and food and drink, are included. It's truly an immersive experience.I believe this book will be seen as a turning point for ebooks: the point at which editorial and publishing quality became a significant purchase criterion. Early ebook adopters (myself included) were willing to spend hours cleaning up Gutenburg editions and formatting them for the device du jour. No longer. The ebook is moving past the early adopter stage and is making inroads into a market that expects quality editing, publishing, and supplemental materials. I'll definitely pay a reasonable amount for an ebook that I can just start reading, instead of tinkering with, and that provides a comfortable feeling of having gotten one's money's worth.Penguin has set the bar for ebook quality with this release.

The book like any other publisher of Pride and Prejudice, they have the same contents although this book have some explanations at the back for words like \\"chaise and four\\" and etc. for people that never read books like this before. I love it so much so now I'm hunting for all Jane Austens' books and movies!!!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Okay, I admit it: I read Pride and Prejudice in high school and didn't like it. However, age and the wisdom that comes with it helped me to realize that my dislike of the book probably had more to do with my dislike of my then-teacher, who had the ability to make even the greatest literary masterpiece seem dry and dull. In recent years, I've read most of Jane Austen's other novels and have enjoyed them immensely, and so I have finally worked my way back to Pride and Prejudice.The story is familiar to most: it centers around the five young Bennett sisters, who range in age from their mid-teens to early twenties, making them quite ripe for marriage (at least according to their mother). And then there are the men, for as the novel's opening line notes: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\" Such a man, Mr. Bingley, buys a house close to the Bennett family, and initially, he seems fated to marry the oldest, loveliest Bennett girl, Jane. Bingley is accompanied by his haughty friend, Mr. Darcy, who, while possessing an even greater fortune, quickly earns the dislike of all those he meets, particularly Elizabeth, the strong-minded second Bennett daughter. And from the pride held by each of the four principle characters described above (but namely Darcy and Elizabeth), Austen derives her prejudice.In many ways, Pride and Prejudice reads like a modern-day romantic comedy, complete with misunderstandings and mishaps. Similarly, the embarrassment which Jane and Elizabeth suffer at the hands of their mother and younger sisters would make them perfect candidates for today's reality TV. But of course, Austen's writing contains a level of wit and subtlety rarely found in any contemporary form of entertainment, making this novel is a true classic-a rare gem that still shines brightly to this day."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I had to read \\"Emma\\" for my high school sophomore English class and was pretty much the only one who enjoyed it at all. Recently, free this summer from required reading, I decided to try \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". The first few chapters are slow and a bit dry, but the action soon picks up pace (as action and Austen go). Austen's characters are brilliantly drawn and her observations in situations are astute. The reader has the advantage of being the most nearly omniscient observer and knows throughout the book what the ending will be but still agonizes over the process of it happening. Some readers like me may be slightly annoyed that (like \\"Emma\\") the happiness of the characters hinges on love and marriage and nothing else, but in the end you'll be so swept up in the story that nothing else matters but the happy ending."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Wow! What else do you say after you read such an incredible book? Jane Austen's timeless characters like Elizabeth Bennett, Mr. Darcy, Miss Bingley(oh, don't you just love to hate her), Jane, etc. all add to this intricately woven plot. Elizabeth Bennett is arguably one of the most complex characters ever written (well, Lucy Snowe of Villette wins the prize). This novel is an excellent example of Austen's literary power. Her heroines are to be admired for they all dared to marry for love and not for social status which so often happened to women in their predicament back then. You will laugh, you will cry, you will be angry, and above all, you will fall in love with Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. However, don't stop after Pride and Prejudice; read Sense and Sensibility, read Emma, read them all. (It won't take long; she only wrote six- I was disappointed that there weren't more) Jane Austen's work is incredible; the only fault I find is that she has so many characters, it is difficult to keep up with them all. Pride and Prejudice has to be read at least twice to catch everything and everybody. But it won't be a chore to read it again, more like opening a treasure chest."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"No need to review the book itself.

They have hyperlinked the notes and the footnotes, so that you can get right to them with your Kindle scroll wheel, and not lose your place in the book.More publishers need to do the same!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I feel sorry for the young person who thought this book was boring. What a shame that you can't relax and stop thinking about yourself long enough to take the time to revel in one of the greatest works in English literature.The plot is timeless, and I can guarantee that many of the characters will resemble people you know. Yes, the dialogue may be difficult to follow at first but, after a while, &quot;listening&quot; to it becomes almost second nature.I first read this book when I was 11 or 12, and have read it at least 10 or 15 times since, including at least twice for school. In fact, I chose to read it again just so I could write a paper on it.Buy this book, sit down and lose yourself in Jane Austen's world. Then try Persuasion, Emma or Sense &amp; Sensibility (I'm afraid I can't recommend Mansfield Park very highly). If you have any trace of imagination, you will be hooked.Please, do yourselves a favor and read the book before seeing any of the adaptations. Each has its advantages, but the recent BBC/A&amp;E version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is a sight to behold. The Garvie/Rintoul version is also good, but not quite as beautiful to watch.

It is also full of wonderful dialogue and a timeless plot.This is one of my very favorite books. I love how everything that could possibly go wrong does go wrong. My favorite part about it is that I can relate to the story although it obviously was not written in this time period.My favorite mix up is how Mr. Darcy is convinced that Jane does not love Mr. Bingley so he separates them, causing Elizabeth to refuse his offer of marriage. He then goes through a long process of tiny deeds with the hope of redeeming himself in Elizabeth's eyes.One of my favorite characters is Mrs. Bennett. Forever causing her daughters' grief with her thoughtless comments and impropriety, she contributes to much of her daughters' unhappiness; Although all she wants for them is to be well-married and happy.I recommend this book with a love for classics who do not get bored with a lot of dialogue (like my sisters do).E @ 3 Book BeesOriginally posted @ [...]Ima swagbucks superstar @ [...]"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It is beneficial at times to step away from our classics of literature, to take them down from their high pedestals and look at them without pretension. No novel, no matter how well-regarded, is universally esteemed - Twain, Emerson, and Charlotte Bronte all savaged Pride and Prejudice in print - so let us, for a few moments, stop treating it as holy writ and just look at it as a novel, at how it holds up to a modern casual reader.Pride and Prejudice (1813) is Jane Austen's novel of manners - it thoroughly explores the ins, outs and economics of nineteenth-century courtship. The novel's central character is Elizabeth Bennet, one of five daughters, whose family lives in a country village. Two wealthy, eligible bachelors move to town, and romance, confusion and animosity ensue.Austen populates her novel with all manner of flawed characters. Many of them are annoying - that is, they behave badly and are antagonistic toward the main characters - but they all show at least some depth. No one here is without flaw, but no one here is without virtue, either (except Mr. Collins, the most ludicrous of them all). And this is why the novel works: because Austen treats her characters and their social milieu gently, delicately (well, except Mr. Collins). If she had done otherwise, if she had been more cutting, she would have lost the sympathy in the reader that many of these characters engender.To the modern audience, Austen's plotting is rather sluggish, although it must be recalled that novels moved at a rather more leisurely pace then. At any rate it often seems that there is one too many side plots, or perhaps one too many visits to relatives, and there are patches that can be quite hard to get through. But you don't go to Austen for plot - you go to her for clever dialogue, for a delightful turn of phrase. That is what she thrives at, and that is what she is best remembered for. And in spite of the novel's overlength, Austen delivers a full and completely satisfying payoff. Rarely is a happy ending so fulfilling, and it may not be until the last few pages of the book that it becomes evident to the reader how masterfully Austen has set it up. And this is a large reason why the novel has such enduring appeal.Much of the nuance in Pride and Prejudice may be lost on casual modern readers. For example, the character of Mrs. Bennet is the object of great scorn from many readers, and this has only been exacerbated by the film adaptations of the novel. But while marrying for love is the norm today, then, it was not; Mrs. Bennet is the only one looking out for the Bennet family's financial future.Pride and Prejudice is, on the whole, a satisfactory and clever novel, and, at present, one whose merits are diminished mostly by readers too far removed to understand it in its fullness, or whose tastes have diverged too far."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I bought this book because my own copy was severely damaged after years of peruse. The picture of the cover was not available online at that time. I was sorely disappointed when the book arrived and I realised that this is not Jane Austen's original novel, but a severely butchered version, probably adequate for 8 year olds.So, should you be looking for a present for a child, this is probably an excellent choice. Should you be looking for a cheap copy of the master novel, search further."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I decided to go to the library and take out the book after seeing the movie a few weeks ago. The movie was good but the book is so much better. It was well written, funny and everything you can expect from a good novel. Definitely a must read even if it is not required for class."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"If you only read one Jane Austen book, this is the one to pick. But if like the rest of us, you find something so completely witty and enjoyable in Pride and Prejudice, you'll pick up the rest of her books and read them all."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Who could not get swept up in the thorny romance of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy? And what girl hasn't fallen in love at least a little bit with the prickly yet big-hearted Mr. Darcy? This book has been made into mutiple miniseries (the A&E one is hands-down my favorite) and movies, while many modern screenplays have borrowed (and downright stolen) from this classic, romantic comedy of errors--or prejudices if you will--and for good reason. Like a fine wine, this novel just seems to keep getting better with (my) age."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Reading this book is like taking a sailboat ride to the world's best locations: exciting, smooth, tumultuous, but all in all a fantatic ride. Austen delightfully teases you in your role as omnicient reader, leaving you tantalized by the characters in all of their plots and sub-plots. You want to reach into the book and tell the characters you know the solutions to all their problems. You cheer the characters on through their pleasures and foibles. The language is as smooth as silk and as alluring as diamonds."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is Jane Austen's finest novel and one must assume that the author identifies rather strongly with the female protagonist. The book is the perfect balance of story, prose, structure, and characters. It evokes many emotional responses in the reader. The novel is among the greatest novels of all time on par with for example Flaubert's \\"Madame Bovary\\" or Tolstoy's \\"Anna Karenina.\\"The present novel is about a young woman, Elizabeth Bennet, who comes from an upper middle class family living in rural England. She has four sisters plus an interesting mother and a wise but witty father. The novel follows the romances and complications of the Bennet girls, especially Elizabeth and her sister Jane. Beyond knowing those facts, you should not read any more about the plot until you read the novel, or you will risk spoiling the read. I will not give away the plot, but will only describe the writing style and structure.I read Austen's \\"Mansfield Park,\\" then read some analysis by Nabokov from his Cornell \\"Lectures on Literature\\" and the comments of Jane Stabler from the introduction of the Oxford version. After that I got a bit excited and read Austen's early writing \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" along with the analysis by Margaret Doody in the Oxford version. Yes, I guess I am now an Austen fan, and it is a pity that she did not live longer. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is my third Austen novel and so far the most fun to read..Based on the three novels written over two different time periods, it is clear that she developed a certain fixed writing style and a common structure. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters.Those opening chapters are an obstacle for most readers. She uses her own vocabulary and has an unusual way of structuring her prose. That structure is a trademark of Austen's writing. Also, she manages to work in a lot of drama and social issues with some humour and irony.Based on what Nabokov and others are saying, she got her inspiration from Sheridan, Richardson, Henry Fielding, Sir Walter Scott, and the poetry of Cowper. She modulates the complexity of the prose to reflect the characters - such as making the sentences of Sir Thomas Bertram in \\"Mansfield Park\\" somewhat elaborate instead of describing how the character is dressed or a similar description to convey qualities and traits, i.e.: she uses the complexity of speech to convey character. Also, she uses lateral shifts and epigrammatic notations and similar literary techniques. These techniques are interesting for some readers but just confusing for others. It is all part of the price of admission to entering the world of Jane Austen, and it is part of the fun in reading her novels.Overall, once you get past reading and digesting 50 pages or so and have absorbed the Jane Austen vocabulary (words such as felicity, remonstrance, countenance, etc.) and understand the structure of her prose, the book becomes a compelling read. The second Austen novel seems much easier than the first.This was written by a mature Jane Austen and many think it is her best work and it is one of the most delightful and pleasant reads. One must conclude that the very intelligent and witty Elizabeth character is a reflection of the author herself."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I had to read this for school, but I actually turned out liking it.

Whenever I am at a loss to find anything decent to read in the modern literature I find this a real comfort. A great read!!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It is beneficial at times to step away from our classics of literature, to take them down from their high pedestals and look at them without pretension.

It's about 7 1/2 hours each way (because I actually go the speed limit!!!) and I wanted to try something new while driving. So, I decided to try an audio recording.I found one from my local library of Pride and Prejudice. : Why not go with a classic book for the drive home?So, I listened to Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen.Pride and Prejudice is the story of the Bennet sisters, Elizabeth and Jane. Both are of marriageable age but do not come from the wealthiest of families. However, they live in a time when marriage to someone with wealth is of utmost importance.Since they have no brothers, when their father dies his estate will go to another male relative, as they are unable to inherit.One summer a new family comes to live nearby, and Mrs. Bennet, their mother insists that Mr. Bennet make an acquaintance with Mr. Bingley, the new bachelor who is very wealthy. At a ball one evening he is immediately taken with Jane Bennet who is admittedly beautiful, of a sweet nature, but perhaps below the standard of wealth into which he is expected to marry.But the problem really is his friend, Mr. Darcy. A haughtier more proud man has never existed, and though that same night at the ball many women did not have partners as men were few, Mr. Darcy makes it clear that he thinks pretty negatively of Elizabeth Bennet. He is cold, unfriendly, and seemingly unkind . . .Mrs. Bennet is determined to see her daughters married and encourages Jane and Mr. Bingley, but is desperate to make a match for Elizabeth, including pushing her to accept the proposal of marriage from her most insipid cousin.We follow the story of the Bennet family as others do everything they can to keep Jane and Mr. Bingley apart, and Elizabeth is forced into close proximity with the awful Mr. Darcy repeatedly.Will Jane and Elizabeth ever find true love that others will accept? Or will their less wealthy state be their destruction?Read Pride and Prejudice to find out!This is a total and complete classic. There are over 2 million copies sold worldwide, hundreds of editions, and quite a few different audio recordings, not to mention TV and movie versions of this story.If you haven't actually read Pride and Prejudice you simply must! It's a beautiful, wonderful story full of lively characters with personality oozing from them. Mrs. Bennet is incredibly silly, a trait which seems to have rubbed off thoroughly on several of her daughters. But Jane and Elizabeth took far more after their father with much more sense. It's the story of how pride and prejudice can keep you from truly seeing another's character, and how opinions can change when someone is given a true chance.I highly recommend this book to everyone!5 out of 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"In all seriousness, this is a classic piece of English literature.

In Elizabeth Bennet, Jane Austen has created the quintessential spunky heroine who refuses to let her somewhat low position on the social ladder dictate her behavior. Her mother is determined to marry off her five daughters to the highest bidders, but Elizabeth refuses to look for a marriage of financial convenience. She is hopeful that her sister Jane will marry the amiable Mr. Bingley, but she has no real matrimonial ambitions for herself. She has a particular disdain for Mr. Darcy, from which comes the \\"prejudice\\" of the title. He is a prideful man, thus supplying the other half of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". The language of the book is, of course, quite different from modern-day phraseology, but it's worth plowing through the conversations of manners and morals to uncover the delightful story of this star-crossed duo. May it continue to delight readers for the next 200 years!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This novel grabs you so hard that you just want to know what is going to happen next and why is Darcy and Elizabeth acting this way, what is the deal with all this pride and the prejudice?Even though that their life style in the novel in general does not seem very exciting like our present life style; however I think they were much more sophisticated than we are; they all read, write letters hence mastered the art of writing, and they all can play the piano! nice. in short, the novel is brilliant! that is it!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This classic novel follows the Bennet sisters as they search for marriage. The joy of this book is relating it to modern day romance and marriage. Many parts of the conversations and desires are familiar to today, while many other parts are foreign.

All of the characters are wonderfully developed and full of life. The plot seems to have a mind of its own, twisting here and there. Unlike some books were the plot doesn't seem to fit together in the end, Austen has worked out every detail.I also think this book is wonderful for the social commentary that it provides. Again, some novels I have read do not do so well with balancing social commentary and plot/character development. This is not so with Pride and Prejudice. This book is a true gem. Witty, fun, shocking, scandalous, romantic, and entertaining!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Almost everything that can be said about this book has been said.

This book is amazing, and I recommended it to anyone."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a superb book. Each character has a unique personality. For example, Mr. Darcy is arrogant at the start of Pride and Prejudice. While Darcy is arrogant, Elizabeth Bennett is smart, beautiful, and independent. Elizabeth is the protagonist and is the liveliest character. I rooted for her from the start to the end of the story. Miss Bennett seems to somehow always find herself in difficult situations. The plot kept me entertained. There were several times when I couldn't put the book down until I found out what happened next.Pride and Prejudice is sometimes a little wordy. And because it was written in the 19th century, the English isn\`t contemporary.Overall, this book is excellent. In fact, it is considered one of the best novels in English ever written.

I appreciate the positive reviews as they motivated me to start a classic which I may not have begun without some encouragement."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"My favorite chapter was chapter eleven in volume two because I found it amusing that Elizabeth turned down Mr. Darcy's proposal. I think that Elizabeth's own prejudice against Darcy didn't allow her to see his affections for her. Darcy accuses Elizabeth of having too much pride, and she accuses him of prejudice, when in both cases they both show pride and prejudice.I think this book is appropriate for students in high school because it is not complicated to read and therefore they should be able to read it. I like the fact that the author uses a lot of dialogue to reveal ideas and personalities of different characters. In my opinion dialogue is very important because sometimes it helps me understand what the characters are like, or it can reveal a character's look, and that helps me develop a picture of that one character.I like this book because it wasn't as hard to read as I thought it was going to be. One thing that I learned was that you should carefully read the story because sometimes you might miss the important parts."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"STORY LINE:Being not very wealthy, Elizabeth (Lizzie) Bennet and her four sisters find it hard to find good marriages in society thirst for position and good fortunes.

It encompasses Austen's fabulous use of irony, wonderful examples of females subverting the economic conditions that control them through their wit, and a wonderful contrast in descripitions of landscapes that are prevelent in all of Austen's books. However, this book stands out as one of the best of the nineteenth century for many reasons. The first is that Austen's use of irony in this book is readily apparent, especially in the dialogue and actions of the characters. The wit that Lizzie exudes, especially in her conversations between Mr. Darcy, her unexpected love interest, and the Lady Catherine de Burgh provide endless entertainment for the reader. The reader develops a line of sympathy for Lizzie as she struggles to make the best of her unfortunate financial situation. Another reason to love the book not only includes the wit of Lizzie Bennet, but of her father and Mr. Darcy, which provide wonderful view into the superior workings of Austen's mind in terms of her characters' personalities. The landscapes would provide a wonderful escape for someone stranded on a deserted island because they provide many Romantic countrysides with transcendental descriptions along with wonderful descriptions of London that make the reader feel as if they really are staying with Mrs. Gardner with Jane. The description of Pemberley alone provides a wonderful example of the grandeur of nineteenth-century estates in England. Since I am supposedly stranded on this island on Valentine's Day, the love story contained within Austen's indirect ocmmentary on the hardships of economics on women in the nineteenth century, provides a hope that each person will meet not only the perfect person, but that person will also recognize them as their destined mate. This book incorporates the Romantic notions of Byron and Wordsworth into Lizzie, while allowing her to retain pieces of realism that makes her supreme to all of the other female characters. Austen also provides a wonderful sexual tension between Mr. Darcy and Lizzie that has never been equalled in any book that I have ever read, and being an English major, there have been many. I have read this book many times and still find motifs, themes, images and nuances in the plot that provide me continually with enjoyment. For this reason alone would I be content with having this book as my sole company on a deserted island. The villains in this novel are also so much fun to hate because they prove to be the very foces that try to keep Lizzie and Darcy apart. The two characters, however, persevere, which would be a very important theme for a person stranded on a desert island. Perseverence would be the only way one would survive the lonliness, aside from an excellent book, of course. Austen was truly ahead of her time as critic after critic will tell you, but only after you have read one of her greatest works will you understand why it has crossed the time and custom boundries and to this day remains a wonderful piece of literature that will continue to provide enjoyment to each new reader that endeavors to read it. Enjoy!

Elizabeth's younger sisters are silly young girls who favor their senseless mother. Her father loves her dearly. He adds humor to the novel with his near-sarcastic views of his family. The other characters in the novel range from her completely silly and senseless cousin Collins, to the conniving Miss Bingley, to the indescribable Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth's beau. Austen uses the perfect combination of humor, romance, and suspense in this unforgettable story. I was unable to put this book down, but I regretted it not being any longer"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"As always, Austen ridicules the conventions of the time, but acknowledges that they must be accepted. Women must find men (hopefully rich) to marry them; any feelings of love or respect in marriage are wonderful, but not always necessary or relevant. The characters are far from perfect --- pompous, superficial and greedy. Even the heroine of the novel, Elizabeth, is prone to prejudice. She is a willing participant in the titillating conversations with the proud Darcy and the envious Bingley sisters which serve to amuse and entertain the reader"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"the English countryside during the 1800's.Imagine this: you are the second eldest of five sisters, you have a flighty mother who is fixated on marrying you all off, and you have a father whose indolence and disillusionment with life have led to the faulty upbringing of your three younger sisters. What would you do when an attractive, rich man moved in next door and fell in love with your older sister (who is the most beautiful and eligible woman in the surrounding countryside)? You would be happy for her and you would do everything you could to help her marry the man she loves...and you'd be pretty upset if his best friend stepped in and talked him into not being in love with your sister and thus removed your sister's chance at happiness and an improved situation in life. Then what if your socially inept, silly, pedantic cousin asked you to marry him after you had only known him three days? Oh--then what would you do if he proposed to your best friend the day after you refused him, and she accepted?! To top it off, what if the same person who took away the love of your sister's life fell in love with you and asked you to marry him?!Well, that is Miss Elizabeth Bennett's position at the outset of this hilarious and endearing novel which details a year in the life of a genteel English family and their neighbors. During the course of the novel, three proposals of marriage are made to Miss Elizabeth; one proposal is made to Jane (the eldest Miss Bennett); and their youngest sister (who is only sixteen) elopes with an English Army officer who has a worse reputation with the ladies than Wilt Chamberlin. Jane Austen is a masterful storyteller who is able to sketch characters through a plot that is never quite what the reader expects. This is a tale of life, and much can be learned from the proud and/or prejudicial acts of its participants which is applicable even today."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have always loved P&P it is timeless both in its writing style and it's subject matter. Like Romeo and Juliet this book's story line have been shamelessly borrowed by novelists and film makers for years.

I love the social commentary Austen makes in the book through the interactions between the Bennett family and others in the book .

This is, however, the finest work that the average man can actually read without being entirely baffled by the intrigue of the female mind. This, my second Austen, is perhaps the best to get anyone interested in Austen's style of writing. But be warned, \\"Pride and Prejudice can keep you rivetted for hours..."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is mainly focused on Elizabeth Bennet and her romance with Mr. Darcy, which comes about in a very interesting, if not humorous way. Elizabeth first judges Mr. Darcy to be arrogant and conceited, while Mr. Darcy finds himself falling in love with Elizabeth. Another main character is Elizabeth's sister, Jane, who has a troubled relationship with Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy's friend. Many exciting events take place involving the many sisters of the Bennet family in this great English story that will keep advanced readers interested.I have to admit, this was a very difficult book. I struggled through most of it, and I like this book much better now that I am finished with it. I guess that means that I like the story, but it took a while to get through reading it. One downside was that there was not much said describing Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy's romance. That might have been somewhat due to the time period in which this story was written. However, I really enjoyed the great detail, which allowed Austen to paint an amazing picture of society in that time period and middle-class expectations. I bought this book, which I am glad I did, because I plan to read it again. This definitely seems like it's one of those books that the reader will enjoy more the second time it is read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I was truly surprised by this tale. I was drawn from the very first page by Mrs. Bennets gossip. What was equally delightful was the sarcastic manner in which Mr. Bennet responded to her chatter, and she was none the wiser. And so begins a tale of wit that engages the minds.From the moment Darcy is mentioned, with his ill manners, we know that he will be key to the story and surely he is. The engaging repetoire between Elizabeth and Darcy is what makes the novel such an interesting read. From their haughty demeanor to falling in love, this tale is rich with engaging conversations.This novel gives an enlightening aspect to the 'higher' society of British life. There is a wicked vein that runs throughout the book, for the outlook on such a life seems quite vain if not ridiculous. Miss Austen does an excellent job of conveying that life to us, with enough wit and sarcasm.I enjoyed this book immensely and would recommend it to anyone wanting a witty read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This plot was definitely fit for me. I am into the suspensful love stories that pull you into the story and won't let you go. This book was like that for me. I felt I could relate to a lot of it in that the girls were fighting over a guy or gossiping about who they think is prettier, or who they admire the most; something i could see my friends and I doing a lot. I think a part of the book that portrays the similarity between my friends and the girls from &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is when the Bennet and theLucas women get together the morning after a ball and discuss all of the details. Mr. Bingley is the hot item in town and they are trying to decide who he likes the most. &quot;Oh!---you must mean Jane, I suppose---because he danced with her twice. To be sure that did seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he did--I heard something about it---but I hardly know what---something about Mr. Robinson.&quot;&quot;Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies....and which he thought the prettiest? And his answering immediately to the last question---Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point.&quot; (pg. 20). I also love all of the characters in her novel. For each one of them i could tink of someone I knew who was exactly like them. I feel like I know Elizabeth, Jane, and Charlotte so well because they each have qualities almost identical to some of my friends. My favorite character throughout this book had to be Elizabeth. She is strong, witty, and extremely intelligent. She has a lot of the qualities that inspire me to be a stronger person that stands up for my beliefs. I love that she is able to battle with Darcy about what makes the &quot;perfect&quot; woman. Her intelligence makes Darcy drool over her. I think Elizabeth would be a good role model for a lot of girls who need to learn what the meaning of independence is, and how to use it. A quote in the book that shows Elizabeth's strength. &quot;My fingers, said Elizabeth, &quot;do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the trouble of practicing. It is not that I do not believe m fingers as capable as any other woman's of uperior execution.&quot; &quot;Darcy smiled and said, &quot;you are perfectly right.&quot;&quot;Another reason I love this book is because of Jane Austen's writing style. She uses such a large vocabulary that thouroughly illustrated everyone's feelings so well, that it made it hard to put the book down. Austen's wording just seemed so elegant and flowed together perfectly. I felt smart just reading her book. It was definitely challenging because of the old fashioned wording and advanced vocabulary, but it feels like such an accomplishment finishing such a great book. I reccomend this book to anyone who wants to enjoy a great story and get a sense for the social status of women and men during the 19th century. It's a great book, and I have nothing bad to say about it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is the original and most amazing novel of all of Jane Austen novels.The most wonderful chapter is chapter eight where Elizabeth Bennet shows off her witty and exhilarating character. She is very beautiful and has a shining personality.This novel has amazing, fantastic wording as well as chapters. The appropriate age for this novel to be read would most likely be from 16 years of age and up because younger readers aren't mature or they don't have the knowledge that has to be applied to read this novel.Jane Austen beautifully brings out irony of fate; everything is expected to go one way but ends up another. For example, when the Bennet family thought that Wickham took Lydia to London to elope. The family thought the worse. They kept in mind that Wickham could possibly try to bed Lydia and not consider that he would propose to her. They were scared for Lydia and Wickham. At last they were found and brought back to Longbourn estate and surprisingly they were safe and engaged.This has been the best novel I have ever read in my life. I have never indulged in a novel like Pride and Prejudice. I adored the truth and reality that it holds."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a book based in the 19th century in England. It was based on the era when money, pride, love, and marriage arrangements had to be the best and the most important thing. In this book the major conflict was their pride and prejudice of the main characters. The book's main characters were the Bennet Family, Bingley, and Darcy. The Bennet family consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, their daughters Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia. As this story starts we meet all of them along with others minor characters. We find out that they are all concerned about social classes.The best chapter in this book is when Darcy and Elizabeth become engaged. To me it is the best chapter because that shows that they overcame their pride and prejudice. These two characters were deeply in love but couldn't show it to each other not only because of their own pride and prejudice, but also because their family and acquaintances had influenced them wrongly.The literary device I appreciate is comedy. A comedy, in general, is a story that ends happily. The hero or heroine of a comedy is usually an ordinary character who overcomes a series of obstacles that block what he or she wants. It's usually a plot where two young people meet and fall in love. The young lovers must face obstacles to their marriage. At the end of the story Elizabeth and Darcy overcome their conflicts to get together and be able to show their feelings towards each other.I like and recommend this book to anyone who likes to read love books with a little comedy. This book is age appropriate for teens and older people because it gives you a chance to appreciate the differences in lifestyles and beliefs in the 19th century from those of today. This book makes you think of how people believed women had only one futurein life, and that was getting married and raising a family."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It is unfortunate that most first time readers of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE see it merely as one more book to be endured in 11th grade English. However, most soon enough catch the magic of an author (Jane Austen) who can weave a spellbinding tale of love, romance, satire, and passion while all the while poking a not so gentle thrust at the social mores of the early 19th century. This book is no frilly ancestor of a Harlequin romance, even if it shares with the dim-witted heroines of Harlequin a time-honored plot of lovers who meet and find an instant dislike that later morphs into enduring love. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE starts off with that basic premise, but what sets it off as classic is what goes on behind the lovers, Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. A careful reader usually notes the society in which Elizabeth and Darcy play out their little games of cross-purpose verbal repartee. The world of Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is a society ruled by conniving and single-minded women who see men only in terms of the size of their wallets. Whenever a new bachelor appears on the scene, the women of the novel (with the exception of Elizabeth, of course) immediately try to guess his income so that they can decide if one wishes to marry him. His age, his looks, his habits are much less significant than his income. A fat purse compensates for a fat head.Modern readers typically call such schemers 'golddiggers,' and according to modern values, perhaps they are, but these readers ought to judge the book's morality against the age in which it was written. Austen (1775 - 1817) lived in an England that prized manners and breeding over all else. It is no surprise, then, that since the reclusive author felt most comfortable only in the company of women, that she would limit her book only to the thoughts, feelings, emotions, and habits of women. In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, men are never permitted to occupy center stage, nor are they shown interacting independently with other men. If a man is present in any scene, so must a woman to control and observe his actions. Men--even the eventually triumphant Darcy--are generally portrayed as vain, sycophantic, sarcastic, and totally aware that they they are prized only for their money.The world of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, especially if one has seen the fine film version starring Greer Garson, is one that seems to have been built for women to inhabit. All the women wear flouncy, bouncy dresses with huge flowered hats that Scarlet O'Hara might have worn in GONE WITH THE WIND. Even those ladies that complain of poverty never lack the funds to afford those outrageous outfits. Further, Miss Austen stages a ball in just about every third chapter that permits single women to size up eligible men. As these dandefied women and uniformed men speak to each other, the modern reader probably will be surprised at the excessive politeness and deference tossed unerringly about. This strict adherence to a surface morality ought not to fool the reader into assuming that the characters are as inwardly noble as they are outwardly polite. In fact, behind this massive wall of formal phrasing and good manners lies the same fears, jealousies, and general backstabbing that pervade a modern disco. What gives PRIDE AND PREJUDICE its perpetual charm is the biting irony that causes the reader to wonder: 'Did that character say what I think he (or she) just said?' The modern reader can best appreciate Austen's wit if she can read between the lines to sense the tone of the moment. If such a reader can see that this book is a polite if powerful indictment of a way of life that even Austen wished to poke fun of, then perhaps this reader can appreciate the charm of a book that grows with each successive reading."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Neither but I could not, I repeat could not read this book I fell asleep through the first chapter and could not seem to muster enough effort to read the second chapter. I do like Jane Austen movies, but I think in her books she tends to elaborate on things a bit much for my taste. I commend anyone who has read it through though. It is a wonderful classic with humour and romance this is a must read if you can get through it without dozing off."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"**** UPDATED September 30, 2012 (edited here. Extended comment at bottom) ********Pros: A great heroine and romantic story.Cons: The language can be a struggle in the beginning.The Bottom Line: The heroine of the story, Elizabeth Bennet, is one of my top 10 favorites.The story:A young woman, Elizabeth Bennet, is the second eldest of five girls (no boys as the heir). She is a very realistic woman who doesn't believe that beauty or wealth should hinder her from a happy life and marriage. While her sisters give their hearts out to people too quickly. The mother allows all five girls to be \\"out\\" (allowed to find suitors) due to her fears. She is worried that when her husband dies they will be destitute - which is true at the times lifestyle.Elizabeth takes her time in finding her ideal man. She is very proud of her family and prejudice toward the wealthy. Lydia and Kittie (two youngest sisters) are hilarious, and they believe in love at first site of a navy sailor. This doesn't go so well for one of them - i.e. a Mr. Wickham. Mary is the unfortunate middle child whom is neither gifted in \\"the arts\\" nor with words. Jane and Lizzie (Elizabeth), the older two sisters, are more reserved with their hearts. Mr. Darcy also is prejudice and proud, especially when he tries to ruin Jane and Mr. Bingley's relationship. His reasons is that he doesn't see Jane's love towards his friend. The connected relationships all fit perfectly together. Jane Austen shows a new ideal marriage when Mr. Bennet intends to marry off his daughters only if their mate was equal to them - meaning that the marriages should be equal.The language:It's a little difficult to read at first, and my only suggestion is that you should remember that it was written before our time. Most of the words are in the dictionary, but the grammar has definitely changed over the century. Jane Austen also enjoys excessively writing about one subject in the story, which can be difficult to sit through to read. But it still shows that Jane is a great author, especially during her time.My thoughts on the book besides the ones that I've already given is that the book is one of my favorite Austen books, because it has a strong heroine character that I can relate to. The family values are very modern, but yet it also gives a feminist-like style when the characters like Elizabeth are intelligent, and aren't too afraid to speak their mind. This book is a great classics book that I have read numerous times, and am still interested in reading in the future.cheersmichelle (2002)******UPDATE********So 10 years later and after an excessive amount of writing and reading classes, I feel this needs an update.Austen's writing is always a woman's point of view. It's beautifully written with rich characters so that you always feel like you're apart of the story. Austen's fan base is more popular with woman rather than the macho man because she expresses feelings. Her characters communicate to each other rather than shut their feelings away. In the case of 'Pride and Prejudice' these feelings spoken won't always help the character due to either their pride or prejudice.In my experience men are not keen to the idea of talking about how they feel. Austen not only shows this but she allowed woman of her era to have a voice - even if it wasn't etiquette. So men, you should just bear through all the woman talk. And when reading through their blabbering, think about their behavior. Are they childish (I.e. Lydia and Kitty)? Are they behaving with etiquette?The romance in this book is genuine. I can't help but wish for a Mr. Darcy for myself. Austen did a good job in \\"showing\\" us her characters love - rather than today's authors whom \\"tell.\\" This is the example of show your feelings rather than verbally giving them untill our heads are bashed in."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is a wonderful work that definitely is a window into the life of the 18th century.

It takes place in 18th Century, Longbourn, England. The two main characters of this book are Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. In the beginning of the story they do not get along at all. I think that the antagonist of this story is Lady Catherine de Bourgh. This story is about the interaction between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. They have several encounters throughout the book and some of them weren't so friendly. Elizabeth is witty and sarcastic, while Mr. Darcy is perceived as proud and arrogant. This book is about the both of them learning to overcome their differences and falling in love somewhere in the middle.I really like the way Jane Austen writes, it is very descriptive and you can see a clear picture in your head of exactly what she's saying. She starts out with her main character and you know exactly who they are and where they're coming from. But then you get to read and see how they change throughout the story. I think that the theme of this story is to look from other people's perspectives and not be so centered on yourself and you might be surprised what you find. When I was first assigned to read a classic I wasn't thrilled, but then as I got reading I came to find that I really loved this book and now it's probably one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"That was a very interesting audio book - I had never read the book and now I know."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride & Prejudice has turned out to be my favorite book when it comes to romance novels...and that's saying something since I'm a 21 year old who reads ALOT.Elizabeth Bennet is such a smart and kind, yet of course flawed heroine, that I felt like I actually got to know her. Austen made her characters so tridimensional I was amazed...not many writers arecapable of that.When it comes down to Mr.Darcy, I was extremely satisfied with him as well, and every time I read a scene with him and Elizabeth , I giggled at their witty replies to each other, they most definitely made me swoon.Learned from this.

This novel didn't get interesting to me until page 202. If you look above at the total page number, you'll see this is WELL into the novel.I didn't feel any tension? Any real conflict?So there's a woman living in a house with her parents (both of whom are pretty kooky, though Mama Bennet takes the cake) and four sisters (only one of whom seems remotely redeemable.) They talk, they walk, they go to parties, they get interested in marriage then get dumped, then someone else wants to marry one of them but moves away, more parties, some sewing, some cards, yada yada yada.I read this novel searching for WHAT in the world it is people like about it.Then it hit me: the tension is the life depicted.Jane Austen was living this life-an exceedingly intelligent woman (evidenced by her prose) who is made to reside behind doors hoping a man will marry her and hoping he is someone she'll respect.An insipid existence. A passive life for an active mind.The conflict isn't within the characters. The conflict is between the author and her readers.So how does Austen portray the absurdity of her life without alienating her readers? She creates an intelligent woman and then contrasts her with absurd characters. She gives us Jane, a sweet woman who is considered beautiful by everyone (though her mind is given no notice.) She gives us Elizabeth, a smart girl who is forever compared to her socially perfect sister. She gives us a mother who wants nothing but five sons-in-law, a father who can barely stand the presence of any of these women (or their prospective boyfriends), and a trio of silly sisters either buried in books or the mirror. Their ultimate life goal? Marriage.Having no money makes acheiving this goal very difficult.Wanting love? Equality? Conversation that isn't empty? Nearly impossible.Along comes cranky but rich Mr. Darcy.Somehow Austen has to find a way to make the rich guy see the poor woman's intelligence, and the poor woman see the rich (arrogant) guy's shrewdness.Both of them are trapped in an absurd game. Both of them know it's an absurd game but neither of them can say it's absurd, and Austen daren't let on she knows it's absurd because everyone buying the book is trapped in the very same game.She displays her novel as a light-hearted love story. In truth, I think it's a firestorm. She's shouting, as loud as she dares, \\"Does anyone else think this is stupid?\\"If you're reading for entertainment, it starts around 202.

Listening to this work is thus a truly refreshing experience.In addition, the main characters, the Bennett sisters, have limited interests. With no educational, professional or political concerns, their only concern is to get married, what will guarantee their future social and financial status. They lead simple, sheltered lives and apparently have no notion of the work and efforts put in by servantsto produce dinners, balls, gowns, etc.The writing style is congruent with the times. The work itself is very long, meticulously written with very slow, restricted action.The audio book's narrator is truly excellent and succeeds, while remaining unaffected, to add dramatic interest by very astutely modifying her voice for each character.All in all, this novel is heartily recommended for a worthwhile escape from our hectic 21st century."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is amazing and perfect for anyone just being introduced to Austen.

It is unfortuante I waited until my 30s to read it. A true classic I'll never tire of reading again and again!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"What could I possibly say about Jane Austen's most famous novel that hasn't already been said? Even those who haven't read it surely know the name Mr Darcy, and how he's the romantic ideal of every housewife around the world. Everyone knows that he and Elizabeth Bennett are one of the most famous examples of a dislike-at-first-sight acquaintance that gradually matures into mutual respect and understanding, and I'm sure a healthy portion of that generalized \\"everyone\\" also knows that the novel also contains Austen's requisite commentary on class, marriage, wealth and families. Witty, self-deprecating Elizabeth is one of the most beloved heroines of all times (to this day, I find that I will always like a female protagonist if she reminds me of Elizabeth) and the novel itself begins with what is one of the most famous opening lines in English literature: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\"The true meaning of this line is obvious, and sets the tone for the entire novel: that it is not young men who are on the search for wives, but young women who are in want of eligible husbands, and that it is only society and decorum that dictates that the search should be undertaken by the men. Like all Austen's novels, the story is told from the point of view of a young woman, just beginning to find her place in the community and the world, and who is expected by everyone around her to be on the look-out for a husband. Yet this is not the first thing on Elizabeth Bennett's mind - as the second of five sisters, she's more preoccupied with keeping her younger sisters in check and making sure her beloved elder sister Jane is well matched in life. And if it's to a wealthy bachelor, then so much the better! Although reasonably well-off, the Longbourne estate is entailed on a cousin of their father, and so the girls face grim futures if they do not marry well before their father's death.A cynical and sarcastic recluse, Mr Bennett spends most of his time either baiting or avoiding his vacuous wife, whose most pressing concern in life is to marry off her daughters. Her prospects are suddenly promising when news comes that the neighboring estate of Netherfield is being lent out to a young man by the name of Mr Bingley: pleasant, wealthy, and immediately smitten with Jane. However, society is considerably less impressed by Bingley's companion. Mr Darcy is cold, arrogant and snobbish, who, on being invited to dance with Elizabeth, says of her: \\"\\"she is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me.\\"Elizabeth takes an immediate disliking to him, an attitude that is only enforced when she meets the charismatic Mr Wickham who tells her he was the son of the late Mr Darcy's steward, and that the present Mr Darcy robbed him of his rightful inheritance as stipulated in his father's will. A further black mark against Darcy is drawn when Elizabeth learns that he (along with Bingley's spiteful sisters) has deliberately forced a wedge between Mr Bingley and Jane, in the attempt to \\"save\\" his friend from a bad match.It is to her utmost astonishment then, when Mr Darcy tells Elizabeth that he's in love with her and proposes marriage. Telling her that he's struggled against his will, reason and character in order to take this action, (and pointing out obvious disadvantages of the match - on his side), Elizabeth is hardly impressed by his assumption that she'll accept him, and takes the opportunity to tell him exactly what she thinks of him.And yet after this disastrous encounter, Elizabeth begins to learn more about her rejected suitor and his circumstances. Perhaps she's been blinded by her own prejudice against him, just as his pride initially made him so un-gentleman-like toward her...One misconception concerning \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the belief that Elizabeth and Darcy are an early example of the \\"belligerent sexual tension\\" clich&eacute;, in which two characters hide their secret attraction to each other by pretending that they dislike each other. This assumption has always bugged me, as it is certainly *not* what is at work here. Austen is not only poking fun at the notion of love at first sight, but more importantly, is riffing the idea that two people would try to hide their passion by pretending that they don't like each other (the foolish Mr Collins believes that Elizabeth deliberately refuses his marriage proposal just because women often pretend to reject their suitors to hid their true feelings). Elizabeth and Darcy are legitimately unimpressed by each other at the start of the novel, but it is their growing understanding and desire to become a better person for the sake of the other that makes up their storylines. Both of them have to change in order to deserve each other: Elizabeth to overcome her prejudice, and Darcy to realize that he \\"has been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.\\"In a similar vein, it's important to note that Elizabeth - although prejudiced - is not entirely mistaken when it comes to accessing Mr Darcy's character. Although there is more to the Wickham story than meets the eye, her perception of him as arrogant and proud is indeed correct. It is her words to him after his proposal that force Darcy to reassess all that he's learnt in his lifetime; yet when she learns the truth and cries \\"till this moment I never knew myself,\\" we can see just how shaken she is to learn that her judgment is not as infallible as she thought it was.Different readers take different things from \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" - at its most simplistic, it's a Cinderella story about a worthy young woman who marries the man of her dreams and by doing so elevates her social standing. On a more contextual level, others approach the text as a vigorous satire of the social norms and expectations of Austen's day, in which the desperate hunt for a husband to ensure a woman's future has to be hidden beneath the constraints of civilized society.Although the novel may seem deceptively small in scope and content (in regards to the setting and general theme of marriage) this is a story that explores the depth of human relationships and the need for personal growth; a simple story about complex characters. Though it is not widely thought to be Austen's best novel - that distinction often goes toEmma- whichever way you look at it, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is considered Austen's lightest and most entertaining read, and is certainly her most famous. If you haven't read it yet - what are you waiting for?"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice: a probing study of human nature or just another love story? Jane Austen's novel enables the reader to embark on a journey with moments of laughter, suspense, frustration, and delight. Although Pride and Prejudice may seem like a love story on a superficial level, a deeper look reveals the complex themes of reputation, class, stereotypes, and first impressions.Exploring characters from different walks of life, Jane Austen effectively and passionately develops the personas of her characters, enrapturing the reader. First impressions can be dangerous and the author implies that society must discard preconceived notions and, in turn, explore beyond the surface. Elizabeth Bennett, the novel's protagonist, captivates the reader with her independent, free-spirited, and quick-witted nature. An anomaly of her time, Lizzy refuses to marry solely for status, for love is essential and she will not compromise her values for power and wealth. Her character is refreshing as compared to her marriage-obsessed mother, materialistic and pedantic sisters, and pompous aristocrats. However, no matter how much the reader hates these characters, he or she realizes that Austen has accomplished her goal of exposing these diverse individuals for who they truly are.The development of relationships and the characters themselves also enthrall the reader. First appearing as a pompous snob, Darcy initially repulses the reader, but through the progression of the novel, the reader begins to see Darcy as the kind, generous man that he is. On the other hand, Wickham appears to be the helpless victim of Darcy, but this false impression is quickly erased. Appearance versus reality is a reoccurring theme throughout the novel which forces the reader to resist deception and search for truth.The reader laughs with Mr. Bennett, cringes at Mrs. Bennet, sympathizes with Jane, flinches at the haughty remarks of Caroline Bingley, and wants to knock some sense into immature Lydia. The strength of the story lies in Austen's depiction of love as an element that can surmount class boundaries. Taken through twists and turns, the reader experiences love ignited, love broken, and love rekindled. But is this is a typical love story? Although Pride and Prejudice ends like a typical enchanted love story, Austen's development of the characters, storyline, and her shattering of class shackles enables the reader to acknowledge that the story serves a deeper purpose."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice: a probing study of human nature or just another love story?

It was not only a touching love story, but also an accurate reflection of the Victorian society in that era. The story evolved heavily on the complications among different classes. The pride within each character and prejudice between them further enriched the novel. Some characters, such as Darcy and Lizzie, found themselves fighting among their pride, prejudice and their affections for each other revealed an idea that true love outweighs anything and everything. Each character in the novel contrasted significantly in terms of their characteristics. We can recall these contrasts among the five Bennet sisters, Mr. and Mrs. Bennets, and Darcy and Bingley. Another interesting point revealed by Jane Austen is that characters with similar characteristic attracts. We can see this through the two loving couples, Jane and Bingley, Lizzie and Darcy.These complications and challenges that each character had to struggle within themselves made the novel Pride and Prejudice a great masterpiece."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"In comparison to Tess of the d'Urbervilles, Pride and Prejudice is a refreshing romance comedy which brings to life the humor of 18th century society. Jane Austen's style is so stellar. She leaves nothing unsettled or unhappy. They way each character is tied in with the plot is amazing, from Mr. Collins and charlotte's marriage, which brings Elizabeth to lady Catherine and Darcy, to the Gardeners transaction with Darcy during the chase for Lydia, proving Darcy's love for Elizabeth. Jane is a sweet character and Bingly is her perfect match. Darcy and Elizabeth as well are the epitome of romance. Elizabeth cannot marry anyone she cannot love, and to her, love is someone who she can connect with on all levels. When she and Darcy fight, it should only be taken as a sign of their compatibility because she is not afraid to answer him and he enjoys it. Lydia and Mrs. Bennet are incredibly irritating, however they do add to the satirical style of the novel, as Mrs. bennet's sole desire in life has to do with marriage, her own and her daughters. She and Mr Bennet do not share a true love because he married her for her beauty, and now must learn to live with her stupidity. Lydia as well makes a mistake in who she marries. She is too naive to understand that Wickham had no desire to marry her in the first place. She considers the whole ordeal a game, not realizing the gravity of the situation she has put her family in, ruin and disgrace. Bingly's sisters take on the &quot;wicked step sister&quot; act in trying to keep Bingly from Jane and Elizabeth from Darcy. Charlotte Lucas is an extraordinary character simply because her theories on love are profound and true for the time period. Good book, I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"After reading many excellent, yet somewhat depressing novels, Austen&#8217;s Pride and Prejudice, came as refreshing and uplifting treat.

Her humor shines through the biting sarcasm of Mr. Bennet's expected, yet amusing remarks about Mrs. Bennet's &quot;nerves,&quot; and his daughter's suitors, namely Mr. Collins. This unctuous character also provided us with a few laughs by quietly portraying the absurdity of society's emphasis on &quot;connections&quot; with the upper class.Another part of the novel, which we greatly enjoyed, was the blooming romance between Darcy and Elizabeth. Though their union was much anticipated, we were kept on our toes by the many twist and turns it took throughout the novel. At one point, we were greatly disappointed with Darcy's overbearing arrogance when he made it explicitly clear to Elizabeth that it was against his own will to love her. But then we were heart warmed by his kindness to her and the Gardiners at the Pemberley estate, exemplifying his true character.Aside from its humor and romance, this novel also prides itself in its vivid illustrations of class structures of early 19th century England. Austen clearly depicts the importance and influence of the social classes on every aspect of life, predominantly marriage, wealth, education, and values. One scene, which we believed to be a great example of Austen's comprehensive knowledge of the social classes, is when Lady Catherine rudely confronts Elizabeth on Darcy's proposal to marry her, all the while mocking her estate, her family, and her life. Yet, Elizabeth once again proves her superior attitude and strength as an independent woman, and takes Lady Catherine's comments with wisdom and maturity.Truly a classic, Pride and Prejudice exemplifies a sincere love that breaks social boundaries. Throughout its 150 years of publication Pride and Prejudice has remained a cornerstone of the literary world, and we recommend it to everyone. And beware; this book ends with a bang, in more ways than one."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"i absolutely adore this book. i have read it 4 times and i would recommend it to anyone. it has interesting characters, a very complex and engaging plot, and you learn alot about english society during austin's time. jane austin is a very gifted writer. i have also read sense and sensibility and presuasion, both very good books, but pride and prejudice will always be my favorite."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"When i read this book for the first time, i just thought that it was just same as the other love story.But after i read twice and three times, i found that it's obviously different from any other romantic books.It's the only one book for reflect of women's life in society.and i really want to be a character like lizzy:)I think that it's the only book to express feminism."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I loved the book!

I'm not especially surprised, and to the males, don't blame yourselves if you can't penetrate Jane Austen (it is undoubtedly more appealing to the female mind), although I must vouch for P&amp;P and pity those who pass over this excellent novel. The whole charm of the story lies in the high vocabulary which Elizabeth, Jane, Darcy and the rest employ, and the wonderful language creates a rapid succession of wit, romance, and observation on human absurdity, in style. ~~~~ It's hard to understand how people can find this book dull, for the very first chapter rolls out a lively discussion between Mr. and Mrs. Bennet. In my opinion, Pride and Prejudice only gets better as you go on; I admit to once finishing the novel and promptly rereading it one day later. Also to smiling for one week straight, for Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. ~~~~ Please don't come to Jane Austen only to criticize her subject matter-- every author has a style and a realm of experience which make their books unique. If you think the young ladies' endless pursuits of wealthy marriages to be old-fashioned and petty, they are! But Jane Austen crafts the novel with a skill and wit that lets the novel at once both expose how ludicrous that English society was and yet create lively and very human characters you have to love; and therein lies its charm. Pride and Prejudice is a lovely combination of sly humor, exasperation, and romance that make it one of my favorites. I hope it will be one of yours too-- don't give up on Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy before you even know them!

Elizabeth Bennet is a heroine that cannot be forgotten; her wit and sense are apparent throughout the whole story. Darcy is a mysteriously romantic character who, despite his cutting remarks, remains irrestistable.

Visits are exchanged between the households and Bingley falls in love with the eldest Bennett daughter ,Jane.The second daughter ,Elizabeth, and Darcy circle each other warily.There is much verbal sparring and Elizabeth-clever,witty and ironic-finds herself intrigued by Darcy while being repelled by his apparent aloofness and seemingly arrogant demeanour.She also hears negative things of him from other people.Events conspire to keep the pair apart and a mix of social snobbery,self-will and just plain misunderstandings are other barriers that must be overcome if true love is to triumph over its enemies -pride and prejudice.I have concentrated above on the relationship between darcy and Elizabeth but while this is the key relationship in the book it also has some well drawn supporting figures such as Lady Catherine de Bourgh ,a monster of snobbery and self-satisfaction personifying the aristocaracy at its worst and Mr Collins ,the oleaginous and toadying clergyman whose true colours emerge in his cringe worthy proposal to Elizabeth.The book is popular as a romance and while recognising this dimension to it have to say that for me it works best as a social comedy and an acute dissection of manners and relationships.It is among the great literary comedies as well as romances and is very clear eyed and unsentimental about such matters as marriage and social convention .This is not just a museum piece and deserves its wide readership"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This was an assigned reading book in 7 grade.

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Austen wrote PRIDE and PREJUDICE in the mid-1790's and it is definitely a reflection of it's times. She speaks of an era where 'true' gentlemen did not engage in 'trade' (a term encompassing what today would include professions) and doing so would definitely lower not only him but his extended family's social status. Women were considered educated if they could play the piano well, or sing, or draw or were skilled at decorative needlework. The only acceptable occupation for a gentlewoman was marriage, an enterprise that her extended family was commited to helping her achieve for the alternative was spinsterhood as a dependent to some family member.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE centers on the Bennet family, a quiet country gentleman of modest means who lives with his wife and five daughters in southern England. As the story begins his family is in an uproar over the news of an eligible gentleman moving to the neighborhood. To the delight of Mrs. Bennet it quickly becomes apparent that Jane, the eldest daughter, has caught his eye. This is of special importance, since at 22 Jane's prospects are beginning to fade. The romance is not without obstacles which are further complicated by the romance of her next younger sister, the outspoken Elizabeth and the outrageous behavior of Lydia, the youngest daughter. In the end though, love, or at least matrimony, conquers all.The story begins rather slowly but the descriptions of the characters alone make it worth pressing on to the finish. Austen manages to bring them to life to the extent that the reader will probably be able to describe each in detail. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE has been called the first comic romance, and, although subtle by today's standards, some of the comic scenes are hysterical.If this novel were written by a 21st century author it would probably be about a third shorter, not a better novel but a more accessible one to a modern reader. The 18th century style with it's long, complicated sentences filled with detail make for slow reading, frustrating for a reader who is anxious for some action. It is also a bit difficult for a modern day reader to comprehend the culture that Austen is describing, one where a young woman walking alone is considered improper, where having a lawyer in the family is an embarrassment, where a wealthy country family could select the local minister. For a reader unfamiliar with this time period, particularly for a younger reader, an annotated edition would probably be helpful."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable. The Enriched Classics edition is also nice because it includes footnotes explaining some of the language and/or references that were well known at the time but confusing today's readers.In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is probably my favorite classics. I don't devote too much time to reading classics but I've read some good ones before. They are not really my style but I do like the ones I have read. The different style is refreshing.The book is written much differently than books are written these days. I was reading the begining of the book while I was tiered. I realized that I hadn't understood anything I'd read. I had to go and read again when I was completely awake.It was enjoyable. I loved the characters; they were smarter than so many characters in other books and were very well spoken. That may, however, been how most people were in the 19th century.It was fun to watch Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go on with their love hate relationship. Until the end it was a lot of hate.I thought it was a good classic but having not read many classics I'm not sure how it compares. Better than Wuthering Heights and not as good or as good as Great Expectations.-cdm"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Romance has very little to do with this book--it is one of the funniest novels I have ever read!

She Writes so well, it is no wonder she is one of the best known authors of all time. Pride and Prejudice has got to be the best book I have ever read. I love Elizabeth Bennet, even more because I am also an Elizabeth myself and I feel I can relate very well to her in many ways. I just adore this book, I could hardly put it down, I finally had to stop reading when my butt started falling asleep. I is so exciting to find out who will marry who, and to see Mr. Darcy change his manners and Elizabeth change her mind. The elegance of the novel truly added to the characters and the setting. I loved Mr. Bennet, and how he and Mrs. Bennet argued so casually. This book makes me want to get married and find a Mr. Darcy of my own. Read this book and enjoy!!! It is truly marvelous!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This book is just plain fun!

The title kept from reading for a long time, but when I finally did, I was amazed. The realistic characters made me laugh and cry. I felt like I could sympathize with Eliza.

I love reading, but this book just seemed a bit boring. Well, once I began reading it, my opinion drastically changed. It is so well-written. The characters are so real- granted, some are a bit exaggerated, but that seems to be Austen's point...exaggerating the faults of society. The tension between Elizabeth and Darcy, and the subplots with the other characters draw together a fine novel. I also completely enjoyed the fact that there was not a lot of description in the book; it let you form your own opinion of how the settings and characters looked.

I'm not sure what it is about this book, but I'm hooked. I have read it and reread it countltess times. My small paperback book shows how well it's loved, pages crinkeld, some stained. There's something about opening the book and reading the lines those lines which are so familiar to me that gives me a comforting feeling,. It's the same feeling as coming home after a long time. If I was stranded on a desert island this book is what I'd take with me because it offers a solice like no other. I'd highly reccomend this book to anyone.

I was introduced to her with Northanger Abbey and was pleasantly surprised with the humor; this book had humor of the same type but it was refreshing to see it coming from a female protagonist. Two thumbs up (and more if I had them!)"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I found Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice to be a historically informative and interesting read. I am fascinated with the society and culture of the past, and find that only through reading can I visit this era. I found the dialogue very amusing as well as the characters mannerisms and behavior. As to their behavior, Ms. Austen could not have captured the essence of human nature any better than she did. She is able to show people's tendency to be insecure; selfish; arrogant; judgmental; opportunistic, and overly passionate. Elizabeth Bennet, was refreshingly unconventional with her frank and direct honestly and her wry humor. The conclusion satisfies the thirst for an outpouring of emotion, for Ms. Austin establishes a good degree of tension, which increases the farther in the story one goes. What I found unfavorable was the plot's slow progression and its tendency to drag. Mr. Darcy is rarely heard in the beginning although I admit he does appear more during the end. I also feel that Elizabeth's dislike of Mr. Darcy lasted too long, which resulted in choking the romance out of it. Along with its slow progression, I found the book to be slightly confusing at times. This is due in part to the language that I find simultaneously charming, as well as to the characters' tendencies to go on and on about a subject of no particular importance."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a satirical commentary on nineteenth century society. Austen uses dry humor and irony to show the absurdities of her time. Extreme characters such as Mr. Collins and Mrs. Bennet are used to accentuate the sexism of her society, and characters such as Miss Bingley and Lady Catherine De Bough are used to show the culture's obsession with wealth and power. Austen uses the character Elizabeth Bennet to counter these negative values. Elizabeth does not conform to the society's beliefs of how women should act, and she believes in marrying only for love. This novel is enjoyable to read, although it is at times wordy and somewhat predictable. The general plot is not overly exciting or suspensful. However, the problems of sexism and egotism examined in this work are issues still prevelent today. Therefore, readers, especially young women, can relate to this novel. As an AP English student, I would not highly recomend this novel to other AP students. While I did enjoy reading it, I did not find it to be on the same level as the other books I read this year. It took little analysis to find the &quot;deeper meaning&quot; of the novel. Although it was not as chalenging as other books that I have read this year, many of the themes would lend nicely to the final thematic question on the exam. I would not replace another AP novel with this, but I would read it as a supplement to the AP curriculum."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This book was in amazing condition.

But I guess they will get that with age ;)"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This book is appropriately titled because the focus of the story is about social prejudices and preconceptions. The main character struggles to find her place in the world while dealing with social pressures and expectations. She falls in love with a man that is from a different rank, so the commentary on society ends up being wrapped in a love story. If you like British literature from that time period, you will love this story. I think it is a good book, but it's not really my particular genre."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I do not often find myself reading female authors, but when I do, it is always in the classics. Jane Austen is deserved known as one of the best. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is witty and memorable. I need not say more. I cannot see how this brilliant work could do anything but polarise opinion, there is no middle ground."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I always feel unworthy to review anything classical, or that even written a long time ago, for the simple fact it is not my place to critise the masters of the written work, or to even begin to understand what it was like to live in that era. Therefore, I am left without an option but to base a review on the level of my enjoyment, which is no reflection of how great the novel is written or what a classical piece of artistry it may be. I cannot give this novel 5 stars because I truely found my attentiion wavering, and I felt thankful that the book, which seemed drawn out to me, was closing to end. It is undoubtably a classic storyline, the 'prejudice' of Mr Darcy, the love developing between the unlikely, but I had seen the movie, and generally knew the storyline, but felt to fully apperciate this story, I must have read it. Maybe that contributed to the sense of boredom that came with this novel to a degree, particularly whilst it was winter (in the novel) and Mr Darcy and Jane's friend were out of town. I got sick of the letters in the book, and began to think about other things while reading them, increasing the time it took me to read it. Sadly, I think with a increased patience, I could have really liked this novel, but I just was thankful I had finished it. I am sorry to burst any 'Pride and Prejudice loving' bubbles, just telling it how I saw it. Then again, I don't really know that much about the classics."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I buy the books for my wife and she is enjoying them in her retirement along with all the other products we purchased from Amazon"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Since it was free, I decided to read \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" again. I was hoping I would like it more than I did when I was in college. I know you are all going to hate me, and never look at another one of my reviews, but honestly it is one of the few titles that I actually believe I liked the movie better. There, I said it. Maybe it is because modern screenwriters are able to present their attraction to each other better than Jane Austen could in 1800's. The movie is one of my favorites. I still get chills when Mr. Darcy tells Elizabeth she has bewitched him.

That's my review, and I'm sticking to it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Sorry, I don't want to step on any toes, but I found Pride & Prejudice to be slow and plodding. In fact, I finished it only for the sake of doing so. Since it was written by a woman and is told primarily from a woman's perspective, given its considerable popularity I can only assume that it is enjoyed more by women than by men. If it wasn't a classic I might even have given it two stars (and I enjoy many of the classics very much)."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Why is this still being published? How does anyone finish this stuff? The women are pathetic, their lives meaningless; the men are shallow; thank goodness I don't have to live in such a self centred universe.

The romance between Eliza and Darcy is thrilling. The characters of Eliza's parents are hilarious. I loved the style of the writing-not flowery or rambling.

One doesn't feel detached from the plot and conflicts despite the myriad differences between Regency England and late 20th century America. In short, &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot; remains my all-time favorite book, bar none. To the high-school student of &quot;Brit Lit&quot; who cannot bear another &quot;thee&quot; or &quot;thou&quot;, take a chance on this book. Austen is a refreshing change, and will most likely prove a pleasant surprise."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is the type of book that you never want to end. Jane Austen has an incredible way of connecting her characters to one another and makes the reader anxiously anticipate the story's final love scene. Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy are two of the most unforgettable characters in literature. The transformations of their characters is lovely to experience, over and over again!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the best books I've read. The characters are realistic, yet all are classic 'types'. Elizabeth and Darcy play well off each other, with quazi-ralistic dialoge and beautiful settings. The book lets the modern reader into a time and place not seen any more. The fashions, people, and places are all interesting. Austen tells a wonderful story with side plots and interesting characters. You'll laugh at Mr. Collins' speeches and Mr. Bennet's way of looking at the world, get angry at Lady Catherine and her high handed ways, and dispair over Lydia's and Mrs. Bennet's silliness.

I fought my way out of the pilot seat against the compiling G-forces and scrambled with a sob in my throat through the open hatchway.Tumbling in free fall. Feeling of helplessness.

Elizabeth Bennett was ahead of her times, a lady who paled in the beauty of her sister. And I would love to meet someday a man like Fitzwilliam Darcy who can see through her lack of means and radiating sister to see the real woman whom he can truly love. And each of the five sisters represent a stereotype of women in literature in those days. The beautiful, the independent nurturer, the bookworm, the flirt, and the follower. Everyone ends up with someone in the end who matches their personalities with the exception of Mary, who stays with the woebegone father.

The story depicts the charactes of the beautiful Jane,witty Elizabeth,their mother and father,the handsome Mr.Darcy, the Bingleys and the Lucases.Jane Austen's spirited Elizabeth,charms her way into the proud and cold heart of Mr.Darcy.

I can't really say what makes it that fabulous, but once you started reading, you can't stop. Jane Austen had fully developed the characteristics of Elizabeth, and made her very human. The feelings stitched into the story has made an impact on the readers' mind, enabling to feel for the characters themselves.

I was not quite certain what to think.....that is until I started to get into the book. This novel is a delightful and intriguing romantic comedy. The pride of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett's prejudice against him are overcome as they learn that love can and does conquer. Elizabeth was a character I could relate to. She was not afraid to stand up for herself and overcame conventions, like walking through mud to see her sick sister, Jane!Perhaps I am not the most qualified to write a review of Jane Austen's work, but I know what I like. This book had me laughing from beginning to end. With Mr. Collins' &quot;speeches&quot; and Mrs. Bennett desperately trying to marry off all her daughter's, who can help themselves?

I was pretty much forced to read this book for a summer reading assignment. I found it to be utterly boring. The real question here is why do I really care if the mother has all of her daughters married off to wealthy parnters, or any partner if it must come down to it? Maybe it was a big deal back in the time, but nobody cares nowadays. Maybe it is a 'literary masterpiece', but then why the heck is it so boring? We need to move on from the old 'classics'. They mean nothing to readers (are there many left?) of the modern society."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and prejudice, is a novel on the love and hate of a man and a woman who are perfect for each other from the beginning but do not realize it until the end. It is about how a great love overcomes the prejudices that two of the main characters have for each other. This novel, in my opinion was everlasting and boring. One would be able to predict the outcome of the novel from the beginning, but must spend endless hours of reading to finally see the plot unwind. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy have a great hate for each other in the beginning, but slowly, thorough out the novel, begin to bid farewell to their prejudices of each other and find a love for each other they never knew they could have. I did not enjoy reading this novel due to the fact that romance is not my favorite topic, especially when it is \\"old school\\" love. I did not appreciate this book in anyway and wish that I never chose to read it. I would not recommend this book to anyone who hates reading as much as I do and is disturbed at the fact that one would enjoy reading about love when they can just look out the window and see it happening right in front of them. Pride and Prejudice is a novel that did not interest me, but may interest those old grannies that jump and express their happiness when everlasting romance novels end in happiness."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I hated this book. It was difficult to read, because Austen never seemed to get to the point, and everything seemed to happen so slowly. The characters seemed so pompous, it was ridiculous. I had to read this book for a class, and disliked it so much, i didn't even remember that I had read it (repressing it in my mind). It wasn't until one of my friends who had also been in that class reminded me that we had read it that I even remembered that i HAD read it.

Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between &quot;serious&quot; works of literature like this one and allegedly &quot;lesser&quot; novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are &quot;better&quot; than any others, and the concept of a &quot;great novel&quot; is an intellectual hoax."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Please, this was an utterly unconvincing and boring novel. If it wa written today it would be internationally acclaimed for being a dummed down soap opera. Unfortunately, having been composed in, what, the 1830s, it has become a period drama style romance novel, where instead of foreplay, they have to bow and curtsy and everything. Althought this may appeal to worthless romantics, it will not perform well to the MTV generation. The movie starred Hugh Grant. Please........."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Jane Austen, is a book about the life of a girl, Elizabeth Bennet. She has five sisters and lives with her mother and father in 18th century England. The story tells of her sisters' loves and marriages. Elizabeth's youngest sister gets married to a man of questionable character, who happens to be the friend of the man that Elizabeth herself loves, Mr. Darcy. Of course Elizabeth's love isn't that simple, since she first has to hate Mr. Darcy and then blames him for everything that her sister is going through. Jane, Elizabeth's oldest sister, falls in love with another of Darcy's friends. All the trouble that any of Elizabeth's not-quite-normal family has is blamed on Mr. Darcy.Basically, the whole book is about an 18th century girl whining about her upper middle class life. Of course, at the end, she gets exactly what she wants and everyone lives happily ever after. There is credit to be given to Jane Austen, since she wrote the book in an American household in the early 1800s, with no support from any of her family. She had to hide her writing under knitting or sewing whenever someone approached. She then had a friend publish the books she wrote, without telling her husband. Considering all that, the story really isn't that bad, but in general, if you were looking for a book by Jane Austen, Emma would be a better read. If you want a predictable love story, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a good book for you."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Beautifully written from start to finish. The story captures all of your attention as it slowly unfolds. I get lost in all of the beautiful words. Highly recommend to strong and romantic women and men alike."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I personally enjoyed the book. A little slow at first but other than that a classic. It is one of those books that should be read just to have in the archive for reference."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"~3.5/5[Also available on my blog.]I think I'm going to try and keep this review short, just for the fact that I don't have as high, or much, of an opinion as most people do. But I might have more to say than I think.This is my first Jane Austen book, and, while I'd wanted to read it for a while, the main reason I finally got around to it, was because of The Lizzie Bennet Diaries. Which, if you aren't watching those, whether you've read the book or not, you should. It's... simply amazing. I love it.But I'm talking about the book, so let me get back to that.When I started the book, I was afraid it was going to be long and droning and boring, given the time period it was written, and it kind of was, in parts. There were a lot of dry parts in this book, a lot of slow points, and the language was rather boring at some points. There were long sentences, huge paragraphs, not nearly as much dialogue, and sometimes it was a bit hard for me to follow. There were, though, some scenes, some chapters or plots, that I really enjoyed, and those went by really fast, whereas other ones took way too long to get through.My main annoyance with the writing was how tell and not show it was. There were countless times that the reader would be told about something that had happened, some scene we didn't get to see, and sometimes even some kind of characteristic that a character had. And the one reason I'm even a little okay with those things is that, with the characters, it was made apparent in their attitude that what we were told was true, and with the scenes, if we were shown them, the book would have been longer, and I probably wouldn't have enjoyed that. It still annoyed me, though; is probably the thing I least liked about this book.Next, the characters. I liked Elizabeth enough, I suppose, but didn't really care too much about her either way. The same with most of the characters, actually. I liked Mr. Bennet. I liked the romantic relationships. I wasn't too big a fan of Bingley, most of the time, because he just seemed too prideful and full of himself (which I will talk about again in a minute). I didn't think I got to know Lydia very well. Jane seemed alright. I didn't like Caroline, because she was... not a nice person.I liked Darcy at first, but then later on was kind of iffy about him. I knew what was going to happen with him and Lizzy, but somewhere in the middle, his attitude bothered me. I think it just seemed like too big a jump, from him being standoffish to really nice to her. But, thinking back on it, it wasn't too bad, actually. I did like their relationship, so there's that.Now, the pride thing. After reading the book, I understand what the title means, and I'm kind of okay with it. I don't mind the prejudiced thing. But the pride part just annoyed me so much. All of the characters were prideful about one thing or another. Bingley was rather full of himself. As was Darcy. And I just... I guess I feel like some development should have been done there, instead of it just continuing to be that way. They aren't the only characters that were prideful, a lot of them were, but they just made the biggest impression on me.I think that's all I have to say, really. The book wasn't horrible, even if it was droning and boring at times, and had way too much telling. The rating is really so high because of the story line. The plot was good, what with what happened with Lydia, and Jane's change in attitude halfway through, and the ending, and even how some of the characters acted. There were some parts that I really enjoyed.I don't plan on reading any of Austen's other books, though. I do plan on watching some of the Pride and Prejudice movies, and am at the moment watching the miniseries, but that might take a while. They're just so long, and kind of boring to me. I know that most people love this book, though, so don't take my word on it all.I would suggest watching the web series The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, though, because it is amazing, and I honestly think it's better than the book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Loved this book, I have lost count of how many times I've read this book.

That leaves you in tears. Some might say its in a old time theme, but I would like to think the romance in this story is so typical every 2000 kinda day. We live in a world where men and women play the \\"I don't like you card.\\" Even when we have already fallen for that person. Instead of realizing right of the bat they were meant to be. Anyway, if you're looking for a nail biter, empty box of tissues, this is an amazing book. Don't over look it because of the title or date written.

I got a mail telling me it is a free download at 0.00 $, but then Amazon tries to pull 2.30 $ for this 'free' classic. Seems they need every cent now to survive the iPad threat."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I enjoyed \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Jane Austen a great deal more than \\"Sense and Sensibility\\".Elizabeth's sense of humor made her a much more interesting heroine in my opinion. She and her father seemed to enjoy a love for the absurd, although her mother's behavior did embarrass her. Other than that there are many parallels among the characters in the story: Elizabeth and Elinor, Lydia and Marianne, Jane and Mrs. Dashwood, Wickham and Willoughby.It still bothers me that all the women think about is finding a husband, that an \\"accomplished\\" woman \\"sang and played all day\\", but I have to assume that was the world Jane herself was exposed to at the time.You know that with a family that size and all those dinner parties, there had to be some people working very hard in that household, but they are barely ever mentioned and then only in brief passing and only in their concern for the family.Fifty years after these novels were published, we see books such as \\"Little Women\\" by Louisa May Alcott depicting an American family. In this book the characters are much less one sided. Although some of the girls were still thinking primarily of finding husbands, they had to pitch in and help make the world around them.Another fifty years later, \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" by L. M. Montgomery describes a young Canadian woman from a very different set of circumstances who puts the romantic side of life into perspective.Both Jo and Anne are charcters that I would encourage young girls to meet early in life. The Austen women in the books I've read so far, although they may be a study of women from a certain subsection of society in England at the time the novels are written, are not ones I'd place before my daughters."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I picked this book up from my daughter's bookshelf and thought it might be fun to read such a classic. I have to say I am disappointed. About halfway through, I grew so thoroughly bored, I had to put the book down for a few days. It is just a predictable romance novel, nothing especially wonderful or exciting. There is so much conversations and it can get really confusing sometimes."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice, what a long book!!! Pride and Prejudice consists of 3 books. In those days, authors were forced to write extremely long novels, if not, chances are, the novel would have not been printed. With sitting by a fire, and reading the favorite means of entertainment, novels had to be long , to take up time. Basically, thats all Pride and Prejudice did for me, take up time. If the novel would have been condensed into one book, it would have been much better, and probably would have received 5 stars from me. Elizabeth, the star character is very likeable and we all seem to look up to her. Her epiphany......&quot;how despicably have i acted......till this moment I never knew myself!&quot; Is worth reading the novel for."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"i know she is supposed to be one of the classic greats, but i just can't get into her writing (i force myself because i feel that i should read the classics, if only to make me a well rounded reader). i found the book slow going and to be quite honest, boring."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I think I got about a quarter of the way through it and hoped it would get better. The story is hard to follow, too detailed about mundane things. The story line is so slow I just gave up. I enjoy historical romances and I figured a classic, right? Should be good. Nope, it was a waste of my time."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I did not have a favorite chapter but the chapter that I found most interesting is chapter eight because in that chapter Elizabeth and Darcy meet again at the Bingley's house and Darcy feels dumb because Elizabeth had rejected him, and they had not seen each other since that had happened.I feel that this book is for the age group of 20-40 and I think that it's more for girls then guys. I'm not trying to sound sexist, but I don't think that guys would find the story interesting.One literary device that I appreciate is the conflict between Elizabeth and Darcy. Elizabeth does not like Darcy at first, and she rejects him when he proposed. But then she falls in love with him.I found the book all right; it was not that boring. However it was really long and I did not have enough time to read it and understand it well. I would not read this book again because it's not my type of book. I would rather read about action or something that relates to me, or that is interesting to me.By Manuel Rosales"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"i read this book becuase i heard how great it was. it has so many great reviews. honestly i think the book was just ok... too much of nothing was written. i found myself forcing to finish the book thinking it was going to get better. the best part was the end. now i can read a better book. sorry jane austen but this now makes me think twice about reading your other books. i was disappointed."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Of course, literature does not have to be realistic to be great, but for me, it has to have something that is at least so in a figurative level. I find the main characters in this book to be rather shallow. Most pepole go through life without seeing their pride and prejudice, so how can Elizabeth and Darcy do it with such ease? I fail to see, other than a nice, happy story, what gives this novel its value."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I really enjoyed it. I understand why it's a classic. I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is probably the most classic romance novel of all time. I get shivers every time I re-read it and fall in love with the story over and over. While I love most of Austen's other books, this is the one I return to at least once a year."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This book is truly a love story classic. I enjoy all of Jane Austen's work, but this one has always been my favorite. It is beautifully written and has a wonderful ensemble of characters that give real life to the story. Their loss is your loss, and their joy is your joy.A must to read and cherish forever."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have read this novel 6 times and I never get bored of this novel! It seems every time I read this novel that I realize something new about the characters that Jane Austen so cleverly created and what's more is that I enjoy the novel each time as much as I did the first time I read it!! I would definitely recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a great classic with whitty characters and an excellent love story."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"A friend of mine knew that I was working my way through the classics that I didn't read in school, and got me a copy of P&P; for Christmas. Personnally I think this is one of the best works Jane Austen came out with! It took a couple of pages for me to adjust to the antique english, but once I did, I loved immersing myself in a culture long gone. Once or twice I even caused my husband's brows to raise when I accidentally answered him in Olde English!Austen gives just enough detail (thankfully not enough to bore you), allows her main characters to be fallible, and whisks you off into a tale that is wonderfully wrapped up at the very end. None of that here's-the-last-page-sorry-you-still-have-questions nonsense (fine for a series, but definately not a stand-alone)!If you too are looking for an extremely well-written, entertaining classic with a happy ending, don't let all the collegiate level stuff scare you! Give yourself a chance to get used to the old phrases, and give P&P; a chance!A.L.

I have to admit, as and avid Austen fan, I'm a bit obsessed with this one. One cannot come upon better characters than the beautiful and witty (way to be a smart girl!) Elizabeth Bennet, and the tall, brooding, but devilishly handsome (not to mention exceptionally rich) Mr. Darcy. And of course, what better way to start off a romance than with two characters who hate eachother? And Austen does it complete justice--for we all know that they can't stay disgusted for long! However, did we ever expect Lizzy to actually refuse a man who has ten thousand pounds a year? Heck yes! And that's why we love her. I've never come across an author better able to create stunning characters than Miss Jane Austen herself. She's timeless. I highly recommend this book to every person who comes across it. Pride and Prejudice merits the title of MY FAVORITE piece of literature ever written!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"One reviewer (Jane Stewart) thanked me for my input on the \\"revised\\" setting of P&P. My reasoning came after my desire to have the setting be the end of the beautiful 18th Century - not the industrialized 19th. Jane Austen wrote the book in 1796, and it was published 17 years later, but it was the SAME book, and she naturally wrote about her time period. So I deducted 17 years from 1813, which equals 1796. (Note: An astute reviewer on Amazon also pinpointed the timeframe of 1794-1796 with a French action that Jane Austen mentioned, related to P&P.)"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"If you're looking for the Regency as memorialized by Harry Flashman, the regency of his father, with country house parties enlivened with chaps p---sing in corners and keeping all hours (as Flashy says), you've come to the wrong shop (as Flashy says).If you're looking for Sharpe roaring about Spain doing his Peninsular duty while beautiful and passionate ladies shrug off those gauzy empire gowns to reveal naught, knickers not having come in fashion, Miss Austen will give you the right about, and, if that fails, have the servants throw you out.The post-sixties restoration of Austen has I think its origin in a rejection by Western elites of the \\"spirit of the 1960s\\"...which was mostly chaps p---sing in corners and keeping all hours, a second Regency.It was Byronic, it was Blakean, it was mad, it was creative destruction, or destructive creation. I can't remember but it sure was fun.But creative destruction, may I introduce diastolic reproduction? People must be fed, infants amused, servants chastised, houses kept up, and daughters married off.However, \\"creative destruction\\" versus Austen's faith in a serious reproduction of fortunes and daily life forgets and shuns another -tion.This is exploitation. The sensitive reader is appalled of course in a minor key by Mr. Collins' toadying of Lady Catherine. But what's unsaid is that the land on which Austen's heroes lived was stolen land.I would have killed Jane Bennet off in her first fever. In my version, John Paul Jones lands and sets the Bennet's house to the torch. Elizabeth would have been abducted by a motley crew of Red Indians, pirates and Jacobins, to wind up at Waterloo crazed with love for a D'Arcy of a Frog, and nothing to be done.But: the work of art must be accepted on its own terms."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This CD is wonderful.

It's a wonderful classic with just the right amount of everything."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This book is a pandora's box of characters. Best friend, worst enemy, love of your life, and the one you love to hate, all found caught in a romantic tale that combines all the elements of human nature into a realistic struggle between true love and social status. The characters are phenominal. I don't think Jane Austen missed a single type of person, or disposition in her novel. As you learn of her characters and begin to relate to them you will run the emotional gamet. From anger to tears this book will take you into the perspective of multiple people. You will not only see through their eyes but feel what they feel. I don't think there is a single person who couldn't relate to someone in this book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"After reading BRIGID JONES: A DIARY and knowing it was a modern version/take on PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, I decided to read P&amp;P again. It is a beautifully written, carefully crafted story of an English family with five daughters, and they may be on the verge of losing their home and means of support. The main character Elizabeth is a very focused, honest, caring person. She says what needs to be said and does the things that need to be done. She is very observant of peoples personalities and what drives them, at least she believes she is until she meets Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy. That the daughters must marry due to their impending financial situation is never questioned, but who will the future husbands be? What makes Mr. Right, Mr. Right? How can one sister's Mr. Right be so wrong for everyone else but her? With all the social customs and duties is it possible that two people can actually find each other, fall in love and marry? There are characters you will love and characters you will love to hate. It is filled with humor,romance and drama, and enough twists and turns to create a wonderful and very enjoyable story."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is Jane Austen's best, except maybe Northanger Abbey. I wouldn't know, I haven't read it (yet). I couldn't like the characters in Emma, in Persuasion it was depressing, all that worrying it would have a sad end, in Mansfield Park, she was so meek(and no reason for him to fall in love), Sense and Sesibility was meatless, but P&amp;P sparkles. Likeable characters, romance, social commentary, everything."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I previously wrote when I was only Half-way through. I would like to update on what I read since then, now that I have finished the book. It is very well written, with a great plot. Plus, Jane Austen keeps you in suspense, but not TOO much suspense as many books are now. I hightly suggest that you read this book!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The two meet. They are completly wrong for each other, or so they think. Mr. Darcy has too much pride, he thinks he deserves the best of everything, including women. Elizabeth Bennet is prejudiced against him; she believes the gossip she hears about him. Who would ever think the two could ever get along, much less fall in love with each other! Meanwhile, Elizabeth's sisters try desperately to find the men of their dreams. I started reading this book a little timid. My mom told me that I just had to read it because it was a classic, but mainly because she read it and loved it when she was my age. So I had my doubts; my mom and I have different tastes in books, and I didn't trust her opinion much. I started reading it because I didn't have much time before I had to finish my book report. I found I loved the book more than I imagined I would. This story is romantic; it leads you in and out of the complicated minds of the Bennet family. Through the hearts of the many men the Bennet girls tend to take lightly. Then into the souls of two lovers destined to be together."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Although I am only half-way through this book, I am finding it very interesting. It IS a romance, this fact may turn people off, but (as far as I have gone anyway) there is much more to the story! So far, it is very enjoyable, and is teaching me a lot about that time period--what it was like for women in England then. I suggest you read it! Even if you feel that you are a little young. I am 15, I read a lot, and perhaps I'm not understanding everything, but it is enjoyable nontheless!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a story that graps you by the heart and does not ever let you go. If you have never read this book, YOU MUST!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is my favourite book of all time. Not only are the characters perfectly sculpted into lifelike images (both charming and deceitful), but the romance is original, heart warming and honest. Darcy is not only dashing, but mysterious and compelling. Elizabeth is simply charming and delightfully strong willed. The supporting characters are simply wonderful; the mother's sillyness to Wickham's deceitfullness, Miss Bingley's almost comical bitterness to the absurb notion that Darcy could ever marry Lady Catherine's pitiful daughter. It all comes together to make the most wonderful book of love, social commentary and humour. I read this in one weekend-I couldn't put it down. If you have never read a &quot;classic&quot; and love romance read this. It'll charm your socks off!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I cannot express in words how much I loved this novel! Austen's wry humor and perceptiveness shine through in all her characters. I know it sounds cheesy, but I still do get excited over whether Elizabeth and Darcy will ever see eye to eye. Elizabeth is one of the strongest and most admirable female characters in literature, the book is worth it just for her!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen is incredibly witty, which makes this book just a delight to read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen's writing is superb without a doubt and can by no means get any better. This is a classic story of (stating the obvious) pride and prejudice. I was in agony over whether Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy were really going to get together and it's a story that cannot be told, but must be read to understand it thoroughly. I could read it a million times and I cannot stress it enough for you to buy this book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride And Prejudice, written by Jane Austen, is an amazing work on the nature of love. Austen uses beautiful language and intriguing characters to tell this story of courtship in a time when reputation was everything. The main character, Elizabeth Bennet, is a clever-witted woman who manages to gracefully glide through the lines set up by society. Although she does not always come off as lady-like, her charm and confidence demand the reader's respect. She is surrounded by a cast of diverse characters, creating a riveting plotline. Her mother is a rather quirky character who wants nothing more than to see her daughters wed. Her father, on the other hand, is a sarcastic and intelligent man who favors Elizabeth for her wit. These characters are brought together with the Bingley's when Elizabeth's older sister, Jane, falls for Mr. Bingley. Here, we are introduced to the stubborn and proud character of Mr. Darcy. He seems to be above everyone else and completely opposed to the idea of love.When Elizabeth Bennet catches Darcy's eye, however, a battle between the mind and the heart begins. These two chracters are faced with the obstacles set up by a strict, Victorian society. Their largest obstacle, however, will be to overcome their own pride and prejudice, and discover their love for one another. Is this a battle that the heart can win?"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice, is one of the most superb novels in English literature. This novel includes love, lies, and lively characters. Austen's style of writing is superb, her use of the English language is music with words. Austen is able to give the reader an all around view of each character, since it is written in third person omnipresent, but through the many letters, the reader is able to understand each character in a personal way.Austen's heroine, Elizabeth Bennett is an exception to the typical women of her era. Her lively wit and determination not to marry for money is a model for women of all time, these qualities allow her to transcend time. Elizabeth stands up for herself and in the end is rewarded for her steadfast constitution, by marrying the man she loves. Although this situation is not typical in everyday life, that same quality is what makes this novel loved by all. Pride and Prejudice feeds into the illusion of true and perfect love. The man comes to rescue of the woman he loves and in doing so saves her and her family. He goes against his family's and societies wishes to marry the woman he loves.The unique way Pride and Prejudice is written enhances the story. The reader is able to get an inside look into every character's personality. The reader is able to see the flippant way Lydia writes as she decides to run away with Mr. Wickham, how truly ridiculous Mr. Collins is, and how sincerely Mrs. Gardiner loves Elizabeth. Through the letters we learn about some of the most important event in the novel. Mr. Wickham's true character, Lydia's elopement, and even Darcy's involvement in fixing the scandal.It is every woman's dream to be Elizabeth Bennet. To marry the man she loves become rich and live happily ever after. This novel plays on everybody's want to find true love despite all the obstacles in life. I loved Pride and Prejudice because it transported me to another simpler more beautiful place, where love conquers all."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Being the first Jane Austen novel which I have ever read, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that Pride and Prejudice was nothing at all as I had expected. Full of wit and humor, as well as a romance both entirely innocent and mature (a virtue sadly lacking in much of this age's romances), Pride and Prejudice also conveys the polished skill with which Austen writes. I was most surprised to find that Austen, with her sophisticated style, was in her late teens/early twenties when she wrote this novel.I could easily go on about her style, vocabulary, and intricate sentences (I had a little trouble following her sometimes), but the main focus should always be given to the story itself. Insightful and often hilarious characterization gave texture to the story, as did the complex personalities of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. Mr. Bennet's off-hand remarks and Mary's deeply celebral, pompous observations on morality brightened up the scenery considerably. Jane Austen exercises expert storytelling to catch (and keep) interest until the very realistic, very satisfying, conclusion.Pride and Prejudice has earned its way onto my \\"feel-good\\" list of books, and I'm sure I'll be re-reading it for many years to come. Don't be discouraged by its old-fashioned front. Pride and Prejudice is one story that no one should be deprived of.Oh, and if you haven't seen the movie, go see it!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a great classic and should be read by anyone who enjoys Victorian Romance. The beautiful, intelligent, head strong Elizabeth Bennet has finally met her match in the arrogant, proud Mr. Darcy. Their tumultuous romance is extremely humorous and delightful to read.Although Jane Austen was a talented novelist, she was harshly criticized during her day for writing about marriage and the social life of well-bred, 19th century British women as opposed to more serious topics such as the French and American revolutionary wars. I however, believe that Ms. Austen was ahead of her time, exploring the world of gender politics with every witty heroine she created.Pride and Prejudice is a timeless tale that is just as enjoyable today as it was centuries ago. In fact, You may notice that this story is very influential in modern films and books, most recently in Bridget Jones's Diary. I recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"OK, maybe the title was a little much, but from what i have read...it is. Elizabeth Bennet is a young, satirical, young woman who is prejudiced against Mr. Darcy, a charming yet snobby man. The two argue throughout the entire book but when she realizes her misperception of him, they finally begin to love one another. This is perhaps one of the best parts of the novel, in my opinion.The characters are amazingly sketched out and Mrs. Bennt takes the cake! I had a lot of fun reading her comments as well as the sisters.Even though I am only thirteen, I believe that I fully grasped the novel. The words are a bit confusing, so keep a dictionary on you at all times.Jane Austen is one of my favorites, if not my most favorite, and I want everyone to read at least one of her novels!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"If you enjoy British 19th century literature, you are sure to like this book. I read it for a book group selection, and am so glad I was able to get a copy of it. The dialogue is so wonderfully witty, and full of meanings that are not immediately discernable to American readers that are less familiar with this more formal manner of speaking, as I was. I still enjoyed it, as the story is a romantic comedy that I feel has a little something for anyone that enjoys a good romance. It is definitely more subtle than the kinds of things one reads these days, but that seems to be a good thing. The BBC televised version with Colin Firth is also very good."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It's been awhile since I've read any literature involving flowery language and staunch manners but I'm so glad I came back to it!!! Pride and Prejudice is extremely well-written and the characterization is fabulous. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy create delicious sparks with their constant head-butting and romantic tension. Elizabeth can probably best be described as someone who embodies the best manners, heart, and intentions without being sappy or spineless; she is incredibly intelligent and strong-willed. It's interesting to read this book and think of how women of the time had to play the love &quot;game&quot; and marry above their station to progress in society. It also sheds light on Jane Austen's own independent state of mind that her most darling character was a total fireball! This book will give you constant butterflies and provides a nice glimpse into the comedy and pettiness of the society of the time, all the while, weaving a charming tale not soon to be forgotten."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"i loved this book the moment i started reading it. each and every event in it beacame my very own; Jane austen definitely knows how to weave her stories into the hearts of the readers. elizabeth bennet, the heroine, is a vivacious spirited young woman who speaks from her mind and learns from her heart. mr. darcy is uniquely unfolded as a man of principles and convictions. he starts to make you think of what you truly stand for. this is a story full of warmth, tenderness and love from the heart. you'll enjoy every moment of this scintillating experience."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Well, I first readthis book last week and I think it's amazing. I saw the video of it last year and I think it is possibly one of the best dramatisations ever. I loved Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth in P&amp;P and this week I am hoping to buy Bridget Jones's Diary (being released here in England on Saturday). I find this book has a romanticism about it and when you read the book, you feel a longing to be back in the period where men where gallant and women were graceful. The sexual chemistry between Elizabeth and Mr Darcy was wonderful; you felt as if you were actually there.If you've already read it, read it again and if you've never read it... well, you've never lived!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book.

Every time I was out I'd pull it out of my purse and read a little bit here and there. Throughly enjoyed the book again! Very good experience and can't wait to read my next book. I've gone overboard on the freebies but purchased some books too. Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"One of my favorite classics. I never thought this book was slow, although some might disagree because of the older english. I personally found the language in this book to be beautiful. I love the character of Elizabeth Bennet.

I loved it!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"A very loooooong time ago I was a Honors English student in college; we read the classics voraciously. While Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is one of my all-time favorites, I always dreaded reading Jane Austin. She can be very bland, dry, and boring. This book is a bit different, with the characters showing more wit than Austin usually provides.I recently read the \\"Zombie\\" format of this work and found it absolutely laugh-out-loud funny! Can't wait to see the movie! If you like this book, by all means pick up the P,P & Z edition and prepare to be charmed all over again.Best,Vienna"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I did enjoy the novel, but was not particularly fond of how Austen (as opposed to Chralotte Bronte) portrays marriage as a necessity for women or essential for a woman's happiness."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Love the story, and this little book with gold edges is the perfect copy to keep and enjoy again and again. In our disposable society they just don't make books like this one anymore. Great gift for the Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen, lover in your life, or better yet for yourself."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have read this book several times, and each time it continues to amuse me more. the wonderful thing about Austin is the style of her writing is so wonderful and other worldly that one can keep reading the same book over and over and always find some new intricate detail of her writing to marvel over. I know that some people are not up for the task of 19th literature, but if you can just give it your all and dig in, Austin will certainly make it worth your while and more."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This book is a great book full of forbidden love, greed, bribery, sorrow and triumph. Jane Austin, once again, has written a beautiful novel that should be read by everyone! Not only does she describe everything well, but the way that she writes lets you infer how the character is feeling and thinking.Mr. Darcy is a great villian/hero when you read because he is so lovable and caring without being obvious.Lizzy Bennet is one of the greatest characters ever written about! She is spunky, speaks her mind and she is supportive of all of her sisters (which is very important when Lydia takes a turn for the worst). She is a great, admirable person in the story, which makes reading Pride and Prejudice so enjoyable. Jane Austin really knows how to write!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Regarded as one of the classic pieces of literature, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice does not disappoint. The novel chronicles the life of Elizabeth Bennett, a young woman pressured by 19th century standards to marry a man with favorable prospects. Elizabeth, however, is a quick witted and intelligent individual whose strong character is too valued by readers to face a miserable fate by marrying without love.The story begins with a certain Mr. Bingley and his friend who come to stay at a neighboring state of Netherfield. The eldest daughter, Jane, seems to be the daughter of his fancy, and after several balls and gatherings, the Bennets grow acquainted with Bingley, his two sisters, and his friend Mr. Darcy. Where Mr. Bingley plays the gentleman, charming, sociable, and pleasant, Mr. Darcy appears proud, introverted, and rude. Mr. Darcy's initial haughtiness towards Lizzy and his continual dismissal of those around him make him disagreeable at first, but through Austen's subtle description and dialogue of him, readers see him as a misunderstood character. The conversations between Elizabeth and Darcy at the balls or in Netherfield are where Austen's writing shines. Elizabeth's witty and charming dialogue challenges Darcy's cynicism and brutal honesty. The tension and anticipation Austen weaves merely through these interactions solidifies Darcy and Elizabeth's possible romantic relationship.As the novel progresses, Elizabeth is faced again with the prospect of marrying a wealthy man when Mr. Darcy proposes to her. Shocked, and above all, full of indignation upon hearing that he would marry her despite of his character, Elizabeth flatly refuses him. Darcy must then prove himself worthy of Elizabeth's attentions and Elizabeth must realize she was too quick to judge on first impressions.BY steffi castillo"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The manuscript for Jane Austen's best novel, originally titled First Impressions, was rejected and returned to the author. After some revisions, the novel was published as Pride and Prejudice. It has remained one of english literature's most popular novels. Pride and Prejudice did have its share of critics, perhaps one of the most notable of those critics was Charlotte Bronte, author of Jane Eyre, who called Austen's novel a disappointment. I wager many people would heartily disagree.Even people who have never read Pride and Prejudice have heard the names Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy. The main protagonists of the novel have become trademarks of the British Regency era. In the novel, Lizzy and Mr Darcy appear to be the epitome of opposites. Upon their first encounter, Elizabeth Bennet believes herself perfectly aquainted with Mr Darcy's character and hopes she will never find herself in his miserable presence again. The phrase \\"don't judge a book by its cover\\" aptly applies to Mr Darcy.Pride and Prejudice is one of the finest novels I have ever read. I love it not only for the romance (which is unparalleled), but also for its humor. The televised adaptations of this novel, some dating back to 1940, are excellent. The BBC version starring Colin Firth, and the 2005 movie starring Keira Knightley are amazing. I don't think I could pick a favorite if my life depended on it. If I had to be stranded on an island with just one book, it would be Pride and Prejudice. If I could dream a fictional character to life, it would be Mr Darcy. Pride and Prejudice, an unforgettable book filled with unforgettable characters."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"After reading so many modern fiction popular titles it is so refreshing to go back to a classic.

Amazing story, beautifully written."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have, to this point in my life, successfully avoided reading any Jane Austen books, supposing them to be superfluous and archaic. I really only read this book because I wanted the foundation and familiarity with the story prior to reading the adaptation entitled ''Pride and Prejudice and Zombies'' by Seth Grahame-Smith. Because who can pass up a good zombie book, after all?I started this book begrudgingly but was soon intrigued by the language. I amused myself by reading aloud a paragraph of flowery language to my husband and then paraphrasing it in a sentence. I proclaimed and bemoaned the inefficiency of the writing style but persevered and slogged on. About halfway through the book, I surprised myself by really wanting to know what happened next. And here I sit, 1am in the morning, having to finish the book tonight with the absolute stubbornness of having to know Elizabeth's disposition!Hands down, I loved this book. Shame on me and my ignorance for Ms. Austen's talent. I hope to read many more of her books.

Allows us to spy on a world and in a time we'll never know, where pride rules at the expense of others, and prejudice is at its best... If you see yourself in the pages, it's a good thing to step back and think about how to change... or read just for the enjoyment."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is my favorite Jane Austin novel. The characters are so well developed and the descriptions so perfect I felt I was there with them. I loved getting lost in the story and couldn't wait to read what happened next. I would recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen had great sociological, cultural and anthropological insights at her time. However, most of her works sound quite applicable and reasonable today as well, so many years onwards, i.e. after her. Nonetheless, her literary talent and skill are still unsurpassed. This story in particular is told in a very intuitive and psychological way, being very personal and touching, at the same time. The author is constantly flowing in the realms of human mentality, feelings and emotions; whereas keeping very sound and practical judgments on the wide social world surrounding the protagonist. Overall, it is a lovely story involving a whole spectrum of human moods, feelings and conditions, such as: love, romance, grief, happiness, longing, desire, rivalry, remorse, achievement etc."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Admittedly a challenge in verse from today's language... once beyond that, one is easily transported back in time and entranced by Austen's story-telling!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Of course you know why this rating is a five. Pride and Prejudice is one of the most amazing love stories I've EVER read. Honestly the writing style is not something I could read often, but this is a beautiful-reach in and touch your soul kind of read...Of course the movie is amazing as well, but I stand by what I always say-The book is ALWAYS better."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I know most teens whine & complain when assigned classics to read for school, but this book is so much more than required reading.

Then the entire time you read the book you hate it, but you are sure there is some reason it's a classic. Finally, at the end of the book, you realize that you just wasted your time reading an awful book. Well, this book isn't like that. It's actually really great. There are twists in the plot, a surprising end, good characters, and a loveable heroine.

The notes in the margins provide historical context, insights into Jane Austen's own life, and chatty asides from the editor that make you feel like you're reading the book along with an intelligent friend or book club. It is a fun introduction to Jane Austen's books for those new to Austen, and it's just another way to enjoy this classic book and really feel a connection to and a part of the kinds of conversations of \\"Janeites\\" JASNA meetings and book groups. It is an accessible edition of the book - less academic than the Norton Critical Edition, without compromising the experience of just reading Austen's books for fun."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have always been a romantic. I\`m that sucker who is always looking for a great romance novel or movie to captivate me and make me fall into the wonders of love overcoming all obstacles. So, yes, you could say I have seen and read my fair share of love stories, but this is the best.I first read this book when I was 12 after hearing incessesantly about how it was such a classic and a must-read (and of course I heard it was a romance, so that little fact right there solidified any scruples that I may have had at the time). I was mesmerized.Yes, of course it was rather difficult to understand the language at first and I did expect that. Instantly, though, I read it a second time and I locked in with Austen\`s flow of words and the sensations that I went through while reading her novel were incredible.Elizebeth Bennet is such a fantastic and relatable character and I believe any woman can relate to her. She\`s dignified and witty, but at the same time she\`s shy and believable. She\`s never ridiculous or over the top. Mr. Darcy....where do I begin? The changes in him and Elizabeth are just incredible and no matter how many times I read this book I can\`t help but fall in love with them all over again. Mrs. Bennet is truly ridiculous, but she means well. Mr. Bennet is a man who always settles and never really has determination to go ahead. He keeps to himself, sometimes it seems like he even avoids the truth of things unless it becomes dreadfully grave. Nonetheless, a great character. Mr. Collins; What a man! He will keep you laughing at how absolutely ridiculous he is. And Elizabeth\`s younger sisters are truly precious. Jane and Bingley are sweet and endearing. Miss Bingley is the perfect &#34;mean girl&#34;. Mr. Wickham is delightfully decieving and really supports the phrase, &#34;Looks are decieving.&#34; And lastly, the Gardiners are easily my favorite characters after Elizabeth and Darcy.The whole plot is wonderfully paced, and I will confess that first time reading it that it may seem slow and boring. But, when you really take the time to delve into Jane Austen\`s world and understand the truths that she expresses with such precision that still resonate in todays society, you really become intranced. You really feel like you know the characters and maybe even recognize the truth in them and recognize people you know. Austen was insightful and really understood people and characters and the morals of her time. She was brillant and I really wonder what it would be like to have met her if she was alive today. Pride ad Prejudice is my favorite novel and I really hope this review has done is justice. This is the best of the best and it will forever remain my favorite novel.Thank you Jane Austen for sharing with the world your characters and your truths."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"love this classic!!! only, what's with the incomplete names/titles? eg: ----shire ? I've read my grans' copy of this and it did not have those...."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I am not sure why everyone is so negative about this timeless classic. Yes there are no big car chase scenes, no unusually attractive female that makes everyone go \\"gaga\\", or large scale destruction. If you can get away from this and look at the story with a open mind and conscience, you will get a story that is moving and just right for just about anyone.

I like Jane and her shyness. I LOVED Bingley and his charismatic charm. I also really love Mr Bennet and his sense of humor. Mrs Bennet & Lydia Bennet on the other hand were those characters you alway wanted to smack in the face for being so stupid...like so:And then there is Darcy.... At first, like everyone else, I wasn't very into him. He was standoffish and he insulted Elizabeth behind her back mere moments after meeting her! Seriously, what is wrong with you dude? I was fuming as much as Elizabeth...but then you realize that he is shy and awkward when conversing with people he doesn't know and he does all this amazing stuff just to help Elizabeth. I followed Elizabeth right down the rabbit whole when she started to fall for Darcy.My only real complaint, oddly enough, was the prose. I truly did not expect the way it was written to bug me. I am an historical romance novel fanatic so you would assume that this would be right up my alley, no?But it really wasn't. Apparently I only like to listen to them speak this way, not read it. When I hear them speak, it's like aw! He is paying her an extreme compliment and using all these pretty words. When I read it, the dialogue I can handle, but the entire page of description that basically amounts to \\"they lived in a large house called Longbourne that had many rooms and a lot of land with woods\\"....well I wasn't so into that. And when Mr Collins spoke, I had the biggest urge to just yell at him to spit it out already! Seriously dude, pull your head out of Lady Catherine's ass and speak for yourself! Stop paying Lady Catherine compliments every other word! Trust me, we understand that you think she is the awesome.Wow...this is probably the crappiest review I have ever written, but seriously there are tons of reviews out there that really explain what this book is about as well as several films, so if my review has left you confused, please go consult one of them (or just google it) and they will answers your numerous questions."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride & Prejudice is of course a classic in English literature, so in itself it needs no review.

However, I find the most delight I receive is in the clever phrases and word usages. It is a kind, long poem to my ears.Naturally, I do like Elizabeth as well. She is very human. She has the ability to make mistakes, to learn from them, and to realize her hubrus and change. I don't find this very often in modern works.I return to this book from time to time to retreat from life.

I love being able to take this with me where ever I go with out carrying the book with me."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride And Prejudice, Jane Austen(This review was originally published at The Brazen Broads' Book Bash)A Timeless Classic...For anyone who has never read Pride And Prejudice, this Broad would urge you to crack the cover! If you enjoy a smart romance, sharp wit, and the humor of peering into the character flaws of those about you, you won't be disappointed. Austen wrote my favorite heroine of all time within the pages of this novel. Elizabeth Bennet absolutely steals the show!The Bennet sisters, under the hand of an often dramatic and obnoxiously silly mother and a father, who abounds with dry humor but mostly abdicates his role, face life, society, and courtship in the English countryside. This is no easy task, for the young women have no considerable wealth or lofty position to aid them in a time when that was quite important.Pride And Prejudice chronicles the romantic fiascoes of the Bennet girls. Jane, the eldest sister, wins the love of the young and well-to-do Mr. Bingley, although certainly not without trial and tribulation. But jealousy and interference leave her happiness in serious doubt. Lydia, the middle child, selfish and flighty, refuses to comply with propriety, and her actions threaten the chances of all the sisters. The two youngest, Mary and Kitty, while affected by the goings-on, don't figure as prominently in the story. This leaves Elizabeth, the novel's main female character, to entertain with her bold wit and keen observations during her own adventures in life and love.When Elizabeth Bennet first encounters Mr. Darcy, she at once understands him to be prideful and ill-mannered, founding her long lasting prejudice. Adding to her less than friendly impressions are the accusations against Mr. Darcy by the family's newest acquaintance, Mr. Wickham. Circumstances, however, continue to throw the two together, and the time spent coming to know Elizabeth begins to alter Mr. Darcy's opinions. His change in behavior leaves much to be desired, and it isn't until after Elizabeth's scathing face-to-face assessment of Mr. Darcy's character flaws that he confronts his pride whole-heartedly, and Elizabeth faces her prejudice.Strength of character, probing dialogue, and honest reflection turn their opinions of one another into something altogether different as Elizabeth and Darcy, each in their own way, dare to break with convention and hope in love.After reading Austen's original again, I am more than eager to dive into the first sequel on my list! Reading the varied takes on what the Darcy's love affair may have looked like once they married intrigues me to no end.~Moira"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I'm slightly embarrassed to say that it took me this long to get around to reading Pride & Prejudice. I don't like romance novels and I'm generally wary of anything that is too popular. And yet here I am, giving P&P one of the few 5-star ratings I've ever bestowed. Jane Austen is, without a doubt, among the wittiest, cleverest, most talented authors I've ever read. I laughed out loud repeatedly, thoroughly enjoyed many of the characters (the protagonists were refreshingly frank and the stupid ones were delightfully annoying), and don't you tell anyone but I had tears in my eyes when Darcy and Elizabeth finally sorted things out. I'll be thinking about this book for a long time, and I imagine that I'll be delving into Austen's other books in short order."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is an amazing classic. Those who have seen the movie...READ THE BOOK! Austen does a wonderful job in her character development and capturing the emotions and making them tangible.

It is brilliantly written plot-wise and character-wise, set in the time of propriety and manners in Regency England (early 1800s). Jane Austen at her bestSynopsis: (WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!!!)The novel opens with the arrival of a wealthy young gentleman, Mr. Charles Bingley, at Netherfield Park, accompanied by his rather haughty sisters and friend, Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. Seeing the wealthy newcomers, the Bennet family of the nearby village of Longbourn, is in great excitement. The silly and impractical Mrs. Bennet thereupon aims to marry off at least one of her five daughters: Jane (the eldest and the kindest), Elizabeth (the most sensible), Mary (the most studious), Kitty (the simple-minded), and Lydia (the silliest). Almost immediately, the amiable Mr. Bingley is well-liked by the community, while his friend, Mr. Darcy, appears just the opposite. From the start, since he rejected her at a ball, Elizabeth's first impression of Mr. Darcy is to be arrogant, proud, and conceited. Her dislike of him is only heightened when she hears an account of Mr. Darcy, as ruthless and cold-hearted, from a handsome and sociable young officer, Mr. George Wickham. Meanwhile, despite Mrs. Bennet's embarrassing meddling, Mr. Bingley and Jane Bennet begin to develop an attachment, and though unawares, Elizabeth's liveliness and intelligence grows on Mr. Darcy, who unconsciously falls for her - despite all his objections to her inferior birth status and her ridiculous mother and younger sisters. As Elizabeth, the main protagonist, eventually discovers, one of her two admirers - Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy - has all the appearance of goodness, while the other has all the genuine goodness."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I recently had a chance to see the full Masterpiece Theater production of Pride and Prejudice (if you have never seen Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, you haven't lived) and loved it as much as ever. Now that I have a Kindle and many of the classics are free I couldn't resist. I recalled that the dialogue in the series was almost verbatim from the book but I hadn't read the book in so many years that I couldn't recall how well the rest matched up. They are different because the book does a lot of narration that in the film had to be shown by activity, so it gives a different insight into your favorite characters. I was delighted to find so much in the book not in the series.The book is a perfect delight and it obvious why this treasure by Jane Austin ranks so high in the lists of English literature. Austin's skill at dialogue, character and plot development are unmatched. I had intended to just skim the book to pick up the pieces I wanted but I read every word and was delighted with the extra sections in the book not in the series. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I just finished reading the book about half an hour ago. I read it in almost two weeks, since the complexity of my life's schedule did not let me finish it in less time. Let me assure you that it is a good title, and I look forward to reading more on Jane Austen. I enjoyed the reading so much in my Kindle that one day was reading at the University, waiting for some Registration assistance, and I began laughing on the occurrences of Lady de Bourgh at Longbourn.I gave this title a 4 star review since some formatting problems on the Kindle edition; including capital letters where there was no need, word and line spacing, and not coming with a list of the Chapters to be read.Although I found these errors sometimes annoying, I enjoyed quite much the experience of reading this ebook, since I never thought I would enjoy an 1800's title.Enjoy your reading!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I read this book because I have been trying to catch up on some classics of literature that I haven't read. I expected to find it to be boring and stuffy, but I vowed that I would read it. To my great fortune, my prejudice against the book turned out to be completely wrong. It is wonderful book and a great read. It is witty, funny, and perceptive, with great insights into human relationships and the structure of society during its era (late eighteenth century England)."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I've read this book so often, I can actually quote word for word. Within the first few pages you forget which century you're in, and really feel for Elizabeth and Jane as their sisters and mother embarrass them in society. You feel poor Darcy's bemusement at falling in love with someone from a (perceived) lower class, and you ache for Lizzie to unbend a little and cut the guy some slack. When they finally get it on, I breathe a huge sigh of relief that everything's turned out so wonderfully. Yes, even though I must have read it over a hundred times. And that's timeless fiction."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Please note that this review is on the hard cover edition offered here via Barns and Noble. Amazon, for reasons known only to themselves, have chosen to lump every review of the classic piece of literature together no matter the format. As I go through these reviews I find that hard cover editions, e-books, books on tape, unknown bindings, paperbacks and I don't know what all have all been thrown into the same bag.Let me be perfectly honest and tell you that as far as Austen's work itself, I would give it ten stars if that were possible. This is NOT a review of her work though, rather a review of this particular edition...as stated above. I recently went of a book buying spree for my wife to replace worn out, lost (she is a great loaner of books and many of those loaned books never find there way home), and simply misplaced books. She, like me, is a big Austen fan.Anyway, the Barns and Noble edition book described on this product page is a very fine book when you consider the cost. It is difficult to find a decent paperback book these days, much less a hardback version of anything that does not cost an arm and a leg if bought new.Now so with this printed hard back version. The book is well made. The paper, while not of fine are quality, is certainly nice enough. The binding appears quite good...I know about such things and for a mass produced books this is about as good as you are going to find anywhere. The cost is more than reasonable . (Hey...a supersized extra value meal will cost you more), and font used is extremely readable and easy on the eyes.If you order this book you must pay shipping charges; something to consider. I personally bought mine, along with a number of the \`classics' in this series directly at a B&N; store, (We drive to the big city at least every other month), thus saving the cost of S&H.;For a big bang for your buck, I can hardly see how you can go wrong with this one.As to the work itself; if you have not read this one, do so. You are in for a true reading treat. If you have read it before, then read it again! If you are one of those that simply do no like Austen's work...well, don't read it at all!Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I consider myself a moderately well read person, as I have read a few of the must read classics, yet I had not embarked on one of literature's most celebrated journey, the journey into the land of Longbourn and Pemberly as seen in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. A few years ago I selected the book to attempt to read it, but I became immediately bored with the literature and tossed it aside, deciding against finishing it.I came across a book claiming to be a sequel of Pride and Prejudice (and a bad sequel I must say) and I decided to give the classic another try.I cannot ascertain why, but this time, something was changed. Before I finished the first chapter, I was completely entranced in the story of the Bennet's and later, Darcy and the Bingelys.At first, I was completely ignorant of the time period's lingo and I was flailing, reading slowly to completely understand the richness of the grand words. But by the middle of the book, I was fluent in the old English tongue and my native tongue, American English, was past.The plot and dialogue was like no other book I have had the pleasure of reading. The sheer brilliance of Austen's artfully crafted words and wonderful plot left me wishing the book would never reach its finish.But it did.I nearly cried when I bid farewell to my newly acquainted friends, Fitzwilliam Darcy, Elizabeth Bennet, Jane Bennet, Georgiana Darcy, Mr. Bingely, Charlotte Lucas, and the laughable Mr. Collins. An emptiness accompanied me, as I put the book the down, the aching, despairing emptiness that makes you wish that you were in the book, and lucky enough to know the characters.And this is why I encourage you to pick up Pride and Prejudice. You may be like me and either be intimidated by the vast use of vocabulary or have sampled the book before and found it not to your taste.I urge you to try again. All it took was another try and just like that, I was in love with the book forever.Look past the hard words or the moderate length and look directly into a charming book that is sure to captivateyou and draw you in as it did me.Pride and Prejudice is a timeless classic, full of eloquent words, beautiful romance, and a few twist and turns. Pride and Prejudice will always be my favorite book and will always have a hallowed spot on my bookshelf.Is anyone else in love with Mr. Darcy?"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I can't even begin to tell you all how much I loved this book (I loved it most ardently!). It was sweet, heartfelt and real! I felt connected to the characters in a way that I have never been connected with a character before, and that's saying a lot because I'm a very intense reader. I ususally grieve when I finish a book I love, and this was no exception. I think I'm still grieving a little, and It's been almost a week since I've read it!Jane Austen is one of the most if not THE most admirable writers of all time. You can't stay out of her stories. SHe grabs you and pulls you right in there with Elizabeth and Darcy and everyone else, making you fall in love with each and every character deeply."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have always loved reading a good book but I am a romantic at heart and when I started searching for Kindle freebies I came across many different categories of authors. (My mind likes to organise and categorize things). There are the Christian romance authors who explicitly introduce concepts of God and his love for us as they enfold and develop the love story between the main characters. There are the Sex-driven romance authors who give you great details on the physical attraction between the characters and then give you a front row seat (in your imagination of course) to all or some of the sexual experiences in the story. There are the sci-fi based romance authors whose love stories are mystical and many times quite unthinkable. And of course there are the action based romances where the hero is invariably going to end up in some situation (like a fight or car chase) where his machoism will be displayed to the full appreciation of the heroine. And then there are the Historical romance authors who may take any of the aforementioned slants but just given from a historical stand point. Their stories tend to have lot of substance since their work is more often than not well researched and offer detiails and facts of how society and life in general was in the past.Jane Austen's work in Pride and Prejudice falls into none of my categories. You see although she mentions that the characters went to church, she never quite gave us a sermon. Even the value of sex within marriage was the standard of the day and as she dealt with this topic it was in no way an attempt to be \\"preachy\\". It is not sex-driven for there are no sex scenes and quite frankly many physical details on the characters are missing and instead an overview of the person's features are simply stated as \\"Mr. Darcy was tall and handsome\\". There was no mysticism or any element of science fiction and the greatest action any of the characters indulged in was taking a walk. The men did not even work hard but rather spent a lot of time reading in their libraries or playing indoor games (like cards). And while we read of carriages and horses and an England of long ago, the truth of the matter is that this is neither the work of a historical romance author because Ms. Austen wrote about her own time and the dependence of women on marriage for economic security and as a means to escape social ridicule and shame. And yet it is a wonderful and probably the best romance story I have ever read (even though I hace not yet categorized it) and not because of its quite ancient philosophies of women but because it is so frank and honest when told through the eyes of the female protagonist, Elizabeth Bennet.It is a pure work of art and Ms. Austen not only transported me to a different time but to a different place and I was amazed at how enthralled I was at this very \\"wordy\\" books. Yes I love words too but there is a definite art in the way she strung words together with witticism and/or sarcasm for the various dialogue scenes.When held up next to this masterpiece, many modern day romance stories look so immature and hurried. Their creators would do well to read literature such as this! This book has stood the test of time!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I absolutely adored the movie Pride & Prejudice with Keira Knightley. I then thought it would be fun to read the original novel on my new Kindle. Even though it took me three days to read it I was not dissapointed. I had the movie running in my mind the entire time I was reading so I was able to compare the movie with the novel. I must say it enhanced the experience. I so loved each time Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy communicated in any way. Just reading their conversations was such a delight. The book really filled in all the conversations that didn't make it into the movie.This story reveals how it is possible to go from hating someone to loving them completely. The journey Elizabeth must go through to love Mr. Darcy is fascinating and complex. There are many letters exchanged and gossip Elizabeth must sort through to find the truth. The reader really feels the hatred she feels and then feels the warming of the heart as each page goes by. Truly this is one of the best romance novels ever written. I'd recommend you watch the movie first and then you will have something to compare this to.

It is a page-turner even though I know how it ends. I wish to find its equivalent in contemporary literature."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a great book full of love, scandal, humor, wit, and drama. Whether you are young or old, I am positive that this novel has an aspect of interest that will catch your attention right away. Set in an 18th century English society, Jane Austen does a fantastic job of adding comic relief and wit to a society where men have almost ultimate control. The estate of the Bennet family is entailed to Mr. Collins, so the five Bennet daughters must find suitable husbands if they wish to have a home or property in the future. The book revolves around conversation and thoughts the characters have about each other. Austen never gives a complete physical description of the characters, so the reader is left to make an opinion on each character based on their first impression of them. This style of diction and syntax eventually leads to the discovery of a major theme: do not always trust your first impression of someone. Irony is another common device Austen used in the novel. The Bennet's second daughter, Elizabeth, and Mr. Darcy end up falling for each other despite every obstacle that was thrown at them. Problems with social status, money, Mr. Darcy's pride, and Elizabeth's refusal to settle on a man caused drama in the beginning stages in their relationship. The novel's ending proved that one should not judge a person on a first impression and that true love truly can conquer all. Those facts will always make to novel relevant to current times, contrary to those who call the novel out of date. Read this novel and fall in love!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The diction and the story line of the novel is so amazing, The Darcy/Elizabeth chemistry is amazing and great for any romantic reader."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Great read, and the plot is just so easy to follow, the romance and wit is what sealed the deal for me."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Brainy sophisticated and hilarious.

I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Writing styles such as Jane Austin don't usually keep my attention well and, at first, this book was no different. I had to force myself to read the first 6-7 chapters. By a quarter though the book, I found myself enjoying the writing and storyline much more. It was an enjoyable read and I liked the book very much, but I can't say I agree with others who say it's one of the greatest novels ever written. Then again, it's just not my preferred writing style. Also, I got this on my Kindle for free and the formatting was just fine."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"As a high school student I was not sure I would like this book at all. This book was an easy read because of how well it was written and how much the story grabs on to you. Ever since reading this book I have gone on to read all of Jane Austen's book and found that they were equally as good."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is an excellent novel that explores how love fits into a society consumed by an obsession with marriage. As expected from a nineteenth century British novel highlighting upper society, Jane Austen's writing uses a proper and sophisticated syntax. Working with the dignified tone, the syntax often coats the characters' bluntness and turns them into seemingly kinder remarks. These situations tend to be the most humorous, because the readers and the characters all know what is being said beneath all the comments. These dialogues also add important dimension to all of the characters. For example, Elizabeth is very witty and can uphold amusing and complex conversations with Mr. Darcy, but afterward her reflections show that she has insecurities despite her verbal strength. Without the depth of Elizabeth's character as well as the depth of the other characters, the novel would seem much longer and more dragged out than it can be at times. If the readers have the patience to get through some of the slower parts and can focus on the brilliant interactions between the characters, then they will be incredibly satisfied at the end of the beautiful novel."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I first read this book this past school year (11th grade), with a teacher who is an active JANSA Member (The Jane Austen Society of North America). The one thing I will always remember from him, was that in this book the characters are so real that you can see them in your everyday life. Along with my teacher we took a trip down to memory lane and saw all of Jane's characters in his High School (he wrote this as an essay he read at a JANSA congregation). And of course he ended by finding his Elizabeth, who's name is actually Jane (ironic isn't it?).I TRULY recommend this book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Meet the Bennet sisters: demure Jane, witty Elizabeth, bookish Mary, impressionable Kitty, and lusty Lydia. It's the usual story: they don't have much in the way of dowries but need to marry upstanding English gentlemen...Elizabeth Bennet quickly emerges as the heroine with her wry sense of humor and take-no-prisoners attitude to social life. She puts all twentieth century heroines to shame when she tells off Mr. Darcy (while maintaining perfect decorum). Unusual twists and turns spark up the &quot;marriage plot&quot; of the book. There are some great villains, too."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Let this serve as a warning that at least one of the reviews below details most of the plot developments of this most endearing of English novels. In the unlikely event that you haven't already read Pride and Prejudice, and you like to have some surprises the first time you read a novel, you explore farther at your own peril."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I had to read this for school and at first it was really hard to get into it. After awhile, though, it seemed to get better. Some of the words were really hard to understand and I needed a dictionary by me. It is actually a really good book. I was suprised because a lot of people said it was boring. It was boring at first, but if you stick to it and make yourself read it it will get better. I recommend this book to people who like to read romance. The characters are very well developed and the theme of the story is good."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"With pride and Prejudice Austen has at last created a heroine that does not go to pieces at the first sight of an eligible young man. elizabeth Bennett's mind rules her heart not the other way around. thus Mr. Darcy who is attracted to her must first prove his love and loyalty before Elizabeth will consider him. this novel is one of austne's finest and I found myself captured by the story. In those days marriage was essential to a woman's happiness and thus she strove to do all in her power to find a suitable match. it is a task that frankly has not totally died even today despite all the social change that has taken place since this book was written. One has to wonder what Austen would think if she was alive today. the main message of this novel is not to rush to judgement in regards to others. A notion wich still holds great importance. Though at times a little too lighthearted this book nevertheless is an enjoyable read or in my case a listen. Naxos did a great job in making Austen's novel come alive. the narrator read the text with the right amount of tone and intonation and the classical music breaks between scenes was a nice touch. When it comes to audio classics noe one does it better then Naxos. I will have to buy more of Austne's work done by them.this audiobook contains 3 CD's and is abridged; yet i do not think i have missed anything in regards to the overall story. I found listneing to the book very pleasing and will be a fine addition to my audio library."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is only the second Jane Austen book that I have read, but certainly not the last! Though the numerous characters and complex sentences provide the reader with a challenge and requires some concentration, the end result is definitely rewarding. Complicated characters and complicated relationships leave the reader constantly on their toes, and you never know what to expect next. What's so wonderful about this book is that the characters are so real. There are so many memorable characters in this story about Mrs. Bennet attempting to marry off her five daughters, and these characters aren't perfect, merely human, making them easy to relate to as well as laugh at. In reading this book, you see yourself in the same tough situations and awkward moments as them and realize that we sometimes forget that we don&iexcl;t have to be flawless. Everyone is proud and prejudiced at sometime or another; we aren't perfect, and it's okay!Though perhaps an easier read than Emma, Pride and Prejudice is similar in that it is also full of the same brilliant dialogue and subtle humor. This book is great for anyone who is interested in a romantic comedy that will that twirl you around with its genius and surprises."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It seems like a simple statement. Mr. Darcy, the hero of our novel, simply doesn't have time to write to his overbearing aunt to inform her of his engagement to be married. But, like most things in Jane Austen, it has more meanings than one.I will be the first to admit that the plot of the novel is transperent. Anyone who has read a romance can see from the outset that Darcy and Lizzy (a.k.a. Elizabeth Bennet) will end up with each other. The only question is how, why, when, and who will be affected. To find that out, you'll have to read the story. I don't believe I'm giving anything away by saying that the seemingly sub-human Fitzwilliam Darcy (he's got quite a name, has he not?) will thaw eventually, and that Lizzy will warm to his new, altered state. For, simply put, the point of the novel is not the story, but the beautiful prose and dialogue. The deliciously satisfying banter of the newly-engaged Darcy and Lizzy in Chapter 18 of Part Three (some versions are not divided into parts, but I trust you can find this chapter) leaves you tingling with glorious anticipation of their soon to be union.The reader will thrill when he calls her &quot;Elizabeth&quot; for the first time (as opposed to a cold &quot;Miss Bennet&quot;), and the effect is somewhat heightened by his adding a passtionate &quot;dearest, lovliest&quot; before the name. For Darcy, despite his reserves, is a deeply passionate man.Back to my original point. There is something deeper in Jane Austen's seemingly silly and pointless escapades. The novel is an examination of human foibles (sp?) and follies, a critical probing of the pitfalls of society. Austen's points are timeless, for some things never change. In any case, when Darcy says, in response to Lizzy's inquiry as to when he will find the courage to write to his aunt, the despised Lady Catherine DeBourgh, who greatly opposes his marriage to Lizzy, that he is more likely to want time than courage, it means more than it seems to. He is saying, subtly perhaps, but he's saying it all the same: he treasures his time with Lizzy, and he hates to darken it with a cloud of impending doom. Besides which, he loves to talk to his fiance, and wile away hours wandering the country lanes in a state of happiness beyond that which he has ever known. Why waste the precious minutes writing to that stupid Lady Catherine, anyway?As you can see, a philosopher like myself can find reams of meaning in a simple sentance of Austen. If that isn't reason enough to read her novel &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, I don't know what is.--Child of the Burning Heart"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The most striking feature of my experience with &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is the sense of overwhelming changes in society in the last 200 years. What was considered boorish and vulgar in 1800 would be considered conservative behavior today. The characters in Austen's work display such subtely of thought and self-restraint that it's hard to believe that humans once acted in such a way...."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"If I were reviewing Pride and Prejudice alone, I would give this novel six stars. It is rightfully listed on every top 100 literature list. I am currently reading it for the sixth time and still finding wonderful new things in the story. For those who have only seen the movie versions, you are in for a treat... no movie can do this story justice.My complaint is that the Kindle version I purchased was advertised as illustrated, but there are very few illustrations and the quality is poor, and there is no way to zoom in to see the illustrations better (as you can do with text on the Kindle). This is a past-copyright book and it is available free from the Gutenberg Project, and used to be free on Kindle. I paid 99 cents to get the illustrated version, and it really wasn't worth it.

It's written beautifully in the classic language that every man and woman speaks while in the throes of the mating game. I read this book at least yearly to remind myself of not only the gloriously beautiful fluent English language and wit of Miss Bennett, but the always refreshing humility, which this book's title fails to mention. It is truly a beautiful piece of romantic literature.

Reading it was supposed to be a \\"filler\\" until the time I could lay my hands on an as yet unread book. Needless to say, though I have other books in line now, I am completely drawn in and am not willing to give up reading Pride and Prejudice till I reach \\"The End\\" again.This is a book which keeps growing on you and you like it even more on each subsequent reading. The characterization is simply brilliant. The dialogues, though too convoluted and flowery by today's standards, are a treat to read. The characters are all mostly likeable. Though it is supposed to be a romance, there is a whole lot more to the book. Each reading brings out subtler shades and makes you nod your head delighted as the new facet presents itself!Pride and Prejudice has to be one of my most favorite books of all time. I can read it any time and love it all over again. You are missing out on a real treat if you have not read it yet - go get it :-)!Another note: I think because the protagonist is female, women tend to enjoy this book a whole lot more than men!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Of all of Austen's novels, and I've read them all, Pride and Prejudice stands out to me as the most dynamic. The characters are richly developed and the plot woven skillfully in and out of the quirks of society. This book can be boring and tedious to read if you let it, but with a little imagination and an enjoyment of the language it can take flight and transform. I have read the book five or six times and studied it in an English analysis class, and each time I find something new to discover and relish in Austen's witty commentary. Read it once for the plot, then read it again for the social critisism, and it will blow you away!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"If you are like I was before reading this wonderful book, you probably can't imagine what could be so wonderful about Pride and Prejudice. How can it be interesting, you're thinking, when it's written in such a stuffy time period? I'll stick with my science fiction/romance novels/westerns, thank you very much. And it's true, you can't find any lusty young rogues, aliens, or gun fights, but that doesn't keep it from being an extremely wonderful book to read. The characters are full of life, the plot well constructed, and the entire story full of charm and humour. Don't be put off by the language either. It takes some getting used to, but once you're going it's not only completely natural, but makes today's English seem completely dull and simple. I cannot stress enough how wonderful this book is. (By the way, in case you think I'm someone who thinks a 'good time' is a trip to the museum or a riveting game of chess, I'm not. I take sick pride in my love of the uncultured, but even I can't help but love this book.) Once more, with feeling: Don't avoid this book because of the time period it's written in."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"When I first started to read this book I thought that it would have alot of old time english that I couldn't understand and that there would be alot of slow spots and bore.

He is a rich and seemingly arrogant gentleman and she is a poor and very feisty young lady in a large, happy family of girls who must marry well.

All of them except poor Mary, she kind of reminds me of myself actually, she's the nerdy one.Elizabeth judges everyone, her mother, her father, her sisters and especially Mr. Darcy.

The book was 367 pages of text, close together, justified and not written in easy language (i.e. modern English). I was optimistically hoping to finish it within a month.But I really liked the movie with Keira Knightley and wanted to see how closely it compared and if it was as good as the movie.Two weeks later, I am done, and I am pleased with the ride.Plot:Mr. Bingley, an eligible, wealthy bachelor, moves nearby the Bennett family, who have five unmarried daughters. The Bennett family must secure good marriages for their daughters since they will inherit nothing when their father dies. Romance is in the air between Jane Bennett and Mr. Bingley, while the first sparks of love appear between the proud, wealthy Mr. Darcy and the exuberant, Elizabeth Bennett.Good:There are so many good parts to this book! I don't quite know where to begin!The characters are believable and real. Elizabeth is a well rounded character. She starts out proud and prejudiced against Mr. Darcy but as she learns of his true quality is not afraid of changing her mind. Mr. Darcy was sweet, opinionated, and equally prejudiced against Elizabeth's \\"poor connections\\".The plot was wonderful and well paced. It kept me on the edge of my seat (although it was not an action book); I couldn't wait to see what would happen on each page.I enjoyed the arguments between Elizabeth (and her fiesty personality) and Mr. Darcy (stiff and proud). The quips they came up with! The chemistry between the two was perfect!Lastly, I enjoyed how the author emphasized (via Mr. Bennett) to marry for love and not for money or connections or the like. This is something very much beyond her time (as many marriages in the late 18th century were arranged).Bad:Well, this is being exceedingly petty, but the language of this book makes it difficult for a modern reader to fully understand the nuances of what Jane Austen is trying to say (the notes at the appendix help with this, however).Dialogue/Sexual Situations/ViolenceNone. Talk is made of how Lydia and an officer run off to live with each other without marrying. None.Overall:Sweet. There is no better word for the free-spirited, witty romance between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I would have to say this is the best, purest romance story I have ever read (besides, maybe The Princess Bride). The movie does a fabulous job with the book, but the book is even more enjoyable than the movie (if you can imagine). You will not be displeased with this one.Brought to you by:*C.S.

However, do as I did and read the novel before seeing the movie. You will not be disappointed. The first section of the novel introduces you to the character, setting, and social rules, as well as acclimates you to Austen's style. Once you have moved into the remaining sections, the book takes so many twists and turns that you cannot put it down. Even after my third reading, I still love the suspense of what will become of each Bennet sister."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"What do books do for me that nothing else does? The most important encounter that I have with books is that I identify myself with all the characters in the book. I see all the nuances of those characters as present in me. I experience all those experiences and I am not the same after that. I cannot remain unscathed. I have evolved into a greater human being. I have climbed another rung in the ladder of spiritual evolution. One book that I enjoy every time I read it is Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". The book is the baby of a literary genius. The most compelling feature of the book is its non-violence. At no point is there any harshness. Of course, we must consider the period in which it was written. English was most poetic even in prose. Given that credit, the novel refuses to show anyone in bad light at the end of it. All of human frailties are shown as natural and well, human! Neither Mr. Darcy is the villain nor is Mr. Wickham. Each person is a consequence of the experiences he has had in his life. Jane Austen treats every character with gentleness. There is an understanding that every human being functions only within the level of awareness he/she has. That is the appeal of the novel. This is the kind of work Walt Whitman would have been proud of."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"If you can help it, read this book before seeing any of the visual versions of the story. I couldn't help but put the visuals from the BBC mini-series version of the story everywhere. (which I still think is better than the new movie).As I dont commonly read this era's type wording, it took me a good few chapters before I quit stumbling over terminology and sentence structure.Of course, it's a love story to shame all others...and so it gets 4 stars!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"For many years I considered Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" to be one of those many required readings from high school that was meant to be tediously plowed through. Was I ever wrong!While the language is more proper and formal than what we are used to today, and certainly the customs and arrangements are very different, P&P; is in many ways a simply timeless love story about two people who seemingly dislike each other at first sight, but who are truly so right for one another. A century or two will not diminish this romance!At the heart of the story is the Bennet family, a family that has been \\"cursed\\" with five daughters and no sons to inherit the family's home and estate - - lovely, softspoken oldest daughter Jane, spunky and spirited Elizabeth, bookish, serious, almost dour Mary, silly, giggly Kitty and flirty, precocious and spoiled Lydia. Mrs. Bennet's sole consideration and worry in life seems to be finding appropriate husbands for her daughters, mostly so that once Mr. Bennet dies, she shouldn't be kicked out of her home with nowhere to go. It will quickly become apparent to the reader that Mrs. Bennet's favorite child is Lydia, mostly because Lydia seems the closest reflection to Mrs. Bennet's character herself.Into this story comes the Bingley and Darcy families - - sweet, good natured Charles, who quickly falls in love with Jane, his critical, judgmental sister Caroline, who secretly yearns for marriage to Charles' best friend, Mr. Darcy, who seems uninterested in the entire endeavor.As with most romance stories, the road to true love is a bumpy one. Mr. Darcy, although obviously finding Elizabeth attractive, feels that her station in life is beneath his. Elizabeth finds his pride and aloofness infuriating. Jane and Mr. Bingley, although in love, are torn apart by his sister, who believes that a marriage to one of the Bennet girls would be most unfortunate for her family. Add the arrival of Mr. Bennet's cousin, Mr. Collins, who as the next male of kin will inherit the Bennet home - - and his frantic search for a bride and Mrs. Bennet's efforts to assist him; Elizabeth's dear friend Charlotte, a spinster of twenty-seven who accepts what life has offered her and makes some difficult choices of her own, in order that she might be merely content with her arrangements; Mr. Darcy's haughty aunt, and Mr. Collins' benefactress, Lady Catherine De Burgh, who has serious aspirations of her own to make Mr. Darcy her daughter's husband; the seductive Wickham, who shares a secret past with the Darcy family and catches the impressive Lydia's eye, nearly bringing downfall to the Bennet family.All in all, this was an incredibly satisfying story on all fronts - - a rich character study, an earnest romance, and comedy. The ending seemed almost rushed and an afterthought - - but perhaps because I had fallen in love with the stories and characters, I simply did not want P&P; to end.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This book is timeless and never grows old.

The articulate language and complex characters draw the reader into the story of sisters trying to find their place in life. The way in which it is written is rare to find in today's society, creating a sense of mystery and the unknown about society of the past. Elizabeth Bennett, the heroine of the novel, is a character that is easily relatable to for women both in the time that it was written and for modern women today. She struggles internally to find where her heart truly belongs, and leads the reader to question whether they themselves are actually proud and/or prejudiced."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a masterpiece and the Penguin Hardcover classic version is pure pleasure to read.

I often found myself smiling and occasionally laughing while reading the book. This book had such a profound influence on my life that I'm now an English major in college. After reading this I sought out other books in the same style like the Bronte sisters. Over the years, I've basically forced all of my friends and poor boyfriends to read this book so I could talk about it with them.

Jane Austin really knows how to make the characters come alive and you experience the book as if you are the one telling the story.

I am sure it was not an easy task to write feelings for another person. Unless you experience them yourself, how can you say it for another?

If you like history, romance, and a great story line then I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen masterfully tells this story which helps the reader engage in the relationships of people. Like her earlier compelling novel, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice is a romance story. Although there are many different printings of this work, T. Egerton, Whitehall first published it in January 28th 1813 with roughly 370 pages. While the original print did not have illustrations the first wonderful pictures were by Pickering & Greatbatch.Pride and Prejudice owes much of its popularity to its vivid portrayal of character. The story is set in early 19th-century England, a trying time for any unmarried maiden. Elizabeth, the second eldest of the Benett sister, was as open as a closed book shielding her true feelings. While Mr. Darcy would proudly separate himself from the common folk. Both characters are very likable despite their flaws.This pleasurable tale begins with the worries of a caring mother. Back then it was incredibly important for women to get married and none of her five daughters had. Thankfully a young bachelor by they name of Mr. Bingley came to town and was immediately attracted to the oldest Benett sister, Jane. Elizabeth on the other hand was somewhat fond of Mr. Darcy but he seemed to show no interest. Although Jane and Mr. Bingley had grown quite close, he left along with the rest of his party leaving a brokenhearted Jane behind. Elizabeth found out that Mr. Darcy was the one who convinced Mr. Bingley to go. While she was visiting at a friend's house she and Mr. Darcy crossed paths and he tried to propose to her. Still upset that he had broken up Mr. Bingley and her sister she declined the proposal.After a heated argument with Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth saw eye to eye with him and realized they had both been prejudice and maybe a little proud. Fortuitously, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy both moved back to town were they showed up to the Benett's house and had a somewhat awkward conversation. Later Mr. Bingley, who arrived alone, asked if he could speak to Jane apart from the other. A proposal maybe? If that wasn't enough to fill the mind of Elizabeth, knowing she thinks of Mr. Darcy differently would.Interestingly Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy both recognized that they were prideful and prejudice. Which hints to why the title is call Pride and Prejudice. They're imperfect characters, and that's what people like about them! When I was reading this book I realized what made it different from other romance novels is that the love unfolded gradually. At some points in the book it seemed as if they didn't like each other at all. A lot of stories now a days quickly get to the point, forgetting that telling the story is the best part."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I wanted to read some of the classic novels that are available for Kindle, and now I am hooked!

Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down, Austen immediately sucks you in with witty word play, dramatic irony, and catching plot points. The novel captures a wide audience, whether the reader is a hopeless romantic or more practical. It appeals to everyone; I can guarantee that future readers will not be disappointed. The main character, Elizabeth, is complex, stubborn, and full of wit. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy both exude passion. Although there are multiple story lines the majority of the plot revolves around the love-hate relationship of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet. Their relationship is full of twists and turns that are incredibly enticing to the audience. \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,\\" this is the opening line of the novel, and it is perhaps one of the most know phrases in literature. It is incredibly ironic, and ties into the whole book.Pride and Prejudice is a spectacular book for the reason that it leaves readers wanting nothing. Some readers may say that it is an unrealistic ending, because many of the main characters had their fairy tale ending. In my opinion that is what makes this book a great read. There aren't enough happy endings in the world, but when reading about them it feels as if it's your own personal happy ending. Overall, it's a classic romance that I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys a clever, well written, and whirlwind romance."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I read this for my English class, and I have to say that I loved it!

I was not disappointed.The reader was Kate Reading who did an excellent job capturing the characters and what I imagined the accents for that time and place would be. I found myself drawn into this novel and was always anxious to listen once again. I normally just listen while I'm driving but found myself listening at home for a few hours.Jane Austen's writing style and characters are very captivating. I found myself recognizing some of the characteristics of the characters in people I know and liked how she showed strengths and weaknesses in the major players. I especially liked the father's subtle sense of humor. I will definitely read more of her books.I strongly recommend this audio book for anyone wishing to enjoy literature at its best.

Great if your listening to it on the CD, but a nightmare if you want to put it on your favorite MP3 player."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", first published in 1813, is considered her best novel. It continues to be a fertile source of material for television and film adaptations. First marketed as a romance, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" might today be labeled a romantic comedy. Its enduring appeal lies partly in Austen's biting and still relevant social commentary on the rituals leading to marriage as practiced in Regency-era England.\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a good wife.\\" So begins the story, as the five eligible young Bennet daughters and their scheming mother learn of the arrival in their small English village of a wealthy young man and his wealthy friends. A village dance provides the opportunity to meet the newcomers. The wealthy young man, Mr. Bingley, quickly becomes attracted to Miss Jane Bennet, the pretty, even-tempered, but reserved oldest sister. Elizabeth Bennet, the spirited and headstrong second sister, meets but immediately dislikes his seemingly haughty friend Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth is more interested in the charming young Army officer Mr. Wickham, who feeds her derogatory stories about Mr. Darcy that she is all too prepared to hear. As the relationship between Mr. Bingley and Jane deepens, Elizabeth is ardently courted by her cousin Mr Collins, an obnoxious and clueless clergyman. Elizabeth, to the despair of her mother, will not have Mr. Collins, who instead marries her spinster friend Charlotte. When Mr. Bingley suddenly departs the village without proposing to Jane, Elizabeth soon suspects the proud Mr. Darcy of curtailing the relationship based on Jane's lesser social status. While visiting Charlotte, Elizabeth is astonished to receive a proposal of marriage from Mr. Darcy, which she refuses in the most scathing terms.This failed proposal is the dramatic crux of the story. Mr. Darcy, mortified by Elizabeth's refusal and by her accusations with respect to his pride and his actions toward Jane and Mr. Wickham, writes a long letter to her. The letter, if not exactly an apology, makes clear that Wickham's accusations were false, and that Mr. Darcy's actions in separating Mr. Bingley and Jane were based on the perception that Jane was less enthusiastic about marriage than her intended partner. Elizabeth begins to realize that she has been guilty of prejudice as well, a feeling reinforced by a chance meeting with Mr. Darcy and his adoring sister at his home of Pemberly in Darbyshire. When Elizabeth's flirtatious younger sister Lydia elopes with Mr. Wickham, Mr. Darcy will have the opportunity to prove his character and his love to Elizabeth.Austen's novel contains a huge cast of well-developed characters and a series of cascading social mishaps, yet the story remains tightly focused on the relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. They are attracted to each other fairly early in the story, yet are unable to appreciate each other's qualities for pride and prejudice.Underlying the humor in the social mishaps is a grim economic reality of Regency England, that failure to make a good marriage could doom middle class women like Jane and Elizabeth to a life of poverty. For Elizabeth's friend Charlotte, still single at 27, a loveless marriage to Mr Collins brings the saving grace of financial security. Lydia's elopement with Mr. Wickham not only disgraced her family but threatened to make her sisters ineligible for marriage as well. The Bennet family's lack of social standing and manners was a serious barrier to the making of good marriages, a fact less obvious to today's readers.Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" features a engaging plot, lots of excellent dialogue and two classic romantic characters in Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, a combination that holds up astonishingly well nearly two hundred years on. It is very highly recommended to fans of the various Jane Austen film productions as the entertaining source of the story."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Classic, timeless, beautiful fiction. Perfect for young and old (I've read it a dozen times, but it was also a great gift for my niece to introduce her to classic literature)."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that neither wants in the beginning but both can scarcely resist by the end. Other subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own and the various doings of family and friends. This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of the characters and their actions.The two main characters are probably as well fleshed out as any you are likely to see. They are certainly complex and multi-layered and they both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. The supporting characters are considerably less deep and are almost uniformly caricatures more than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written as it is a romantic drama and these secondary characters are all part of the tapestry that allowed Miss Austen to skewer her contemporaries so effectively. There are a few times where I thought a character's behavior was over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find any serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I really enjoyed the sense of humour and the plot.

It took me a while to read it, about 2 months, because it's definitely not fast paced. I was glad I had seen the movie first because it made the whole thing easier to understand.Mr. Darcy is \\"pride\\" and Elizabeth Bennett is \\"prejudice\\". These two are made for each other, unbeknown to themselves. This is essentially the story of how they fall in love, with lots of twists and turns.I really like Mr. Darcy. He is the perfect gentleman. He is readily willing to admit his own faults, when they are brought to his knowledge. He also doesn't retaliate when rejected by Elizabeth and accused of things he didn't do or that are misunderstood.Elizabeth is also wonderful. She is doubtful about people and quite cynical. I really like that about her. It makes for some great banter between Darcy and herself.My favorite part of the book is when Elizabeth see Darcy at Pemberly. This is where I think she begins to fall in love with him. Pemberly is where he is at home- where is is truly himself. I would probably be charmed by him too!This book took a little commitment to get through, but once I got into it, I couldn't wait to see what happened next, even though I already knew the story.

The author does a great job of creating likeable, interesting characters. You have to love Elizabeth Bennet and her boldness. You must also love: Mr. Bennet's wonderful sense of humor, Mr. Collins' silly behavoir and what a haughty b*tch Mrs. de Bourgh is. Secondly, the author is very crafty in unfolding a plot in which the reader fully understands how their could have been lots of misunderstandings between Miss Bennet and Mr. Darcy.

The female narrator reads all of the character's dialogue, but in a way that is easy to listen to. She doesn't overemphasize, nor is she monotone.

While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"By far one of Jane Austen's most celebrated novels, Pride and Prejudice exists as a groundbreaking novel that paved the way for entertainment today. Think of Pride and Prejudice as a 19th century daytime soap chock-full of deceit and motive. Without the novel, we would probably live in a world free from \\"Gossip Girl\\" and \\"The Hills\\". Well, I guess that wouldn't be such a tragedy. But overall, Pride and Prejudice displays Austen's precise use of the English language, coupled with intricate interpersonal relationships that are sure to keep readers amused.Pride and Prejudice centers on the Bennets, a middle class family living in 19th century rural England. The protagonist, Elizabeth Bennet, is witty and attractive while her older sister Jane is shy and sensible. Their younger sisters, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia exist as foils; as they are immature and ridiculous. Also in contrast, Mrs.Bennet is scatter-brained and judgmental, while Mr. Bennet is serious and dislikes any frivolity.The Bennets' world is turned upside down when a wealthy gentleman named Mr.Bingley arrives at his country home in a neighboring town. Accompanying Mr.Bingley are his snobby sisters and his impolite friend Mr.Darcy. It is when the Bennets, particularly Elizabeth and Jane, begin to intermix with their upper class arrivals that the drama is truly set in motion. The characters from both economic classes experience love, heartbreak, deceit, loss, and the side effects of pride and social standing.For those readers who seek an action packed, plot driven novel, Pride and Prejudice is not for you. The novel relies on character development and there are several chapters where the plot remains stagnated. Also, it is difficult at times to decipher some of the text, due to the fact that it is written in antiquated English. Again, this book is not for you if you do not wish to interpret phrases such as \\"she fancied herself nervous\\" (page 7) or \\"a mixture of quick parts\\" (page 7).Although it is more of a difficult read and is often stagnant, Pride and Prejudice has remained a classic for a reason. The novel's romanticism and elaborate depiction of characters has and will continue to make it a favorite among readers."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"These little classic editions are perfectly sized (small) and handsomely built. And the price is RIGHT. They are my favorite reading books -- nice binding and pages. I also enjoy the occasional illustrations. And they look very nice on my bookshelf.

I often play the CDs while I am driving and the time flies. Susannah York's animated reading of Jane Austen's novel includes voicing the lines of the various characters. Even though I have seen the 2005 movie and the 1995 TV miniseries, I feel I have a much better understanding of the various plot points after listening to this audio version. This rendition follows the book more closely, although it is an abridged version."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The story line is good but the writing style takes a little getting used to.

I myself have read it at least twice per year since the age of sixteen. The characters are extremely well developed and the time period well defined. One of the best books of the period to be sure. Mr. Darcy is sure to win the hearts of every girl who reads about him. Emma is the next best book to follow up with, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is not a review of the novel itself, (which is wonderful) but of the Winchester Austen Edition (henceforth WAE) of Pride and Prejudice, published by Word Press in 2007.After buying a copy of WAE &#34;Emma&#34; in Costco, I knew I had to have &#34;Pride & Prejudice&#34; in WAE as well. Here's why:-The WAE versions of Jane Austen's books are hardcover and physically comfortable in that they are printed on smooth white paper rather than typical beige rough paper and the typeface is solid roman type that is easy on the eyes.-The size is approximately 5X8. The corners of the pages are rounded giving it a soft look. The covers of all WAE, are completely black, except for the title and author and also have rounded corners. Attached to the back cover is an elastic band that goes around the height of the book and you can use this as a book mark or as a way to keep your book closed.-Each WAE novel has colorful inside covers depicting a scene from the novel and there are nice color drawings included in the introduction.-Each novel has at least three sets of notes written by Austen scholars. Most of the notes are the same in all the novels, but each novel has one additional note section peculiar to that novel. The notes that all editions have are a timeline in color of Jane Austen's world and a color map of Austen's England. In P&P; the additional notes is the illustrated Army in Austen's time.I bought used copies of WAE novels because even used, they are sturdy and comfortable. I am very hard on books by intention. I read while I eat, before I sleep, while waiting on lines, etc. But mainly, I like to embellish my books with beads, ribbons and lace, and even some rubber stamping on the white spaces in the text itself. I wouldn't have the heart to do that to an expensive hardcover.If you like the &#34;feel&#34; of books, I highly recommend the Winchester Austen Edition of any of Austen's novels. Let me know what you think."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Great book I read it in a week loved this classic book Lizzy and Darcy is a true love story"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This timeless classic by Jane Austin is probably the best illustration of why we should not let ourselves be guided by first impressions. Most previous reviewers have considered only prejudice itself to be the theme of this book, but I am convinced that this was not all of Miss Austin's theme (though it was a major part of it), but rather she was also showing the folly of judging people by our first impressions of them. Elizabeth (the main character), judged Mr. Darcy by her first impression of him (which was bad). She let her opinion of him be decided by this first impression, thus she was prejudiced against him. I think most people tend to focus on the prejudice and pass over the step that leads to it. Also, the same thing happens with Mr. Wickham. She lets her first impression of him (which was good) guide her opinion of him, which later turned out to be completely wrong, just as she had been about Mr. Darcy.Now, do not mistake me, prejudice is a major part of this book, but I think it is important to note that Miss Austin is not just showing us the effects and foolishness of prejudice, but even deeper, she is showing the precursor to prejudice, which is (in many cases) judging by first impressions.As for the form of this book, I thought it was very well written. There was no action whatsoever, unless you include going for a walk in your definition of action. I found it incredible that Miss Austin was able to write in such a way as to keep one's attention for hundreds of pages while including (almost) nothing but dialogue and very minor events.I also loved the believableness of her characters. Almost every character strongly reminded me of someone I knew, they were so like real people, which is very rare in novels, especially in Miss Austin's era. I think that Mr. Bennet quickly became one of my favorite fictional characters with his wit and dry humor, and Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy were very good characters as well. Mrs. Bennet was, as I suppose was Miss Austin's intention, very annoying and frustrating, even to the reader. Somehow the characters in this book were just more \\"real\\" than they are in most books."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I must admit Pride and Prejudice is one of those many books I \\"spark noted\\" in high school rather than reading. It wasn't that I wasn't an avid reader, just at the time I more enjoyed silly sci fi books. Looking back I'm very happy that it isn't until now that I've read this book, because now I think I am more able to fully appreciate it. The characters are very well developed. Be them witty, silly, meddling, proud or prejudicial, they are all a pleasure to get to know and explore. The story as a whole, and the way it is presented to the reader is wonderfull. This is, to date, one of the best books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. (And any one who disagrees should be immediatley taken out back and shot, or at the very least pitied for their simple-mindedness.)"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful book. Don't let anyone tell you it's not. A review in here got me thinking though. They said there is no such thing as books that are better than others because it's all subjective. This person is wrong, simple as that. Certain books are not literary towers because people have said &quot;wow! amazing!&quot; people say that about Harry Potter! I mean really! What distinguishes a book and makes it &quot;better&quot; than others, is if it's around in fifty, one hundred years. Pride and Prejudice has done this. It is &quot;better&quot; than other books."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I admired Darcy the first time I read this book at the age of 12 and yet now again at the age of 31 after having reread this book, I find myself surprised to experience the same feeling.Yes, he is pretty disagreeable in the beginning, but then I find people who don't intend to impress everyone to be more honest in the long run. Darcy's character grows on one as one goes forward in the story.As for Elisabeth, she matures remarkably, in general I find the book very realistic , we are all full of pride and prejudice when we meet people and they prevent us from seeing many of their more valuable qualities."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I can still remember the act of reading this book, during a rather blase summer vaction in the middle of my college years.

She realized that people are complex, and included their different sides in these characters. It's a feel good book, and we need those once in a while. Its like a mature fairy tale. This is my favorite book, however I only give it four stars because it didn't pose a challenge or have me ready to change the world, however I enjoyed this enduring love story."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"\\"I\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\" This is the opening that initiated the whole story with a click, that not only addressed the theme of this book, but also of a \\"universally acknowledged\\" truth.In my long search for a literary classic that I could both enjoy reading as well as get something out of, I finally ended up with \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", by Jane Austen. Upon reading the first sentence of this book, I was immediately captured by the story liveliness and soon found myself hooked. In addition to the lively, vivid tone of the book, what enchanted me the most was the seamless way in which each character behaviors and interactions were so carefully woven together in an intricate plot.Some characters that appear in the book are:- Mr. Bennet, a brilliant, sarcastic man who likes to ridicule the silliness of his wife- Mrs. Bennet, a middle aged woman who is eager to marry her daughters off to rich and prosperous families when they come of age- Their five daughters:- Jane, who, being the eldest, believes in human good and righteousness in all human beings,- Mary, their third child, who is always absorbed in books thinking about this and that- The shy Catherine, also known as Kitty, who always followed her flirtatious younger sister, Lydia around in flirting with officers.However, all the characters and indeed the whole story revolves around Miss. Elizabeth Bennet the second oldest sister, a witty, headstrong girl, and Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, a very queer, shy man. At first sight, Elizabeth's assumption and observation towards Mr. Darcy pride made her prejudiced against him. Yet in the end an unexpected twist ends this book in a very satisfactory manner.Although many readers especially teenagers might be \\"prejudiced\\" against reading the old \\"classics\\", I found this book to be quite interesting. This book gave me an insight on the thoughts of the people during that time period, and some hints how they were suppress or discriminated by the class system."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Like others, I came to this novel after years of it being pushed upon me like a drug. \\"Read it, you'll love it!\\" It took several starts and a snowy winter far from home to finally render the book's period drama understandable. As a student and fan of women's history, I was initially drawn in not by the plot of the story (though it is what soon carries you through to the delicious conclusion) but by the fascination of viewing family life in another time. As with any period piece, geographical, political, and mannerly allusions are lost without some historical understanding of the time. Not every \\"great book\\" is for every person. Also, PandP is very much a romance; you must be willing to romanticize to truly appreciate Eliza Bennett's struggle and change of heart. So don't feel you must read it just because others tell you to. But if you find yourself in a wistful mood, ready to be immersed in another world, give this one a try. Chances are, it will lead you to a minor obsession with Jane Austen.Extensions of the original: If the recent movie starring Kiera Knightley was enjoyable, the book will be more so, with richer details and more drama. Also recommended as a companion is the fullest dramatization of the book, the BBC's version starring Colin Firth. And for a chick lit homage, read the Bridget Jones books."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"this is definitely an amazing piece of literature. i love it now, and will with no doubt still love it in the years to come. i believe it to be flawless, and Jane Austen deserves all the credit in the world for this book. the fact that it has endured the test of time, and has been enjoyed by generation after generation speaks volumes. i believe that the subtleties and simplicity of the story is what makes it the masterpiece it is. Jane Austen's ability to turn a simple love story, into something greater, while completely engrossing us without the fluff of a typical romance are what make her a literary genuis in her own right. her novels are literary dessert. they aren't filled with the complexities and deep themes of dickens', hardy's, or eliot's works, they are light-hearted and this very fact is what makes pride and prejudice an amazng piece of art. Elizabeth and Darcy come to life, and simply jump out of the text. The characters, their lives, the struggles they face, the decisions (and indecisions), and most importanty their eventual happiness are what make the book. no praise i can offer will completely do this masterpiece justice, so i urge you to read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a look at times and customs from a point of view not available in books by modern authors."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have always loved classic literature, and belive Jane Austen to be one of the best classic authors! &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; and &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; are my two favorite books of all time. I think Austen was brilliant in this book because she is able to write so well about (and let's face it, fellow Austen fans--) such a mundane story line! The plot is very simply the story of five un-wed sisters and their very normal life at trying to get engaged. That's all there is to it. Why, then do we find this work so intoxicatingly enchanting? It is because of Austen's brilliant way with words...her descriptions of her witty heroine and handsome hero.If you like this book, I highly recommend reading Emma by Jane Austen and my other fave-- Jane Eyre. :) I give this book six stars!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austin wrote a story set in what i originally thought of as a boring period in time. Her story, however, is about five daughters and their love lives. The parents in the story are funny(the father is very sarcastic and the mother is obsessed w/getting her daughters married well off). I was surprised at how easy it was to read and how much it reminded me of modern teenage drama."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is definitely a book I would want my daughter to read.

Although the book is better than the series, I don't know if I'd fully understand the sarcasm and irony in the description of the characters. I despise Mr. Collins, but I also find him very amusing. And I admire Elizabeth for her honesty to herself and to others.

I particularly liked the scene between Lizzy and Lady Catherine where Lady C demands a promise of her-that of never agreeing to marry Mr.Darcy-every dialogue is so well thought out and even though there is so little of a story to relate,the way the book keeps you rapt with attention is amazing! Whenever I feel lonely or left out this book makes me feel like a part of all its frolicking and ball-dancing.I think that is the power of an author-to be able to make a reader empathise and live thro' the pages.

While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton.

The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other.

Well, it surely is a girly book since the majority of the story is about romance. There are also themes of family, marriage, society, class, etc. The story was pretty good but boring in some parts. However, the ending really left me wanting a sequel. It made me want to know about *spoiler* the life after Elizabeth and Darcy's marriage. I also wanted to know how Darcy's sister will turn out and if she will also find her fated one. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet's situation in life is also greatly altered. It would have been interesting to see how they will get along and if there would be any rekindling of past fires or not. The two unmarried sisters can also be a topic of exploration, especially Kitty seeing as to how civil and improved she's becoming. I will miss Elizabeth and Darcy's witty conversations and I would have been delighted to read about a jealous Darcy. A sequel would have been perfect. Seriously, it would have been fun to read about their life after marriage and if they were going to have any kids or not. Then maybe there would be someone new in town who would intimidate Darcy and fight for Elizabeth's affection, which of course, can only belong to Darcy. Ohh! The possibilities are endless! How I wish for a sequel. Before anyone else writes one though, I will have to be satisfied with my imagination. I am aware of the fanfiction sequels out there, but there will never be a true sequel to this book. I'm also curious as to whether Elizabeth would conform to the upper class or not. Wonders if she improves her piano and other skills like the arts. And their kids.....would they be more like Elizabeth or Darcy?

Being the case, I have a number of observations:1. The conversations feel that the parties involved are having an oratorical debate. It was an art in itself. Obviously, nobody speaks this way anymore. The language was so lyrical, very personally addressed, either face to face or through a proper letter.2. It was a time when ladies were expected (as dictated by good manners, decorum and propriety) to have knowledge of the arts and music. In contrast to the present time, parents and elders lovingly cultivate/develop the natural talents of their children. For those with no natural inclination, it is openly accepted as such, and never forced. At least this is what I have observed in general.3. It is a good thing that women of the present time share an equal footing with men (at least in many parts of the world), that they are not just relegated to marriage when they become of age. Imagine being set for marriage the moment a girl turns 16, with the mother almost in panic if her daughter is not engaged by the time she's twenty!4. What a closed and judgmental society it was during that time. The elopement of one daughter to an \\"undeserving\\" man ruined not only her reputation but that of her whole family as well, in the process making her other sisters almost unfit for marriage.5. Fifty miles of good road equals half a day's journey by carriage! Thank God for the automobile!I enjoyed this novel a lot, though it took some time for me to read because of the lyrical prose, which I am not so used to, and also the typos. Just the same, lyrical prose and all, it brought about the same excited feelings as when I read modern chick-lit fiction. I would have rated this a complete 5-star if not for the many typos in the Kindle edition."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I'm reviewing the Penguin Classics edition rather than the content of the novel itself (which is wonderful). The cover is beautifully decorated, nicely textured, and sturdy, the introduction and notes are interesting but not obtrusive, the paper is high quality, the print is very readable (the font is not too small like some other editions of classic literature), and the colored ribbon adds a touch of refinement as well as utility.

I first read Pride and Prejudice when I was 6-7 (I know, a little young, but I love to read), and I loved it. I've read the book 12-13 times, seen both big TV miniseries and the Laurence Olivier movie adaption, and a stage adaption. It remains on my list of top ten favorites. I love everything about it. I love the charming Edwardian language, the character's, and the plot. This book is not a girly fluffy book, even though the plot is a bit of an old one (who knows, maybe the plot came from J.A.?). I fell in love with Darcy and Elizabeth from the very start, and I still love them. I've read this book at least once every year since I first read it, and it just get's better every time. I laugh in it, which is unusual for me, I rarely laugh in books, even funny ones. What more can I say? If you haven't read it, then you ought to, don't just watch the movies. The only thing is that I've never found a guy who has willingly read it, and I've never found one that liked it. What's wrong with our guys?"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I absolutely hated &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; when I tried to read it in high school. While I absolutely loved romances and novels set in the 19th century, when I attempted &quot;P&amp;P,&quot; I got as far as the scene where Elizabeth strolls around the room with one of Mr. Bingley's sisters and thought that all this walking up and down was the stupidest thing anyone could do and quit reading it.I didn't start appreciating Jane Austen until I read &quot;Persuasion&quot; for a graduate history class that explored how the concept of womanhood changed between the late 18th century and the beginning of Queen Victoria's reign. Our goal was to examine whether the new Victorian ideal of womanhood was something women themselves embraced or a role thrust upon them. And at last, I began to appreciate Jane Austen.By the time I got around to rereading &quot;P&amp;P,&quot; Emma Thomson's delightful adaptation of &quot;Sense and Sensability&quot; had made it to theaters, and I was old enough to appreciate that love at first site can be a disaster.Jane Austen may have been the first novelist to write about love from a woman's point of view--and wrote at a time when marriages were becoming more about love and not just financial considerations. Throughout many of her novels, Austen struggles with whether money should matter in matters of the heart. She seems to want to say that money shouldn't matter, and yet recognizes that when a young woman's entire future depended on her husband's financial status, money still had to matter.&quot;P&amp;P&quot; begins with the wealthy Mr. Bingley renting a house near the home of the Bennetts, a family with five daughters, no sons and an entailed estate that would have to pass to the nearest male relative. Much to her daughter Elizabeth's frustration, Mrs. Bennett immediately begins plotting ways to snag Mr. Bingley for one of her daughters. At a party, Elizabeth first encounters Mr. Darcy. Overhearing his criticism of her immediately gets them off on the wrong foot. As the novel unfolds, Darcy and Elizabeth discover each other's true nature, and eventually misunderstandings are repaired, and they develop an appreciation of each other. The pacing of &quot;P&amp;P&quot; more realistically reflects the growth of true love than many novels that I've read. Austen's witty commentary about courting rituals makes the book highly entertaining.To enrich the experience of reading &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; pick up a copy of Fay Weldon's &quot;Letters to Alice Upon Her First Reading of Jane Austen.&quot; Weldon's collections of essays to her fictitious niece enrich the experience of reading Jane Austen's novels by exploring what makes certain works absolute classics, what life was like for women in the early 19th century, and what Austen's life was like as she was writing these novels."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"One thing I have learned form reading this book and then reading some reviews, is that one can either hate it or love it. Or love it and hate it at the same time.In my case, I loved the tale, it is one of must-read classics, and who ever enjoys romantic novels of any sort will fall in love with the story.Jane Austen, a great author, certainly has captured my heart making this tale to remind me of love when everthing else doesn't."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I love this book!

For guy readers, I can only say that this is one of my father's favorite books; whether he is abnormal or just romantic I don't know, but anyhow this is such a good book that it should be required reading! Also, for anyone who did not like the slow action in the book, you must see the BBC movie with Jennifer Elhe and Colin Firth.

When i first began to read it, i thought i'd instantly hate it. i'm not a big fan of romance novels, but i decided to give this book a try. I was delightfully suprized with the vivid language and great dialogue which Austen used, and the novel kept my interest better than i had ever expected. from the famous opening lines, &quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife&quot;, to the wedding at the end, this was a great book. At some points, i got confused py a paragraph, or even chapter, and i had to re-read it carefully so i could fully understand the authors point, but other than that, i could comprehend the book easily. It is the first romantic book that has ever kept my attention, and i hope this will inspire me to try other books that i would otherwise walk right by without giving it a thought. The book did a very good job of developing the characters, as well. By the end of the book, i felt i had a good grasp on who's personalities Jane Austen wanted to emphasize, and what each character's roll in the plot was. Overall, i feel this was an excellent book, and i would reccomend it to enyone who loves to read, even if you're not a reguar reader of novels such as this one."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a wonderful piece of literature. I have never read a truly great book until this. I have loved many books that I have read, but this book is beyond compare. As soon as I began reading, I became engrossed in it. I finished this book so fast it felt like the book was only 100 pages. I t was such quick read that I read approximately 250 pages in one weekend; I couldn't put it down. I strongly urge everyone to read this book, whatever the age. I am only in ninth grade and even now I'm able to understand its literary value. Although I can speak highly of the novel, there are some things that I can criticize. The most complicated aspect of the book was the language. At some points I had to go back and reread a passage to fully understand it. It is true that the language is beautiful, but frankly, I find it confusing. If you are not up to the challenge of figuring out the meaning of some different words, do not read this book The only other aspect of the novel that at times seemed irksome, was the long passages in which there was little dialogue. These passages sometimes contained Elizabeth's thoughts and observations, but it was the parts other than these that bothered me. The long descriptions of the fields and rooms bored me. This was unnecessary because it did not advance the plot or carry a large amount of importance. When a new plot line suddenly came into existence, this would be weaved in. In moments of suspense I just skimmed through these parts because they were not entirely related to the plot. My favorite plot line was the development and change of people and their feelings, especially love. This novel genuinely showed me how humans' feelings towards one another change, along with their judgments and prejudices. Throughout the novel the two main characters, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy profoundly changed in enjoyable ways. Additionally, these changes describe the title, which I found most appropriate. When we first met Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy he was presented as aloof, cold, and full of abominable pride. As the story progresses we see a profound change in his character, which commences when he professes his love for Elizabeth. After this, we begin to see the real, improved Mr. Darcy. By the end of the story Elizabeth even says this about him, \\" Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable.\\" By overcoming his pride he leads Elizabeth to make a few changes of her own. Elizabeth is the character that I feel made the most significant changes throughout the story. I feel this way because she altered two major things in her life. The first, which I feel led to the second, is when Elizabeth realized her prejudice and surpassed it. She does not find this out about herself until wonderful Mr. Darcy places a white envelope in her hands. After reading what was inside the envelope she describes herself as, \\" blind, partial, prejudice, absurd.\\" The second thing that changed about her was her feelings towards Mr. Darcy. Over several months her feelings for Mr. Darcy grow fonder each time they meet, until she realizes her overwhelming love for him This is a classic love story, which I believe deserves much attention. In one word, this story is enchanting. The story of the Bennet girls will be one I will treasure forever. Finally, I will never forget the way Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy came together and overcame, their pride and prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This book is not only an epitome of classic literature, it is actually interesting. I bet if they made a poll, the people who read this book would be happier in life than most. I love this book so much.

Pride and Prejudice is one of the best books in the world. I just love the story of five sisters and their foolish and funny mother who thinks about nothing but marrying her daughters. Mr Darcy ,who marries Elizabeth, is my all time favorite male novel charachter. His passionate love for Elizabeth and his incredibly romantic nobleness will make him a favourite with female readers.There are people who consider the book boring , but if it is because of the Victorian English I think it just makes the book more classic and valuable."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"First of all, let me start out by saying, I love this book! I'm 17 years old and Pride and Prejudice has been my favorite book for years. It was the first work of Jane Austen's that I had ever read and it prompted me to read her others. In my opinion, Pride and Prejudice and Emma are her two very best. Her characters are so well-developed that you feel like you actually know them. Elizabeth in P&amp;P is an amazing and intelligent young woman. She has so much spirit that it's admirable. Darcy is intelligent as well and he has a self-confidence that makes him very attractive. The plot is always moving, always interesting. I've read P&amp;P so many times and I never get bored. Everyone should have this book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride & Prejudice by Jane Austen has been made into several movies, and remained apart of High School reading lists for decades. It is a heart warming book that discusses family dynamics, true love, money, social order, first impressions and reputation.The story is told primarily in dialogue. This is perhaps why it has been able to be adapted into several movies. It is the story of the Bennet family and their romantic entanglements. Jane Bennet and her relationship with Mr. Bingley, as well as Eizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. The interactions between Miss Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are simply priceless. The famous proposal scene, and the line, \\"You are the last man in the world I could ever marry!\\" make this book an absolute gem.The only flaw with this book is the under developed characters. Only Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go through changes. Even though the characters are under developed they are unforgettable. From Lady Catherine to Mr. Collins they are all very different. Read this book you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is one of those novels which most people know the plot and the characters even if they haven't read the book. For myself, I had not read it in a long time, and I had also not seen any of the movies made using its plot, with the exception of the musical \\"Bride and Prejudice\\" a few years ago. I finally made time for it, and it was better than I had remembered. This was the second of Austen's novels to be published (published on January 28th, 1813), though the original novel (titled \\"First Impressions\\") was written between 1796 and 1797. There is no way to determine how much of the original novel remains and how much was rewritten, but clearly the two dealt on a larger scale with the some of the same themes.The main character of the story is Elizabeth Bennet who lives with her parents and her four sisters in the fictional town of Meryton. Elizabeth is the second eldest of the sisters after Jane. Outside of the Bennets, there is a large cast of characters including the three Bingley's, brother and two sisters, Mr. Collins, The Darcy's, Lady Catherine and her daughter, Colonel Fitzwilliam, the Lucases, Mr. Wickham, and the Gardiner's who are Elizabeth's aunt and uncle. The novel is told in three volumes, the first covers the period at Meryton where most of the key characters meet for the first time, the second covers the period after Bingley leaves Meryton unexpectedly along with those who came with him, and covers the period up to Elizabeth's visit to Mr. Darcy's home know as Pemberley, and the last covers the visit to Pemberley right through to the marriages and beyond.There are several plots running through the volumes. There is the relationship between Bingley and Jane, which Mr. Darcy tries to put an end to, along with the help of Mr. Bingley's sisters. There is Mr. Collins attempts to marry either Jane or Elizabeth, but ending up with Charlotte Lucas. There is the relationship between Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy as well as between their families. There is Lydia's scandalous running off in volume three. But by far the mail story line is the relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.In volume one, Mr. Darcy arrives as the guest of Mr. Bingley. Mr. Darcy's prideful manner results in a negative first impression with Elizabeth whose pride is hurt by his attitude and she develops her own prejudice against Mr. Darcy as a result. Mr. Darcy becomes intrigued with Elizabeth, but her own negative impression of him is reinforced by stories told by Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy's silent attitude towards her which she takes as his looking down on her. Thus, first impressions play a big role in the story, though to be sure other first impressions, such as the first impression of Mr. Collins which is shared by nearly everyone are fairly accurate.In volume two, their relationship develops. Mr. Darcy cannot ignore the feelings he has developed for Elizabeth and this results in three key events in this volume. One is Mr. Darcy's declaration of feelings to Elizabeth. The second is Elizabeth's stern rebuke of Mr. Darcy's feelings followed by an attack on his behavior towards the relationship between Jane and Mr. Bingley as well as Mr. Darcy's treatment of Mr. Wickham. This leads to the third key event, which is Mr. Darcy's letter to Elizabeth where he sets the matter straight about his actions. The second event results in Mr. Darcy writing the letter and changing his behavior, though we don't witness the latter until volume three. The third event is important as the reader is privy to Elizabeth's change in attitude resulting from what Mr. Darcy has told her.In volume three, their relationship completes its change, as Elizabeth gets to know Mr. Darcy from where he lives, and by those who work for him, and she also learns about his character from actions he takes on behalf of her family, which he never means her to learn about. We also witness the change in Mr. Darcy's behavior, not only towards Jane, but towards her entire family. Of course, it is obvious that the two will end up together, but knowing the end does not spoil the journey.There is good reason why this book is a classic and why it is still read and enjoyed today. The characters are believable and well rounded for the most part. There is humor, societal and family challenges, and moral lessons weaved together throughout the book. I can also recommend the Penguin Classics edition of this book, as it contains an introduction and notes by Vivien Jones, as well as an introduction written by Tony Tanner for an earlier edition of the book. The introductions are both interesting reading, and the notes are useful as well."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The Book:Dover Publications does it again. This has to be the ultimate reasonably-priced edition of Pride and Prejudice you could ever get your hands on. Don't be fooled by the image of the stuffy dust cover; underneath the beige paper is a red cloth-bound, gold-printed cover which would enhance the finest library. The endpapers are embossed with a floral design, which is a lovely touch.This is a republication of an 1894 edition, in which the typography is perfect - that is, there are fewer words to a page making it easy on the eyes, while your progress through the book goes rapidly through its 476 pages. The paper is high-quality yet lightweight, which is great for a large hardcover like this. But the best features this edition has are the original Victorian-era illustrations by Hugh Thomson. Just...beautiful!The Story:Reviewing a classic like this almost feels silly, so I will do so briefly. The story moves slowly from \\"interesting\\" to \\"greatness.\\" For the first third or so it seemed like a funny, lightweight girly-gossip novel, and I kept thinking, \\"This book has got nothing on Jane Eyre!\\" Then it took a twist, and another, and got complicated, and the characters were developed, and the story darkened and I got totally sucked in until I could not put it down. Yep. Classic. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I feel fully unqualified to pass judgment on Jane Austen, it is true. But I thought I'd add my voice to the chorus of acclamation that has attended it for decades. Pride and Prejudice is my favorite book--a masterpiece because of its writing (difficult and archaic, but beautiful), its plot (excellently woven and fully believable), and its characters (in whom Austen has perfectly captured the tendencies and caprice of human nature). It is lovable, enthralling, candid, and resonating.I don't like writing reviews that make the product sound flawless... except in this case, where I really believe it to be so."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice has long been my favorite book. But I must say, this edition is my favorite. The side notes are helpful in clearing up details that of the era which we don't understand. I would definately recommend this edition of Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable.In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were a few times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find any serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This novel begins with one of the most recognizable lines in literary history: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\" With that begins, perhaps, the most copied plot-line in human history.

It turns out the handsome newcomer, Charles Bingley, is a fine and friendly gentleman and he has a liking for Jane.Mr. Bingley's cohort, Fitzwilliam Darcy, is, however, not nearly so friendly. Cold and formal, he quickly incurs the dislike of Elizabeth. Mr. Darcy, though, appears somewhat taken by Elizabeth and makes some half-hearted advances. Despite his great wealth, Elizabeth distaste grows the more she learns of Mr. Darcy's past.Just as the relationship between Jane and Mr. Bingley appears set for matrimony, Mr. Bingley suddenly leaves the neighborhood. Certainly, it seems, this is the doing of Mr. Darcy. Jane's hopes dashed and Elizabeth finding only comically unsuitable suitors, the Bennett sisters are headed for old-maidom. That is, unless the terrible events are due to improper pride and/or prejudice.Though I am not a great Jane Austen admirer and find much of her writing overly ornamental and preoccupied with unimportant subject matter, there is no disputing the greatness of this novel. The language usage is clearly Austenesque, but this book is nevertheless genuinely a page turner. Moreover, the tone is pitch perfect - touching the emotions, but maintaining an appealing comic feel. I found myself delighted to be in the company of Jane Austen who, though her writing is over two centuries old and her experiences obviously much different from ours, has a surprisingly modern voice.Even more importantly, this book is an invaluable cultural gift. Though perhaps not in the same league as the Bible or some of Shakespeare's works, the influence of Pride and Prejudice on our culture is simply vast. Familiarizing yourself with Pride and Prejudice will make literally hundreds of cultural products more comprehensible (or reveal them to be unoriginal). The plot-line alone has spawned countless imitations, slight modifications and commentaries. The characters, especially Elizabeth and Darcy, have become veritable archetypes. This is one of those stories that you are already familiar with through its imitators. None, however, has done the material so well and so thoughtfully as Ms. Austen.Even if you don't have the stomach for Ms. Austen's other material, this novel is worth reading. It's both good for you and an enjoyable read - often a tough mix to find."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Never fear this is not a novelization.

That's how my favourite book of all time begins, and it just keeps getting better.This novel deals with the pride and prejudices of the main characters Miss Elizabeth Bennett, and Mr. Darcy, as they try to find true love in pre-Victorian England. Elizabeth is a gentleman's daughter and Mr. Darcy is a gentleman, but Elizabeth, along with the rest of her sisters, are not good catches because, their inheritance is being entailed away to their cousin Mr. Collins, leaving them with very miserable looking dowries. Along with poor family connections, they stand little chance of marrying well or at all; they only have their charms to help them.That is until Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood along with his sisters, and accompanying them his close friend Mr. Darcy. Mr. Bingley becomes captivated with Jane Bennett, Elizabeth's eldest sister, and Mr. Darcy has an eye for Elizabeth herself, but can he see past her poor conditions, and can she see past his pride in order for them to get together? That's the question that keeps the audience captivated right up to the end.I try and find time to read this book at least once a year, and I've been doing that for a few years, and yet, it's always fresh when a get around to reading it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I was 12 years old and had the rare privilege of going shopping alone with my Mum. (With 2 sisters and a brother, this event was EXTREMELY rare.) I asked if we could browse in the book store. Half an hour later, we emerged. I was carrying a paperbag in which was enclosed my first copy of 'Pride and Prejudice'. As soon as we got in the car I started reading. I finished the book that night and I started it again the next morning. Even at 12 years old, I knew I was experiencing a masterpiece. In the 15 years since that day I have revisited the story of Elizabeth and Darcy numerous times. It just keeps getting better and better. Elizabeth was my idol. Darcy replaced Prince Philip, (from Disney's 'Sleeping Beauty'), as the man of my dreams. Mrs Bennett's nerves began to irk me as much as they did the long-suffering Mr Bennett. I love this book and I can't even begin to praise it, and the wonderful Jane Austen, enough. If you haven't read it - WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? If you have read it, I think its time to get it off your shelf, or get down to the library and relive the magic of 'Pride and Prejudice' all over again."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed Pride &amp; Prejudice. Although it has to be called a romance, I personally feel that the fascination is much more about the rules of behavior and courtship in Victorian society. The same story set in the modern day would not be nearly so interesting because you no longer have the rules to navigate that are present in the time in which it is set. It is the compliance with these rules and the reaction when they are not followed properly that makes the social structure of the time (as it is presented here) more like a chess game than a simple romance story. This given with characters and settings that have a feel to them that reminds me of Little Women made this book a great deal of fun to read. It was fast paced with plenty of intrigues.The back of my book puts the entire plot into one short paragraph. I was at first concerned that this would take the fun out of the reading since who marries who in the end was spelled out right there. However, in reading it I realized that it is not WHAT happens in this book as much as it is HOW it happens and in this Austen is a true master. Essentially the story is of the five daughters of the Bennett family. The addle-brained mother has no other concern than to marry her daughters off and the detached father generally just makes fun of the whole situation. Jane and Elizabeth are the two eldest daughters and Jane forms an attachment early on to Bingley, a gentleman who has leased a house/estate nearby. When a pompous Mr. Darcy interferes in Jane's attachment to Bingley, Elizabeth is turned vehemently against him - a sentiment further deepened by aspersions made by Mr. Wickham, Mr. Darcy's father's godchild. As fate would have it, Mr. Darcy develops an attachment to Elizabeth and has to redeem himself in her eyes, despite his feelings of social superiority and her many resentments.I don't know if the title is to reflect the pride of Mr. Darcy and the prejudice of Elizabeth against him. At one point she says the following: \\" Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.\\" I see her really exploring this in the character of Mr. Darcy and his relations and feel that the title may have more to do with the exploration of this sentiment than in any of the individual characters."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"For the typical male, the only thing worse than reading a romance novel is reading a two-hundred-year-old romance novel. So why'd I bother? Because I'm a firm believer that serious readers should occasionally expand their horizons and sample books from other genres, especially those they'd normally pooh-pooh. Because that's when we get pleasantly surprised.Pride and Prejudice fell into this category for me. I wanted a break from the mystery/suspense genre and had heard good things about Jane Austen. As I dug in, my expectations were met early on: plodding, expository chunks of Old English describing landscapes and feelings. Ugh. But then she got me.Like peeling an onion, Austen uncovers characters and a story that are simply genius. Like Shakespeare, she proves again that time and technology have no impact on basic human impulses and the complexities of love. This book will be just as popular in another two hundred years. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"My 13 year old daughter and I just finished reading this book and LOVED it! As we read the book, we kept noticing that many of the characters remind us of people we know! It was funny, and really says a lot for Jane Austen's insight on human nature. Her characters are very realistic in my opinion.We learned from the book that in Jane Austen's time in England, it was very important to say and do the right things and to be excruciatingly polite. P&amp;P can be tedious to read until you get used to the way they talk, but once you do it really makes it even more amusing to read.I tried to read P&amp;P once before a few years ago, but I only got about a third of the way through the book. I just couldn't understand it well enough. I would recommend to anyone who was put off by the book to give it another chance. See one of the excellent videos first if you don't understand it, and then come back and literally FEAST on the book, which is so much better! I know that reading it has expanded my ability to appreciate good literature, and I know I will read all of Jane Austen's novels now."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"In case you are wondering, the novel it tied with is Dostoevsky's THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV.I have read this three times in three sittings.

I once stayed up all night long to finish it.Actually, I read it a fourth time, aloud to my then 8-year-old daughter Elizabeth (who was delighted to find an Elizabeth in the book). She liked it so much that she in turn read it twice. Just one of the great, irrestible book in the English language."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the most-beloved novels by Jane Austen. Words cannot do it justice, but I'll try anyway, since I love it so much. The story of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy is absolutely timeless. From the opening line, which is my all-time favorite opening line- \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a large portion must be in want of a wife,\\" we are drawn into this superb love affair, one which it is difficult to pull ourselves away from. I've read this book numerous times now and I always wonder what's going to happen.Here Jane Austen uses a sufficient amount of wit to satirize the social graces and foibles of the middle and upper classes in Regency England. From the modest Bennet family, with its five daughters, to Caroline Bingley and Mrs. Hurst, to whom social class is everything, we are given a superb picture of life as Austen saw it.There's also an undercurrent theme in which not everything is what it seems to be. Darcy is not the proud, cold gentleman he seems, nor is Elizabeth as feisty as she appears to others. And, while Elizabeth certainly understands the intents of others, she does not necessarily understand the workings of her own heart."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Not bad overall, but missing punctuation and some half sentences serve to pull the reader out of the story. Unfortunate, as this is one story in which the reader hopes to get perfectly lost."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The first time I read this book was at the age of 13. My mother had an old, worn, 1950s copy of the book on our bookshelf, and one day I just decided to give it a try. I think the first 50 pages were a bit of a mystery to me. I remember struggling with the language at the beginning, and having to look up several words in the dictionary. After 100 pages, I had finally \\"learnt the language,\\" and managed to at last translate it into my native tongue. I enjoyed it, and over the years I returned to it again and again. Now, at the age of 35, I practically have numerous passages memorized, and reading the book is no longer a culture shock. Every word of this novel is an old friend, and I wouldn't remove a single one from the text. This is the book I turn to when I'm in the mood to read, but not in the mood to read something new.Every time I read it, I am struck by its relevance. I don't mean the morals or the need to marry well in order to win approval from society (although I think we still see a little of that to this day). I refer to the characters. Their personalities and basic code of principals are timeless. I can identify with every single character in this novel. When Lizzy and Mr. Darcy fell in love, their courtship could have taken place anywhere and at any point in time. That is why her novels are so well adapted into modern films.You cannot possibly do wrong by reading this novel."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Let me tell you about my first impression of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. At the age of thirteen, it was one of the most amazing love stories I had ever read. Five years later, it became one of the most wittily crafted stories I had ever read. By the time I was twenty-one, it was the finest work of literature I had ever experienced.Elizabeth Bennet is a byproduct of genteel poverty. The second daughter of five, she possesses the most sense, tact, poise, and sound judgement of the family in general. On the other hand, she is also irreverent, daring, and judgemental. She stretches the envelope of what might be construed as &quot;polite&quot; society. She also acknowledges the limitations of her gender even as she subtly tries to defy them.As a part of the landed gentry, Mr. Darcy is the embodiment of all that is dignified and honored. He is a gentleman who was born to privilege and money. His kind make up the &quot;polite society&quot; Elizabeth dares to flout. His pride, his disdain, and his arrogance make him unappealing to the people of Longbourn, as well as the community surrounding it. It is his interference with the relationship between his friend and her beloved sister, however, which is a personal affront to Elizabeth.It is fortuitous that Austen retitled her book because First Impressions does not begin to touch upon the complexities that Pride and Prejudice, as a title, connotes. In Darcy and Elizabeth, Austen has drawn two very complex characters who, on the one hand, seem simply drawn and characterized, but on the other, are so much more than they seem. It would be easy to say that Darcy is arrogant and Elizabeth is willful. The truth is, looking beyond my own first impression, as a reader, Austen has deceptively crafted two characters whose thoughts and actions make it clear that they aptly straddle both of the title characteristics."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Wonderful writing, great characterisation, and themes that aren't so outdated as you might expect. The book is difficult to plod through, but once you get used to the intricate writing and you look past the rather uninteresting plot, you'll be surprised when you really start enjoying yourself.Pride and Prejudice is a classic in its own right!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice turned out to be a well involved tale of drama and romance. At first the book runs slowly, sometimes getting off the point and losing interest, but in a whole, when you finish reading the last page, you know you've read something great. The book truly tells a tale of pride and prejudice. Along with the many other stories involving other characters, the main interset is about two people- Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth along with her sister Jane and others are all finding their way into marriage, when two men Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley come along. Mr. Darcy at first appearence is a crude proud man who does not involve himself in social confrantation, while Mr. Bingley comes to be a charming well wittted man. The story continues on with marriage proposals, refusals, and devious scandals. In Pride and Prejudice, many characters develop. Jane Austin creates their stories very well but sometimes as I was reading, I felt that there were too many people and I found it hard to keep up and get involved with it. But in a way, that was also the beauty of the story.So if you are intersted in this book, you have to be willing to be patient. But it will be worth it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"My favorite chapter in the novel Pride and Prejudice is chapter 16 of volume III (or chapter 58) because Elizabeth finally accepts Darcy?s marriage proposal. It amazed me how she was still able to say yes after she was insulted in every way possible especially after disliking him so much in the beginning of the novel.This book is appropriate for anyone who is able to appreciate well-written literature. Anyone would enjoy reading this book, from teenagers to adults.One literary device I appreciated was epigram, which is a brief, clever, and usually memorable statement. An example of this would be ?It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in wants of a wife? which is found on the first page of the novel. The entire novel was based on this quote. Mrs. Bennet wanted to get all five of her daughters married before her husband died.I liked the novel. I found Elizabeth?s romance with Darcy intriguing. It was interesting how in the beginning she rejected his proposal and disliked him, and at the end she marries him."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"You will find Jane Austen in high school classrooms, as inspiration for contemporary movies and fiction (Clueless, Bridget Jones' Diary), and at a book club or two. Otherwise, she is not part of us: Her laser-eyes, scathing commentary about society, and merciless fun at the expense of over-the-top piety are missing. In our current Press-Release era, where ads blanket our cities, and celebrities alter their image every other week, Jane would have a field day-- her observations would have been invaluable, her sharp humor liberating.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\"-- the story of independent-minded Elizabeth Bennet's journey to a happy marriage and her rousing rebellion against the stultifying and stale social system of 19th-Century England-- is an adrenaline-rush of a book.As Elizabeth battles the defenders of society (her marriage-obsessed mother, a condescending suitor, and several members of the \\"upper-class\\" trying to stem her promising relationship with the affluent and handsome Mr. Darcy) we sample a world where family, money, and class dictate your friends and suitors.When Elizabeth and Darcy move to his stunning home, they leave the hostility of an uncaring society behind. Through rebellion and stubbornness, they have found Eden."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice centers around the Bennett family, mainly Elizabeth Bennett, the second eldest of five sisters. Throughout the novel, family relations, economical issues, humiliation of making a mistake, and falling in love are thoroughly described amongst all of the characters. Three of the five sisters marry in the book while encountering pride and prejudice of position or status. The eldest daughter of the Bennetts, Jane, falls in love and marries a man named Charles Bingley. She is the second of the three daughters that marry during the story because of a delay caused by Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy who had initially made Bingley think Jane does not love him because of her poor economical status and family relations. However, it is also Darcy who later convinces Bingley to finally marry Jane out of his own love for Janeas younger sister Elizabeth. After both Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth overcome their pride and prejudice against each other, they are also married. Elizabeth is the third daughter to marry. The first daughter to marry is Lydia, who foolishly elopes with the untrustworthy George Wickham whose primary intention was not to marry her, but who eventually agrees to the marriage on terms agreed to by Darcy and Bingley. The novel describes the pride and prejudice that all of the characters manage to overcome in order to live contentedly.Although the language used in Pride and Prejudice was difficult for a fourteen year-old, as I kept reading it became clearer and easier to understand the 19th century speech. The womenaes rights that Austen presented were beyond her time and I developed great respect for her. The message about overcoming pride and prejudice and marrying not for money but for love was very powerful and I felt that it was appropriate to be read for a humanities class because it was closely related to the topics we have been going over in class. Overall, I thought that Pride and Prejudice was a very well written and entertaining novel."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Originally entitled First Impression, Jane Austen's novel, Pride and Prejudice is a sophisticated love story, elegantly portrayed during the 18th century. Satirizing the Victorian woman's quest for an ideal husband, Austen's witty humor provides much amusement for the reader. The complex plot and the dramatic lives of the Bennet family enable the reader to become engrossed within Austen's masterpiece.The points of view of the novel are shown through Austen's usage of the limited omniscient as well as first person accounts, which are shown through personal letters of the characters. Her unique literary style enables the reader to better understand the mood and dramatic emotions of the characters. The letters intertwined throughout the book, advance the plot and greatly invoke the interest of the reader.Although all the characters contribute to the entertaining quality of the novel, the most auspicious were indeed Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. With Elizabeth's out-spoken manners and Darcy's arrogant yet shy persona, both characters were quick to judge the other based upon their first impressions. As the novel progressed, Elizabeth's humor and charm, not only won over the reader but Darcy as well. We also enjoyed Darcy's evolution from a shy and rather self righteous aristocrat, into a kind, endearing, as well as understanding man. His interactions with Lizzy provided conflict and laughter. Mrs. Bennet's \\"nerves\\" also served as our source of amusement.This intellectual novel entails deception, love, comedy, and above all, a glimpse into 18th century society. We enjoyed the conclusion, in which Austen meets our satisfaction by tying all the loose ends together. Despite it's title, the characters of the novel overcome prejudice, but never lost their pride."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have wanted to read the classics of English literature since I did not do so during college. Because I am not in college, I do not have any need to have an edition with critical essays and copious notes about different versions of the book. A simple book with the story in front of me was all that was necessary. Wordsworth Classics filled the need quite satisfactorily.This edition has the complete text and not much else. The introduction has some historical information about the author and about the publishing of the book. There are only two pages of this. The margins are small, so taking notes within the text will prove difficult. It is easy to carry around and seems to put up with a moderate amount of abuse.The particular story starts with the famous/infamous line \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\" Given this, and given Jane Austen, you know that you are in for a tour of marriage in old England. Austen's sketches of her characters are so well done that you can't help but hear the dialogue in your head in the voice's of people you are familiar with. Jane Austen understands how people work and is a very astute observer of human nature.In these pages you will follow the trials and tribulations of Jane and Elizabeth Bennett, Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy, and the rest of their families and acquaintances.

Austen primarily focuses on the ridiculous pressure to marry. She does an exquisite job satirizing or \\"poking fun\\" at the extreme views of those who lived during that time. She gives the reader a good look at how truly important first impressions are and how love can conquer all. Austen develops her main characters Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, with very conflicting character traits. These conflicting traits allow the build up of tension between these two characters. This gives the novel a pleasant amount of intensity that leads to an ousting ending. Austen sucks you into a thoroughly enchanting world, making the novel impossible to put down. I recommend this novel to those who enjoy intellectual wit and have a soft heart for romance.

The Bennet family women, destined for poverty, vie for the attention of men belonging to a higher social status. Due to the mother's greedy nature, the affections of these men have been turned away. However Jane, the oldest daughter, finds the affection of one man, Mr. Bingley, only to lose him when he is convinced by his good friend Mr. Darcy that she does not love him. In an attempt to reclaim Mr. Bingley's affection, Jane moves to London to be nearer to him. In the midst of this drama, Lizzie finds herself smitten by an Officer whose negative opinion of Mr. Darcy influences her greatly. Because of this, the resentment that Elizabeth harbored towards Mr. Darcy from moment she met him is magnified. Lydia, one of Elizabeth's younger sisters, fails to act in a socially acceptable manner involving the Officer with whom Elizabeth was smitten. This behavior leaves the family vulnerable to public disgrace. Through this course of events, Elizabeth discovers the Officer's malicious nature, and her opinion of Mr. Darcy begins to change. Will the Bennett family women attain their much longed for higher social status or will they experience the repercussions of Lydia's careless decisions? Is the prideful demeanor that Mr. Darcy displays an indication of his true character? Has Elizabeth's prejudice obstructed her chance for true romance?"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite novels.

I would also call Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen quite possibly the most well-written book in the past 300 years.As soon as you pick up this book, your mind is forming hypothoses about the rest of the book. The weird thing is that ABSOLUTLY NONE of them happen. Yet, at the end, you are not only as happy with the conclusion as you would have been with your own ideas, but happier. That kind of literary psycological euphoria cannot be and has not been acheived by any other author that I have ever read.This book leaves you with a feeling of absolute feclicity. I cried with joy the first time I read it, and had to reread the ending twice. In other words, it has a very happy ending! That has certainly been attempted by every tale from Cinderella to the Harry Potter books, yet Austen's ending is unique as her ending is perfectly real. It not only seems realistic, but, in hindsight, any other resolution to her book seems ludicrous.Her characters are vivid. They are complex yet you see them as if they could be you own mother, sister, father, brother, friend, foe, or aquaintance. You not only warm to her heroes and heroines, but Austen leads you to feel a fiery hatred of her vilains and vilainesses.Her writing is intricate. You are left feeling not only perfectly satisfied with this book, but want more. She is not only an excalent writer but a perfect one. Thius book is her masterpiece. It has comedy, tradjedy, richness, irony, love, and loss. It many complex facets gleam like diamonds. I am in awe of this book. I beseach you: READ PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"In college, Iw as supposed to read this book. But I never did because I just assumed it would be boring. Three years later, I tried it again... and I kicked myself for not having tried it sooner.I think my vision of reading Jane Austen always has me curled up in a chair while it's snowing outside, but in truth, the real memory of reading this book was sitting in the waiting room of a car mechanic while my car was being worked on. That day stands out because as usual, the mechanics only had the usual things to read: &quot;Guns and Ammo&quot; and &quot;Field and Stream&quot;. Add the requisite gumball machine in the corner with stale gumballs and you have the idea. I brought the book with me to read, but didn't really think I would get all that much reading of it done. True, I was reading it for fun, but it was Jane Austen after all, and I wasn't sure if I could really concentrate on her. Well, 200 pages later, bringing that novel with me was the best decision I ever made. 4 years later, I still rememebr how into this book I got. (I even had to take a walk around the block before I read the last chapter just to prolong finishing the story.) Once the story did end, I felt like I was saying goodbye to my friends.This book is riveting, it's fun, it's hysterical (wait for the rewarding confrontation between Lady Catherine deBourgh and Elizabeth...it's not only a battle of tongues, but a great clash of the &quot;refined&quot; yet uneducated upper classes, and the middle classes of Regentry England. This is by far my favorite Austen novel of the bunch (with Emma coming in a close second). So, this winter, wait for a snowy day (heck, choose any day, you can't have a bad Austen day) and get ready to be taken away. And no.. this book is not solely the domain of high school etachers and academians.. you'll be surprised how much you may enjoy it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"&quot;~Though only sixteen, I consider myself to be moderately well-read. I love reading, and, when I am between books, my life feels desolate and empty. One day, while in the most barren pit of ennui, I picked up Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice at my mother's recommendation. I do not ordinarily like my mother's taste in reading; her favorite books tend to be very dull, but so deep was my boredom that I succumbed to her suggestion.&quot;~ table, class and late into the night, I read my beloved Pride and Prejudice. I love everything about it. I love the characters; especially Elizabeth Bennet! I love the Victorian vernacular which works so well for this particular novel.

I can offer no suggestions to the male reader, however, because generally this book, in every essence, is a female novel. I am not saying that men would definetly not enjoy it; I'm simply saying that I have yet to meet any male who has not addressed this book in a very vehement manner. and I know it won't be too long before I pick it up again. Jane Austen surely knew what she was doing when she wrote this one! Her Pride and Prejudice will always have an honored spot on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and prejudice is a beautifully written love story, full of humor and life-like imagery. The characters Elizabeth and Mr Darcy are both carved out nicely, with Austen's acute sense about how both men and women think and perceive beauty, love, society. The novel is a compelling read, and for diehard romantics like me, it is irresistable to the end. While Sense and Sensibility moves more slowly, and likewise also dwells on stories of two sisters, there the love stories are presented with maze of other matter. Here the hero must overcome his pride, the heroine must fight a battle with her prejudices, and both then discover not only love in each other but their real selves. Additional stories and people appear perfectly developed in their own roles of lovers, parents, friends, envious relations, grumpy grandmothers, lively teenagers, etc. The drama of a great movie or a soap opera is all here, with Austen's simple and elegant story telling.Many sequences and sentences are purely delightful or extermely hilarious, making the novel one of those reads where you are caught laughing aloud or smiling with twinkle your eyes alone, as you are relishing the new turn of events. While the story is set in Victorian era, the characters, emotions and humor is timeless. The novel is an easy read, fit for travel reading as well as for fun, and trust me, the romantic in you will be raving about it for a long time! In fact, two movies compelled me to reread the novel recently: Gurinder Chadda's Bride and Prejudice that reinvents the classic in a Bollywood flavor and Tom Hanks- Meg Ryan Starrer You've got mail. In You've Got Mail there are repeated references to the novel, and to the extent the opposites attract, and essential elements of novel are concerned, the movie is like a reincarnated version of the novel.Citation from You've Got MailConfession: I have read Pride and Prejudice about 200 times. I get lost in the language-words like thither, mischance, felicity. I'm always in agony over whether Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are really going to get together. Read it - I know you'll love it.Meg Ryan's character, to her anonymous email friend, Tom Hanks in You've Got Mail.(the reference to the movie is for those who have seen and like the movie, else the novel is intrinsically enjoyable, and even for those who have seen this movie or the movie based on the novel, worth spending a fun-filled reading time with.)"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, follows society's elite through the trials and tribulations of love, pride, money, and marriage negotiations. This novel takes place in 19th century England and revolves around the slow development of love found between two characters. The first of these characters is Elizabeth Bennet, a clever, beautiful, and spirited young woman. Pride and Prejudice begins, when Mrs. Bennet asks Mr. Bennet to call on their new neighbor, Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bingley has an income of 5 thousand pounds a year and is not married, so Mrs. Bennet hopes to marry one of her 5 daughters to him. Jane, the eldest daughter, and Mr. Bingley begin to like each other during a ball. Elizabeth, the second oldest, meets Mr. Darcy at the same ball. Darcy initially does not care for Elizabeth, and refuses to even dance with her.However, as Elizabeth grows to dislike Darcy, Darcy starts to become very fond of her. She and Darcy meet again when she stays with Mr. Bingley, because her sister, Jane, has taken ill at their house. Ms. Bingley, the sister of Mr. Bingley, herself hopes to wed Darcy, and seeks to make Elizabeth less appealing to Darcy. After Jane's recovery she and Elizabeth return home. There they welcomed to their home by their cousin Mr. Collins, who, because of the inheritance customs of the times (the Bennet girls had no brothers), was the heir to the Bennet family home. Together, Elizabeth and her family travel to town, where they met Mr. Wickham. Mr. Wickham notices Elizabeth, who he found charming, and describes to her a terrible deed he alleges Darcy had committed against him. Wickham claimed that Darcy owed him money and had denied him of a promised avocation. This new information causes Elizabeth to despise Darcy even more.Soon Mr. Collins, the rather odd clergyman, proposes to Elizabeth. To her mother's dismay, she refuses him. Instead, her friend Charlotte Lucas marries Mr. Collins, and Elizabeth goes to visit them and their neighbor the great Lady Catherine De Bourgh. During her stay Elizabeth sees Darcy again, and he proposes. Elizabeth refuses, reciting all the terrible things he had done, including the mistreatment of Wickham. In response, Darcy writes Elizabeth explaining how Wickham had tried to elope with his sister because of her money. Elizabeth is forced to rethink, her opinions relating to Darcy and Wickham.That summer Elizabeth traveled to Pemberly on holiday with her aunt and uncle, and while there her aunt and uncle wanted to see the beautiful Darcy estate. While visiting, Darcy showed up. Darcy and his sister heartily welcomed Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle, and invited them to dinner. Elizabeth began to grow fonder of Darcy. Dreadful news arrived during Elizabeth's stay at Pemberly. Her frivolous younger sister Lydia had run off with Wickham. Upon learning of the circumstances, Darcy sought out and found Wickham and Lydia, forcing them to marry. Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle returned to the Bennet home.Bingley and Darcy together visited the Bennet household to call upon Jane and Elizbeth. Jane became engaged to Bingley, and when Darcy proposed to Elizabeth, her heart had changed, so she said yes. Elizabeth had fallen in love Darcy. They had both seen past their pride and past the prejudices that they had learned from society. Elizabeth and Darcy were happy in marriage, and remained forever grateful to Elisabeth's aunt and uncle for uniting them.I would recommend the book Pride and Prejudice. It forces each of us to think about our roles in life. The novel also makes us think about our own pride and our own prejudices against others, and the need for us to learn more about people before we judge them. This book is also one of the greatest Romances of all time, bringing to life the love that a man and a woman held for each other from another era. It provides meaningful messages that all of us should learn. The characters are also interesting. This book is good for people who understand the use of language in the 19th century. Pride and Prejudice is a classic novel that I love, and believe everyone would enjoy."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I bought the set of audiotapes with no particular expectations, and I am pleasantly surprised. Ms Sharon Williams's reading is amazingly smooth, natural, and she depicts the personalities of each character with the intonations of her voice so perfectly that it always sound like there's more than one person reading, even though she doesn't alter her voice. I am particularly amazed by her rendition of Mrs Bennet. I can almost see the woman when I hear the talk!As an American, I am not fond of British accents, and I am happy to hear that Ms Williams read with some British influence, but it is overall pleasant and easy for me to understand. (In contrast, I dislike the accents on the Harry Potter movies.)I highly recommend this product.(If you haven't read Pride and Prejudice yet and is wondering if you should, the answer is yes! The classics are usually a drag to read, but not Pride and Prejudice. It moves fast, it is witty, insightful, and the language is easy to understand. I think it is the best book among the classics.)"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is viewed as one of the finest novels ever written, and rightfully so. Despite being only 22 years old when the original manuscript was finished, Austen displays an astonishing mastery of the English language that has rarely been equalled. The prose is so expertly constructed that the book maintains a brisk pace throughout and never becomes dull. Being so heavily dialogue-based, it's critical that the conversations in this book keep the reader interested. Fortunately, the snappy dialogue is what makes this book really shine. The characterization is nothing short of brilliant, from the silly Mrs. Bennett to the intolerable Mr. Collins. Despite the fact that nothing truly exciting ever happens, you'll find yourself desperate to turn the next page. I could not possibly recommend this book more."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This classic Jane Austen novel is one of my all-time favorites and I loved the novel on my Kindle as well.

I previously owned a tape version - horrible because you had to FF to whatever parts you wanted. In fact my player ended up eating 2 of the tapes. This CD version is much better and I would highly recommend it, except... Normal audio CDs have tracks that correspond with the chapters. Not this one. The tracks were in random places (in the middle of a paragraph, even in the middle of sentences!) so trying to find the right chapter to start on required some detective work. If you're just planning to listen from start to finish, however, this is an excellent version- the reader is splendid."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Hours of tremendous enjoyment from reading the book. The incredible depth of the characters and the richness of the detail creates a wonderful read. However, should you find yourself lost in the middle of the forest with only matches and this book in your hand in dire need of light and warmth, don't hesitate to rip out several pages from the middle of the book, gather a few branches and start a fire... you thus will have the light to read by, and know the start and the end of the story.

I do not think that it is appropriate for someone today to decide what parts of a book written in 1813 are important and what are not. I did not actually keep and listen to this selection.

I'll not spend words telling you the story, describing the characters or the time, offering opinions on the social state of Britain at the time of the novel. There are other reviews that attempt this. Jane Austen is much better at these tasks than I. The reviewer is an anglophobe. If it is given five stars here it should tell you a great deal about the value of this novel. For one who protects what is left of vision to read this book three times should say even more. It is strongly suggested reader that you uit wasting time on reviews and read the book. You may believe from the title of this review that the reviewer is prejudiced. What took you so long to figure that out? Age and other afflictions of the eyes have robbed my ability to read to some degree but this edition is very kind to us ancients. Oxford has a good reputation and this publication will not detract from it. The editorial material is even somewhat amusing.There is nothing amusing about the War of 1812, the use of the wordswhere we Americans would more likely use is symbolic of the British conception of our republic. But we digress. Austen has been a favorite since I first encountered her in college. It was much later I realized one reason for the fine prose in Hiram Grant's Memoirs. He spent many hours at West Point reading Jane Austen novels. There he was given his more familiar name Ulyses Grant, hero of the Civil War and Republican president of the U. S.

Each time I wonder if Mr. Darcy will be able to capture Elizabeth's heart, and I am always tickled when he does. I still get as choked up, and laugh just as much as I did the first time.

I happen to love Jane Austen and Pride and Prejudice is a fantastic novel. However, this abridged version lacked some of the best aspects of the original story. They cut it down to 3 hours (can't be helped, I guess) and, therefore, the story really only deals with Elizabeth, Jane being a mere afterthought. The other sisters are barely mentioned. I am looking forward to when someone realizes that there are customers out there with CD players in their cars and they would like to hear the UNABRIDGED version of popular and classic books. I also felt that Jenny Agutter did not distinguish that well between characters, Mr. Bennett sounded just like Lady Catherine.

Elizabeth is a wonderful heroine that you find yourself relating to and wishing to be! What a life those young women must have led! And Darcy, well I fell in love with him immediately. You can't get any better than Darcy when looking for a man who would do anything to protect and help you.

Not to mention that she is extremely likable. Mr. Darcy, though not a very intricate character compared to Elizabeth, is undeniably well thought out, and perfectly drawn. But, for anyone who has read this(I think I can speak for just about everyone)there are three particular characters that are memorable, and even lovable, just for their perfectly delightful absurdity; Namely Mrs. Bennet whose \\"sole object in life was to get her daughters married; and it's solace was visiting and news.\\" Then there is Mr. bennet's pompous cousin Mr. Collins, whose proposal to Elizabeth is one of the best scenes in the book. Finally, there is Lady Catherine, Mr. Darcy's haughty Aunt, whose class consciousness, and condescending airs are wonderful!The Plot:A simple love story, and a Cinderella story at that. Though there is no really important issues covered, no intellectual depth to fathom, it remains one of my favorite plots, becuase it flows so easily, there is no awkwardness, is tied together so well in the end; there is nothing I would ever dream of changing.The Diolouge:This is it's absolutely flawless point; the diolouge is perfect; perfect and consistent with each character, it moves the story along, and charms the reader non-stop.Language:Who can resist a novel that makes frequent use of the words:folly, felicity, ductility, oddity, and every other charming \\"ity\\" Austen uses.I really can say nothing else. I have read this book so many times I have so many different perspectives, so many opinions on it, have so much to say that I could not possibly say it all, so I decided to take the literary view, and build on that.

It is a story about an empty-headed mother and her search for proper husbands for her five daughters. The book is a prime example of the manners and morals of the gentry in a small English village in the early nineteenth century. Ms. Austen does such a good job of displaying these strictures and morals in her novels, that to us in the present day it appears to be an entirely repressive era (which it actually was). The plot and the characterizations in this book are wonderful as in all Ms. Austen's works, and it tells a dazzling story.

Touching, witty, and with happy weddings in the end...in short, a true Austen novel. I found this book immensely enjoyable to read, and it is among my top ten favorite books of all time (although, I must admit, my 'top ten favorite books of all time' list is often prone to change, as I am not very old and shall devour other books yet)...Nontheless, I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever liked any other Austen or Austen-like book, as this is perhaps my favorite written by this particular author."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I've read three incredible books lately and NONE of them were remotely connected by theme, style, or author. &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; was the first, &quot;The Bark of the Dogwood&quot; was the second, and &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; was the third. While all were excellent, P&amp;P was so great for me, simply because I didnt' expect it to be great. If you are like I was before reading this wonderful book, you probably can't imagine what could be so wonderful about Pride and Prejudice. How can it be interesting, you're thinking, when it's written in such a stuffy time period? I'll stick with my science fiction/romance novels/westerns, thank you very much. And it's true, you can't find any lusty young rogues, aliens, or gun fights, but that doesn't keep it from being an extremely wonderful book to read. The characters are full of life, the plot well constructed, and the entire story full of charm and humour. Don't be put off by the language either. It takes some getting used to, but once you're going it's not only completely natural, but makes today's English seem completely dull and simple. I cannot stress enough how wonderful this book is.

This edition which is published by \\"Penguin Classics\\" proves to be a wonderful read because of the information included in the back.Ms. Jane Austen does an impeccable job of describing the characters in the story. Each one has their own distinct personality which is part of what makes this book such a classic. Mrs. Bennet is especially cute, the way that she is always talking about the fact that she'd like her daughters to marry, and seems to think that it would prove to be the pinnacle of her life if one of them married into wealth. When Mr. Collins comes into the picture and decides to marry Charlotte, he can't stop praising the house in which will one day be his.This is where the book really picks up. At the conclusion of volume one, an individual is left only to imagine what could possibly be happening with Mr. Bingley and his beloved Jane.In this charming love story, two people learn to \\"get over themselves\\" and develop feelings for one another."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I welcome this new edition from Penguin Classics with expanded notes.How does one demarcate pride and prejudice, or bias and stubbornness? In Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen deftly exposes the folly of and further ridicules judging by first impressions.When Elizabeth Bennet first met the fine, tall, handsome eligible bachelor Fitzwilliam Darcy, she immediately deemed him arrogant, conceited and utterly obnoxious. Her first impression of Darcy, who was initially looked upon with prodigious admiration, was quickly assured as his conceited manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity.Darcy's conceit and selfish disdain of the feelings of others formed the foundation of Elizabeth's disapprobation on which succeeding events had built so inevitably a hatred. When she later found out Darcy had deliberately altered Bingley's opinion of her beloved sister Jane and determined to separate them, she was determined to exasperate herself as much as possible against Darcy.In the comedy of manners that follows, Austen, in a superb manner and prose so elegant and lyrical, verbalizes the stubbornness, bias, and prejudices of Elizabeth toward a man whom resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of his admiration for her escaped him. Despite the fact that he struggled to maintain his composure, in his breast there existed a powerful feeling toward her, which soon procured her pardon and directed his anger elsewhere upon Elizabeth's weighty accusations of him.Pride and Prejudice presents us a romance comedy with a modern feel and touch. The opening of the novel Fitzwilliam Darcy is blackened as the most obnoxious snob for whom \\"there is not another woman in the room who it would not be a punishment\\" to him to stand up with. To Elizabeth, almost all of Darcy's actions \\"maybe traced to pride\\" and \\"pride had often connected him to virtue.\\" No sooner had Darcy's superiority of mind (pride) been fully exposed than Elizabeth's prejudice was revealed.Unlike her sister Jane, Elizabeth was more hasty in censuring anyone (especially Fitzwilliam Darcy) and never supposed the possibility of any extenuating circumstances in the case, let alone urging the possibility of mistake and misunderstanding. In confronting Darcy of his inexcusable act of separating Bingley and Jane, Elizabeth judged from assumptions, suspicions, and the biased first impression. In a sense she sought to discredit Darcy and the relation of events that might be capable of a turn which must render Darcy blameless throughout the whole affair.When Elizabeth finally considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided Darcy, her anger and indignation was turned against herself and Darcy's dejection (more or less disappointed feelings toward her) became object of her compassion. Elizabeth's folly and rashness also become object of our compassion. How awful her petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting Fitzwilliam Darcy.Pride and Prejudice evokes the fact that human nature is prone to pride and very few of us do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or another. Pride usually relates more to our opinions of ourselves, of which Elizabeth has epitomized. Pride is the real superiority of mind, when along with stubbornness, bias, and determination, would casue irremediable regret. The novel also evokes the friendship, the values of marriage, and snobberies of English middle-class life in the early 19th century. 4.5 stars."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Fast and quick delivery.

The print is a great reading size and I love that it gives you references to words, places and traditions of the time to better understand the story."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It as a truth universally acknowledged that Jane Austen, in possession of a good novel must be in want of a reader.Undeniably one of the greatest authors in classic literature, Austen begins her classic masterpiece, Pride and Prejudice, with her renown truth. Ironic, amusing and romantic, Pride and Prejudice still offers many delights for the modern reader. Whether it's flighty Lydia, brooding Darcy or the imperial Lady Catherine, you can fall in love again and again with her diverse cast of characters.Pride and Prejudice is essentially seen through the eyes of Elizabeth Bennett, second in a line of five daughters, gifted with a dry wit and clever conversation. The novel primarily follows her and her sisters movement though the social sphere of the 19th century, though social climbing, manners, and the strict regulation of \\"proper behavior\\". When Jane Bennett falls for Mr. Bingley, the fur starts to fly and Lizzy and Jane are forced to fight for each other and for the men they love.While Austen's text captivates and seduces, this edition constantly diverts the reader with it's countless footnotes. While these could be beneficial to a reader unfamiliar with British Society, the definition of \\"Militia\\" and its explanation of the significance of Gretna Green bordered on insulting. Though the quotes and opinions on the text in the back of the book were interesting and refreshing, the sheer magnitude of footnotes (generally explaining something well-known or easily inferred) distract greatly from Austen's stunning success.While Pride and Prejudice in itself is a work deserving far more than five stars, this Barnes & Noble edition cannot qualify such a rating."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I was looking for a hard back book and was happy to have found one, when it came I was very disappointed that it was a bed book.

Amazon should make it clearer that you are buying a bed book and not a normal book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"In my opinion, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Jane Austen's best work. I think it is one of the best books ever written, and one of the very few perfectly told stories I have ever had the pleasure of reading.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" focuses on the Bennett family --- Jane, a quiet and demure woman whose angelic countenance matches her sweet and giving personality; Elizabeth, a level-headed lady with slightly more temper than her older sister, and a level of good judgment that sets her apart from other women of her set; Mary, a bookish girl with little talent to speak of; Kitty, a weak-minded creature who allows her flighty youngest sister to rule her life; Lydia, a hopeless flirt with no thought for anything other than fun and men; Mr. Bennett, who likes to retreat into his library and bury his nose in books; and Mrs. Bennett, a foolish woman whose primary goal in life is to get all her daughters married off to rich and handsome men. A simple family living in the country whose lives are turned upside down by the arrival of a wealthy young man into their neighborhood.Mr. Bingley, their new neighbor, instantly takes a liking to Jane, the oldest sister, while his best friend, the proud Mr. Darcy, spends his time trying NOT to like Elizabeth. As Mr. Bingley gently pursues Jane, he finds he gets little or no help from his friend Mr. Darcy or his own sisters, Louisa and Caroline --- who schemes for Mr. Darcy's hand herself.Set against a vivid backdrop in various locations around the country, Austen covers all kinds of English society. Her colorful, lively characters take this story all over the place, having their own adventures and learning about themselves and about life. Jane learns that not EVERYONE is sweet and charming. Elizabeth learns that first impressions can be misleading. And Lydia experiences a dangerous kind of life that should never have been embarked upon, and which lands her in a very sticky situation.Jane Austen has a keen sense of the ridiculous and loves to poke fun at her characters. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" has one of the most delightful array of interesting characters ever to grace the pages of a novel --- the oh-so-charming Mr. Wickham, whose past is a mystery; the Gardiners, Elizabeth's aunt and uncle, who see much more than they let on, and understand its significance; Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth's friend; Mr. Collins, the Bennetts' cousin, an oily clergyman who marries Miss Lucas after Elizabeth categorically refuses him; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, aunt of Mr. Darcy, a proud and unpleasant woman who likes to rule over and frighten others.Austen tells her story with the best mix of drama, wit, charm, humor, intrigue, and romance I have ever seen. The story is writted seamlessly, unfolds brilliantly and ends perfectly. The entire novel is beautifully written, with an elegant, charming style as only Austen can write. It's the perfect addition to any library!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin is a very interesting novel. It not only tells but also, shows what young women went though in the 18th century. Elizabeth Bennett faces many expirences that women go through today. From getting maried to dealing with friends, family, and men from a day to day basis. Elizabeth has seven sisters who are also going through the same expirences. She is closest to her oldest sister Jane. They seem to understand each other the best. The mother is the most interesting charatcter out of the whole novel because she wants the best for her daughters and tries to live their lives for all seven of them. Elizabeth does not let her mother do this and in the end her mother disowns her. This novel teaches what is worth in life and what is not.You should only do what is right for your self and on one else.This novel gives you hope that in any life you can become your own self and not be criticized for your own actions or how you think. This is a great novel and if you read it I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I love Pride & Prejudice.

This edition is so poorly edited as to be confusing at some points, when, for instance, suddenly we are reading about a previously unintroduced Miss King, who is mentioned and then forgotten. There are no descriptions of clothing, very little of scenery, none really of homes/estates. The book consists of conversations, which are terrific due to the author's skill, and the bridges that get us to those. How can I get an unedited, unabridged copy of the book? That should be made clear when we order these \\"free\\" books: they are vastly edited.

Nobody writes like Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is considered a \\"classic\\" for many reasons. For one thing, it deals with themes that are still very relevant in our society today. The ideas of pride and family relationships are both important factors in every day life today, and help bring the book to life. Also, the characters in the novel have many character traits that are exhibited almost 175 years after the book was originally published. Aloof, rich people, flirtations, young women, and social, eligible bachelors are common types of people even today. By incorporating characters such as Mr. Darcy, Lydia, and Mr. Bingley into her story, Jane Austen has kept the book popular for hundreds of years. The plot is very interesting and keeps the reader engaged from start to finish. A family living in the British countryside that is almost continuously worried about marriage may not sound like an intriguing plot to many people, but in fact the plot is fascinating.Somebody who read the book might be a little bit disappointed by the fact that it was written 175 years ago. This affects many aspect of the novel and radically changes how the book is written. Although most of the vocabulary and style is easy to understand, every now and then there is a small section that is hard to understand. In terms of themes, the obsession of young people with marriage is not as apparent in today's society as much as it used to be. Finally, various decisions in grammar and punctuation may make the book more difficult for some people to read. At some points in the novel, such as letters or other dialogues, the whole page may be filled without any paragraph breaks. This makes for a more intimidating reading experience and may serve as a deterrent to people who are considering reading the book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I loved this book, everyone had kept telling me to read it and I kept putting it off, then I saw the film and I read the book and I loved it. The language was a bit difficult to begin with, but I soon got used to it and it was well worth the effort. The book's very funny and the story's excellent, all in all a must read.If you want more, there's a book out called Darcy's Diary by Amanda Grange and it tells the story from Darcy's side, so you see the things you don't see in Pride and Prejudice, like Darcy going to London to track Wickham down, and it also goes on after the wedding, so all in all another good read. But make sure you read Pride and Prejudice whatever you do!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is and will always remain to be an all time favorite romantic comedy in the history of American literature. The story never fails to emphasize on the ethical manners played out in the 19th Century English society, an existence in which wealth, social status, and love prevailed lucidly in pithy marriages. It also differentiates with our human behavior in the modern world, how much we have changed in a sense.The emotions and intentions of the characters in this book are beautifully written and brought to life as they are living life to the rules of respect and manners. I highly recommend this book to all ages interested in reading romantic classics."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is a gorgeous little edition of Pride and Prejudice.

It's a beautiful story of class in Jane Austen's time that appeals to us today because it is so well-wrtitten. It's scrupulously clean morally, and I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates the time when love stories were wholesome and pure and touching. All the characters have an appeal that's makes you appreciate the way they fit into the story."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"As much as this book revolves around three of the four daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, all of those characters revolve around Mr. Darcy - whose personality and character matures and unfolds before you.Neither poor nor rich, the Bennets cannot establish great wealth and comforts for their children - and Mrs. Bennet's hard opinionated character further deprives the lovely lasses of possibilities for advancement. But, through the character weakness(es) will come happiness in all levels - where some smile and others are more joyous and laugh. And, thee events happen quickly, all within one year's time.Darcy, who adores his 10-years-younger sister Georgiana, is the proper gentleman who has never raised his voice during his 28 years. Elizabeth, her father's favorite and mother's least, befriends Mr. Darcy and soon aggravates his senses and challenges him to make it to 29 without harsh verbal exchange or raised voice.After some embarrassingly wrong misconceptions of his character, and equally wrong characterizations about a person whose life has plagued Darcy's, Elizabeth watches the young man blossom as he singlehandedly controls her family's pitfalls, confronts those who attempt to deliver her family to near disasters and financially saves the family from other possible misfortunes. In such actions, Darcy has to befriend an enemy, deliver embezzled money, negotiate with creditors of his enemy, and more. And, all for love - and who ever said love would be easy?Pride is swallowed not only by Darcy, but by so many others in this novel. \\"Pride. . . is a very common failing. . . Human nature is quite proud of some quality or other, real or imaginary.\\" We learn, \\"Vanity and pride are different things.\\" \\"Pride rises from a good opinion of ourselves; vanity from what we would have others think of us.\\"We are wrongly told \\". . . almost all his [Darcy's] actions may be traced to pride, and pride has often been his best friend.\\" In the end, we learn Darcy \\". . . has no improper pride.\\"Interestingly, prejudice is not a word defined, used or explained like its title counterpart. But, prejudice is a concept belying each page, each acquaintance, each personal affront, and somehow is easily overcome by youthful passion. Prejudice helplessly loses amidst the betrothing of the three daughters full of young passion.In the end, a Cinderella-like conclusion befits the young hearts' defiance to prejudice through passion. And, in the persuasive methods of young Elizabeth, the originally perceived overbearing pride of Darcy evolves into what she describes to be proper pride.If there is one thing this reader enjoys in this Austen book it is the dialogue. Whether it be the hindered ire of Darcy in civilly responding to Elizabeth's overzealous impertinence, or Elizabeth's steadfast refusal to succumb to Lady Catherine's requests that she never wed her nobleman nephew, the calm and polite retorts are deliciously phrased and eloquently presented. Few plays can match such work."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It seriously does not get any better than this! This book unfolds slowly allowing you to fall in love with the characters and get a feel that world and time. An amazing love story, it leaves you wanting more!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I love Jane Austen all around, but most especially Pride & Prejudice. If I can't find anything else to read, I pick up P & P. Austen is so very clever, and the multifaceted storyline never gets old."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, with the exception of two things.First, the version that I read has a nauseating, fan-boy introduction. I don't particularly care which version of this book you purchase; you should skip the introduction. Just in case. This is not the fault of the author, but of the editor, and I will not ding the author because of its presentation - especially hundreds of years after her death. It would be dirty pool.Second, there is a single passage in the novel which details Elizabeth's growth as a character, where she, introspectively, weighs in on how she feels she has developed. This was out of character for her. She spends much of the novel in angst about various things (such as Mr. Bingley's interactions with her sister Jane, Mr. Darcy's feelings for her, and vacillating between like and dislike for Mr. Darcy himself). The loss of this paragraph would have, in no way, mutilated the perception of Elizabeth as a cogent and erudite character with a mind of her own that was well-working. Nor would its absence have colored an intelligent reader's perception of her growth.Mr. Bennet, however, was hilarious. His steadfast perception of all of the women around him (excepting Elizabeth) as being irredeemably foolish was, I think, a major highlight of the book. Not because it was accurate (although it certainly was in the case of the youngest daughter, Lydia), but because it highlights and gently satirizes the perception of ladies at this time in England. This is made particularly clear in the case of his wife, who is the most grasping fictional woman since Becky Sharp. The juxtaposition of Mr. Bennet's foolish perceptions of women (as themselves being foolish), and the intelligence of two of his daughters (Jane and Elizabeth) faithfully, I believe, points out one of the main purposes of Ms. Austen's writing: To throw into stark contrast the difference between the commonly, culturally accepted perceptions of women (e.g., Mr. Bennet) and the reality of their perceptions and their intelligence (e.g., the two eldest Bennet sisters). This was, in my perception, one of the most important purposes of Ms. Austen's writing, and she performed it well.The interactions between Elizabeth and several of the other characters, especially Lady Catherine De Bourgh, are often times hilarious. Other times, such as her frequent misperceptions of Mr. Darcy and her excercise of her sometimes rapier wit at his expense, are less amusing than they are painful; not because of their inaccuracy or their sharpness, but more because an astute reader will realize the reality of Mr. Darcy's character much earlier than Elizabeth does. And once that point is reached, and even before, it is hard to take her chidings with equanimity. Even if he is a jerk, he is still a human being, and it seems malicious of Elizabeth to treat him this way. Unlike some, I will not excuse her behavior as common for the times, because Elizabeth seems...transcendent of her times in some ways, much like the author herself.This was, by and large, a very entertaining book. It is well worth reading, whether you are curious about the foundations of romantic comedy (which got their first big push in the public here), in the time period of the Napoleonic War (which doesn't figure in the novel, but the social interactions of the time are well detailed), a fan of novels of manners (such as this one, Sense and Sensibility, and Emma, by the same author, Thackeray's Vanity Fair, or Evelyn Waugh's A Handful of Dust), or just in the mood for a fun book. If I could, I would give it 4.5 stars.AHarkius"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"There are few things more comforting in this world that sitting down with \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and a steaming mug of tea. My mother first introduced me to the world of Jane Austen when I was quite young and I will say that this novel is one of the most battered books on my shelf due to how many times I have read it - at least once per annum. For years, audiences have been charmed by the likes of Elizabeth Bennet, the story's sharp-witted heroine, and admired the well-born Mr. Darcy, her verbal sparring partner. There is evidence to suggest that this novel in particular held a special place in Austen's heart, though one could hardly fault her if this is the case.It is impossible for me to resist being drawn in by the Bennet family - the tale of five sisters and an estate entailed away to particularly ridiculous male relation. Though it may be \\"a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,\\" the prospects of marriage for any of the girls are far from ideal. However, more than love and marriage, character takes the center stage of this novel and within its pages is material enough for endless study and enjoyment.I hesitate to say too much more than that this novel is simply a joy to read; it certainly deserves its place in the literary cannon, withstanding the tests of time. I wish that all young girls would read it so that we may have more Janes and Elizabeths and fewer Lydias. I would also freely recommend a viewing of the 6 hour A&E; film after you turn the final page, as it truly does justice to the story - not to mention Colin Firth makes a particularly dashing Darcy."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I was a little disappointed that this issue didn't have any illustrations in it, but the book is wonderful.

The funniest parts were when Mr. Darcy said he would consider Elizabeth a beauty as soon as he would consider her mother a wit. Not that her mother is totally stupid or anything. They were the two best characters in the book. Mr. Bennet is funny too at the begging when he sayd he is not going to go talk to Mr. Bingley and he does. He is one of the most likable or I should say 'agreeable' characters in the book.

She didn't want to read it, so I did. As I dug right into it, I realized that my daughter, being only ten years old, was probably still a little young for it anyway. In fact, it was tough enough for me...Well, at least I can admit it.It amazes me that some books, such as this one written almost 200 years ago, are filled with such style and prose. It seems that in our modern day world, with our stereos, TV's, computers and toys, that many of us unfortunately, don't seem to have the time to broaden our vocabulary, and grammatical abilities as well as some did 200 years ago. I guess,.. in some ways, we have certainly regressed in the natural progression of our intellects. Interesting ... It does make you want to read more books that were written long ago,..and broaden your mind a tad.This was an interesting book, although a little slow at times; probably because of the huge gap in our cultural differences. I can see why it could possibly be considered a bit out of sync with the world of today. The book displayed what now would be considered an imbedded chauvinistic society's way of thinking; young women sitting around all day with the most important thing on their minds being, &quot;Who's going to come courting me today?&quot; But, I don't think that was any of Jane Austen's fault.All in all, it was a very well organized and written story of life and mannerisms of old British Regency."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I was assigned this book for my AP Literature class and the grunts and groans running through the room were audible. A comedy of manners at first seemed like it would be no comedy at all. From what others had told me, Jane Austen had always been lumped with that group of 19th century authors to avoid at all costs.I couldn't have been more wrong. Jane Austen is delightfully humorous and the sarcastic humor that underlies the characters of Elizabeth, Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bennett rounds out the book and the characters themselves. The protagonist, Elizabeth Bennett is an intelligent young woman stuck in the early 19th century. And while she is resigned to fitting the role of young women at the time, she is also able to see the silliness by which other girls govern their lives, and though she does nothing to warrant it, the reader automatically places her above the others. She contains all the elements of a charming protagonist as she is honest, intelligent and witty all at the same time.I loved Mr. Darcy, as well, on his first appearance. Admittedly he was haughty and conceited but from first sight Elizabth begins to chip away at his pride, though she frequently refuses to give him so much as a word. Reading the back cover I thought this was going to be a typical romance story, but it wasn't that either. Despite many other 'romances', the one the reader really wants to see is held off time and time again, and by the last few pages it feels like it may never come about.This is definitely worth reading and is above the ruin that college discussions will often cause."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It was with wonderful anticipation that I sat down with Jane Austen's seminal work, Pride and Prejudice. I had previous knowledge of Jane Austen only as a giant of Western literature, but I resolved to read her work after seeing the delightful Emma Thompson movie Sense and Sensibility. I briefly entertained the notion of reading the novel Sense and Sensibility, but decided instead upon Pride and Prejudice. Mainly because Pride and Prejudice is widely considered to be the better book, but also because I wanted to read one of Austen's works that I had no previous familiarity with the characters and plot. I can happily say that this book has awakened within me a voracious beast of a reader who has every intent of devouring every Austen novel he can get his hands on. It is a testament to Austen's incredible prowess as a writer that she is able to breathe life into a historical period that 21st century readers are far removed from, and by the end of the book you have come to look upon Elizabeth Bennet and Mr.Darcy, not as the heroine and hero of a book 200 years old, but as completely fleshed out characters who could exist in any time, in any novel. The reader comes to understand their joys, their pain, their defeats, and their ultimate triumph, as if these emotions were his own. The hallmark of all great literature is an ability to awaken in the reader a true sense of understanding for what the characters are thinking and feeling, and that is certainly the case in this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I read this book recently as an SSR book for my Honors World Lit class.

How could I have let 19 years of my life pass by without reading this classic and constantly-alluded to novel? Yes, I delayed reading it for far too long, but it did not disappoint my anticipated expectations.In the opening chapters of the novel I was *gasp* - bored with the plot and characters. I was blasphemously thinking, &quot;Why has everyone made such a hype about this book for the past century or so? It's just a bunch of prissy girls wasting their lives away by waiting around on parties, dates, and personal Prince Charmings to whisk them away&quot;.However, as the novel went on, Austen's prowess at prose whisked me away, and I was totally intrigued. The Victorian world was opened up to me, and I tossed all former feminist theories momentarily aside as I became immersed in this setting, yearning for that time and place, where icould have lived like a princess and been loved by all, simply for being born female.I loved Austen's depiction of the relationship between Elizabeth and Jane, and I saw the closeness of my own relationship with my sister reflected in it. I was amused by Mary's disgust in boys and her blatant disregard for most people. Lucy and Kitty's attempts to capture the eyes and hearts of possible suitors were timeless characterizations of so many girls, at that time period and today. Most of all, I loved Mr. Bennett's sense of humor, and his remarks (especially those directed toward Mrs. Bennet) made me laugh out loud throughout the book.Count me in: I am the newest Jane Austen fan, and the one who deserves to receive the Procrastinator of the Century award for waiting so long to read her. For any of you who are putting off reading her like I did, there words of advice: do it, now. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Mrs. Bennet was a simple woman, with but one goal in life: to get her daughters married. She went about this task in a dedicated manner, pouncing on every man that comes by, from nobles to officers. Marriage was the only option for a respectable girl and the husband had to be chosen with care. We usually automatically make the assumption that the love and marriage go hand in hand. But at one time a marriage was thought of as a business transaction. Wealth and social standing were thought of first and foremost, love and happiness could come afterward. Any wealthy bachelor was \\"considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.\\" Elizabeth Bennet thought she knew better, for a happily ever after there had to be love and understanding. We follow her misadventures in search of happiness with a range of comical characters from her assertive, matchmaking mother to her arrogantly, meek cousin. Marriage, it seems, is more than both an economic decision and an emotional rush. We are given examples of each of these extremes through Elizabeth's sisters. Through this and Austen's humor and wit, we are given a delightful satire of the British matrimonial arrangements."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"it is a nice book for all age group."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I read this back when I was in Jr. High and fell head over heels in love with Jane Austen, with her sparkling wit and lively characters.

The charcters of Lizzy and Darcy are among my favorite in all of literature.But after reading all the reviews on this site, I have became convinced that this is a book that does not belong in American High Schools. I had some of my friends read it in High School and they all loved it. I can only assume that we went to a batter HS or something, as every other bad review on this site (in fact, almost all the classic book reviews) it from some poor High School student who has never read a book over 200 pages in their life, doesn't know anything about literature ( I was laughing out loud at the \\"facts\\" presented in some of the 1 star reviews) and is just upset that they have to take time away from being spoon-fed things to pick up a book and think. It distresses me that we have become such a culture that we chide cultured books like this for not having sex and then turn around and call it a \\"soap opera\\" (anyone who has ever seen a soap opera and then read this book knows that there is no comparison between the two--for one, no soap opera writer has Austen's wit, her intellegence, her perception of the human condition).So, to potential buyers--it is a light, comic work that you shouldn't have to think about (don't believe the negative reviews--there is nothing deep in this) and I'm sure you will enjoy it, if you have a respect for art and a bit of intellegence. It is one of the best ove stories ever told. And if you are going to write a negative review, try not to make yourself look like an idiot in the process."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite books of all time! Although it was written about 2 centuries ago, it doesn't matter because it tells a timeless and believable story. All 5 Bennet daughters need to find husbands, preferably rich ones. How they go about it and how Elizabeth learns to love Mr. Darcy is absolutely fascinating, not only because of the way it is told, but because it shows people as they really are when something important is at stake. Fabulous!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I'm not sure what can be helpfully added to the 487 prior reviews of P&amp;P but I enjoyed this one so much that I must try. This is a fantastic work and should be the textbook for aspiring novelists' Storytelling 101 class. Austin's ability to create compelling characters that leap off the page and to maneuver them through an intelligent, gripping narrative is amazing. Despite the passage of 200 years, her characters resonate with their timeless flaws and virtues. I particularly enjoyed the snippets of intelligent, wry humor from both Elizabeth Bennett and, most notably, from her father Mr. Bennett. I finished the book on an airplane and struggled to stifle laughs.As an aside, the BBC/A&amp;E 5-6 hour version of P&amp;P is the best film adaptation of a classic book that I have ever seen and is well worth the time investment."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The plot is intriguing: an assembly of eligible men take short-term residence in a town full of unmarried women. As a result, several couples pair off and a few marry. The novel is concerned primarily with one couple: Eliza and Darcy.Obstacles prevent these two from seeing each other's worth. Darcy at first thinks Eliza possesses no great share of beauty. He is prejudiced and only sees her as a product of her class. But by gazing through the windows to her soul - her dark eyes - he slowly becomes fascinated by this enthralling beauty.Eliza, proud herself, will not accept the advances of a haughty, cold man like Darcy. Instead, she offers her affections to a bright-colored soldier, who possesses pleasing manners to match her own. But experience teaches her that a cool temper can hide love, and pleasing manners can mask cruelty.Appearances are deceiving, and lessons are hard learned in Pride and Prejudice, a light romance, occasionally skirting the depths of human psychology."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Being a 20 something male, I was not sure what to think when I picked up this novel. I knew that girls had always loved this book, so I set myself up for a girlie novel. Elizabeth, the protaganist, is anything but a simple girlie character though. This book attacks the social structure of Austen's days. The characters are deep and well written. Some are characatures for comic relief, but you still come away with the feeling that you have known someone like that in the past. This book is a classic for a reason. I recommend this book to anyone, not just love sick teenage girls."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I want to recommend you this novel,\\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Have you ever heard \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and \\"Jane Austen\\"? I read it two times, last year and early this year. It's very interesting for me to read this book.Jane Austen lived small village so her view about world is limited and her works mainly deal with marriage. A model example is 'Pride and Prejudice'.There are many character in the novel. Many man character and woman character enter the story. At first, each person misunderstand each other but they remove misunderstanding and finally many man and woman character fall in love each other. The story is happy ending.Many character point the other man's mistake but they don't know their mistake. They realize that they made a misunderstanding, they begin to know themselves mistake. I think many people make a mistake like the character's mistake. I also the same so I read this novel and realized many things. I presume that maybe the novel teach you many things.The novel show character of realism. Generally realism literary work explain everything in details. 'Pride and Prejudice' is the same. Writer explain everything very detailed so people said that realism literary work is limited people's imagination. I don't agree with that because I think that the more detailed writer describe, the more detailed we image. For example, if the writer describe like that \\"There are a table and chair and a flower vase and so on.\\", I can image like that \\"maybe the table color is black and chair color is same, and.. maybe the flower are rose and forget-me-not. So I think realism literary works can make us more imaginative, just my opinion.I recommend 'Pride and Prejudice'. I'm sure that you'll be intersted in this novel and Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Is she proud and he prejudice? Maybe it is he who is proud and she who is prejudice? Despite the arguments that could be made both ways, Jane Austen does indeed do an excellent job in bringing together two people of such different moral standing and ensnare them in a delightful and romantic story.The heroine, Elizabeth Bennett, is a witty, presumptuous young lady with an uncontrollable urge to speak her mind. Her antagonist is the very wealthy and very blatant Mr. Darcy, who has his own ideas about how certain people should act and behave. So how can two people so wrong for each other and so different ever be brought together?Elizabeth finds herself alone with Mr. Darcy on many awkward occasions and always manages to say something to hurt his precious ego. I think it is absolutely amazing how he can fall in love with a woman who has nothing but utter disdain for him and everything he stands for. She is, however, an amazing woman.Elizabeth is caring and considerate and very much eager to be in love, although she sometimes hides it well. She has the utmost affection for her family, and especially for her older sister, whose heart she would gladly do anything to keep from breaking.In Mr. Darcy&#65533;s defense, he is a very well rounded gentleman. He has the highest and most prestigious upbringing. However, he lets his social status and wealth dictate his heart and cause him to spiral into a soul searching debate over love verses social standing.The entire story leaves the reader captivated and in agony, ready to flip to the end to see if Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth truly find love."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\" Thus begins the novel \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Jane Austen. Written nearly two centuries ago, the novel still seems fresh and new owing to its radiance of wit and uncanny sense of candor. The characters are quirky, at times satirical. However, their actions and concerns mirror those of our own. Should we value property, position and esteem over virtue and principle? Should we forgo all romantic notions of love and marriage and instead be practical and settle for material wealth and security? These are questions the characters in this novel ask themselves and each other. It is a comedy of manners, but also, a story about young people trying to make rational and intelligent choices, pulled this way and that by their morals, their conscience, and often, their mothers.At the center of the story are Elizabeth Bennet, an intelligent and opinionated young woman, and Mr. Darcy, a proud, haughty gentleman. They meet and almost immediately, dislike each other - Elizabeth because she finds Mr. Darcy incredibly proud and completely lacking in humor; Mr Darcy because he thinks Elizabeth and her family are beneath his station in life. But one cannot help who one loves, and Mr. Darcy eventually feels great admiration for her. Elizabeth, on the other hand, realizes that she has been too quick to judge, and begins to look upon Mr. Darcy with some measure of interest. What follows is a delicate waltz of flirtation and witty repartee. We the readers, 21st century get-up-and-go, can't-stop-for-a-minute workaholics, then have the bucolic pleasure of bearing witness as to which will melt away first in the warmth of true affection - Mr. Darcy's pride, or Ms. Bennet's prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen, in her novel Pride and Prejudice, contrasts characters through a battle of social conflict. Elizabeth Bennet, a young woman of lively character, strives against an equal adversary, Fitzwilliam Darcy, a man well endowed by fortune. As the two haughtily battle wits, Mr. Darcy falls in love with Elizabeth, further complicating the story's intricate plot; while Elizabeth's sister, Jane, falls for Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy's best friend. Mr. Darcy's pride against Elizabeth's social standings and Elizabeth's unfounded prejudice against Mr. Darcy's seemingly snobbish habits form a classic tale of romance and humor.The intricate twists of fate intertwine the lovers in their conquests, defeats, and humbling of character. Mix-ups in the tale create a humorous love story with a relish for varied characters undoubtedly human in their emotions and actions. Austen vividly illustrates contrast in social class during the Regency era while exposing human flaws. Characters such as Mrs. Bennet, Lydia and Mr. Wickham warn the reader of the mishaps caused by characters unscrupulous in their wayward actions. Yet as the story unfolds, one cannot help but fall in love with this tale of a man and a woman beset by emotions they fall victim to."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This classic detailed description of the problems faced in olden day England regarding women, enchanted my mind immediately from the books first sentence.

No novel, no matter how well-regarded, is universally esteemed - Twain, Emerson, and Charlotte Bronte all savaged Pride and Prejudice in print - so let us, for a few moments, stop treating it as holy writ and just look at it as a novel, at how it holds up to a modern casual reader.Pride and Prejudice (1813) is Jane Austen's novel of manners - it thoroughly explores the ins, outs and economics of nineteenth-century courtship. The novel's central character is Elizabeth Bennet, one of five daughters, whose family lives in a country village. Two wealthy, eligible bachelors move to town, and romance, confusion and animosity ensue.Austen populates her novel with all manner of flawed characters. Many of them are annoying - that is, they behave badly and are antagonistic toward the main characters - but they all show at least some depth. No one here is without flaw, but no one here is without virtue, either (except Mr. Collins, the most ludicrous of them all). And this is why the novel works: because Austen treats her characters and their social milieu gently, delicately (well, except Mr. Collins). If she had done otherwise, if she had been more cutting, she would have lost the sympathy in the reader that many of these characters engender.To the modern audience, Austen's plotting is rather sluggish, although it must be recalled that novels moved at a rather more leisurely pace then. At any rate it often seems that there is one too many side plots, or perhaps one too many visits to relatives, and there are patches that can be quite hard to get through. But you don't go to Austen for plot - you go to her for clever dialogue, for a delightful turn of phrase. That is what she thrives at, and that is what she is best remembered for. And in spite of the novel's overlength, Austen delivers a full and completely satisfying payoff. Rarely is a happy ending so fulfilling, and it may not be until the last few pages of the book that it becomes evident to the reader how masterfully Austen has set it up. And this is a large reason why the novel has such enduring appeal.Much of the nuance in Pride and Prejudice may be lost on casual modern readers. For example, the character of Mrs. Bennet is the object of great scorn from many readers, and this has only been exacerbated by the film adaptations of the novel. But while marrying for love is the norm today, then, it was not; Mrs. Bennet is the only one looking out for the Bennet family's financial future.Pride and Prejudice is, on the whole, a satisfactory and clever novel, and, at present, one whose merits are diminished mostly by readers too far removed to understand it in its fullness, or whose tastes have diverged too far."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It is beneficial at times to step away from our classics of literature, to take them down from their high pedestals and look at them without pretension.

Even if most people could not necessarily recount the plot and characters, the countless editions of the book, combined with movies and literary spinoffs stand in testimony to it as a cultural icon. There are not many who would not recognize the book by name and have some sense of its position and impact.This review then cannot do much more than to echo these commonly known facts and direct attention specifically to the Kindle edition of the book which was downloaded as a free public domain book and which I confess, my first time reading the entire book as originally written. The strength of the book and timeless qualities of it can be affirmed by the attention that it elicited from me. I was able to enter into the plot and see both the masterful writing as well as the true insight into human nature that this book represents. Apart from a few typos and the chapters not being very well differentiated, I had little difficulty wanting to return to my Kindle to continue the read and glad for the experience.This is one of the most appealing elements of the Kindle in my estimation. There are so many books in the public domain that provides an opportunity for the reader who has heard of and knows the place and importance of a particular book who can then download the book and take the opportunities during the day (and for me of a long commute) and fill the gaps in one's reading by pulling books that have stood the test of time as well as the convenience of the newer books that are available at a considerable discount over the new Hardback price.What a pleasure to read and more yet to come in the days ahead.5 Stars for the novel AND the medium!Bart Breen"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"When I picked up Jane Austen's &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; at a local bookstore,I had NO idea of what the book was about,and had no clue tht I would absolutely fall in love it.Jane Austen makes Elizabeth come alive,and made me admire the kind of writing skills that can capitivate readers 200 years later,and leave the readers wanting more!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I'm a big fan of classics, and books like Sense and Sensibility, Emma, and Pride and Prejudice, and I've found that I can always look to a Jane Austen book to keep surprising me with her talent and sense of old-fashioned style in writing"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice had me hooked by the first page.

Line breaks follow pretty much every occurrence of \\"Mr.,\\" for example."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Any reader of the novel Pride and Prejudice, be it novice or veteran, has certain expectations and apprehensions based on its incredible popularity and renown. The same can be said for the media, whose recent over-use of its famous opening line, \`It is a truth universally acknowledged...' can be found repeated in the opening of many a news, magazine or blog article announcing some creditable or dubious connection to Jane Austen's characters or plot. Interestingly, it has become the meme of the day passed along and re-used by those who want to appear in the know, but are sadly missing the point. It is debatable if Pride and Prejudice's profound truths can be reduced to just universally acknowledged one-liners. If the novel was that easy to figure out we would not care two figs about it, and after nearly two hundred years, it would have been lost to obscurity! What one can expect though is so much more; an engaging plot that keeps you thinking and re-evaluating characters every step along the way, witty, sharp and humorous dialogue that others wish to emulate but never quite achieve, and a love story which just might reign supreme for all eternity. With all of these expectations before us, who could not be a little intimidated?The Oxford World's Classics new edition of Pride and Prejudice might just meet your need to read and explore Jane Austen's classic novel. This edition presents the reader with a wide variety of supplementary material to help you along in your discovery of the universal truths in Pride ad Prejudice. Like many editions, it supplies us with an unabridged text that has been carefully edited by prominent scholars since it was first published in 1813. \`Carefully' is the operative word here, since the debate is on about what has been changed or removed from the text. I will again defer to my learned co-reviewer Prof. Moody to delve into that arena. In addition to the brief biography of Jane Austen, select bibliography, chronology of her life, and two appendixes on dancing and social status that are repeated in each of the six editions in this series, (and previously mentioned in our first review), this volume includes a twenty-six page introduction by Fiona Stafford, notes on the text including a publishing history, textural notes and explanatory notes unique to this edition filled with insights and facts neatly organized and easy to find.Writing an introduction to one of the most beloved and highly scrutinized novels in English literature is a daunting task indeed. My sympathies went out to Fiona Stafford even before I had read one word. Pride and Prejudice is so many things to different people, and not everyone's pet project could be addressed within the limit of space. I just hoped that she might enlighten me in some small way about a truth or insight that I had previously missed. She did not. But like one of the main themes in Pride and Prejudice, accounts by different people of the same events can have different truths. We all judge by our own unique agenda, so what I saw as lacking, another reader might find diverting. She did however, hit upon some interesting points; how the strength of our convictions can cloud our belief and disbeliefs, the divergence and attraction of different personalities, and how truth or the misconception of it can alter our judgment and future happiness.The truth may be uncertain in Pride and Prejudice, but on this fact I am convinced. I had difficultly writing about this introduction even after taking copious notes. This can be a telling sign to its clarity and content. I did however find one point of amusement when the author mentioned that characters can be distinguished by their speech patterns and gave examples; \\"Lydia's use of \`Oh Lord', Miss Bingley's \`Abominable', Mr. Collins' \`Lady Catherine de Bourgh', and Mary Bennet's lengthy, but largely content-free sentences distinguish her from her vivacious sisters.\\" This is definitely true of Austen's unique characterizations, but this introductions \`content-free sentences' certainly distinguished it from any other vivacious introduction that this writer has the pleasure to read.Besides my disappointment in the introduction, the remainder of the supplemental material including the very helpful explanatory notes and the extensive chronology were a delight. For the new student the additional material is a must to understand the full context of the novel; - and for those Janeites who are ready to start your annual re-reading of Pride and Prejudice, pick up this edition. It is a perfect size to stash in your handbag or brief case, and whip out when the next debate ensues about whether Mr. Darcy was too proud, or just shy."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"...This book is a romance, and I liked it.My only excuse is, it's a CLASSIC romance!I loved it, in fact.

A must read for any self-respecting bookworm!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"When I went to a bookshop, this book 'Pride and Prejudice' charmed me with pretty book cover and familier title.When I started reading this book, I could not stop, i had to finish it. This book is very classical love story, even though it is written in a difficult english style. I was able to fall into this book very easily.Firstly, it was interesting how Jane portrayed the fluttering mind of village people like how all the villege people tried to contact with new villeger Bingley.Also it was interesting that how Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy's first impresstion is bed. That shows the first impression is not everyting, it's changeable by knowing the person in depth.Combine with that period of time, the love story continues. I was queit impressed how their only hope is to get married. For example, wickham's case. Elizabeth's sister get crush on him, and just fall into him and gets marry with him.I also knew that in that period of time, there was big gap between rich and poor same as today. This story is more meaningful because the story overcomes the richness. Also the way Mr. Darcy acts out, how he helps Elizabeth without letting her know and how he tries to protext him was really romantic.One another thing is that these days, most of the love stories reverse the story at the end that might give readers a thrill. But this very classic book just kept on going to one direction the way that i predicted. That is the reason that i chose this book to write a review on.Lastly, as I read this book I learnt that the appearance is not everything, the thing that charms person is one's scent. What kind of personality and chracteristic the one has. I think everyone wants to be pretty and be nice like a flower infront of a person the he or she loves. But important thing is that should be not determinded by a appearance but by inner personality."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Although this is my first Jane Austen novel (I started Emma but returned it to the library after a boring few pages), it suprisingly was a fun read. I admit I read this because of the movie and the BBC miniseries, but even watching both does not give the full story behind Pride and Prejudice. The book can be boring at a few scenes, namely, Mr. Collins, but whenever we read Elizabeth's and Darcy's banter, it makes it all more worthwhile. Definitely recommend the book if you enjoy the movie/BBC series."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen's books are fabulous. Her writing is superb and captivates the reader. Pride and Prejudice is an excellent book. It tells a story of five young girls to be married and has a very engaging plot. Young girls will not be disappointed with Jane Austen's novels. All her works are very inspiring.Cynthia Marie Rizzo author of \\"Angela and the Princess\\" and \\"Julie and the Unicorn\\""},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a romantic novel which I absolutely recommend to readers. If one is able to comprehend a 19th century woman's role and priorities, entailment, and discover insights on characters within letters and situations, you will surely appreciate this novel. I would mostly recommend it to readers ages 16 and up.One of my favorite chapters was chapter 34. In this chapter Darcy declares to Elizabeth his love for her and proposes matrimony to her. He does this when his love for her is at a stage where he disregards all obstacles that kept him from doing this earlier. He also does it at a point where Elizabeth's anger towards him is at a crucial point.One of literary devices that I mostly appreciate was irony. For example, in chapter 34 Darcy accuses Elizabeth of being prideful while Elizabeth accuses Darcy of being prejudiced. Even though both characters have fault in pride and prejudice, I found it quite ironic how the reader may think that Darcy symbolizes pride while Elizabeth symbolizes prejudice. Yet these two characters are viewed in the opposite way, where Darcy symbolizes prejudice and Elizabeth pride.I really did like this book, mostly because it did not bore me. I hope other readers appreciate this novel as much as I did."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I believe that this is an appropriate book for any age group. I recommend this book to whoever is interested in reading it. There is no violence, or any misconduct. The only thing mainly talked about was of love and the social class differences in the 19th century. One literary device that I appreciated is called allegory. Allegory is a story in which the characters, settings, and events stand for abstract and moral concepts. An example of this is the distinction people made in social classes. We can see this clearly in the way Mrs. Bennet desperately wanted her daugters to marry rich men, but Elizabeth wanted to marry for love. This moral concept shows readers that money, even though it has a great effect on many people, does not buy true love. I believe it has been one of the best books I have read so far. It was a beautiful, yet confusing love story. My favorite chapter was Chapter 18 from Volume 3. In this chapter Elizabeth and Darcy resolve the unanswered question of their relationship. Darcy had come with Bingley to Longbourn to see if he could make Elizabeth love him, and he knew from Lady De Bourgh's lecture to him about Elizabeth's evilness, that Elizabeth must have cared for him. Elizabeth insists that he only came to love her because she did not try to please him. She tells him &quot;You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike them.&quot; She is still embarrassed by the way that she misjudged him from the beginning. He is just as embarrased of his first proposal to her and his behavior toward her until that proposal. Since both Jane and Elizabeth have been proposed to, the entire neighborhood hears of the engagements, and both Elizabeth and Jane recieve congratulations. This is my favorite chapter because this is where all the conflicts are resolved, and thus begins a happy ending."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I believe that this is an appropriate book for any age group.

I thought that was really hilarious because it determined that Mrs. Bennet just wanted her daughters to marry her no matter what.I think this book is appropriate for teenagers like me who could understand the meaning of the book, and in some situations be connected with the characters. It relates to me because just like Elizabeth didn't marry because of the money, I know that when I marry, I'm going to marry for true love not because of the wealth the man I marry has.A literary device that I appreciate was that Jane Austen used imagery. She helped her readers feel as if we were with the characters. For example when Jane was sick, Elizabeth went to visit her on foot trails and she arrived with soaked and dirty stockings to the house.I like this novel because it made me realize that you should not judge a person with out knowing them. I recommended this book to anyone who enjoys reading love and realistic characters."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I thought that this book was a great book. I liked the characters and also the plot. My favorite chapter was chapter ten of volume three. This chapter is about Mrs. Gardiner writing to Elizabeth and telling her about what Mr. Darcy did for his sister. This letter showed Elizabeth Darcy's true character and how much he really cared for her. I think that because of the letter Elizabeth was able to confirm the feelings she had towards Mr. Darcy.This book is appropriate for teenagers and up because Pride and Prejudice has characters with these ages. Elizabeth, Jane and also the Darcy's and the Bingley's were around their twenties. Elizabeth younger sisters were teenagers. The other characters were around their thirties, forty's, fifty's and maybe sixties. Their actions and some of the events that happened with them can be related to some of the things that sometimes happen to us.A literary device that it is used in the story is allegory. Allegory is a story in which the characters, settings and events stand for abstract or moral concepts. Allegorical references are made towards the moral issue of marriage when the Bennett family is disgraced because Lydia has run away with Wickham without the benefit of marriage.I really liked this book because I was able to picture in my mind everything that was going on in the story. Jane Austen is able to bring images and pictures to my mind because she was descriptive, and she also used long dialogues for the characters. I liked the romances and misunderstandings about the main characters because it made the story interesting and it made me wonder what was going to happen in the next chapter. I enjoyed reading the story and also learned about some problems which women confronted in the 19th century such as entailment, which was the main conflict of the story."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is by far one of the best books that I have read in high school. The meaning of the title, Pride and Prejudice, is present throughout the novel. The main characters portray the meaning of the title. It was a must that they, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, marry, but their pride and prejudice were keeping these two characters apart temporarily. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy are so different, yet so similar. Pride is one of the main barriers that creates an obstacle to Elizabeth and Darcy's marriage. Darcy's pride in his position in society keeps him from interacting with anyone outside his society, which includes Elizabeth. Elizabeth's initial prejudice against Darcy is rooted in pride of her own judgment of people. She was very proud in her ability to judge people by their first impression. But these characters were able to overcome their flaws and realize they were destined for each other.My favorite chapters are chapter 12 and 13 in volume II. I like these chapters because this is where Darcy reveals the truth to Elizabeth and Elizabeth begins to analyze Darcy's actions. Darcy explains the reasons why he prevented Bingley from marrying Jane and the reason why Darcy and Wickham dislike each other. Thereafter, Elizabeth realized the she judged Darcy completely wrong and that her vanity has been the cause of her prejudice. This is the chapter where both Elizabeth and Darcy realize their faults and it is also the turning point in the novel.This novel would be appropriate for people 15 years and older. It does not have a complex plot, and the reader is able to evaluate each character after carefully reviewing their role in Pride and Prejudice.One literary device that I appreciated was the way Jane Austen revealed the personality of each character. Jane Austen revealed the characters through letters, and revealing the character's effect on others. I liked the way Jane Austen used indirect characterization, which forced the reader to use his/her own judgment, thus putting clues together to figure out the personality of each character.I enjoyed this novel and I recommend it to others. Throughout this novel one is able to see the flaws of people regardless of social standings. People from all social levels are alike-they are all PROUD. Therefore, one is able to conclude that human happiness is found by living a life in accordance with human dignity, which is a life in accordance with virtue. Human dignity and virtues go hand in hand, happiness is found in human dignity which is found in virtue, and together anybody could over come it, like Darcy and Elizabeth did."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is by far one of the best books that I have read in high school.

The emotion and attachment set to the characters of such novels is fully upheld and boundaries of literature appreciation are exceeded with the reading of Pride and Prejudice. The essence of a classic novel that can stand the tests of time is displayed in this masterpiece of Jane Austen. Wit and one liners by the ever enjoyable Mr. Bennet reminds you of your favorite uncle, while the observant eye of Elizabeth Bennet reminds you of friend you always wished to have as she takes a stand on the dullness of humdrum society, constantly giving something to ponder and test the limits. This satire on nineteenth century Europe has a wonderful approach, allowing some periods of a curved brow that silently screams in agreement with our heroine, Elizabeth, all occuring between a chuckle of amusement that is often choked by a surprise twist of the storyline of the other well illustrated characters. This novel is recommended for the modern day romantics who would appreciate a played story of hard-to-get; for the everlastining realist who loves the power felt when a opinion and lifestlye is presented against the grain of normality; and finally, for the everyday classical reader who can ever remember a time where self-pride has made a place, only to be broken by the realization that prejudice is only what sets people apart. A classic situaion in our heterogeneous society where everyone carries a pride-filled opinion of our surroundings, forgetting that individually we make up the prejudiced society. Gradual and humble realization is to follow, as in the likewise case of Miss Bennet, while the timeless saga and appreciation of Pride and Prejudice continues..."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"While I had many high expectations for this novel, they were all far exceeded when I actually picked up the book and read it -- and then could not put it down. Jane Austen's wit and charm constantly present throughout this story make it quite possible to laugh out loud. At a time when marriages were to go not beyond political correctness and money, Austen writes about the Bennett family, whose 5 daughters are all meant to find these advantageous lifestyles. While Mrs. Bennett is on a hurried and frantic quest to marry off each of her daughters, the two eldest, Elizabeth and Jane, are each on a journey of finding their true loves, whether they first realize that at meeting them or not. The plot line keeps entertainment and holds captive attention, and the twists and turns of this novel keep the reader coming back for more. It has my highest recommendation -- so go out and read it today!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have to say that Pride and Prejudice is one of the best books I have ever read...and I have read a LOT! I think the first time I picked it up was back in 6th grade. I loved it then, but how much does a sixth grader really get out of it? Reading it again for my English class opened my eyes to some of the more subtle humor and details Austen includes in her witty satire of Regency England's society and customs, particularly those dealing with marriage. Perhaps one of the reasons I liked this novel so much was-it wasn't a \\"fluff\\" romance. I admit, I love romances, but this one surpasses them all, simply because it has sustenance. It has a fully-developed plot, well-thought-out characters, etc. It is thought-provoking and at the same time, a fun read.The heroine of the novel, Elizabeth Bennet, is intelligent, witty, and-of course-prejudiced. Mr. Darcy, the proud hero, epitomizes the saying, \\"Appearances can be deceiving.\\" Lizzie's journey to true love is fraught with obstacles-some of her own making and some due to her matchmaking mama; her indulgent, sarcastic, and perhaps at times insensitive father; her love-lorn older sister; and two boy-crazy younger sisters."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"There is no wonder why this was the story You've Got Mail was based on!

In all truthness I can not see how this book has gotten so many other books based on the characters of Darcy and Elizabeth. I don't get it. I wish I did. I wanted to like this so much more than I did. All I could see the book is about is dancing and gossip. It reminds me of a older version of Seinfeld because it was about nothing. I did not give diddly squat about anybody in this book. Yes it is written pretty and well done but I had no connection to the people.You are probably wondering why I would give any stars if I dislike it so much but the truth is certain moments caught my attention and as I said it is written pretty.

Everyone in the novel wants to find love, and marry someone. Mrs. Bennet desperately wants her five daughters to find husbands and she makes it \\"The business of her life\\" (Austen, pg 5) to get her daughters married. Throughout the novel the characters must cope with the issues of pride and wealth in their community and in turn deal with the pressures of marrying into a good family.Mr. Bingley, who is a wealthy man, is very attracted to Jane, the eldest daughter. They dance at the ball and she believes that he is the right man for her. Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley's friend, does not want to dance with Elizabeth, Jane's sister, because she isn't part of the same social class as Mr. Darcy. This makes him seem very arrogant. However, as the novel progresses Mr. Darcy sets aside his prejudice, and actually starts to fall for Elizabeth. Elizabeth starts to realize that she actually has feelings for Mr. Darcy. She understands that she isn't as rich as Mr. Darcy, and that she does not come from the same world as him. Elizabeth looks past the arrogance she once saw in Mr. Darcy, and learns to love him regardless.Elizabeth's younger sister elopes with Officer Wickham, and the family is ashamed. Elizabeth fears that their pride may be ruined. Even though the two are happy together the family acts callously towards the couple because they do not think that Wickham is good enough for her, and she would be better off with someone from a high social class.Jane and Mr. Bingley get engaged and everyone is happy again. Lady Catherine tells Elizabeth about Mr. Darcy's intentions on marrying her, and that she should say no. Lady Catherine does not think that Elizabeth is worthy of her nephew because he is so wealthy, and she is just average. Elizabeth says that she isn't going to throw away her happiness, and accepts when Mr. Darcy proposes.The book was very well written but the plot was a little boring and goes back and forth too much. I felt that all anyone really cared about was whether or not they were going to get married. I thought that the way the characters spoke, and how the actual words were written were very eloquent, and made a simple phrase sound beautiful. I feel like what the author was saying could have been said in fewer words, and she could have condensed it into a shorter novel.I also liked how Elizabeth didn't give into Mr. Darcy right away and she stood her ground, yet Mr. Darcy did not give up on Elizabeth. She thought that he was very arrogant but then once she got to know him she actually appreciated him.Because the book focuses mainly on the subject of marriage, and love, only certain people may find enjoyment and entertainment in it. I don't believe that this novel was written for one specific age group, and could be read by many different ages. I think that young adults might enjoy the novel the best, because it deals with finding love. Again, the book was very well written, but a little too repetitive."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Miss Elisabeth Bennet is a very witty, ironically and independent woman. She is the opposite of Mr. Darcy. He embodies the modern, educated and pride person of the upper class. She is full of prejudices against his behaviour. It is a story of resentment and misunderstanding. The first impression of a person is a constant picture which you carry along with you. It takes time to get rid of it and so does Elisabeth. Jane Austen takes this picture to develop her story. The reader follows the view of Elisabeth in the whole story to the rear end. During the elopement of Elisabeth younger sister Lydia she realises that Mr. Darcy is not the kind of person she always thought of. Her change of mind takes place in the off. The reader is not familiar with it because Elisabeth rejects the love of Mr. Darcy every time. You feel astonished in the end when you hear what she reveals to Jane.The novel is characterised as a battle of words. There is no much description of the setting or the social class in the nineteenth century. It concentrates on the feelings and situations of the characters. Chatting all over, I think it is the typical pastime of every girl. The book is full of these situations. It is about love, envy, parties and what is hot in town."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I wanted so badly to love one the classic romances of all time, but couldn't. I found the story incredibly dated. I was able to get past the archaic use of vocabulary, but not the lack of plot. Most of this lengthy novel is about idle English gentry socializing at each others homes. I had nearly decided to give up on finishing the book, when it picked up a little in the final third.

Mr Darcy, and Elizabeth, how great it is to see them together. Howevor Jane Austin is not a Romantic novelist. Her intent was to criticize her generation. She was in a way, poking fun at people's prejudice. This book is actual considered an &quot;ironic comedy.&quot; The comedy I can not see, but the irony is definately blinding. The part of this book that bothers me, is not so much within the book itself, but the point of the book. If someone was truly in hatred of their society, noticing the flaws relentlessly, why spend 62 chapters of their life, writing about it? I personally felt that this book, could be summed up in less than four pages, with the same amount of content being delivered, the same lessons being learned."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"jane austen is the most manly woman i've never met. her books are full of the kind of intricate analyses that i've only ever found in men, like myself, and have never observed in women, even women supposedly very smart, with all the benefits of formal education, indeed, even phd's from such places as harvard and berkeley. women, however smart they may be, always fall back on intuition when confronted with perplexing problems. even when their intuitions are completely impotent. i've had women tell me that they \\"thought\\" the economy was on the edge of deep recession because their \\"intuitions\\" told them so. or who said they \\"thought\\" a new business venture was destined to fail because they had an \\"intuition\\" about it. yet, when pressed for further \\"reasons\\", they were able to elaborate no further.so it is against such a background that i approached ms austen. and having read p&p; and mansfield park i am truly astonished that a woman wrote these books. certainly, the subject matter betrays a woman's concerns. yet, she must have been a rare woman who could patiently analyze and untangle the thoughts and actions of so many confused characters, who could resist the feminine temptation to jump to easy intuitive conclusions. i am amazed. would that there were just a few jane austens in this world. or lizzie bennetts, even. but alas, the world positively teems with lydia and kitty bennetts - and mrs bennetts! sigh."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Such a book with themes such as reputation and class horribly expressed.

I enjoyed the novel, and thought it fairly funny. The novel begins with Mrs. Bennet, who is earnestly searching husbands for her two eldest daughters, Jane and Elizabeth. The arrival of Charles Bingley, a wealthy bachelor, is an exciting prospect. She thus proceeds to set her daughter Jane up with him, and in the course of events, her other daughter, Elizabeth, falls in love with Mr. Bingley's friend, Fitzwilliam Darcy. The novel seems to lack; however, a more serious plot. The main themes are love, public status, and class, all of which seem to me rather less important in the scheme of things. All throughout the novel, the reader's main motivation to finish the novel is the unveiling of the fate of Elizabeth and Darcy. While the characters are very interesting and well structured, I feel the novel lacks a serious plot line. I believe the novel to be more of a gossip based story rather than a classic. I would not recommend this novel to others."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have read this book and have seen the movie so many times that I know the book by heart.

I've read the book 7 times and cant get enough of it.The BBC adaptation of the book was brilliant Jennifer Ehle was the perfect Elizabeth and Colin Firth was the perfect Mr Darcy, both were exactly how I'd imagined the characters to be like.

Elizabeth Bennett is intelligent, witty, and strong, the kind of woman that all women should aspire to be like.

In the BBC version of the novel, the adorable Colin Firth plays Darct to a tee. He was exactly the way I imagined him to be.

That's the main point of all the character's in Pride &amp; Prejudice. Pride &amp; Prejudice is about the Bennet's 5 daughters who need to be married off. Unfortunately all of the Bennet women are poor judges of how to act towards men and how the men feel about them. (Both cause many problems in the book.) One person understands, Mr.Bennet, but he seems to kind of humor them and leaves the job of matchmaking to his wife to deal with that. Mr. Bennet did seem to pass on some of his knowledge to the so-called heroine of the book, Elizabeth, a character who seems to be the light at the end of the tunnel for Mr. Bennet. Sadly, at times her wisdom fades and she shows her true colors as a Bennet woman. The main reason that all of the girls (with the exception of Elizabeth) are so silly (as it was put in the book is mostly due to they're mother, Mrs.Bennet. I assure you that Mrs.Bennet will irritate you. Even though she always tries to do the right motherly things or what she things is best for her daugters she causes many problems you may not realize until you finish the book. You can see her ingorance in her first statements which she bases on the fact,&quot;That a single man in possien of good fortune must be in need of a wife.&quot; All in all, I really find the book and the statement above shallow. All though I understand that British society at that time diplayed courting as the top of the list for females, but this book makes women appear as empty-headed, man-hungry, child-like people that bow down to man's and society's every wish. I have found that a lot of British and other classics diplay courting as a high priority, but in other books, like The Inheritance and Little Women there was more on thier mind than finding a husband. I also find this book unrealistic for many reasons, mostly because the complete personality of the charcters change in the blink of an eye. I really feel that this book is not pleasurable to read, though it may benefit you to read it so that you can learn to find the good and bad pionts of a book and compare it to other literature like it or during that time."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Everybody talks about the book.

It's so incredibly boring and stupid!!! It was without a doubt one of the most torturous reading experiences for me. Now, I can appreciate great pieces of classic literature (e.g. Moby Dick, Red Badge of Courage, Gullivers Travels), but this assuredly does not merit to fall within that catagory. It is friviolous and devoid of any real substance. No plot whatsoever. Essentially, it concerns a bunch of smart-aleck, stuck-up self-righteous phonies who try to outdo each other with their sarcastic and smart-aleck remarks. Give me a break, all of you who supposedly like this dull, monotonous, shallow book!! It is utterly beyond my comprehension how in the world this garbage is considered one of the great books of world literature. It is simply a 19th century British version of the Jerry Springer show."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"this book is for three kinds of people:1. people who think what so-called \\"classics\\" are all good. Of course, why would such book be called a classic if it isn't good?2. People who are really really old and are adapted to the cultural and period ideas3. people who like fairy-tale-like romantic storiesThat being said, I'm fair to not give this book a one-star. You can bang on the \\"unhelpful\\" button if you like, but I'm only telling the obvious truth.The story is basically about a mother trying to marry her five daughters off to wealthy men, so that she may \\"rest assured\\" on profits. Sounds selfish huh? Well.All the daughters are quite empty-headed and foolish except Elizabeth Bennet, who actually has clever \\"ideas\\" and is quick-witted with her tongue.They flirt around, using clever, humorous, or not-so-clever speeches that establishes each personality of the characters. Kind of like one of those old-fashioned playsI can just imagine Austen while she is writing, it goes something like this: \\"oh those pitful arrogant wealthy people, how I loath them! But it would be very nice to marry to one.\\" The truth is, she wanted to be a feminist, thus the Elizabeth character, but ended up a conservative anyways- women are better off marrying rich guy; rich guys are not only noble as birth, but noble in soul as well; high class people are in general, better than low class people. etc.So how did it end? well, I'm sure you can figure it out. All the girls married to rich-guys, or rich-guy-to-bes, with her main character married to the richest of all- and surprise! The best guy of all. And they all live quite happy.Some people said that they are enchanted by the \\"clever things\\" Elizabeth says. Yeah, they are pretty clever, but honestly, it's pretty much only because of the period difference. I think some pop TV shows' characters' speeches are pretty clever too with their usage of pop culture, I bet Austen can't think of those. WHY? BECAUSE SHE LIVES IN A DIFFERENT PERIOD OF TIME!!! So why would people hold Elizabeth's speeches higher? Well, you figure it out.Sound like a dumb silly-old love story? well, you got that quite right. This is pretty much what I tell most people who are biased over \\"classics\\": classics may have that time-less fancy feeling with their wording, but story-wise, they are pretty silly and outdated."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"An email solicitation acknowledged me as an International Amazon customer, and invited me to download the Kindle Reader, which I did.However when I tried to download the titles I was advised that they were not available to me in Africa.Amazon knows I am in Africa because my email address and customer details describe my location as being in Africa.So much for not discriminating against the people who live in Africa!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Wonderful look back into a more romantic time.

I should not have been surprised, however, for any work authored by Jane Austen is bound to be genius. With her witty dialogue that had me laughing out loud and the heartachingly poignant love fiascos that left me in tears of frustration, she successfully turned me into another Darcy fanatic.The characters are timeless-Elizabeth with her candor and brilliance, Darcy with his romantic soul waiting to explode, and Mr. Bennet with his stoic attitude towards the Mrs.-and the plot will never grow old. Even if the book were as long as War and Peace I would not be deterred if I knew I was to be rewarded with the defining moment when Elizabeth returns Darcy's declaration of love. What makes this book what is though is not just the tryst between Elizabeth and Darcy, but the social commentaries Austen makes about the period and all of the outcomes that are swayed by the civilities of society. Clearly a classic that remains just as magical as the day it was written, Pride and Prejudice should be required reading for everyone, boys and girls alike (hey you boys out there might just learn something from Darcy's quiet love approach)."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Even though Jane Austen might sound stuffy and old fashioned, her enthralling novel Pride and Prejudice is as pleasing today as it was in the 1800's when it was written. The story is all about two girls-Jane and Elizabeth Bennet- and their trials and tribulations in middle-class, snobby English society. Austen uses sophisticated word choices and witty remarks to portray what life was really like, and how everything wasn't always as it seemed. The main character, Elizabeth Bennet, finds herself caught up in an elaborate love triangle--involving her sister, Jane, a wealthy, intelligent gentleman named Mr. Charles Bingley, and a plot to tear the two lovers apart. As the story goes on, more and more is revealed about who is responsible for breaking up the budding romance between her sister and Bingley. In the middle of all of this, Elizabeth finds that she has fallen in love with the man that ruined sister's relationship. With a tangled web of lies and deceit, the tale takes a sharp turn from entertaining anecdote to a gripping suspense story. Will she tell her sister who is responsible for the breakup? Will she continue her romance with the man that has made her sister so unbelievably miserable? All in all, the story is a riveting piece of art that shouldn't be taken for granted just because it sounds boring."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen obviously chose the titles to her novels with care, for this book truly is about pride and prejudice, explored through the eyes of the book's main character: Elizabeth Bennett, as well as the rest of the Bennett family, Elizabeth's best friend Charlotte and the upper crust families with which they rub shoulders.Set in the England of King George III, \\"Pride\\" details Elizabeth's coming of age and her exploration of her own romantic nature. As the second eldest of five daughters, and most beloved of her father, Elizabeth is used to being the quickest wit around, and fancies herself an expert of human nature. When Elizabeth finds herself sought after by several men, consecutively, she finds perhaps she isn't quite the expert she'd believed herself to be.Austen is a master of character study, and \\"Pride\\" is certainly no exception, being the finest example of her work. While a romance novel in earnest, Austen never hesitates to ruffles feathers with her quick wit.Characters such as Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Collins, and Lucas family and, of course, all the Bingleys, provide an excellent assortment of personalities and conflict that Elizabeth must navigate in order to remain true to her nature and find her position in English society of the time.Herself the daughter of a clergyman, Austen was no stranger to the lifestyle of which she wrote, and \\"Pride\\" provides excellent insight into her time."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Oh! Can I even say enough about this delightfully wonderful book? I won't give any of the plot away. But, I will say that the tension and the passion between the characters is so strong that it comes through the pages, transcends time and you can relate to it precisely today as readers could a hundred or so years ago. The humor and wit is British, of course, and most of the sentencing isn't used any more; therefore it might be a difficult read for some. I admit I had some hard times getting through it. But it was well worth the effort! And now I read it once a year just so I can relive the pleasure. A good read for anyone.

The way all the characters interact and the vivid picture the book gives on every person helps the reader understand the contents of the story and the reason the main characters act in the manner that they do. Apart from love, this book also has mystery and suspense. The novel never takes the reader to a dead end, but instead takes him/her to a sort of maze where anything can happen. This book is full of twists and turns that keep the reader on his toes and because of its contents dealing with society and its morals on being prejudiced, it is appropriate and a must read for any age group. In &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; the chapter that interested me the most was chapter 8. In this chapter Elizabeth is taking care of her ill sister when she joins Miss Bingley, Darcy, and Mrs. Hurst and the topic of an acomplished woman arose. In this little dispute of the upper class, a vivid description of an accomplished woman is given where a woman is accomplished when she has mastered all of the fine arts and has read many books. This was my favorite chapter because it gives an insight into the prejudiced mind of the upper class. To them an accomplished woman is one who has mastered the fine arts, but the only people in the 19th century that could afford the classes that helped a woman master anything were the upper class families. In laymens terms the only way for a woman to be considered accomplished was if she was rich and famous. The fine arts that were considered refined were the ones that could not be studied by just anyone and those were the art the upper class studied to feel superior. What made this my favorite chapter was the way Elizabeth reacted during the dispute. Even though she was being put down, she did not say a word to fight back. All she did was listen and let the birds chirp. Her pride was too great to let anyone tell her differently and that's exactly what I liked. Even though she was lower class, she had more respect and pride than the ones that were believed to be high and mighty. This book is appropriate for people of all ages. As long as the person reading understands the meaning of big words, this is a great book for them. This is so because of the morals of the story, and the connection you can make with the present time. This book shows you how and why some people feel superior to others and how in the end, the people they looked down upon ended up being the greatest people they've ever met. As you read this book, you come to realize that what you are learning is priceless and meaningful. &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; gives you an insight into a problem facing every average person and, if read right, the solution to being prejudiced. If you haven't read this book, read it, and if you have already read it and understood it, read it to some one who hasn't, or give your book to someone you like or appreciate."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Let me begin by saying that, although I have been an Anglophile since the age of eight (for some strange reason!) not every novel from or about England captures my fancy like &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; has, through the years...I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book (and was able to read it in England the second time, which really gave its words and sentiments added significance). What makes it special for me each time I read it is its historical content and reference. For example, the fact that some of the English people of the times spoke so concisely and brilliantly has always been, for me, a mental pleasure. The customs of the day have also appealed to me compared to some of the casual ways exhibited in today's world. (To say I am Victorian at heart would not be wrong...)Although &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; mirrors universal truths and concepts, it is the aura of propriety (sometimes abused and falsely applied, such as in the case of the Reverend Mr. Collins, the pompous Lady Catherine de Burgh, and the haughty Miss Bingley) which I like. Despite their ability to de-nobilize the demeanor of their time, I still enjoy their antics. They serve as a meaningful counterpoint to the serious business of living which drives Elizabeth and her sister Jane to seek more high-minded and worthwhile pursuits. I like &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; because it illustrates, once more, that &quot;there's always one in every crowd,&quot; that there exist among the civil gentry those who would thwart and turn back and simply congeal to impress (Mr. Collins, again!)In this same vein, Mrs. Bennett serves as the original &quot;stage mother,&quot; constantly pushing her daughters to the forefront of dances and other situations, wanting them to marry well. Yet she consistently annoys and insults those about her so her daughters' chances to &quot;marry well&quot; are minimized almost in direct correlation to her pandering.Mr. Bennett is one of my favorite characters, although he is not as clearly-drawn as most of the others. In him, I see a man of his times, saddled with a silly wife whom he married for looks and not for her intellect, and trying to make the best out of her urgent desires for her daughters' future wealth. In that regard, he is not so much depressed as resigned, a quiet man who keeps to himself but who also acquiesces to his wife because (alas) he still does love her. He is caught by son-less fate to have to cede the home over his family's heads to the Reverend Mr. Collins, a cousin. This causes Mr. Bennett grief but serves the reader as a historical footnote, a sign of the times that, fortunately, has come and gone.Since I have only limited space, I will describe only one more character, Miss Elizabeth Bennett. Amongst these pages, she has such courage, such intelligence, such a command of the English language, and an acute sense of responsibility in all areas of her life. (She is fictional, of course, but I find myself hoping I can someday identify with her - not only that, but she gained the affection of the equally-noble Mr. Darcy!) Elizabeth is the embodiment of cool reserve and ready wit, but she is also quick to comfort. As she stood out among the other characters in this book, so would a real person like her, during those times. The historical perspective of Elizabeth's life is informative, pleasing, and remarkable - a worthy history lesson as well as an entertaining novel."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is the work of a scholar. Granted, it is expensive. But compared to other editions of Pride and Prejudice that imply scholarly expertise, this edition is a scholarly work. And Rogers credits his sources, too! Kudos to Professor Rogers!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"When I walk into a bookstore, you'd rarely see me pick up a classic. I typically head straight to the Young Adult Fiction section, home to my favorite first-class, high-quality novels such as Gossip Girl, the A-List, and The Clique. However, this time I opted for a change, wanting to read, for once, a really good book. With the movie coming out, I decided to give Pride and Prejudice a try. I fully expected to put the book down forever after the first page or so--- it seems to me that most authors writing before the 21st century hadn't quite caught on to the method of captivating the reader in the first few sentences, or even chapters--- but I was surprised. From the start, Pride and Prejudice was interesting, humorous and engrossing. I read on. Taking my clean hardcover copy with me everywhere I went for the next couple weeks, I read whenever I had a spare moment. I loved the language, of both the chatty and funny narration and the dialogue of the interesting, loveable characters. Some phrases and words were unfamiliar, but instead of making it hard to understand, I caught on quickly... for example, a teenage female's 'coming out'. And another thing I loved about this book--- it wasn't just a typical love story. There were all sorts of twists and turns, most noteably with the crabby, snobby Mr. Darcy-- who, by the end, had captured the hearts of the readers as well as the characters. All in all, I'm so glad to have overcame my fears of boring, difficult-to-read 'classic' novels--- this book is really one that nobody should miss."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is an old time classic for me and one of my favorites.I have went through it about 5 or 6 times already, listened to it on audio cd and watched different versions of the movie countless times.Splendid conclusion!!!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I always resisted reading this book. I thought that the old, female bounding type society was something I never wanted to relive. However, I came to truly love Elizabeth.This was another 'home book club' pick of my daughters and I, and we also enjoyed it. We loved the language, which is so well spoken and hilarious (Elizabeth). She has a way of verbalizing positive demoralization, which makes others walk away with their tails between their legs!We also loved many of the other characters, such as Lydia, and the idiot Bennets.Now to why we only gave 4 stars. The Kindle version I have is FULL of errors! Also, one of our books had a HORRIBLE font, and was missing many of the illustrations that were in our other two books. I had to go to the library to get a copy for our reading group."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"In thirty years of reading, I somehow missed reading this book (or anything by Austen). If I hadn't been trying to fill my new Kindle with free books, I don't know if I ever would have read it. There were too many movie adaptations that held zero interest for me and too many rip-offs from authors unable to imagine their own characters and wanting to pick up where Austen had left off. I didn't think that this book would have anything for me. I was too cool for Jane Austen.I was wrong. Austen is amazingly witty and the romance of Elizabeth and Darcy is one of the sweetest and realistically character-driven I've ever read. Despite the setting, the two of them are so well-imagined as to achieve a kind of timelessness. I highly recommend this book, especially if you've never read Austen before.As far as Kindle editions go, this isn't one of the best. There are some weird line breaks. The typos and repeated words mentioned in earlier reviews seem to be fixed, but any word with emphasis in the original is all caps in this edition -- it's a bit like reading an over-heated chat room discussion at first, but I got used to it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the greatest novels in English literature and is truly deserving of being called a classic. First published in 1813, it is set at the turn of the 19th century in a fictional town near London. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are blessed with five daughters, ranging in age from 15 to 22. The novel opens with Mrs. Bennet anxiously thinking about how to marry her daughters off, as that was the primary way for women to achieve financial security during those times. The story is told in third person from the point of view of the second eldest daughter Elizabeth Bennet.Of the four Jane Austen novels that I've read, Pride and Prejudice is my favorite. This is not because I didn't enjoy the others, I most certainly did, but rather because Pride and Prejudice affected me on so many different levels. It touched my heart and swept me away, as I absolutely fell in love with Mr. Darcy. It also provoked my mind, as I reflected upon the many issues that Austen explores in this novel. It is a subtle book, as all Jane Austen novels are, and that is its beauty. All of the issues that Jane Austen raises in this book slowly simmer in your mind.One of the reasons I love Pride and Prejudice is that it is a romance for those with a bit of a feminist streak. Elizabeth Bennet is a strong character who isn't afraid to speak her mind. She is no weak wallflower. Many romantic plots feature a damsel in distress who is saved by her knight in shining armor. That is most definitely not the case here. The love story in Pride and Prejudice shows that you can have chivalrous man and grand romantic gestures without a weak heroine.I also love Pride and Prejudice for Austen's excellent treatment of the characters. Both of the main characters, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, grow, develop, and change throughout the novel. Their character developments are deep, thorough, and convincing. In contrast, the supporting characters do not change much. Their constancy provides a nice point of comparison to the growth of the main characters.The novel is a full-fledged social commentary on marriage, love, money, wealth, social class, propriety, as well as pride and prejudice. It is fascinating to learn how different those times were from today, especially in the lack of opportunity for women; and yet, it is even more fascinating to think about how relevant the issues are to today. The more things change, the more they seem to stay the same.If you only read one Jane Austen novel, let it be Pride and Prejudice. Be patient with the old English language. It is not an easy read, but it is worth your while."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Beautiful clothbound edition. It is well made and will last a long time. I believe the typeface is Times New Roman, with standard margins. There is a ribbon bookmark in the binding. I plan to get some more of the Penguin clothbound editions in this set."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"You may believe from the title of this review that the reviewer is prejudiced. What took you so long to figure that out? Age and other afflictions of the eyes have robbed my ability to read to some degree but this edition is very kind to us ancients. Oxford has a good reputation and this publication will not dretract from it. The editorial material is even somewhat amusing: e.g. one note in the chronology \\"the United States declare war on Britain.\\" There is nothing amusing about the War of 1812, the use of the word \\"declare\\" where we Americans would more likely use \\"declares\\" is symbolic of the British conception of our republic. But we digress.Austen has been a favorite since I first encountered her in college. It was much later I realized one reason for the fine prose in Hiram Grant's Memoirs. He spent many hours at West Point reading Jane Austen novels. There he was given his more familiar name Ulyses S.(stands for nothing)Grant, hero of the Civil War and Republican president of the U. S. Had he spent his time reading the French tacticians as his classmates did the war may have been prolonged to allow McClellan to beat Lincoln in 1864.I apologize for wasting the readers time on things that really spread no knowledge of the book reviewed. I'll not spend words telling you the story, describing the characters or the time, offering opinions on the social state of Britain at the time of the novel. There are other reviews that attempt this. Jane Austen is much better at these tasks than I.The reviewer is an anglophobe. If it is given five stars here it should tell you a great deal about the value of this novel. For one who protects what is left of vision to read this book three times should say even more. It is strongly suggested reader that you uit wasting time on reviews and read the book.Thank you for your patience."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Does the world need another P&P; review? No. Will anyone read this? Probably not, but I made a resolution to write a review of every book I read - and I read this for the umpteenth time while recovering from surgery.What is it about this novel? On the surface it is an ever-so-polite romance featuring the Bennett sisters, whose biggest concerns are their ball gowns and gossipy letters. However, what makes it ageless is the fully developed characters and the deep insights into the human condition. I never tire of it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Since I was a business major in college, I wasn't made to read a lot of the standard classics that most people have already read. I'm finally starting to make up for lost time.I loved this book. I have always loved 19th century literature, mostly because I love the societal rules and manners. (The House of Mirth is one of my all-time favorite books.) However, I was a bit surprised that I could be drawn in so much to a romance where no one even kisses. (Especially because some of the paranormal romances I read are practically pornography.) But I couldn't put this book down and I am now in love with Mr. Darcy like so many other women before me."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"These clothbound Penguin classics are even more beautiful in person!

I ordered Pride and prejudice and Jane Eyre. I recieved them yesterday and was very please with them. The pictures do not do them justice. They are gorgeous. I was afraid they would not be very durable, but they are very sturdy and the paper used for the pages is nice and thick. I wanted to find copies of my favorite classics that I can have for a long time and that would hold up to many re-reads and that is exactly what I have found in these. It doesn't hurt that they look great on the boofshelf either. I am also very glad that I ordered them from amazon and not from someone else (I did see them on a few other sites, for full price) because the price was amazing and they arrived properly packaged and in perfect condition with not a single flaw or bent corner, which happens easily to hard covers. I can't wait to order the rest of these beautiful penguine classics!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":".it was a freebie. it was a paperless book. why not take advantage of it right? not like WHOA! book!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It's important to remember that Pride and Prejudice takes place during the later reign of George the Third at the beginning of the 19th century. The period was one of war and revolution that severely threatened upper class privileges. Conscription at home and reports of endless damger can never be comfortable news from across the channel and on the seas of the world. There was also the threat of invasion that Napoleon planned but was ultimately unable to execute. Yet war is never mentioned in the novel. There are soldiers, officers only of course, but their sole military duties are flirtation and to supply dance partners.The true conflict, in fact the only conflict of the Bennet family, is the struggle to marry off the eligible daughters before their father dies. Primogeniture is the evil djinn of the plot and Mrs. Bennet and the daughters are never unaware of the perils of their situation. They live one heart beat away from being thrown out of their estate by the male heir, their cousin Mr. Collins. Their only options are marriage or a life of dependency on a relative's charity. The girls are untrained. They can never earn their livings and the only skills they possess are those required of a wife, a companion, and a homemaker. Here I am thinking of Jane and Elizabeth. The youngest, Lydia, runs away with a scoundrel officer and almost brings the family to ruin. The other two daughters, Mary and Kitty, are mere bookends of little note, useful perhaps to illustrate the unlimited production of Bennet daughters, and to highlight the misfortune of never having produced a son.Every unattached man the family encounters is defined by fortune. Darcy has an income of 10,000. and Bingley 5,000. Once these two are corralled, the fate of the rest of the family is secure and the novel ends with satisfaction. The great peril is that these two wealthy bachelors will not be induced to perform their assigned tasks, finding and wedding two suitable wives from an otherwise often embarrassing Bennet family. Among the great delights of this novel are the nuances of character displayed and the modulations of the central personages as fortune and misfortune threaten and abate.Loss of place and social ostracism run behind every line of text and the wonder of Jane Austen's novel is that the threat of material want is ever present and yet is rarely noted. In polite company such matters are never discussed, but they are implicit in every second of existence. The stress is desperate and the courage of the characters immense. Since it is never expressed, it is possible to imagine it lies hidden in their minds but never given place in speech.Dialectical materialism can understand and find clarity in the situation of the Bennet family. A rereading of Das Kapital might be a useful sequel to this great novel."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"No matter how many times I read this book, it still makes me smile.

The book has way too much talk in it, hardly anything is described in any other way than by someone remarking upon it. But I liked the story overall, and I thought the authors view on pride was interesting. The characters are believable and somewhat relatable. Some parts were hard to understand because the language is outdated, and I wasn't always sure who was speaking. Only that someone always was. But because of the social nature of the novel, I guess that works."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The Collins classics version is outstanding. It's inexpensive ($6 or so when I purchased), though compact it is very legible. The paper is thick enough so that the font on the other side doesn't show through. Binding is tight though the spine gets bent quite a lot even after one read through. What I particularly enjoyed was the Collins classic English literature dictionary in the back. It includes many outdated or no longer used terms and words so that you don't have to reach for the computer if you don't really know what an 'entail' is or what 'persnickety' means. But it is a compact, standard mass market paperback size, and that's my one beef.As for the novel. Classic English literature is amazing, and this novel is one of the cornerstones of the 19th century English literature scene. Along with Dickens and the Bronte sisters, Austen's novels seem to capture the lives of the English in these times. Though Pride and Prejudice deals mainly with the wealthy, or at least the privileged class, we get to see a wonderful story unfold. Like the title states, this story deals with the pride of one character and the prejudice of another. Many peripheral plots unfold and help add to the overall story while the main plot moves along quite well.It's a novel that is often placed on reading lists in school, though I feel that in reading this in my early 30s that I can really truly grasp the emotions and trials of these characters more completely. If you read this when young, then do yourself a service and re-read this novel. It's amazing! Then watch the Colin Firth BBC series."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Absolutely amazing! Probably my favorite book ever, and that's a lot coming from an English major.

On the inside cover it suggested not to miss \`Pride and Prejudice' and \`Romeo & Juilet'. So of course, I bought them as well!When I first started reading the book, being that it was written in 1813 and the language being slightly different then, I found the book a little hard to get into. Although, once I got to know the characters and the story began to unfold, I found myself unable to put the book down (literally). The romance, as well as the relationship, between Elizabeth Bennet & Mr. Darcy was highly intriguing and only added to the chemistry that makes this love story truly amazing! Now, I don't want to give away any of the juiciness that lies within the book so I won't say anymore. You'll really just have to read the book!NOTE: While browsing around, it appears that other authors have written books continuing the \`Pride and Prejudice' story regarding the lives and love of Mr. Darcy & Elizabeth Bennet.

This has all right to be called an alltime classic."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"i finnaly decided to read this classic because i have heard so much about it.

Jane Austen's characters like Elizabeth Bennett, Mr. Darcy, and the bad lady Miss Bingley Jane all add to this complicated plot. Elizabeth Bennett is very well shown character, maybe the best ever written This novel is an excellent example of Austen's literary power. Her ladies are to be admired for they marry for love not the social reasons. There is a lot of pressure in society to marry in your social class but love should be the main reason.

It's nice to have another read at an older age to appreciate the author's words, and have a better understanding of what makes this such a classic book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I decided to reread this classic because I wanted to read PD James' new novel which continues the story of Darcy and Elizabeth after their marriage when there is a murder. I wondered if I would enjoy this book after reading it some decades ago and seeing at least one movie version of it. To my delight, I found the rereading fun. The statement that a classic is a classic because people enjoy reading it is true. The book is filled with humor and witty social comments. Jane Austen pocks fun at the generally uneducated women of her age, their silliness, their interest in looking beautiful, men, marriage, and family, the strong difference between them and the men in their lives, and how some very intelligent women, such as Elizabeth Bennet, stand out despite not being as beautiful as her sisters, and accomplishing more than them. This was a time when a woman walking three miles was unusual and women reading non-fiction was extraordinary.The story focuses on Elizabeth and on Darcy's pride. He is very good looking, rich, more intelligent than most of the people he encounters, and sees their foolish behavior and thoughts as a waste of time and absurd. His first impression of Elizabeth is negative. Looking only at her surface, he sees a young woman who is not as beautiful as others at a party. As a result, he makes a remark that Elizabeth overhears, that disparages her. Later, he sees the beauty of her character and intelligence. But Elizabeth has become blind to his worth because of the prejudice created by his remark, and she avoids him. The story becomes even more interesting when other characters are introduced and we read about the five Bennet girls and their parents' reactions to them. Some seem good or bad at first, but are they, and why do they seem like they do?"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I finally read P&P; at the insistence of a very good friend...we disagreed on the merits of the recent Keira Knightley P&P; film (I liked it; she didn't)...she challenged me to read the book so that i would understand, and now I do!The goal of all the great novels, the experts tell us, is to arrive at some fundamental TRUTH.The genius of Jane Austen was that she told us the truth from the get go: \\"that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\" and the MORE important truth: \\"However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.\\"And by declaring the truth from the get go, she brilliantly illuminates it throughout.This is a book for EVERYONE:For fathers (like me!), who love all their children, but recognize each for their faults and good parts...delights in the marriage of their daughters if they will be happy (like I am going through now)...the most touching part for me was how much Mr. Bennet loved Elizabeth and Jane and missed Elizabeth so much when she was gone.For children, especially, teens who are MORTIFIED at the behaviour of their parents in front of their friends. I mean, could Mrs. Bennet BE more embarrassing?!For brothers and sisters, to see the beauty and challenge of being siblings, especially in a large family!But, especially, for people who are - as Jane Austen put it - *violently* in love. She expressed it so well in the almost manic internal ponderings of Elizabeth and even Darcy, and and all at once: I hate him/her, I love him/her, I hope he/she will see me, I hope he/she doesn't come, how could he be so uncivil, how could he/she be so kind, I think he/she loves me, he/she could never love me...and also the joy of being friends before being lovers.I loved how she portrayed Mr Collins only in terms of his ridiculous language and habits; the filmmakers \\"cheated\\" by making Collins short to be ridiculous and then piled on; Austen saw the comedy not in his stature but in his silliness.I also loved the emphasis on letter writing to pour out ones fears and feelings...it is a lost art and we are the worse for it.The only thing I didn't like, and will likely never appreciate, is a culture where people don't have to show up at work everyday...I just don't get it...I guess that's why I enjoy historical fiction of common folks of the 18th and 19th century (by Matthew Pearl, Louis Bayard, David Liss, and others), where even the elite have to actually *do* something.I thanks my friend and Miss Austen for helping me appreciate a true classic!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"\\"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long age. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun.\\"This sentence is from the novel Pride and Prejudice, the most famous book written by Jane Austen. The author set the background as conservative and traditional British countryside life which still pay attention to the reputation and have their own social circle. It contrasts with the people who are upper- class. They are selfish and prideful. Through five middle class girls how to choose love shows the values of marriage in that time, in that society. But among them there still exists people like Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley who finally choose their true love. And the sentence expresses the true love in a class structure society is really cherished between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. It fully shows Mr. Darcy's love to Elizabeth.For a long time, because of Mr. Darcy's pride, he hides his love to Elizabeth. It leads to Elizabeth has a misunderstanding to Mr. Darcy since the first time they meet. As the most important themes in this novel, love plays a special role in this book. The whole story develops around the different barriers in the true love and how people to respond these difficulties. And all of these difficulties come from one reason that is the social force. The social structure makes Mr. Darcy's pride that he feels like he should be proud of himself. Because he is richer than others and live in the upper- class. At the same time, it also the social structure makes Elizabeth's prejudice. She knows she and her family is just in a middle- class. So she is more sensitive than others and she does not want others such as Mr. Darcy looks down upon her. But just because of her sensitive, it makes her different from other girls. Elizabeth is the most intelligent girl in her family. She is clever and high- hearted. When she first meets Mr. Darcy, she has a really poor impression about him. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy and intelligent gentleman, so faces Elizabeth's prejudice; he chooses to be silent and does not explain anything. When he proposes to Elizabeth, Elizabeth determined rejects him and mentions Wickham's deceit. But Mr. Darcy still says nothing about it, the only thing he says is \\"I don't want to talk about it at all.\\" This is just one obstacle between them. Before they realize their sincerely love to each other, they have faced the different troubles and numerous stumbling blocks- Miss Bingley's snobbery, Lady Catherine's attempt to control her nephew, Mrs. Bennet's idiocy and Wickham's lies. All of these obstacles make a big difficulty exist in their love. Especially, the class- structure and reputation is more serious. The class- structure is really significant in that society. There are so many differences between them. They have the totally different life style since they were born. So from the origin of their mind is different. In the beginning, Mr. Darcy's pride to the people who live in the countryside hurts Elizabeth a lot. He thinks as girl as Elizabeth should be happy that he loves. Therefore, in the first time he says courtship to Elizabethj, he thinks she would love to say \\"yes.\\" But he gets an unexpected answer. And finally he knows Elizabeth in the only woman who loves him, not his money. So he helps Elizabeth's sister Lydia and Wickham, who is a fortune- hunting officer. And he explains all things through the letter from Elizabeth's aunt. He earned his love back. That proves love is a force that can be separated from social structure and facts and it shows love can conquer anything even the hardest thing- people's mind.Reputation is another theme in the novel; it helps to strengthen the difficulty between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. For Elizabeth, reputation is not that important for middle class girl. She prefers to live with her family than cares about the reputation. So when she knows her sister Jane is ill, she walks to Netherfiled alone. She arrives with muddy skirt, to the shock of reputation- conscious Mass Bingley and her friends. She does not care how people judge her. In Miss Bingley's eyes, her behavior is absolute not acceptable in the upper- class. From Miss Bingley's reaction, it expresses Elizabeth's unique and her natural personality. But when sister elopes with Wickham and lives with him out of wedlock, the reputation- conscious happened again. Bennet family is not invited to the ball anymore, and even they walk as they run. Whatever Elizabeth does not care her reputation, but her family cannot avoid it. The social force still exists in her life. She cannot escape from it. But in her most difficult time, Elizabeth finds Mr. Darcy is the only person that wants to help her to find her sister back, give her sister money and solved all problems for them. She suddenly realizes she is wrong about her prejudice. So she decides to accept Mr. Darcy's courtship. They break the social structure and rules and finally get married.This novel reflects how people treat marriage in that society. People only pursue wealth and reputation. Girls can marry with a guy such as Mr. Collins, only for his money. Parents pay attention to the man who their daughter will marry is rich, not whether their daughter really loves him. They pursue social position instead of love. But just because of that, it shows the true love between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth is special and cherished. The author in this novel also tries to tell people, in this world we need to change, change can solve anything."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"One friend asked me why the book, Pride and Prejudice, became one of the most famous classics of all time. She knew it exemplified a great English writing style, but after reading the book, it only gave her the impression of an early 19th century \\"chick-flick\\", targeted for fans of romance novels. The book, however, offered me not only a witty, romantic comedy but also educational and historical values through the realistic depictions of an early 19th century English society.Throughout the whole book, the main characters constantly reminded me of the famous maxim: Don't judge a book by its cover. When the heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, meets the male character, Darcy, she finds him handsome, young and rich; the type of men that any women during her time period would consider to be the perfect husband. But his proud arrogance and aloofness prick her pride, causing her to stubbornly decide to dislike Darcy. This fire of hatred is further fueled along when Wickham, a handsome soldier, wins Liz's heart through his seemingly agreeable personality. Providing her with spiteful lies about Darcy, Wickham helps Liz's prejudice to grow. When the truth is reveled, however, Liz realizes that she had made the wrong impressions about both Darcy and Wickham based upon their exterior behaviors and appearances. In fact, Wickham turns out to be a scandalous liar whose addiction for gambling has broke him poor and Darcy turns out to be a truly noble person who knows how to care for and love those dear to him.In the end, Liz learns to correct her mistake of making misimpression and eventually marries Darcy who loves her for who she really is. This unrealistically happy ending, however, caused me to be aware of the real matrimony system in the early 19th century. The main characters ended happily; a girl from a poor family married the perfect man from a wealthy background due to their true, inseparable love. But other characters showed otherwise. For example, Liz's friend, Charlotte Lucas, agreed to marry Mr. Collins despite the fact that her friend had rejected him a few days ago. No love existed in this marriage obviously, but Charlotte could not have been happier as the marriage had much benefit for her: it saved her from her poor financial status and even from the shame of remaining unmarried at her old age. Just like Charlotte, many lower class women settled to be content with marriages, if they brought them or their families a little benefit.On the other hand, Ms. Bingley and Lady Catherine show how the upper class of the early 19th century married. Ignoring love mostly, both compared Darcy's social class, financial status, and family background to judge if marrying herself (Ms. Bingley's case) or her daughter (Lady Catherine's case) would be the most advantageous combination. In both cases, the source of wealth and power could be traced as the men, whom the women had to depend on and negotiate with to marry as best as they could. Both classes considered greatly the effects on the future and the family that the marriage would bring and the way how these female character perceived marriages proved how the real women during the early 19th century actually married.In conclusion, Pride and Prejudice should not be only read for observing Jane Austen's talent in writing or for mere enjoyment of romantic comedy, but also for development in mature perception and the cultural history that the book offered. Pride and Prejudice is an educational novel that clearly depicts the difficulty in forming perspective about other people and the dangers that could arise when our impressions or senses are trusted too much. It does not only offer an insight into how women of the early 19th century really lived but shows their lifestyle, way of thinking and the harsh reality of the matrimony system."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I've read this book a million times.

The story is set in rural England of early 19th century and is centered around Elizabeth, second daughter of the Bennets, and her evolving relationship with 'proud' Mr Darcy. The author has done an excellent job keeping the pace of the story, while painting excellent character portraits.--A minor note:Some people observe that the name of the county where the military regiment is settled appears as \\"----shire\\" throughout the book. Strange as that may seem, it is not a typographical error; it is actually how it appears in the original (you can check the free online editions of the novel on Project Gutenberg or Google Books). According to an annotated version by David M. Shapard, that was done in purpose by the author to avoid naming a particular county, although the reason is not known for certain."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Enjoyed this more thoroughly than expected.

Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen was PAINFUL to read.PAINFUL!!!!!The book is filled with rich people being super proper. Oh my goodness it was bad.Although a little more than halfway through the book, I did start to enjoy it. Mainly because they stopped being so stuffy and started being a little more real.There were a bunch of funny, underhanded proper comments, similar to something like \\"Why, doesn't she look pretty today?\\" but really meaning that she's super ugly and happens to have made herself look good for this moment.The overall story line: Daughters find people to become their husbands.Done.I just couldn't handle it.But it's a classic and I already know some of you are going to agree with me while others are like shouting at the screen in frustration at my review.So tell me your thoughts on Pride and Prejudice!Thanks for reading,Rebecca @ Love at First Book"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Brilliant writing.

I won't go into detail about the plot, it's a tried and true story, done many times in many forms of movie, I'll cover just a few here. But Mr. Darcy is the epitome of men. A specimen worth lusting over, he is the type of man that all women secretly want. Tall, handsome, and true, he is arrogant, prideful (or not prideful? That's for you to decide), and conceited. He's the type of man that although confident, will make you feel like once he takes you in his arms, you are safe and loved forever. There are many wonderful reasons to read this book, but I believe Mr. Darcy is the main reason women have been reading it for generations.Besides Mr. Darcy, my next favorite characters are Lizzie and her father, a relationship worth noting. They have an affection and understanding betwixt them that is both endearing and enviable. He understands her in a way that most don't and does his best to protect her from her worst enemy, her mother, the one who is always trying to give her away to the first available man. He is commendable. The other daughters are not as noteworthy, obviously Lydia is meant to be childish and annoying and it comes across well. Someone should have slapped that child silly. I almost wish two characters, Mary, the middle sister, and Charlotte, Elizabeth's best friend, had gotten more play. I understand Charlotte was there to represent the many women out there that are sensible and marry for reasons other than love, and so we need her, but it didn't seem fair she got the short end of the stick. And poor Mary, who just wanted to shine in her own way, whether through her demurely moral comments or her piano playing, and was often ignored or rebuffed. I think she had merit and would have liked to see her end up with someone. Alas, it was Elizabeth's story, and more so Mr. Darcy's and so we must focus on them. I absolutely loved it and it was just another example of Austen's genius.[...]"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This book was a nice, romantic novel with lovely descriptions allowing you to transport fully into the story.

Generally, I enjoyed Austen's sense of humor: there were many funny moments. I also found the story's end heartwarming... perhaps I am just a sap, but you should read it and find out!!! I think this would be one of my favorite books so far; I definately want to read more Jane Austen in the coming months!!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have never read another book that kept my attention as constantly as Pride and Prejudice. The novel involves such a vast array of diverse characters all involved in the search for love, whether willingly or unwillingly. Mrs. Bennet's incessant stress of finding a husband for her five daughters is quite a difficult feat. Not only does she want them to have a man for the rest of their lives, but he must be one with much opulence. The need for an attraction between the couple is quite peripheral in the eyes of Mrs. Bennet. However, Elizabeth Bennet, the second-oldest daughter, would rather renounce the popular tradition of marrying solely for wealth. She searches for true love and happiness, and wealth is an added bonus. A very unexpected set of circumstances causes Elizabeth to question Mr. Darcy's love. As their lives continue, Elizabeth reconsiders her initial judgements of Mr. Darcy and other characters. Jane Austen's satirical and ironic comments and situations give the reader great insight into the customs of the early nineteenth century. Austen presents a very tangled web of people and events. The transformation and reactions of the characters from beginning to end is very drastic and presents very sagacious lessons about life. This is a timeless classic that can be enjoyed at anytime. I cannot wait to read it a second time!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The book Pride and Prejudice was a book about love and its consequences. This book tell us about the life of people on the 19th century in England, how they lived and how they felt. It also shows a true story of love, how sometimes pride can be stronger that the love that people feel, and marry for love and not for social status which happen to woman very often back then. Elizabeth Bennet is the second oldest child on her family. She is a strong, intelligent, and a beautiful, independent girl, she makes good judgments of others and must live with the consequences of her prejudice. The best chapter was the last one when Mr. Darcy goes to Elizabeth's house and they tell each other about their feelings, and Mr. Bingley and Jane got together too.

It could happen anywhere, to anyone, at any time.

Elizabeth is a middle-class female with too much pride, and Mr. Darcy is an upper-class male with too much prejudice - or is it vice versa? It appears that both these characters had a little bit of both...Anyway, the characters were very believable, with feelingsand emotions that were surprisingly accurate.Everyone came out a winner in the end. I particularly likedMr. Darcy's reactions (or actions) to Elizabeth's retorts to his proposal. In all cases, they were both right in their own ways. They just needed to get together enough times to finally say what they had been feeling all along. And they do.In the end, it worked out, and oh, did it make me happy!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice was probably one of the first novels I read during this time period. The first time I read it, I was amazed by the eloquent but simple writing of Jane Austen. The second time I read it, I was astounded by the way the charactors were portrayed. The third time I read it, I was blown away by the plot, and the rich detials and descriptions that surrounded her story. Since then, every time I read it I am more and more captivated by the certain truthfulness and plain exertion of human nature. The writing is of incredible quality. I would say that this novel is one of the best I have ever read, second only to Les Miserables."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"After reading this book I thought that if the early 19th century had soap operas, they would be a little like this. I thought I was going to be bored but I was quickly proven wrong. The best parts of the book is when Elizabeth is around Mr. Darcy (you'll see why). I found Mrs. Bennett (Elizabeth's mother) to have a sort of comic role(you might agree with me). And the juicy secrets revealed later in the book will have your jaw wide open. By the end of the book you'll fall in love with the charactors and you might be tempted to read it again (I know I did). There is a reason why this is Jane Austen's most widely read and most loved book: It's just entertaining reading!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The story is a little bit complicated at the beginning because of the many protagonists introduced but in the end it is quite remarkable and gives you some insight into the life of the English landed entry.When you have read this book and and also understood its content, you will agree that it has been worth reading even if it is only for the language used. Since I have really enjoyed it, I would give it top marks."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I want to recommend you this novel,\\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Have you ever heard \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and \\"Jane Austen\\"? I read it two times, last year and early this year. It's very interesting for me to read this book.Jane Austen lived small village so her view about world is limited and her works mainly deal with marriage. A model example is 'Pride and Prejudice'.There are many character in the novel. Many man character and woman character enter the story. At first, each person misunderstand each other but they remove misunderstanding and finally many man and woman character fall in love each other. The story is happy ending.Many character point the other man's mistake but they don't know their mistake. They realize that they made a misunderstanding, they begin to know themselves mistake. I think many people make a mistake like the character's mistake. I also the same so I read this novel and realized many things. I presume that maybe the novel teach you many things.The novel show character of realism. Generally realism literary work explain everything in details. 'Pride and Prejudice' is the same. Writer explain everything very detailed so people said that realism literary work is limited people's imagination. I don't agree with that because I think that the more detailed writer describe, the more detailed we image. For example, if the writer describe like that \\"There are a table and chair and a flower vase and so on.\\", I can image like that \\"maybe the table color is black and chair color is same, and.. maybe the flower are rose and forget-me-not. So I think realism literary works can make us more imaginative, just my opinion.I recommend 'Pride and Prejudice'. I'm sure that you'll be intersted in this novel and Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice was the book that introduced me to Jane Austen. I find the love story between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth simply irresistible. Will they get together? That kept me in agony. I have to admit that it was hard to follow at times, but it still kept me in suspense. It is so obvious that today's female (and some male) writers emulate Austen's writing, writing touching romantic comedies. This is definitely one of the books that I'm proud to keep on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The portrayal of Elizabeth and Darcy's love affair although not truly noticable was very strong and forgiving. Neither knew that they had feelings for the other until a rash judgement was made on both sides. Elizabeth declines the hand of her cousin Mr. Collins and therefore goes against the customs of the time period. Elizabeth defies most traditional customs when it comes to men. She wants to marry for love not money, or anything else. This novel keeps the reader interested and wanting more. Jane Austen is a superb author."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This was a really good book, although there was some confusing description at some points. It's about the daughters of the Bennet family, Elizabeth and Jane in particular. The courtships of Elizabeth and Darcy and Jane and Mr. Bingley are the focus of the novel. Jane Austen does a good job of describing the romances because the dialog for the most part is easy to understand."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This book has humor, drama, romance. Everything I love to read in a good old fashioned story. If you have never read Jane Austen you don't know what you are missing. Even my husband was a convert after Pride and Prejudice!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"A classic that remains relevant in any century. The ultimate book on romance. It is tryly timeless and the characters of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett will have you rooting for them throughout.A book that may be read a dozen times without ever losing its charm."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is one of the very few &quot;classics&quot; that I can honestly say I enjoyed. Most of them, I hate to admit, I find difficult to comprehend and relate to, but not this one. The dialogue was its greatest strength; it was so incredibly real! This book is so rich in its use of the English language. Pride and Prejudice is truly an enriching reading experience, and one that is guaranteed to be enjoyed over and over again. I just finished my sixth reading ... I can't wait for my seventh!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a fun, descriptive book. I used to think that was an oxymoron but it's not! Fun, descriptive books actually exist. This book is enthralling because I am able to relate to the characters."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is my favorite Austen book, beating out my second-favorite, Emma, by maybe half a mile! Every character is believable and human, and perhaps more importantly, can be understood by those of us of modern times.Elizabeth is entirely lovable because she is NOT entirely perfect. She has a penchant for mischief and irony that she has obviously inherited or absorbed from her wonderfully eccentric and hilarious father, and a slightly over-developed sense of her own worth that springs from her highly and consciously intelligent observation of all the folks that share her corner of the planet. But she is also wonderfully honest and capable of eating crow when she sees the error of her assumptions.Although this is a beautiful glimpse into the ways and mores of a very different age, it is also a timeless human drama, loaded with subtle humor."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This book is charming and i love when the author describe the old houses with appletrees, wild flowers and all that stuff. There's really something about Austen... ....what ever it is.

Someone broke into the car and tried to steal the radio but was not able to--but they did get away with this audio tape. Now, I know there is a car thief somewhere in this area listening to Pride and Prejudice, and I hope they enjoy it.I compare this book with a comfort food. For me, it is a comfort book. When I have nothing else to read (seldom) and don't want to read any more murder mysteries or genre fiction, I reach for this book as it always brings me joy and pleasure."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have just read a description of this book calling it boring, and hard to comprehend, very far from the truth. As a highschool student, I had to read this in my leisure time, b/c it is a lightweight classic. It has so many great characters. Subtle hints of sarcasm, and the stereotypical attitude of some characters, give the story a comical twinge. However, if you do decide to read this for a class, I personally think the story is most interesting as far as plot and drama goes, and unless the class is bent on feminist views, I found it hard to extract any valued literary elements."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I absolutely loved this book!!!! I don't understand how anyone could call it boring. Granted, the people in the books talk a little much and sometimes I'm just like 'Get on with it' but I've sort of learned to skim those parts. This book is a comedy making fun of the English society in the early 1800s. It's making the womens'(woman's?) quest for a good future into a vicious man-hunt and it's hilarious. I agree that there was not enough written out dialogue. I really would've liked the scene with Elizabeth and Darcy played out a little more. But it's a GREAT!!! GREAT!! WONDERFUL!! book. Read it!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"SHE:a very opinionated young lady with the promise of youth and love, yet coming from a family unwelcomed in the real society. a woman with a unique shyness but great dignity and spirit, with an inner beauty that would amaze his soul and imprint her face in his heart.

It should be, considering it has been a classic for so many years--it was written in 1813! But some people are pushed away by classics for just being &quot;classics&quot;--don't be pushed away from this! I'll be honest, I first discovered this story on &quot;Wishbone.&quot; It was my favorite episode. I decided to read it after finishing &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; and aching for another great book. This is it! It has wonderful characters that you fall in love with, a wonderful love story, and insights that really make you think about . . . pride and prejudice of all things. It's wonderfully written, and it's fun to try to get used to the different usage of English. Read it!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Like many people, I had heard of Pride and Prejudice but never cared to read it. Well, for anyone who is considering reading the book, I full-heartily recomend it to you. I previously just finished the book, and Jane Austen did a fabulous job captivating my attention and suspicions whether Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet ever truly get together. The latter is prejudiced against the handsome and &quot;supposively&quot; haughty Mr. Darcy, so until she realizes the truth does her opinion alter. Jane Austen adds humor to the story and created well-balanced characters which arouse much interest with the reader. An exceptionally written and intriguing story which anyone who has never read should."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"As much as I would like to, I don't reread books as a rule, even the most favorite, because life is short and there are a billion books to go before we sleep. I do make an exception for PRIDE AND PREJUDICE however. It is a masterpiece, a guiltless entertainment. There are lots of laughs, some melodrama and romance which make it easy to knock back, like chocolate or a good wine. There is, of course, much more to it, which makes it more than an indulgence. Austen gets so much right: she sets up a entire world and explains exactly how it works, what happens when it tips to its own excesses or when its players break its rules. You could pitch a hardball at her window and it would bounce off, shattering nothing, that's how strong and clear it is. She gets romantic love right, as well as all the mistakes everyone makes trying to get it right. She spears bad behavior and holds it up on a stick. She is very witty but never casual. She burns up the page with truth-about her society, family interactions, human nature and the fact that no matter how civilized we become, we as a species are still at square one when it comes to managing the heart. I see that some younger readers don't appreciate the depths this novel or its relevance for contemporary life: maybe it's the way it is being (not) taught, but it could also be that readers have to be ready to appreciate the idea of an insular world that can bear timeless truths, and for younger adolescents, the world as yet has no edges but truth is limited to immediate circumstances."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is an enjoyable love story first and foremost but it is also an interesting commentary on the way that society used to look at the institution of mairage along with role of women with in that same society. The storyline is augmented by wonderful characters such as the witty Mr Bennet and the rediculus Mr.Collins. I very much enjoyed reading this book and would readily recomend it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"When I was a young teen, a freind of my mother's had the 6 volume BBC movie version of this novel, but we never saw all of the episodes. Now, I am twenty, and I only wonder why I waited so long to read it. There were truly moments when I wanted to scream, laugh, and heave a sigh from the core of my innards. The book, and this is meant to be a compilement, is like a good Beatles song...deceptively simple, but rings so true and real, it can't help but tap into something very critical to the human experience. I recommend to all women, and all sensitive men. Also, women who come from families with all sisters will have a strong nostalgic reation (I sure did.)"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austin is the first author that I have ever read all of her books and this is the first one that I read. I fell in love with this book and I have never found another one that quite compares with it's imapact. Maybe I am a hopeless romantic but i believe that things like this could have happened, and might still happen now! I mean you really never can tell. For example, in the beginning the main character meets the person that is to be her husband later in the book, and their intial meeting is not one of desriable happenings. Elizabeth sees Mr. Darcy as a arrogant and rude. He in turn sees her in the beginning as plain, except for her eyes, but he later developes feelings for her which mature throughout the novel. On her side the feelings mature as well...."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen's classic, Pride and Prejudice, is perhaps my favorite book of all time. Miss Austen's trademark wit and whimsy style of writing is appealing to readers of all ages, even to a modern teen like me. I find something, many things, to relate to within the main character, Elizabeth Bennet, as I, like she, \\"[takes] delight in anything ridiculous.\\" Since the moment I read that infamous line: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged......\\" I have considered myself to be a firm and loyal Janeite, joining the ranks of thousands of hopeless romantics and head-strong women whom only hope to one day find their Mr. Darcy.Between the playfulness of Miss Bennet and the comically formalness of Mr. Darcy lies a classic lesson to be learned. Originally, Jane Austen thought to name this tale \\"First Impressions\\", as the moral of the story lies within the importance of not relying on just that. Lizzie Bennet's fatal --- or perhaps only --- flaw is her characteristic quickness to judgement, which nearly cost her the love of her life. Although by the end of the story one is almost always in love with Darcy, his personality at the beginning of the story is purposefully icy and rigid, depicting him as the perfect example of an excess of pride. By the end of the tale, however, Darcy stands proud as perhaps the most romantic hero of all time.Prepare to be \\"bewitched body and soul\\" by the whit and wisdom and Miss Austen, perhaps the most perfect romantic author of all time. In addition, plan to be enchanted by the playfulness of Lizzie, charmed by the misadventure of Darcy, rendered speechless by the nerve and lack of tact within the Mrs. Bennet, charmed by the sweetness of Jane and Bingley, enraged by both Miss Bingley and Lady Catherine, and most of all, infuriated by the ridiculousness and insufferability of Lydia and Kitty. There is always something to take from a story so perfect and so classic as this. I make it a point to return to it's familar story at least once a month. This beautifully penned tale only stands to prove that Love, more often than not, will be not so easily defeated."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I recently finished reading Pride and Prejudice for the sixth time and can honestly say it was better than it ever has been before. The first reading, in high school, was a little rough. Since then, this book has grown on me each time (silly to say, since it is my FAVORITE book and the only one I have re-read as often). The humor is fantastic, the characters are both wonderful and suited so well to the time period, and Mr. Darcy is a classic \\"leading man\\". Who doesn't want to find the modern day version of Mr. Darcy?"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It has been one of my favourites for years.

The witty back and forth dialogues and characters created an amazinig atmosphere of intelligent and quirky people. Though the book does not give the reader an idea of what was happening historically at that time, that is part of what makes it a timeless classic. One gets a very good idea of what it was like to live in that time, but without the history it makes it open to all audiences.

I'm hoplessly romantic, and I love the different conflicts, the interesting and independent characters, the plot twists, and the happily ever after at the end. Elizabeth Bennet is an independent, youthful, clever, and witty young woman in the eighteen hundreds. She is my favorite character in the novel, and has a wonderful spunky nature that keeps the book alive. The characters are fully formed and realistic, from beautiful Jane to the hilarious Mrs. Bennet. This is, by far, the best Jane Austen book ever published, and recommend it very strongly for anyone starting to read eighteenth and nineteenth century literature."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have no right to review Jane Austen.

Never had I read such a book that made me feel like I was the heroine, yet as I turned the pages of the book, I didn't feel like I was in my small town in California, I felt like I was actually Elizabeth and I actually was in love with Darcy!

I bought a hard copy edition but never took time to read it, just kept watching that movie. Kindle had a free edition, I said what the heck and I loaded it. Knowing the story already, I delved into the book. Happy was I to see that the movie was almost totally in sync with the book! I absolutely love the story.

Sure the language is verbose & flowery , But Never has one book spawned hundreds of cookie cutter wannabees. Nothing will ever compare to the wonder that is this book. Jane Austen was a people watcher,I'll bet. As a writer, Jane Knew how to get under the characters skin to bare their souls of what mattered to them. What still matters to us.It was a satire of the times. Middle Class Women had to marry well because if they didn't they would be homeless or working at the lowest of jobs.So,alot of times they married the first dude that asked them to dance.I think Jane saw how unhappy the women surrounding her were in marraiges without any common ground or affection.She also explores the intricities of marriage and how differant personalities date and eventually marry. For some love for starts like a raging fire only to evaporate in middle age, for some love seems to elude them for no good reason ,and for others it comes softly at the strangest time. Some couples are dear friends, some roommates,others HAD TO GET MARRIED.Above all ,Ms. Austen shows us that Love can be savage,beautiful,tragic ,sudden,brutal,frightening,awkward,exciting,mysterious and confusing. That, my friends will never change.If this isn't enough reason to read this book, At least check it out for Lizzy Bennet and her well meaning,goofy mother, who loves playing matchmaker. Even though she is bad at it.Lizzy is everywoman. The men want to date her and women want to be like her."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I love this book...it is a look into the window of how people use to behave in such a comical fashion."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Dearest Readers of the century first and twentyith,I prooffer my highest and most esteemed recommendation of this fine book. Be not intimidated by formal British writing style of nearly 200 years ago, the occasional serpentine sentence, and words not oft' seen since the SAT exams (if at all). You will be highly rewarded with a most engaging story, skilled character development, and above all, acerbic wit. I trust you will be as delighted as this reviewer to have the felicity of reading this book.Very truly yours...P.S. Any 21st century western female reading this book will likely be as relieved as I am that we no longer live in a society where property conveys automatically to men, and women are totally dependent on men for their support. It's easy to understand why one character married for money and security only, and why the protognist's mother was completely obssessed with marrying off her daughters."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a great read and Jane Austen is a gifted writer whose development of likable characters will be enjoyed for still more generations. It is hard at first to adjust to the language of the 1800s but is well worth the effort. Once the story begins to unfold you will not want to put it down. I also highly recommend Mansfield Park also by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice was an excellent novel because of its distinct feminine superiority. Elizabeth Bennet, being the heroine in the novel, was a great character to whom women can relate. Her clever, independent quallities are what makes Elizabeth such an admirable character. My favorite chapter would be chapter eleven, volume two. This chapter is when Mr. Darcy proposes to Lizzy, and he expresses his feelings to her for the first time. Thisis my favorite chapter because of the way Lizzy refuses Mr. Darcy's proposal. She wasn't intimidated by Mr. Darcy's arrogance and his billowing attitude or his wealth. Not only did she decline his offer of marriage, but she criticized him for all his faults of pride and prejudice. This book is appropriate for ages fifteen and up because of its complex speech. The one literary device that I appreciate was irony. I found it ironic that a prideful, arrogant man would fall in love with an independent, strong willed woman. It was ironic that Elizabeth could see Mr. Darcy's faults of pride and prejudice but not see it in herself. Austen was able to use this irony to create the plot of the story. I enjoyed this novel because of the way it was written, the characters, and the relationship between the characters, especially the relationship between Mr. Dary and Elizabeth. The way that Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth despise each other at the beginning and later realized their true feelings for each other was very romantic. It was an explicit novel that I believe anybody who enjoys reading would enjoy."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"An abundance of pride and prejudice inflicted on the two main characters, Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet, is the main obstacle of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; by Jane Austen. The actions of the novel revolve around the central characters who undergo tremendous changes to overcome their faults. Mr. Darcy is accused of having such a pride that he could not believe Elizabeth appropriate enough to barely be in his presence. From then on, Elizabeth formed harsh judgments about Mr. Darcy and his personality. Their first impressions of one another clung to them so deeply that establishing a relationship was all the more heartwarming. The actions of the novel, between not only Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, but with the entire Bennet family and other acquaintances, kept me wanting to read on for more. My heart was into each character and I could not wait to find out more about their relations. I felt myself laughing and, at times, talking out loud because of the actions of the novel. I remained in suspense throughout, which made the events more enjoyable. I cannot wait for the opportunity to read &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; again in my free time. I highly recommend the novel to anyone in search of a plot and a love for characters to read the amazing writing of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The novel Pride and Prejudice written by Jane Austen merits praise even with the high expectations I contained for it. In the first few paragraphs, I was confronted with flighty gossip and lacy trifles that were rather discouraging considering that I had expected something more profound. Yet as the novel progressed, the flowery language had a zing to it that amuses a person as it pokes fun at those with immense wealth in nineteenth century English society and at the traditions that were upheld. The Bennett family holds the attention of the readers in this novel, especially the women, as they deal with society's regulations regarding entailment. The fact that a male heir does not exist in the Bennett family causes Mrs. Bennett to become anxious to marry her five daughters off to men with fortunes. The aspect of the novel that truly provides the reader with contentment resides in the moral development of two of the main characters. The character flaws that exist within Miss Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy are discovered, examined, and steadily coached until both can live more fully. I appreciate this fine piece of literature for the magnificent writing syle that Austen utilized and the clever character development that she employed."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I'm ashamed to admit it, but I only picked this up after watching the latest excellent BBC adaptation of Jane Austen's now-ubiquitous 'Pride and Prejudice'.Let me preface this review by saying that this is a novel like no other - it's Little Women with Declaritive Sentences, it's Gone With The Wind without the Overstatement. The story of the five Bennett sisters in their quest to make good marriages is as entertaining as it is relevant, and Austen's acerbic and subtle humour still shine today.Eliza Bennett has a problem. She is the only independant sister in a family of five girls, ruled by a weatherbeaten Father and a hyperactive Mother. She wishes to marry for love, and love alone, but times are hard, and if she does not marry for money, she will be poor, as her father's estate is entailed away to his only nephew, the connsumately hideous Clergyman, Mr. Collins. She meets and falls in immediate Hate with the snobbish, upper-class Mr. Darcy, and through a series of mishaps, revelations and balls, she discovers that he is not the man she first suspected him to be.Austen shows an almost unnatural intelligence with her prose. She is the definitive social commentator, and slips her jokes and judgements into her writing with such subtlety, that you forget she's doing it at all. Unlike Louisa M. Alcott's heavy-handed Christian-Morals littered about 'Little Women', Austen's morals are of a markedly more subtle nature. Truly ahead of her time, and an early feminist, her writing advocates independance for women, and shows clearly the faults and idiosyncrasies of men and silly women - a refreshing change for the period. Even today, her caustic protrayals of Mrs. Bennett, a woman as mercenary in her dealings with marriage as she is socially embarrassing, Lady Catherine DeBourgh, a wealthy, if somewhat inbred, dowager, and Mr. Collins, a greasy and truly venal human being, ring true as vivid and relevant descriptions of how to be an Idiot. The opposite can be said of her central character, Elizabeth Bennett. Clearly a semi-autobiographical heroine, Austen has created in Eliza an independant and intelligent heroine, but tempers this with several character flaws (the most notable being the titular 'Pride') to produce a young woman of believable depth and character.Her plot is long-winded and drawn-out, but, thanks to Austen's wonderful gift for making characters interesting as well as whole, it never once loses pace; instead, it becomes a joy to read. Her Cast Of Thousands each have a distinct part to play in uniting Elizabeth with her true love, and however small that part, Austen ensures they do it with memorable gusto.All in all, I urge everyone to read this novel. However, I think it's best read after seeing the TV adaptations, because while good, they cannot even begin to show the depth and intelligence of this novel. You'll appreciate Austen all the more after 'Pride and Prejudice'."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; by Jane Austen is a classic that is well worth reading. The descriptions of the characters and their interactions with one another truly make this book enjoyable and unique.The book centers on the developing relationship between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. They start out disliking one another, but as the story unfolds, they begin to see each other in a different light. Soon, respect for one another develops and eventually a love that is greater than either have ever hoped to experience.The setting for this book is 18th century England, where there is a separation of classes: upper class, middle class, and lower class. Elizabeth Bennet is from a respecatble, middle class family, whereas Fitzwilliam Darcy is from a very notable, upper class family. Mr. Darcy sees any alliance between him or his friend, Mr. Bingley, and the Bennet family, as highly reprehensible in the beginning. Elizabeth's oldest sister, Jane, is in love with Mr. Bingley and believes Mr. Bingley to be in love with her as well. Mr. Darcy does not want his friend having any connection with the Bennet family, so he takes it upon himself to separate his friend from Jane and believes himself to be in the right to do so. This upsets Elizabeth greatly and she refuses to have anything to do with Mr. Darcy, if she can help it. Fate had something else in mind, though, and they kept getting thrown together.The interactions between these two characters were, at times, very humorous. Jane Austen developed them in such a way that I had to keep turning the page to find out what was going to happen next. She definitely did not disappoint my curiosity in wanting to know how everything would eventually turn out for the characters.British Broadcasting Company, in partnership with Arts &amp; Entertainment television, produced the movie, &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, starring Colin Firth as Fitzwilliam Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet. I was so impressed with this movie after watching it on television, that I immediately went out and bought it. It stayed with the book for the most part and really brought Jane Austen's characters to life. It helped me to understand her characters and their situations even more.This is definitely a book I would recommend to most anyone who is looking for a great, romantic classic to read. It is my favorite book of all time and I look forward to reading it many more times throughout my life."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Some might feel that Pride and Prejudice is just a feminine romance novel, but to me this book was much more. The words and language in the book were mesmorizing. I believe Meg Ryan put it perfectly when she said, \\"I get caught up in the language, words like felicity and thither.\\"(You've Got Mail, 1998) Considering Jane Austen's formal education ended at age nine, Pride and Prejudice proves that America as a whole has been \\"dumbing-down\\" their children. I feel Pride and Prejudice is a timeless literary classic."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"this is definately an amazing piece of literature. i love it now, and will with no doubt still love it in the years to come. i believe it to be flawless, and Jane Austen deserves all the credit in the world for this book. what more needs to be said...it is my favorite book..EVER! i place it above the rest, and truly believe there is no comparison. the fact that it has endured the test of time, and has been enjoyed by generation after generation speaks volumes. Elizabeth and Darcy come to life, and simply jump out of the text. no praise i can offer will completely do this masterpiece justice, so i urge you to read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"At first, I had no desire to read 'Pride and Prejudice,' I thought that it would be drivel like so many other romance novels are. After the insistence of friends, I finally gave in and read it. While reading the first few pages, I was sceptical, but soon I was hooked. I couldn't put this book down and even though I knew what was going to happen, I still was intrigued and enthralled.For those of you who haven't read this book, you are missing out on a lighthearted, romantic treat. It is intelligent and fun and the characters are extremely likeable. I now consider it to be one of my favourite books.Also, if you haven't seen the film version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, you need to see it. It may be about 6 hours long but it doesn't feel long at all. The book and the film are great companions."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the first Regency romances ever written and still perhaps the best. This witty and complex novel features delightful characters, nonstop comic observations, clever dialogue and fast paced development of an excellent plot. Besides being a thoroughly entertaining read, Pride and Prejudice raises questions about appearance versus reality, society versus the individual and the nature of true love that still resonate deeply with us today. Elizabeth Bennet is one of the most complex, lively and fascinating heroines ever created, and her growing romance with the highly intelligent, proud and magnetic Fitzwilliam Darcy is one of the most compelling ever written. This is a seminal novel that no lover of romance-or student of human nature-should ever miss."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is a must read. All the senior English classes at my high school watched the BBC movie. Everybody loved the movie. Even the boys. Everybody I know has either read the book since (or read it again in some circumstances) or has plans to read it as soon as they get a chance. The characters are perfect as well as all the description. The entire book is, in a word, perfect. Read It. Watch the movie. Fall in love with Jane Austen (like I have). I am now in the processing of reading all of Austen's novels."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This book would be perfect for a coffee table. No one would ever with to talk about it. When I read it in high school I thought it to be the most boring book I ever read. I didn't care about all the people trying to be married, etc. I just found this book to be an upper class soap opera. Anyone who likes upper class, sappy, drawn out scenes of lovers trying to get each others attention can read this book and be enthralled. For the rest of us, I would recommend you read a modern romance novel. ALL modern romance novels would be better than this, even if written by William Shatner."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I tried to read it, but I couldn't. I put it down at about page 100. From a fan of IMMANUEL KANT, this was too boring. Honestly, after I put it down, I had to study the Diamond Sutra and the Book of Job to get the vapid feeling out of my head. Someone on here wrote something to the effect of \\"as Blake saw the world in a grain of sand, so did Austen see the world in a drawing room\\". To this, I'd say that there is a vast difference in seeing the world in a drawing room, and thinking that the world IS a drawing room.Basically, it felt way too narrow for me. I will admit that I dislike British culture, as a whole, and have yet to make it through a third Dickens novel (have tried four). Still, I am a huge fan of Fielding, Defoe, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Wordsworth, and like a few other English authors."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"And I was very disappointed with 'Pride and Prejudice', which I read by choice. It did not offer anything I would expect from a good book: surprise, pleasure (intellectual as well as emotional), humor (the character of Mr. Bennet being an exception), new ideas or meaningful information. After finishing the book I ran to a bookstore and traded it for a second-hand copy of 'A House for Mr. Biswas'. Maybe this time..."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"My wife says that this is her favourite novel of all time. I could not disagree more. Turgid. Dull. Truly awful prose. Surely nobody ever spoke like these utterly implausible characters. Literary mogadon. Don't bother."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I had to read this book in my Final Year at High School and I didn't like it one bit, Now it is 25 years later and I re read it and I still didn't like it the second time around. This would have to be one of the most overrated novels ever published and in no way deserves it's title as a so called \\"Classic Of Modern Literature\\". The plot concerns a mother, Mrs. Bennet whose sole purpose in life is to see her daughters married. That's it. End of story and yet Ms. Austin takes several hundred pages to repeat this Theme Ad Nauseam.One has to remember that this book was written in a time when the only four things to do at night were get drunk, sleep, read or make love and some people did all 4 of these things in one lonely night!!!Ms. Austin takes full advantage of this and decides she has a story worth telling which is without plot, believable characters or any hint of suspense or excitement. As the writer Mario Puzo once said \\"Why would anybody with a Beach House and a VCR choose to read Proust?\\"Amen to that.Throw away your sleeping pills and try to read this book instead."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I had to read this book for my english class because my teacher believed that it would make us better students all around.

It gets tiresome, even before you finish it.It's too bad there's no zero star rating."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I HATED THIS BOOK. I READ IT IN HIGH SCHOOL, ABOUT 9 YEARS AGO AND I STILL REMEMBER HOW MUCH I HATE THE PUFFY PATHETIC NARRATIVE OF WHINY WOMEN IN WANT OF HUSBANDS. It is with deep anguish that I note that there are books on how to teach this book in classes, thereby continuing the legacy of pain to innocent students of this day and age."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This book may be considered a &quot;classic&quot; but it isn't. It may deal with &quot;emotions&quot; and &quot;the human spirit&quot; but it lacks the qualities of true literature. To be blunt, the book is boring. There is too much description and not enough meat. The story seems to be leading somewhere, and when you get there, you wonder why you took the journey in the first place. I plead to the human race not to let writers get off this easy by writing such unfulfilling books.

Piece of advice for everybody who's forced to read this: buy CliffsNotes. This book is not worth wasting your time on.

I don't want to give any hints to future readers, so I'll just say that Mr._______ was...well, I can't find the words to fully describe, so it will be up to you as the readers to find out yourself! The book was realistic and I thought the eighteenth century English language to be fully enchanting. I think my most favorite parts were when Elizabeth refuses to marry Mr.Collins, her cousin (YUCK!), and her discussion with Lady Catherine deBourgh! I was literally sitting at the edge of my chair while reading certain parts, and I must admit, falling asleep at others (though these parts were short and well worth it)!

The critical introductions for Pride and Prejudice in both World's Oxford Classics and Penguin, by Isobel Armstrong and Vivien Jones respectively, do follow this trend and tend to overlook the rigours of feminist criticism, as appeared in Marilyn Butler's Jane Austen and the War of Ideas. As a post-revolutionary romance, Pride and Prejudice provides a reflection of political events, but this theme is only secondary to the critique of class and gender conventions, and which is only indirectly related to political conditions.The use of silence, or the withholding of information, as a narrative strategie to produce the complications in the plot that go to make up the story, follows from this indirect association. Another important theme in the novel is the difference between public and private space. The exchanges of information (gossip, if you may) between the characters, particularly between Elizabeth and her relatives and friends, reveal a society in which individual worth and reputation is decided by rumour. When rumour is too strong, this is, shared by many, it may not be worth one's while to attempt to change it even if it is found to be false. It is for this reason that Wickham is allowed to fulfil his mania for elopement and achieve a suitable marriage.It is no surprise that a society so concerned with opinion should be given to prejudice, this is, the conversion of uninformed unfavourable opinion into a general judgement. Prejudice is by no means to be seen as a privilege of the aristocratic class. The community at Longbourn are seen to be equally capable of misjudging and misrepresenting character, in particular Mr Darcy's.Elizabeth's one aristocratic feature in her character is her general dissatisfaction with everything she sees. Her critical gaze links her to the aristocratic crew that she meets and alienates her from her surroundings. But if she wants to become one with Darcy's \\"family party\\" it is precisely this quality that she is to tame. By looking at Pemberley's grounds, she learns to express her own (sensuous) satisfaction with things as they are.Elizabeth's sensual gaze has been educated through the novel in a process of humiliation and denial. It is when she accepts the humbling experience of Charlotte's wedding and goes to visit the Collins' that she learns to appreciate the stately fixity of Rosings and starts to give the appropriate steps to becoming Darcy's consort.In the words of Isobel Armstrong in the Oxford World's Classics \\"Introduction\\": \\"it is through the uncomfortable limits of sexual signals that the novel indirectly explores a deep political question: when is it right to conceal or to reveal information; when isit right to speak out?\\" Nevertheless, this question is in the novel less political than gender and class- based.\\"Female elegance\\", according to Mr Collins, consists in \\"rejecting a man on the first application\\". Affectation is taken for granted among women, which poses a problem for women who, like Elizabeth, wish to decline a proposal in spite of their economic need. Twenty years had scarcely passed after the publication of Mary Wollstonecraft's Vindication of the Rights of Women, and it is characteristic of the peculiar genius of Jane Austen that she had already produced the first post-feminist heroine, a woman capable of turning the issue of marriage into an unselfish and pleasurable conquest - unselfish, because by marrying Darcy Elizabeth establishes her family socially, and pleasurable, because in accepting the stately home of Pemberley she fully reconciles herself to the sensuousness of life -."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This book has well earned it's reputation as wonderful, but I would be much more inclined to place it in the romance section of the library than alongside Civil Disobedience and Wuthering Heights. Hold on, don't turn red just yet. My reasoning is such: this book was well thought out, much considered and had a depth of plot and characterization that I thought was approaching immaculate. The title was appropriate: this book is about pride and prejudice IN RELATION TO HAPPINESS, and only that. Austen dosn't go farther; she dosn't explore the depths beyond treading the seashore of what COULD HAVE been. We were only allowed to \\"dip our toe in the slough\\" for forty or fifty pages, until pride was rebuked, the truth was told and love recovered. Something more is required of a book than following the realms of happiness. \\"Suffering - perhaps that hasn't been properly looked at.\\" A classic must give something more, but this was a wonderful, heartfelt read! Put it between sessions of Bronte and Dostoevsky!For those who have read W & P and Pride and Prejudice: Tolstoy killed Andrei - Austen should have killed Darcy!

But I felt uncomfortable with the underlying assumption that a woman's ultimate fulfillment is to marry a rich and gorgeous man. Of course it has very strong female characters, and was a very progressive novel for its time. The fact that it is still so popular makes me wonder how far we have come.

Jane Austen uses impeccable, meticulous language full of long descriptions and explanations to give the reader insight into the minds of all the characters. The character development indicates the author's striking understanding of human nature and acute observation of human tendencies. The story provides an intricate plot involving the intertwining lives and feelings of a few characters and is based more on character development than on actual events. Although the book is complex and somewhat wordy, it is interesting and not all that difficult to read. The story shows how individual tendencies and personalities can get in the way of love and happiness. It also adeptly portrays inter-family relationships and the profound impact they can have. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in classic fiction, or who enjoys stories about people and their relationships with one another."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Honestly folks, did you really enjoy reading this book?

If you're under 21, or like to have fun with the books you read, stay away...stay away"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The book was in excellent condition.

I always like to get a head start. First of all, I was very pleased with how fast I recieved the novel (Even under standard shipping). It was delivered earlier than I expected. Then once I started reading it I realized it was full of humor and I was eager to read the next chapter just to see how the plot would unfold. I would recomend this book and amazon.com to all readers who are looking for a no hassle way to keep up with your reading."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is full of fluff and is nothing more than an old-fashioned soap opera. I found the characters very one dimensional, and could not develop an opinion about them. I felt Austen shoved the opinion at us, instead of forming our own. The way she presented the matters of pride and prejudice was very trivial and predictable. It is certainly not worth its hype. I do not recommend."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is not a good recording. Too much noise andthe voice sounds muffled.

I made a list of a dozen or so and have had mixed results so far.I think that my expectations were too high, I was expecting something like Jane Eyre, which I loved. Unfortunately I found 'Pride and Prejudice' a little too frivolous for my tastes.Perhaps if I had known what I was getting before I started I would have been less disappointed? It felt like a fluffy romance novel, which I do not in general care for. I love a good love story, part of why I loved Jane Eyre.Maybe if it had been called 'Pretty Girls Out Husband Hunting' or 'Lydia Lands In a Jam' or something equally silly I would have known what I was in for.Maybe this wasn't the best first Jane Austen novel to read?I'm not sure if I will be reading another.Okay, I know that 655 of you loved this and many of you will have to give me a negative vote because we don't agree...So, let the negative votes begin *winces*."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I purchased this recording (read by Lindsay Duncan) through the iTunes store (something I will not be doing again), on the understanding that it was an unabridged recording. This is one of my favorite books, and I know it well enough to realize when sentences are being left out, which happened in several places (I did double-check with my print edition). At least one of the omitted sentences was important for understanding the characters.The other quibble I have is that the recording I purchased consisted of two SIX HOUR tracks. Heaven help you if you lose your place while using an mp3 player.I cannot dis-recommend this recording enough."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Vapid and pompous! Despite the clever rhetoric, the plot and characters are simply too shallow, predictable and archetypical. Yes, this novel is a classic, and an original of the romance genre, but that doesn't make up for the fact that it, in fact, is romance genre: WAY to simplistic.Couldn't stand the book, not when I read it at 20 and not when I gave it another chance at 49. Disappointing because I loved the movie \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" (with Kate Winslet, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman), so I thought I would like the author.And yes, I do love Dickens. Despite her myriad adoring fans, in my opinion, Jane Austen's writing lacks depth and cannot truly be compared to Dickens."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Did anyone else wish they lived in Regency England after reading this book?

If I could write well enough to do the book justice, I wouldn't be a programmer, but I can say that it satisfies my craving for &quot;romantic slop&quot; without being in the least sloppy, and it entertains with both low comedy and keen perception. But my favorite feature of the book is what I've heard described as the &quot;comic precision&quot; of the speech of the characters. It would take a week of polishing to utter a single such phrase, and the idea of a group of people bantering effortlessly in this manner fills me with delight. And to the high school kid that said it wasn't &quot;profound&quot; enough: I might have said the same thing 25 years ago, but now the books that I thought profound then seem obvious, tedious, and/or pompous.

It made me laugh and made want to tell the chracters what I feel about the problem. I think everyone should read this book. I loved how all Bennet daughters are so indepent do what most well brought up women don't do. I also think Elizabeth is great heroin. the only thing I didn't like about the book is that the famly is so worried about the father dying and he doesn't even die. So what was the use of worrying. I also feel that Jane Austen was a great author and really wrote what womwn felt during the time when very few women wrote. What do men know what women feel. What gave men the right to write when they don't even know what women felt during that time. But I feel now that women and men are egual. To end this review I feel it is a great novel and that you can really feel what the chracters felt. It's a great novel............................ So just read it!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is my favorite book of all time - I love rereading it.

I love the part when she is confronted by the Aunt and all her responses. She is sharp to the point and remains a Lady."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I enjoyed this e-book very much because I have seen versions of the film and TV presentations and reading the book gives a more indepth study of the writing style of Jane Austen. The film and TV presentations couldn't include everything in the book such as a study of each main character. You must read the book slowly to enjoy her usage of words or you will miss the message because there are so many words to describe an event, person, scene, experience, etc. This book is very similar to a Harry Potter book - you need to read it more than once to capture the little things lead to something bigger. She gets you involved with her characters and you feel for them and you might even cry with them."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"If you were a proper English mother at the time of Jane Austen, what sort of novel would you want your impressionable young daughter to read? You certainly wouldn't want her reading romance novels, for that might result in her eloping with the gamekeeper! No, you would want her to read a sensible novel, about how it is important to marry money, and that upper class men, even if they seem haughty, are really the best husbands. You would want her to read novels that reinforce, rather than undermine, the class-ridden social fabric. You would want her to read novels that show that even less-than-beautiful girls can use their wits to snare husbands far wealthier than themselves. In other words, you would want her to read Pride and Prejudice, the ideal anti-romantic novel.The novel offers a stark contrast between sisters. The younger sister falls in love with a poor army officer, and, by following her heart, brings herself and the family to the brink of disgrace. The heroine, by contrast, by keeping her head, marries the haughty but wealthy man, saves the family, and climbs up a notch or two in social caste. The men in the novel are neatly arranged according to wealth: the best men are Darcy and his rich friends; in the middle is the father, a nice but ineffectual character; at the base is the poor and caddish army officer. Things appear differently early in the novel, when the army man appears dashing and noble, and Darcy seems rude and prejudiced. But by the end, the rightness of the class system is revealed, and the heroine discovers that marrying wealth is the best way after all.This is the perfect instructional tale for cynics of Austen's time, and for ours. Enjoy this masterpiece of anti-romantic fiction."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is a wonderful classic of English literature.

You will love Jane Austn !"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It is a common tragedy that many high-schoolers and even adults do not read old books because they believe the books are not relevant. My words for them: human nature has not changed one bit since Jane Austen crafted her magic. Many people begin their reviews with &quot;Once you get past . . .&quot; but if any element were left out of this book (victorian society, language, high formality) it would diminish the book. Austen has shown through her characters the importance of valuing a person for who they truly are while 1) making fun of prudish victorian standards 2) showing gossip for the destructor it is, and 3) being one of the first writers to promote free thinking women as opposed to silly girls. Pride and Prejudice is called a classic for a reason: it will always remain a literary treasure."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Never before have I read a book as Austen's Pride &amp; Prejudice. Honestly, I don't read much book but I'm glad that I read this one.Throughout the first and most of the second volumes, Eliza criticized Mr. Darcy for his conceited, haughty attitude. She berated him for being so snobby at the balls. Eliza made assumptions about Mr. Darct only using his appearance and brief conversations with him as her premise. She also believed rumors from absolute strangers (Mr. Wickham) that slandered Mr. Darcy's reputation. Any bad news that she could find even the most baised resource was a good enough for her, just as long as it intensified her hatred for Darcy. One of the greatest accusations she put against him was his acts of prejudce and his big pride. However, she had made these conclusions based on her own prejudce against Darcy. This is the irony. She was a hypocrite in her own way. She deserves equal censure for her pride and prejudice. Unfortunately she realized her defects at near end. It is not surprisng that hse feels horrible about her discovery of her true self. The irony in all of this is that she got so caught up in finding Darcy's evil that she became who she hated most. She became the vain and prejudced one. She became the enemy she loathed so much. As you can plainly see, this book had a lot of impact on me. It was really enriching to read and Austen's delicate use of language which integrates the formality of that time along with slight English humor. The amalgam of languages helped me develop an intense vocabulary. I learned a lot of new words and feel better about writing."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, truly shows what great books are made of. The novel revolves around a distressed mother desperately trying to marry her daughters off before her husband dies. As a result, some hilaroius mishaps and misunderstandings occur, turning the novel into a humorous love story. Its conclusion will leave you smiling for days. A great book for anyone interested in love and all its follies!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen's novel, &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, was a great novel written as a portrayal of what life was like in the eighteenth century in England. This amusing tale revolves around an embarassing couple, named the Bennets and their five daughters. The Bennets, were what I would consider to be one of the most disfunctional families in all of history. The book starts way back in time when women could do nothing but to marry well, and as one can see having five daughters was more a curse, than a blessing.In the beginning Mrs. Bennet starts off by telling her daughters to marry well. At the same time, a wealthy man moves close to Netherfield, the house that they live in. The oldest of the five daughters, Jane, falls in love with this man, whose name later turns out to be Charles Bingley. Charles falls in love with Jane, depite her family's strange ways. Mr. Bingley and his friend Darcy talk often of the Bennet sisters, and later Mr. Darcy falls in love with one of them... the oldest Elizabeth, but she unfortunately turns him down, even though she later begins to have some other feelings for him. Lydia, the youngest daughter elopes with a man named Mr. Wickham and the family is very upset about this action. Jane and Mr. Bingley are getting closer but his younger sister Caroline tries to break them apart.Jane Austen's novel reflects many ways of life, including both the good and the bad times, all while in the search for happiness. This novel's story almost reminds me of another classic called, Little Women, which surprisingly enough was not written by Austen, because it has the same type of story line."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I first read &quot;P&amp;P&quot; when i was very young and i enjoyed it but didnt understand much other than Lizzie Bennett was adorable. but i recently read it again and it was so wondeful, all the subtle humor and irony behind what seems to be just a simple love story. what's amazing is that even thought the book was written in Regency England the characters seem so recognizable: the pompous sycophant Collins, the overbearing mom Mrs. Bennett, the dishonest charmer Wickham, and of course, the sometimes self-righteous, sometimes sharp-tongued, but always lovable Lizzie, who's just my favorite. Now that i have a boyfriend i can understand the relationship between lizzie and darcy much better: unlike today's soap operas, where people jump into bed within minutes of meeting, Austen recognizes that true love takes time to develop and that lovers dont always say or do the right thing. it's just wondeful, the whole book, and i recommend all girls read if only to have a real role-model in Lizzie Bennett."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is a love story that is slow developing, at least for Elizabeth Bennett. Because she is prejudice of Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, she cannot see his fascination with her, nor can she see his true disposistion, which is delightfully uncovered over time. His fascination stems from her lack of desire to cater to his apparant haughtiness. She mistakes his shyness for rudeness and his disdainment for silliness as resentment towards others.And we musn't forget dear Mrs. Jane. Her love for Mr. Bently and his for her, make this book even more enthralling, especially as it all unfolds.Mrs. Bingly is a vital character in this book as well, as she covers jealousy, treachery to certain extent, caniving, and even back-stabbing. Of course she wants Mr. Darcy for herself.Jane Austen created memorable characters that each become a major part of this story! From her Father, Mr. Bennett, to the rediculous Mr. Collins and from Mrs. Bennett to the very silly Lydia. She even goes into detail about how things end up for the characters she created, at the end of the book! Great writing!This story also is an awesome detail of what it was like in the 1700's for families and women. Jane did not deal with the political side of life in this book. Some reviews from famous author's were disappointed that the book did not contain any information about what the men did for a living, but that was not Jane's intention. It didn't matter what they did for a living. They \\"went to town on business\\" was enough information. You come to understand that women didn't marry for love much, as in the case of Mr. and Mrs. Bennett. It was a convenience to be married for many. It also showed how important it was for families to have sons.I highly recommend this book, and the movie. You will not be disappointed. It is a great read, over and over."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have wanted to read this book for years, like many people, I've watched the A&E; movie, and have always been in love with Miss Bennett and Mr Darcy's story. I was held back so long from reading it because I was afraid (or perhaps more convinced than afraid) that because of how long ago this book was written, the language would be so difficult to read and comprehend, that I would find little pleasure in reading it. However, I was very mistaken! I was pleasantly surprised as I began to read this book at how smooth is reads while still retaining the magical way of conversation of that period. I loved it! I recommend anyone who has the same reservations as I had about reading Pride & Prejudice to not worry, it reads beautifully!After reading the book, I can really appreciate how true to character and events the A&E; movie kept, but no movie could ever compare! I'm impatient to read more Jane Austen novels, and only wish that I had done so sooner!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I absolutley loved this book and had to keep reminding myself it was written ages ago. Apart from the dialogue, which was sometimes hard to understand, the story is timeless. Each character in this book was well developed and interesting. The twists and turns of the novel were well planned and thought out to keep the reader wanting more. I loved the setting of this book and Jane Austen's descriptions made you feel that you were there with them. This book is witty, charming, emotional and endearing. There is only one thing I didn't like about it...there wasn't a sequel. I recommend this book to anyone who's interested in a classic and a true romance.Bravo Jane Austen!!!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is the first classic I've ever read and I really must credit Jane Austen for her wit. That's what got me sitting through the whole plot!The story is clear from the first chapter: Mrs. Bennet is trying for get her daughters married before her husband dies because since all five of her children are female, they won't get to inherit any of their father's money. Smart and sharp Elizabeth is the heroine in this book, and has a thing for judging people at a first meeting. It is not surprising that she developes an immediate annoyace for the arrogant Fitzwilliam Darcy. Darcy's friend falls madly in love with Elizabeth's sister Jane, who is astonishingly beautiful and shy.It's actually pretty boring to sit through the parties and dances, but there are some characters to keep us alive. Mrs. Bennet is one of the most comical characters ever; I can picture every one of her expressions when she is freaking out about her poor nerves. Lydia is flirtacious to the point of silliness. Mr. Collin's proposal to Elizabeth is so absurd,the seriousness of his stupidness and love for Lady Catherine de Bourgh is absolutely funny. Jane Austen has made her characters so lively and significant, you think you know them.Aside the fact that I've got a problem with Mr. Darcy being so rich and handsome (if I remember correctly), I liked this book. There are several turning points in this story, such as the letter that uncovers the charming officer into a man exploiting girls for money, and Elizabeth's sister eloping. I know Pride and Prejudice is incredibly old-fashioned, but that can't be helped. Try reading it at least."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"After reading this book, my eyes have been opened to not only outward character but inner personality. Truly no other book has ever acheived international acclaim for so long. The reason is clear one of Jane Austen's best works, Pride and Prejudice has proven to contain the finest of elements which only contibutes to it's immortal relation of what happened during her days.

I'm reading the books now too (they're great, glad I've got them to read as I find time) but the design is truly beautiful. The hardcover book has a gorgeous aqueous / soft matte coating, and it's almost as if the letters/ cover text are screened on top. Really beautiful. One should note that the page edges are also painted to match the color of the cover, so this book's page edges are red. The book is wonderfully typeset so it's very easy to read. I'm so pleased with my purchase. I've purchased A-F (the only ones available at present, and will undoubtedly purchase the entire collection.

It doesn't load well and is difficult to read as parts are cut off or wrap oddly.Even though it's free, it's not worth it. It's too frustrating trying to navigate and read.I'd spend a bit of money and get a better version, or better yet, buy the actual book, or even better, buy both. This has got to be one of the most romantic stories of all time.If you're not a Jane Austin fan, you will be within a few moments of entering into her world.For those of you unfamiliar with the story ~ (Do people like that even exist?) ~ Here is a brief summaryThe story takes place in Victorian England. We meet the Bennett family, the mother's sole intent is to marry her daughters off to successful men, ensuring they will be cared for properly since only males can inherit property. The story focuses on Elizabeth Bennett, the second daughter, who is attractive, but not as attractive as her older sister ~ She is also witty, smart, well-read and confident. Now we meet the wonderful Mr. Darcy. He is handsome and rich, but quite prideful and arrogant and rude. He is intrigued by Miss Elizabeth Bennett although he can't really figure out why. She mocks and teases him, and doesn't seem at all impressed with him, like every other female who has crossed his path.Throw in some other characters that help carry the story and you now have in your hands the most wonderful and romantic story ever written.Hmmm ~ perhaps I'm a bit biased.

In this case, the book is clearly abridged, and it is a very poorly done abridgment. Hopefully, the paid versions of this book for Kindle are not abridged."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen has been considered a classic for many years and now that I've read it I definitely agree with its status. I read this book for a school project and did not expect much when I began reading. It was very difficult for me to get into the language and understand what was going on in the plot. I considered the book a bore until I was more than half way done reading it. I'm not sure at which point this transformation took place but I found myself completely engrossed in the characters and the plot. I wanted so badly for Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy to get together! I absolutely could not stop reading until I was done with the last page of the last chapter. Once I had finished I just sat there for a few minutes, reflecting on my experience with this book. My advice to readers who are struggling with the language is to keep reading! The challenge is part of the success you will feel when you finish the book. Jane Austen writes with beautiful imagery and has wonderful diction. This love story will touch you to the core. I am convinced that I will read Pride and Prejudice again, and in the second reading I will enjoy the first half of the book much more. I would say the ideal age to read this is college or older, at the youngest I would say a senior in high school. I urge you to read Pride and Prejudice and to let yourself appreciate Jane Austen's brilliant writing technique."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This book is one of my all-time favourites. It's Jane Austen's BEST literary work. This book revolves around 2 main characters- Elizabeth &amp; Darcy. Then there is Elizabeth's elder sister, &amp; her lover, Mr. Bingley.

Mr. Bennet (Elizabeth's father), feels Elizabeth is the only sensible one of the family. She certainly IS sensible, but not in love. When Mrs Bennet learns that Mr. Bingley &amp; his friend, Mr.Darcy have moved in Netherfield, she is overjoyed. After all, a bachelor with a huge fortune is always a target for matchmaking mamas. She schemes different ways to make Mr. Bingley fall in love with Jane, her eldest daughter. In the mean time, Elizabeth is busy antagonising with Mr. Darcy. But while all this is going on, a military regiment comes to town, &amp; the younger Bennets are busy flirting with the officers, the most popular of all being Mr.Wickham. After a few months of staying in Netherfeild, the Bingleys &amp; Mr. Darcy depart, leaving behind a trail of broken hearts. (the most important being Jane who really is in love with Mr.Bingley, but is no match for Mr.Bingley's sister,Caroline Bingley). After their departure, Mr Wickham discloses something about Mr.Darcy which makes everybody declare that they always knew him to a proud, selfish &amp; disagreeable man. Elizabeth, of course, believes him. Darcy, meanwhile realises that he has fallen in love with Elizabeth, but his pride is revolted by the very fact of marrying beneath himself. Whether he overcomes his pride &amp; proposes to her, what she does when he proposes, &amp; what happens after that, I'll allow to read it yourself. In the midst of all this lies the magnificent &amp; imposing figure of Lady Catherine de bourgh &amp; William Collins (also Elizabeth's cousin), who worships the very ground she walks on. This a VERY good book, &amp; the potrayal of the characters is so true, like its taken from real life. Take my advice..READ THIS BOOK!!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The novel of which I spent many a night, studiously reading, was a true masterpiece. The irony and satire with which Austen displayed the seventeenth-century society was beautifully mastered. The humor was impressive and understandable to the common reader. The relations, especially between Darcy and Lizzy kept the reader guessing about how their relationship would turn out. Thanks."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It is a truth not universally acknowledged, that \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is probably not Jane Austen's best book. That honor is reserved for \\"Mansfield Park\\", a much deeper work. But it's almost everybody's favorite Austen, including mine, as much for the unforgettable characters as for the story.Elizabeth Bennet is the perfect heroine: she's bright, sharp, likeable, perceptive, nobody's fool, infinitely fallible, like all of us; but, unlike most of us, able to see and admit when she is in the wrong. Unlike her wacky mother and her shallow younger sisters, she does not see snaring a husband as her sole object in life, and thus she is supremely capable of putting Mr. Darcy in his place. Darcy's progression from an insufferable snob to an empathetic human being results from the realization that money and an old name are insufficient recommendations to a woman with real class, intelligence and character.Elizabeth's family is also well portrayed. We can understand why Elizabeth is her father's favorite child; he is as sharp and perceptive as she is, totally sensible and down to earth, a perfect foil for the ditzy Mrs. Bennet, who is so ridiculous you wish a chandelier would fall on her head, obsessed with marrying off her five eligible daughters. We know how the book is going to end almost as soon as it begins; Jane will hook Mr. Bingley in spite of the machinations of his nasty sisters, and Elizabeth, of course, will become Mrs. Darcy.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is very much of it's time, set at the end of the 18th century, but it's been loved by generations of readers for the past two hundred years and looks good for at least another two hundred. It's quintessential Jane Austen.Judy Lind"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is my first Jane Austen novel. It did not dissapoint!!

Now I can't wait to read all of Jane Austen's books."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"So many people - especially in the younger, 'trendier' generations, quite literally groan at the thought of reading a classic. And yet they do not realize these books are classics because they relate so well. They may not know that some of today's hottest blockbusters are based on this story; the unlucky in love bridget jones was based on this eloquent novel. as was the bollywood hit Bride and Prejudice.This story is about the wit of a young woman, who is unable to fight for her position in society with anyone else. This story stands for the right-minded, showing how they can change everything around them with only a touch of cleverness."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a charming and witty excursion through the trials and tribulations of a middle-class English family at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Most of the action centers around a young spitfire named Elizabeth Bennet (Lizzy), who, along with her four sisters and mother and father, is trying to negotiate the erratic fortunes of love and courtship amid the complexities of economics and social class.The independent and stubborn Lizzy meets the proud and very wealthy Mr. Darcy. His pride won't allow him to admit his feelings for her, and her adamant refusal to see his better qualities (her prejudice) stands in the way of their making a closer acquaintance. And so it goes for about three hundred pages -- but they are an intriguing three hundred pages of revelation, counter-revelation, comedy, and light suspense. However, to any experienced reader of romance novels, the ending will never seem much in doubt.Since Pride and Prejudice is a nineteenth-century romance novel, a prospective reader should bear in mind that the vocabulary and syntax reflect the time in which it was written. It has been called a seminal work and is standard fare in high school and college English courses; it certainly deserves that distinction. However, loading all this importance onto the book will constrain the casual reader from enjoying it as I imagine Jane Austen would have preferred -- a simple work of entertainment.The Oxford World's Classics edition includes a useful (but quite scholarly) introduction that provides the reader with a historical context for the novel and some background on Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is possibly one of the most beautifully written novels of all time. As one turns the pages of this timeless classic, she is brought into the wonderfully romantic world of Elizabeth Bennet and the rest of the so vividly depicted characters. One becomes familiar with the lavish mansions and picturesque countryside that envelope the setting of this novel, and at once becomes a part of the drama that surrounds the young women on whom the novel focuses.By far, my favorite character in Pride and Prejudice was Mr. Bennet. His quick wit and ability to survive in a household filled with marriage obsessed females are prime examples of the wonderful humor Austen brings to the novel. Another character I became quite fond of was Lizzy, for as a young female myself, I felt that the obstacles and tribulations she faced throughout the novel, especially the pressures put on her by her family and society, were timeless trials that all women go through.The turn of events in this magical novel leaves the reader both enthralled and ultimately satiated with the happy endings for the main characters. The plot is both unexpected and fulfilling at the same time, for Austen's writing is, at times, more gratifying for her characters than one could even devise in her own imagination. As the reader enters the world of the Bennets she gains a new perspective and appreciation of this era that lasts throughout the novel and leaves you thirsty for more at the end."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I read the Barnes and Noble Classics edition. This book dragged on and on in the middle and it is not an easy read due to the language of the time. But it's a fun, character-driven novel. My favorite character was the father - he's a riot! Don't expect much to happen, but there's a lot going on. For example, it's an interesting study of British class differences at the turn of the century. Also, the options women had were much more limited than today and it made for very different relationship dynamics."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"When I started this book, I must say, it was with dragging feet. It was assigned to me for school and I was prepared for a sappy romance story, probably with big words, like most classics. The first half seemed to be living up to my expectations, minus the big words. In fact, it was so simply written that I began to wonder why it was called a classic at all. I know I may be speaking blasphemy according to some people, but all I could think in the beginning was that this was some twaddle about a bunch of giggly girls from the Victorian era! Then the middle came. At just about the exact middle of the book, things got interesting. Tension was rising; emotions were running like a river through rapids, and I was hooked. I suddenly found myself reading more chapters than I was assigned to that week, and of all the books I had to read in a week, that was the first one I picked up. I can't tell you any more specifically what grabbed me for fear of giving too much away, but I will tell you this: it may take awhile to get there, but it's well worth the wait.

Pride and Prejudice is also probably one of Jane Austen's most famous novels. I certainly liked it much more than Northanger Abbey. It is the story of Elizabeth Bennet, who lives with five sisters, and an odd pair of parents at Longbourn. Her mother is constantly scheming about marrying off her daughters to wealthy young men, so when Netherfield Park is let to the rich Mr. Bingley, she is very excited indeed. (Mr. Bennet's estate will be entailed away from the immediate family upon his death, so at least one of the sisters has to marry well to provide for them.) And Mr. Bingley brings his very proud friend, Mr. Darcy. The book is about the courtships, and, of course, has many twists and turns. Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley, Mr. Wickham, and I suppose, the detestable Mr. Collins (who the estate will be entailed to) are the main men of the story.I really loved this one; it had humor and wit in it, and great characters. I enjoyed Mr. Bennet and his sarcasm very much, though Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are really too silly sometimes. So stupid. And of course, Elizabeth. She is really a very smart and spirited young woman, who will not be ordered around. I also watched the 1995 TV series from BBC, and I must confess, Mr. Darcy...never mind.Anyway, all the characters were well portrayed, and while the TV series is wonderful, it doesn't quite have the subtlety of the conversations in Pride and Prejudice itself. The TV series did have excellent casting though; all the Bennets, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Collins were portrayed very well. (Yes, I suppose this is sort of a double review.) I would say though, that Caroline Bingley should have been a little prettier; she was just hideous, and Mr. Bingley was kind of silly-looking. But everywhere else, they did very well.Back to the book. As I said, there were many twists and turns which made this one a thoroughly enjoyable read. And really great characters. Though she is certainly less descriptive and florid than Dickens, Austen still manages in this one, to portray everyone extremely well. Mr. Collins really is detestable, Bingley overly-cheerful and positive, and Darcy stiff and stern (though he has his reasons, of course.) Mrs. Bennet is an extremely foolish woman, as is Lydia, the youngest Bennet. The pride and prejudice of the story refer, I believe, to Mr. Darcy's pride and Elizabeth's prejudice (though it is certainly debatable.) Mr. Darcy is very proud indeed at the beginning of the story, and Elizabeth's prejudice prevents her from seeing his true character for a while.I will just add that I read the Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition from 2009, and while it has a very nice design, it does not have any analysis or introduction, so if you want that you'd be better off reading the Penguin Classics regular edition or Oxford World Classics. However, my Penguin Classics Deluxe edition arrived slightly damaged on the spine, which was a disappointment.[...]"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Can you imagine a more classic tale of romance?You are immediately transported back to the 19th century--I want tobring this book with me every time I travel to the English countryside.More than any other novel, this story really captures Austen's wit.Books these days are so lackluster in comparison, and it's becomeso incredibly hard to find a hero to live up to Darcy. I'm never, everbored when I pick this up--even on the hundredth read!PLEASE give this one a shot if you haven't already--you won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Blame Jane - Austen that is - for The Marriage Plot: the idea that a woman's ambition and happiness rests solely upon marriage to a man; and that she is free to use any means to land her man, including to a great degree: gossip, deceit, and deception. In addition, she need not worry that he is not the ideal man, for she can mold him into what it is she wants because he is witless--putty in her hands. Unless he is a scoundrel, who turns the plot upside down on an unsuspecting nubile. Cheers, Mr. Wickham.Nora Roberts owes Austen for her fortune and success. Austen was the pioneer that many other romance writers have followed. Not only writers, but including real girls and women for, apparently, centuries, right on up to today; and is responsible for much of marriage's misery (sometimes for some people.) For some, I know, The Marriage Plot works.Jane Austen was a young, little (Actually, I don't know if she was little or what she looked like - but I do know she had one fine imagination.) twerp--writing wishful fantasies in her attic about things she had little experience with, having never been married, or \`properly in love,' or, \\"\`violently in love.\\"' Thank goodness she didn't write sex scenes.Oh Miss Bennet, no not you Jane, or you Mary, or her niece, or the other sister, or her cousin, or his cousin - yes, you Elizabeth, the creature that is Mr. Bennet's daughter, or should I call you Lizzy? Eliza? The writing is often confusing and redundant and nothing happens but gossip and sideways conversations - which is probably accurate for the times. It certainly is today. So there is that. If Austen were alive today she might be a stand-up comic. She's funny, and if you can muddle through the bad writing - amusing and entertaining. I struggled to finish the book, but then I'm not a fan of The Marriage Plot nor bad writing. Nevertheless - five stars because she was way ahead of her time - a true pioneer."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I LOVE the movie so I decided to finally read the book.

Really, there is no need for sequels because all the loose ends are tied up. For that reason, Austen has given us a remarkable masterpiece.I will not go into the plot, you need to read it, but just know that this book is at one time a fanciful and a serious examination of the lives of women in the neoclassical era."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice was one of the remaining Austen novels I have not read (Northanger Abbey is the other one). Emma, Mansfield Park, Sense and Sensibility, Persuasion...loved them all. So I figured it was about time I pick this one up off my shelf.Boy, I was not disappointed! It almost felt like coming back to an old friend, even though I have never read P&P; before. But I know the story very well, having fallen in love with the BBC series. And I loved it. I loved it so much that I don't know what to say. It is that good. And it is jumping right up to the top of my all-time favorite lists.It's witty - I love the early banter between Mr Darcy and Elizabeth when Jane is recovering from an illness at Mr Bingley's home. It's funny - Mr Collins just cracks me up, and you just have to laugh at Mrs Bennett's scheming. Almost 200 years later, it is still a page turner. And as much as I love reading classics, I would not describe most of them as a page turner!It is also a comfort book. I can't help but love almost all of the characters, despite their flaws. Immersing yourself in the novel is like having a cup of tea with an old friend.

I came across it in my elementary school library, and was hesitant at first because the title suggested similarity to Crime & Punishment (let's be frank, Dostoevsky simply cannot appeal to a relatively normal 5th grader). I was way off base in this assumption, and have been smitten with P&P ever since that first reading.

I can easily identify with and like the main character, Elizabeth. Throughout the book, I find it's easy to sympathize with her when she's embarrassed by her family or angry with Darcy. I feel her love for her sister. And, of course, I feel her anger and dislike for Darcy and the feelings of attraction and love that start to take their place. This is a love story.

I do have a clock and a radio though. And a calendar too although strictly speaking that particular item is made out of paper. I do believe that I am going to bigly dig Pride and Prejudice in any case, hence the bold five stars. Well for starters it's considered a classic, innit? Plus I am very favourably disposed towards this writer on account of having read and thoroughly enjoyed some years ago the very bleeding brilliant Persuasion. That truly is a lovely book that is and an abiding pleasure to read. The BBC made a great film version of Persuasion too so they did, in the middle 90s and not long after I savoured this memorable novel for the first time, with deeply satisfying turns by Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds.

This version has full page colored pictures of the characters through-out, and has that traditional deckled edge (uneven cut pages - makes it easier to turn pages imho).The book is a cute love-story about Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzwilliam Darcy set in that classic early 1800's English period where manners and one's dictated social existence means far more than independence and general happiness. You HAVE to take into the account the current society of the time period / location to understand the predicaments.

I automatically fell in love with the story, just because I'm such a romantic and found everything about the characters and story so incredibly sweet. Finally, I dragged myself to Borders and forced myself (slash my mother, because I'm broke, hahah) to finally buy the book. I was not disappointed. I love old-fashioned stories, with old-fashioned language and learning about how they did things way back then. It's entertaining on all levels! Mrs. Bennet, though, could drive any sane person crazy, but she's leveled out by Mr. Bennet and her two sensible daughters, Elizabeth and Jane.The love story between Darcy and Elizabeth is priceless; I can see why this book is considered such a classic. However, this isn't a book to be recommended to someone who doesn't like lengthy descriptions and can't really translate nineteenth century speaking into modern day language.

I haven't read it in years, but look forward to reading it again on my Kindle."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This was the first time I had read one of Jane Austen's novels, and I am so enthralled with the story-telling and characters I am now looking to read every single thing she has written. The writing is filled with so many different layers; not only do I find bits of humor in a re-read that I missed the first time around, but the characters themselves are so different and have so much depth that you could easily imagine these people exist (or have existed) in real life.The dialogue is where this novel shines, which is good since the novel is mostly dialogue. Austen is able to convey the personality of a character simply through the way the character speaks, so that even though there are not a lot of descriptions of the characters, you have a clear idea of who each character is almost as soon as they open their mouth. Perhaps one of my favorite aspects of the writing style is the sandpaper-dry wit of Austen, which, when you understand it, can be very, very funny.Note that it may not be for everyone: since this book was written in the early 1800s, some of the turns of phrases are outdated, and may be difficult for a modern reader to understand. Another stumbling block is that while the writing itself is elegant and beautiful, the sheer density of words might make it hard for some people to read. For the former, my recommendation is to read as closely as possible, and re-read passages you didn't quite get the first time around; this will have the added benefit that you may be able to catch wisps of Austen's dry humor you might have missed the first time (I know I did). For the latter, it's a matter of preference. Personally, I love how poetic and elegant the writing is, and finding the hidden tidbits of humor as well as the ever-present underlying issues of the time was always rewarding to me; but if you find after the first chapter or two that you just can't get through the density of the writing, this may not be a good read for you.Since I downloaded the Kindle version, here's a review of the e-book format specifically: I did not notice any typos (yay!); it had a list of chapters near the beginning of the book, right after the cover, but does not contain an actual \\"table of contents\\" function. (i.e., if you click on \\"Go to...\\" the \\"table of contents\\" button will be grayed out.)

I warned my husband, though, that I'm not in love with another man.. and his name is Mr. Darcy :)"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is simply timeless, I reread it this Summer for the first time since high school and somehow I learned to appreciate Jane Austen's work even more."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I can not even begin to write the review that this book deserves. My only regret is that I didn't read this book sooner! If you enjoy a good love story then you MUST read this book! The characters were so well developed and the story was so well delivered that it was virtually impossible to put it down. In my opinion, this book deserves way more than 5 stars."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have always had a soft in my heart for Jane Austen. In fact, I can not say that there is any of her books that I do not like. About a month ago, I received my first kindle, as a graduation gift, from my boyfriend. I have to say at first I was very uncomfortable with using it because it just seemed like it would be very hard to read from it. I hate reading off the computer. However, I promised him that I would try. However, with this experiment I did not want to waste money on a book that I may never read from the piece of equipment. After searching Amazon I found the free section of ebooks and was delighted to find my tried and true author amoung those. This was the first ebook I had heard and though it has been many years and still enjoy it, greatly. Plus, I found that the kindle was right up my alley.Thanks, Jane; for giving me a book that never fails to capture my attention."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This story is one of the greatest pieces of English literature to ever be written. It may take some time to actually get hooked to the book, but once you do, don't count on putting it down. The tension between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy leave you wanting more. The love in the story leaves you speechless. It's a battle between the rich families and the poor families. I loved the book because it is a beautiful story that deals with tension, love, heartbreak and so much more! Also, the version of this book is easy to understand. The book is amusing, well written and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I could read P&P; over and over again, watch a million film adaptations, and never get sick of the seething love story behind it. The story of Elizabeth & Darcy is what all fiercely independent women (or those of us who would like to become such) dream of -- uncompromising love with a man who is somehow both kind and sexy and equal in every way.No one does romance like the Brits, and most subsequent romance stories are just rehashing the tales of Austen, Bronte, and the like."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"*happy sigh. I mean, really, do I need to say much more than that? I can't quite put my finger on what it is about Pride and Prejudice's happily ever after that goes above and beyond your average HEA. It could be because it has quite a few of my favorite plot devices in it. Austen certainly balances them all very well. At no point does one seem to outweigh the other. In one novel you have: a grievous assumption of character, manipulative sisters, a scandalous elopement, a dysfunctional yet mostly lovable family and the heroine who marries up.I think my favorite story arc is the same as everyone else. I love watching Elizabeth Bennet get smacked upside the head by love. I adore Darcy for not being aggressive in trying to win over Elizabeth. Instead he showed her who he could be. In one instance he wasn't guaranteed Elizabeth would ever know about his act of kindness. In fact he didn't want anyone to know. Their love story is both epic and legendary.I'll admit it took some time to understand the dialogue. Once I did, I found one of the greatest love stories ever written."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"i really love this book! i liked the movie with keira. (i never was into the whole pirates of the caribbean) i saw the movie first and then got the book from a bookstore, and when i got my kindle i downloaded the book so i could re-read it when i had craving for a pride and prejudice fix. i can read this book over and over.the only problem that i see is the formatting and that is why it is a 4 star, i really think it is the kindle itself because i have the pc kindle and everything is just the way it is in the book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"like Pride and Prejudice. I really do. It's one of my favorite novels. But, I must confess, it's not my favorite Jane Austen novel. I like both Persuasion and Emma better and Sense and Sensibility is very, very close.I first read the book when I was 14 and I absolutely loved Elizabeth Bennet and her sharp wit. I really liked Darcy too, but everyone paled in comparison to Elizabeth. I thought the story was incredibly romantic. I even thought Mr. Bennet was a doll. I saw the 1995 version very shortly after I finished the book and my opinions were less than favorable. But that's a review for another day.My opinion has changed over the years and frequent rereads. I saw what a bad father and husband Mr. Bennet really was. I still like Elizabeth and Darcy, but mostly because they are dynamic characters who mature and grow to become a worthy couple. I find Elizabeth quite immature and a bit too sure of herself in the beginning and Darcy to be on the controlling side. They are both proud and both prejudiced in the beginning but I do like that they learn from their mistakes and change.The book is a delightful comedy of manners. But I more highly admire Elinor Dashwood, Anne Elliot, and even Fanny Price than Elizabeth Bennet. And I'd take Frederick Wentworth, Henry Tilney, Mr. Knightley, or Colonel Brandon over Darcy. Although the 10,000 a year does work in his favor..."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I read this book a few years ago, and it is one of my favorites of all time! the characters are very detailed and believable, and the plotline is very interesting and dramatic without being totally unbelievable. having wanted one guy before discovering that another one was my match myself, I totally relate to this book. I also find the 17th-century culture aligned in the book interesting, such as the fact that girls were forced to marry for economic reasons by a certain age, often with men that they were not in love with. This book paints an amazing portrait of what 17th-century life was like, with all of its balls and activities, along with an amazing love story."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The content of this book receives five stars with ease.

I never get tired of reading this book. Elizabeth Bennett has taught me to never settle when it comes to matters of the heart. I always find that the middle of the book drags a bit, as I'm not interested on the drama concerning Jane, but Lizzie & Darcy will always bring me back."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I'll keep it short since it's probably all been said before. But how Ms. Austen can create such dramatic page-turning tension with so little real \\"action\\" is beyond me."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This was by far, most certainly, without a doubt.. the first book I put on my Kindle over two years ago. And I can't count the number of times I've read it since then! Jane Austen is a wonderful writer... Lizzy is an amazing character to follow and fall in love with. Mr. Darcy... so dark and mysterious and stern. I love reading about the social and societal customs and ideals... it's so very interesting, so different from life today. No matter what mood I'm in, I can flip to Pride and Prejudice and feel warm, cozy, and content within minutes. Favorite book of all time. Weeeell.. Pride and Prejudice is in direct competition with Harry Potter.. for the spot of 'favorite book of all time.' But it's definitely right up there. You can't go wrong - read this book!!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This classic by Jane Austen was amazing. I am only eleven years old and I completely fell in love with this book. After reading it, my friend read it too, and she LOVED it! This is one those timeless books...It takes place in Regency England. Elizabeth Bennet meets Mr. Darcy at a party. At first, she thinks he is prideful and prejudiced. But after knowing him, they kinda fall in love...I am doing a book cube project on this book, and this book is completly AMAZING!!!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"A mother's driving force is getting her five daughters married quickly; it hardly matters to whom. A suitor proposes, is summarily rejected and marries someone else within days. A woman doesn't like men but wants to get married anyway. A sixteen-year-old runs off with a man and doesn't marry him right away, much to the dismay of both her parents and sisters. A mother has no use for her daughter's suitor but happily accepts him into the family because he is rich. The less money a family has, the more important it is that all their daughters marry and quickly. If the family lives in the country, they must work harder to get these daughters married. Sound like your favorite sitcom and/or your favorite cousin and her family? Well, it's Jane Austin's timeless PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Here we have much ado about getting the daughters married.Everybody points out what is so unique about this novel as well as the rest of Austin's works. She does very little to place them in any given time. They are good because of what they don't tell us. Austin doesn't give us a lot of specificity about a lot of things. For example, The Bennetts are always entertaining yet we don't know much about what they eat other than \\"venison\\" or \\"meat.\\" Wickham may wear a blue coat when he gets married. The young women often play music but we are never told the names of the pieces they play.The ironic first line of the novel is well-known: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\" With that great opener, we are off to the races.Parts of this novel will make you smile; others will make your laugh. My favorite character is the father, Mr. Bennett, who is quick to see and point out his wife's and others' foibles but never sees his own. Somehow it seemed Jane Austen anticipated the future when much of her character's behavior would be seen as folly, though we certainly have follies of our own today."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen's works are always engaging, entertaining, heart-warming, and funny. So well written and so much more true romance than any dime store novel ever could attain to be. The only downside is that this copy seems to have some glitch where it will double a sentence and place that 2nd sentence a few paragraphs later but it's in a way that it's obvious it doesn't belong there. The only thing I could figure was that in the hard copy there is some book print style picture with a quote from the book under it as would be typical in many books of this type and that in the kindle version it just doesn't show the picture."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I loved the book, a well-known English classic, and felt compelled to give it a good rating. I do have one criticism of the eBook format for this particular edition. While I was reading through the book I noticed, more than 100 times, that the book was inappropriately formatted. There were new paragraphs where no paragraphs should be (...Mr. (praragraph inserted) Darcy...), this was only a minor distraction, but it did become a bit annoying, and it is an easy problem to fix. Paragraph insertion also took place between sentences, this became especially confusing with paragraph long dialogues.

I am now surprised at myself that I had not read a single Jane Austen book at nearly 30. I fully intend on reading all of her works. I loved how dialogue based this novel is."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I read this for the umpteenth time on the PC Kindle, and the formatting seemed fine to me, so maybe it's been sorted by now. Either that or I was so bedazzled by the story that I simply didn't notice any problems.A librarian once remarked to me, upon my commenting how few people were in the library that particular day, that if people had to pay to gain access the line would be around the block. This seemed to me to display a wise understanding of human nature.Just because something is free does not mean it is worthless, any more than there being a guarantee that something costing a lot is bound to be valuable. The reason this book is always free on Kindle is that it is long out of copyright. This fact alone shows that it has stood the test of time, along with Jane Austen's other novels.Many people shy away from reading so-called classic novels. They feel that they will be full of long descriptions or such dated language that the narrative will be impossible to penetrate. To anyone reading this book for the first time, therefore, the writing will be a revelation. It is perceptive and witty in its social commentary, and full of interesting, sympathetic (and sometimes unsympathetic) characters who remain forever in the memory.The story itself is the great-great-great-grandmother of all romances, even predating Jane Eyre, which so many people liken to Mills & Boon or Silhouette romances. The heroine and her hero are real, flawed people rather than cardboard cutouts. When you consider that Jane Austen's settings and characters genuinely reflect her own time (the late 18th/early 19th century), rather than being researched in modern times, there is added interest from both cultural and historic perspectives.If you have never read this novel, regarded by many as the writer's best, please don't pass on it this time. Not only is it a wonderful experience in itself, but it may open for you literary doors to other fascinating worlds that you have kept firmly closed until now. If you have already read it once, of course, this review is preaching to the converted, for you have probably done so several times, with its charms only increasing with every reading."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It is the first book I happened to read on my Kindle.

The topic at hand was Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, and the class was a noisy, disrespectful circus. It may be that this novel is essentially inaccessible now to all but a handful of young readers, and probably many older ones as well. A terrible shame!The book has much to teach us, after all, about the human condition, and the ways in which we handicap ourselves in the pursuit of happiness. Elizabeth's travails, and Mr. Darcy's, are as much self-inflicted as they are levied by the society in which they live. That said, Austen has an exceedingly generous and sympathetic touch with all of her characters, and the novel is one of the funnier pieces of the period. It goes without saying (or should) that her mastery of the English language is without peer."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Great read I loved the descriptions and I want to applaud the author.Be get the red fall but then"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Still a great story;even after multiple readings.

The book itself is a classic, and timeless in its appeal. Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a well-written satire on the hypocrisies of Regency society as exposed through her various well-delineated characters. Mrs. Bennet is eager to marry off her five daughters - the beautiful and quiet Jane, the strong-willed Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty and flighty Lydia. So when a young man of means moves into neighboring Netherfield Park, Mrs. Bennet is determined that one of her daughters should snag the gentleman in question, Mr. Bingley. Mrs. Bennet's character is truly a caricature and an almost scathing portrayal of the society of the time - mothers desperate to see their daughters married off, especially given the Bennets' predicament - with no male heir, the family home and fortune would be entailed away from the Bennets' in the event of Mr. Bennet's death.It is also a harsh criticism of the hypocrisy and pride of the ruling classes as well-embodied in the character of Fitzwilliam Darcy, whose pride makes him look down upon the Bennets and the rest of society not equal to his own station, though of course he doesn't count upon his own traitorous feelings when he falls for Elizabeth Bennet (whose prejudice against Darcy almost blinds her to the flaws in another). The lively and almost fiery exchanges between Elizabeth and Darcy are one of the most interesting and captivating aspects of the novel. There are a host of other characters that make this novel an engrossing read - the haughty Lady Catherine de Bourgh who is hell-bent on marrying off her sickly daughter to Darcy, the comical and 'greasy' Mr. Collins who reveals his own mercenary tendencies despite being a man of the cloth, the morally bankrupt Mr. Wickham, and many others. It is a delightful tale of the battle between the social classes, and a wonderful character study. Though the language takes some getting used to (it can appear quite stilted to those unused to reading this style of writing - the flowery, stuffy sort), the story itself is compelling enough to make it a worthwhile read. In fact, having fallen in love with the novel about two decades ago, I've since re-read it countless times!As for this particular cover by Ruben Toledo, I have to say it makes for a fun interpretation of the dynamics between Elizabeth and Darcy, the novel's two main characters. Illustrated in black and white with the characters presented in silhoutte, this is a fun and inspired take on the classic which will extend this novel's appeal to a younger generation of readers. This is a novel to be savored time and again - highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"There are literally thousands of review of Austen's seminal classic Pride And Prejudice out there already.

I know there is a lot that I'm missing since I'm not an Austen expert on her subtleties and innuendos on society, but that's what makes it a timeless classic...it still speaks to everyone even without knowing everything that she was intimating in her social commentary.

Furthermore, she did a great job persuading the reader to switch back and forth to Wickham and Darcy's different sides.P and P is a book to not be overlooked!

Is she serious we ask? 'A truth universally acknowledged' is the language of mathematics, of science, of logic; it is like saying: \\"we are dealing with self-evident truths--axioms.\\"How does this statement apply to society? to families? to manners?Although I have read many articles and reviews on Pride and Prejudice, its perennial enchantment has eluded me until now. What makes this novel a favorite of so many readers after so many years?The title to begin with, is provocative. Both terms pride and prejudice are applicable to Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy. But prejudice is directed more towards Darcy than Elizabeth. I would have like Jane Austen to use the word 'Prejudgement' as opposed to prejudice because the former word is laden with situational biases such as when Darcy prejudges Elizabeth: \\"She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me.\\"Ah, the title is also alliterative; and it would have also worked with prejudgment.Not wanting to walk along the trodden path I want to propose a few personal impressions. First, it is a syntactically flawless--British English at its best-- narrative which is never boring; perhaps due to Austen's adroit handling of the Indirect Free Speech. Second, the characters are diverse: some attractive (Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, Jane and Bingley) and others picturesque (Charlotte Lucas and Mr. Collins, Mrs. Bennet, and Lady Catherine de Bourgh). Third, that it is a moral work in which not only good manners and judicious decisions are privileged, but also virtue.When Plato cast poets and artists out of his Utopian Republic, little did he realize that one can learn virtue from literature as well as from philosophy. And that is a 'truth universally acknowledged.'[...]"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"i thank god for ms austen. amazing writing, i just don't have the words.

Sure, some of the young women get married by the end, and the romance of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy is very diverting, but that's not the whole point of the story. For the most part, it deals with the observations of the author, as well as those of Elizabeth and, on a smaller scale, Mr. Bennet. There is social commentary on the ideas of class that many people of that era held so dearly, and the way some of them behaved to get the results they desired, regardless of whom they hurt. Pride and Prejudice also pokes fun at human frailty and absurdity, which, I believe, crosses the boundaries of time. I found myself laughing out loud at some points at the behavior of the minor characters and how some of the major characters reacted to it. Most importantly, there is a lesson to be learned: how a good person can overcome his or her first impressions, his or her pride and prejudice, and get to know the real heart and soul of the person. As some other reviewers have said, the enjoyment of this novel is in the journey, not the ultimate ending.I think those who called it boring more likely found the slightly antiquated and verbose language a bit too difficult to follow. I will admit I was a bit daunted by it at the beginning, but once I got into the flow of the novel, I realized it wasn't that hard. One thing that really helped me get into the novel (which I highly recommend) was watching the excellent 1995 A&amp;E/BBC adaptation before reading it. By doing that, I knew what was going to happen and could pay more attention to the inner workings of the novel, the commentary. As I read, I found myself really enjoying the language (rather than hoping for a translator to appear) and wishing I could argue as eloquently as Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy seemed to do.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a sharp, acerbic commentary on the absurdity of human nature, and I wish those who gave it one or two stars would give it another try."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"_Pride and Prejudice_ is the story of Elizabeth Bennett, one of my favorite heroines(I think that every strong heroine since must be based on her in some way), and Mr. Darcy, one of my favorite heroes(I've been in love with him since I first read the book). There are misunderstandings and scandals and very irksome supporting characters that you just want to strangle, but it's a wonderful book that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"My measure of a superb novel is the ability to read it many times and be able to find something new or to see characters and occurences from a different perspective. This novel never disapoints. With each reading, Mr. and Mrs. Elliot have become more complex, funnier, and also sadder. Jane has become more than just a sweet girl pining for a lost love. Her passivity and inability to express her emotions seem a subtle warning to those of us who may share Jane's foibles. Elizabeth seems more self-conscious, more aware of her times, a woman's place, and the class system within which she must operate. Against this background she appears braver and wittier, her observations more trenchant. It would be hard to find a character as pompous and awful as Mr. Collins, yet he also elicits one's sympathy. And Mr. Darcy is wonderful in his rudeness and his smoldering desire. His haughty proposal to Elizabeth and her stinging reply are still hurtful. His subsequent letter is the opening gambit to the breaking down of Darcy's pride and Elizabeth's prejudice. These characters are so real and their emotions so true that the 150-plus years that separate us quickly disappear."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I thought this book was great. Not only is Elizabeth a strong main character, but the supporting characters make the book very enjoyable. They are so funny; especially the mother. I couldn't put it down. I loved it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I must confess up front that I am a sucker of love stories. As such, Pride and Prejudice had me hook, line, and sinker from the beginning, turning page after page to find out if Elizabeth, the heroine, would find happiness in the end.A female friend of mine recommended the book to me (as did my girlfriend) with the caveat that most guys she knew complained that &quot;nothing happened&quot; in it. Needless to say, if you're looking for action and intrigue, look elsewhere. There is some little intrigue in Pride and Prejudice, but the heroine(s) play a strictly passive role. All the excitement in the novel stems from the suspense of the Bennet sisters' romances.Another minor caveat: I was initially slightly distracted by Austen's style of writing, which sometimes seems a bit distant from the action of the narrative (at least to someone more accustomed to more modern works).However, I feel that this hardly detracts from what recommends Pride and Prejudice the most (and what all love stories require): interesting characters to whom the reader can become emotionally attached and believable obstacles to their deserved happiness."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is a true English masterpiece. Not only is it magical,funny and sensitive. Austen also manages to entice you into her world. She creates the most perfect hero in Mr Darcy, a man willing to do anything to be with the woman he loves, even if it means having to stand Mrs Bennet as his mother-in-law. With Elizabeth, Austen manages to create a heroine who could easily be envied in both the nineteeth and twentieth just for her wit, intelligence and her honesty. Do not judge this book before reading it as a girly, old and an out dated piece that your English teacher rambles on about. It really does make you realise that there was life so long ago, and people have not really changed that much."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This book is one of the greatest classics I have ever read. The story of five young daughter's lovelives, along with their impertinent mother and lovable but sarcastic father, it is definitely a good read. The plot picks up as the book progresses, leaving the reader striving to know one thing: will Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy realize their profound love for one another and finally get together? I definitly reccomend reading this book. Try it, you will love it!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I must be honest and say that I had a prejudice against the book. I never thought that I would ever enjoy such a novel. To my surprise I could not put it down. The characters had charisma and charm and the tale holds a universal theme that can be understood despite the decades. I throughly enjoyed this book. A classic, timeless, and amazing piece of literature, I have the utmost regards for this novel. It was a spectacular piece of work that I cannot say enough about. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This novel took me completely by surprise. I had seen the movies &quot;Emma&quot; and &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, and I decided to give this one a chance. It is by far, one of the best romance novels I've ever read. It is old-style romance, and yet the language and the feelings of Elizabeth Bennet truly capture every essence of what a woman feels when encountered with different situations. Although we see everything mostly through the eyes of Lizzy, a person cannot help to admire Jane Austen's ability to let your imagination be transported, momentarily, to a world where human beings are not so evil after all, and love is worth more than what is portrayed today in the media. Although the movie is very accurate, I would strongly encourage everyone to read this novel. If it is, indeed, Jane Austen's best work, it is absolutely worth every penny. Let yourself be absorbed into this magnificent story of all-time, and don't be surprised if by the end of it you feel like reading it all over again."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Anyone who has ever abandoned a first impression of another for quite an opposite assessment of the person... or had a disingenuous &quot;friend&quot;... or been mortified by a parent's behavior in front of someone whose opinion mattered... or had a wanton and unrepentant sibling... or been able to lay bear to an object of affection the true meaning of all of the crossed signals and misunderstandings that occurred up until that point... To any such persons (and several more), Austen's novel, though nearly two hundred years old, will surely ring true. As in most any romantic comedy, there is not much question of the couple(s!) getting together in the end, but it's the getting there--and, of course, the revelation of it all in the end--that is the fun."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Read this, and then re-read this. You will see elements to most every romance novel, play and movie produced since this work was published. If you're a bit obsessive, you may even become an Austenite, seeking P&P rewrites, continuations, movies derived from it, etc. My faves of these are Bridget Jones's Diary (the first book and movie), The Bar Sinister (book continuation), and Lost in Austen (movie). There are TONS of these types of adaptations and explorations of the original novel, and for good reason: it is excellent."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Believe it or not, I had never actually read Pride and Prejudice, though I have been an English and Drama teacher for over a decade. This book not only gave me the full text, but the little \\"insights\\" in the margin were interesting and often inspired my interest even more into the works of Austen. I think this would be a great book for everyone - those who have never read it and those who are on their hundredth reading. Kudos to the author."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I would have liked to have met Jane Austen, and I think she would find it entertaining that her books have lasted as long as they did.I won't review the book itself, but rather, the Kindle version of it. The book was free (amazing) and works splendidly across my non-Kindle devices, my iPod touch and my Blackberry. That way, I can sneak 10-15 mins worth of reading in on the train or bus without worrying about people making judgements about a man reading Austen.The test of a classic novel is whether or not you want to keep it handy and refer to it when you need inspiration, a solid read or just to get lost in a different world. Thanks to the Kindle edition of Pride and Prejudice, I can pretend I'm in the world of Mr. Darcy."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Before I read this book I saw the 2005 film starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen. I loved the movie and I was inspired instantly to read Jane Austen's classic novel. Despite the fact that I had already seen the movie and knew the general progression of events I was still captivated by the novel. Jane Austen writes with an incredible literary style that is lacking in the works of most contemporary authors. She has an eloquence of words that is complex and yet far easier to read than most people seem to think. Though I am usually not a fan of novels that are based in reality without any hint of the supernatural I was enthralled by Austen's timeless love story which will leave every female reader pining for the dark and brooding Mr. Darcy."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen is an incredibly talented author and although I do love her other books, I do believe that Pride and Prejudice is her best work. I am one of those individuals who thoroughly enjoys reading great literature from around the world but to be completely honest, I had never read this book until after the new movie was released a couple years ago. After falling in love with the film, I went out immediately to purchase the novel and upon completion, Jane Austen \\"bewitched me body and soul\\" (as Mr. Darcy would say).Elizabeth Bennett remains to be one of the most complex, interesting, and relatable characters I have ever read. She encompasses all the alluring qualities a respectable lady was supposed to possess from that time era but additionally, many rebellious attributes that links her personality and inner battle with personal feelings vs. societal conventions, to modern day. She knows the place of women in the community- how they should talk, interact in society, her social standing, especially in relation to men, however, she also struggles with ideologies of romance and being her own individual- speaking her mind, voicing her opinions- no matter if it is Lady Catherine or her best friend Charlotte, as well as denying reputable marriage proposals for the hope of finding true love.Pride and Prejudice is not just an enrapturing love story but really transports you into a time period that is much different from today's world. It gives you insight into a completely different lifestyle, exposes the flaws and obsessions of a culture, and most importantly, it is all done so from a revolutionary point of view- the perspective of a woman who doesn't necessarily agree with the rules of societal acceptability.It is a great book and I whole-heartedly recommend reading it. And it only gets better each time you read it. I guarantee you too will fall in love with all the characters of Pride and Prejudice. If Lizzy or Mr. Darcy don't satisfy your need for a personal connection, I'm sure you can identify with the many other colorful characters- the deceiving, selfish, yet undeniably charming Mr. Wickham, the benevolent and kind spirited Jane Bennett, the frivolous Lydia Bennett, or even the middle child Mary Bennett, who even though is most accomplish, often goes unnoticed and under appreciated.

What I can do, however, is give an honest and heartfelt account of what I thought of Jane Austen's 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE'. I have always wanted to read some of the classics but have never up until now dug up the courage to actually do so. I thought if I was going to start reading a classic novel Jane Austen would probably be a good author to start with and what better choice was there than her stand out 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' ? I was pleased to find out that I was absolutely right. 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' has to be one of the most romantic novels that I have ever read. The romance between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy literally made me swoon quite often (and I don't swoon!). Romance mixed with a little bit of drama and Austen's most descriptive prose made it impossible for me to put this book down.

The characters, especially Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy are quite well drawn.

The point of view broadens as Elizabeth develops as a character and loses her prejudices, particularly against Mr. Darcy.Pride and Prejudice continues to be extremely popular and inspires many spin-offs including Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.

Once it did, however, I was completely enchanted. Our 21st century need for speed and immediate gratification takes a backseat as we move with Jane Austen through the every day lives and loves of her characters. The slow but steady pace of the novel allows the time to actually get to know and connect with the characters. Austen brings you fully into her world of 19th century England: with no difficulty you can feel the joys and sorrows, happiness and tribulations of the Bennet sisters and especially Elizabeth and Jane.Classic themes: scheming mothers, class distinctions, vanity, pride,false assumptions and misunderstandings abound...until by the novel's conclusion I could not help but find myself rooting for Elizabeth and Darcy.I thoroughly recommend this to anyone who loves classics and doesn't mind the slow pace that generally characterizes them."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I cannot even hope to do justice to how well written this book is.

The witty banter between Darcy and Elizabeth is always engaging and never fails to bring a smile to my face. Read this book. It is a must for everyone."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen, in her novel Pride and Prejudice, contrasts characters through a battle of social conflict. Elizabeth Bennet, a young woman of lively character, strives against an equal adversary, Fitzwilliam Darcy, a man well endowed by fortune. As the two haughtily battle wits, Mr. Darcy falls in love with Elizabeth, further complicating the story's intricate plot; while Elizabeth's sister, Jane, falls for Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy's best friend. Mr. Darcy's pride against Elizabeth's social standings and Elizabeth's unfounded prejudice against Mr. Darcy's seemingly snobbish habits form a classic tale of romance and humor.The intricate twists of fate intertwine the lovers in their conquests, defeats, and humbling of character. Mix-ups in the tale create a humorous love story with a relish for varied characters undoubtedly human in their emotions and actions. Austen vividly illustrates contrast in social class during the Regency era while exposing human flaws. Characters such as Mrs. Bennet, Lydia and Mr. Wickham warn the reader of the mishaps caused by characters unscrupulous in their wayward actions. Yet as the story unfolds, one cannot help but fall in love with this tale of a man and a woman beset by emotions they fall victim to."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Although I picked up the book for a 12th grade English class, Jane Austen captivated me with her polished dialogues and intricate descriptions. Pride and Prejudice is more than just a love story between Darcy and Elizabeth, and Bingley and Jane. It is a satire of a society in which money is the driving force behind love and social status means everything. The story is set in England and focuses on the four Bennet daughters, primarily with Elizabeth Bennet, who is the second oldest daughter. She meets Mr. Darcy at a ball and detests his pride. Although he is very rich and quite handsome, she is certain that Darcy thinks he is above his company, and that disgusts her. But although she is drawn to him by hate, the hate turns into love through a series of events and dialogue. Austen uses rich dialogues to form her comedy, and in the end a reader will not only learn that love can conquer all pride and prejudices, but he will also laugh at a society full of arranged marriages and love based on what a spouse could bring to a marriage. This book is a &quot;classic&quot; for good reason. Austen's diction is exquisite, somewhat challenging, but after a few chapters, she has the reader hooked. Although picked up for a 12th grade English class, I know I will pick up it up again and will pick up some of Austen's other books. I would recommend this book to other high schoolers that need to read a classic for school, but also to people of any age looking for an excellent piece of writing."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I like when that what I read is realy interesting.

It had a great plot and kept me looking forward to the next part. Another great thing about, while it was described wonderfully, it was not confusing and I was able to follow the story the whole way through the book. I also thought that the whole time period back then, though it had many bad aspects like a great rift between the very rich and others, was still a great time period with manners and etiquette that we in this time are lacking. Overall I really loved the book and am looking forward to reading other Jane Austen books."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It is almost 200 years since \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was first published. It ought to be the equivalent in literature of those faded, dried flowers that used to be found pressed between the pages of the old family bible. Instead it is redolent of freshly cut flowers still carrying a sprinkling of morning dew.The freshness and the perfection of form are certainly astonishing. Jane Austin is as good as story teller as ever picked up a pen, knowing exactly how to construct plots, and what incidents and dialogues to detail in full and what to briefly summarize. Her \\"world\\" is small but intricately constructed. Every characteristic, quality and idea has a precise and fixed value, all being ranked strictly and sternly according to decorum, logic and morality.Despite its architectural perfection, however, a recent re-reading reveals one or two construction features that are questionable. How could it be, for example that Fitzwilliam Darcy could have such a dragon for an aunt? I also wonder about the friendship between Darcy and Bingley. How did it begin? It is obviously important to each, but we are given nothing of its history.Jane Austen lived long enough to see this book published and enjoyed amongst her own family and a small readership. Her mother entertained family members with it, reading it, in Jane Austen's estimation, a little too quickly. Distinguished British actress Lindsay Duncan reads it with perfect timing and inflexion in this highly recommended audio tape format, which presents the novel in an unabridged version of just over twelve hours."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"You may have heard that literature is an example of the time and place during which it was written. Pride and Predjudice is such a book. While many think of it as a serious book, it is actually quite humerous. Austen's portrayal of love and marriage is a perfect example of how it should be. From marraige-obsessesed Mrs. Bennett, to the intelligent Lizzy to attractive Fitzwilliam Darcy, the book is a masterpiece! This is one book that I could (and have!) read over and over again.

Without a doubt, one of the best books I have ever read.Jane Austen proves that brevity is not the soul of wit.

A could not put it down.The only negative is the occasional typos (used \\"-----shire\\" a lot) and used only one letter initial for names in some areas. Annoying but it was free."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"A classic tale of the &#34;play hard to get&#34; gets you far! A little hard to read through if your not used to the old english. But never the less a classic tale of the dating game."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I read parts of this book to my wife, who, like so many female readers, had previously read it. So much has been already been written about the superb characterization and a decent plot, that I don't feel I can add much to it. I found the dialogue witty and intelligent.Austin demonstrates that timeless problem of how men and women continue to misunderstand each other. The language of civility is a hoot, and descriptions of what is socially appropriate add tensions and obstacles. This is a marvelous read and a worthwhile way to spend some time over the holidays."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"There was a time in our 20's and into our 30's that a slight film covered our lives. Metaphorically speaking, of course, we were wandering around in our own world of literary complacency. We never realized this, though much like those Claritin D commercials, all our surroundings became sharper and brighter, due to Jane Austen and her charming novel, Pride and Prejudice. We would ask you, oh kind reader, to cast every last ounce of your sense and sensibility aside and read this book. Just be careful that in hast you don't pick up Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, which has a slightly different take on this classic love story.Miss Elizabeth Bennett is the second oldest of five girls raised in a poor(ish) family on the English countryside, outside of London. Smart, funny, passionate, loyal, and a tad bit prideful, she is the literary heroine of our dreams. Enter Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth with a pair of awesome sideburns). Seemingly arrogant, self righteous, and uppity; our Eliza quickly decides what he can do with all his preconceptions. Upon our word, there is hardly a man quite as standoffish and rude as this gentleman... or is there? Don't be too quick to pass judgment.Pride and Prejudice is likeable on so many different levels. Austen does an amazing job of changing rudeness into shyness, fierce animosity into extreme thankfulness, and all around bad guys into good ones...and then changing them back with the snap of her fingers. Pride and Prejudice stands as one of our absolute favorites and we are still anxiously awaiting an invitation to Pemberley Estate so we can check out Darcy's impressive home library."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Unlike many required readings for high school literature classes, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is an engaging read. She builds the complexity of this novel with each additional character introduction. As the story progresses, I felt the connection between myself and the Bennet women develop. Though not as dramatic as the early 19th century, the same credentials for an acceptable relationship exist in the modern 21st century. Wealth and social status, as well as appearance were essential to the acceptance of a spouse, to avoid embarrassment to one's family. There remains an element of judgment in relationships today concerning individual etiquette, wealth and physical characteristics. This prejudice extends to peers and family members. In Pride and Prejudice, it contributed to the anxiety in the developing relationships between Jane and Mr. Bingley, as well as Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.In the opening of the novel, Darcy's pride leads to Elizabeth's prejudice against him. His admiration grows because of her rebuke. This scenario takes place in all aspects of our society. We want what we can't have or that which seems out of our reach. We are never satisfied. Darcy falls victim to these desires as Elizabeth's rebuke transforms his pride into admiration for her.Looking past the intricacy of the English language, I found Pride and Prejudice to be a novel of great complexity, where the lives of all characters are intertwined. From Mr. Collins marrying Charlotte Lucas, to Mr. Darcy finding Lydia for the Bennet's, each character had some effect on all the others. Austen keeps the reader wondering, only putting their minds to ease at the conclusion of the novel."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a perfect novel. The characters, story structure, humor and insights are brilliant."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I'm very biased because this is my favorite book of all time by one of my favorite autors. The story comes alive, the characters come alive. To me after years of reading and rereading the story, these characters are like people that really lived and I feel like I know them better then alot of real people. Wonderful book, if you've never read Jane Austen, start here and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"No need for lots of words here: this is one the best books ever written. Each re-reading highlights Austen's genius, as new gems are discovered throughout in various forms. 'nuff said."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful book! It is a timeless story about the tangled relationship between Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy. What I love so much about this book is how relevant these situations still are and how easy it is to relate to all of the characters. I have read other Jane Austin novels, and so far this is by far my favorite. Elizabeth is such a strong female character, and Mr. Darcy is a wonderfully complex and interesting male character. This is definitely one of my \\"comfort books.\\" Whenever I have had an unpleasant day or need to relax, rereading Pride and Prejudice always makes me feel better. Truly, it is on of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I love this 'Collector's Library' too. Yes, they used to have it in Barnes and Nobles but somehow they discontinued it.

Definitely her masterpiece. Wonderful love story, great characters. You won't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This particular DK edition includes footnoted definitions of terms, illustrated lessons about the time period and culture, and is unabridged. It is a sturdy, glossy paged paperback and has decorative edges on each page. A good library edition or student copy."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"While this title was Jane Austen's second published work, it is her most popular. First published in the late 18th century under the title \\"First Impressions\\", it was later revised and re-published under the current name.It is an entertaining view into 18-19th century courtship. Recommended for students and literature aficionados alike."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I decided on my own to read this book when I was just 12 years old. I immediately fell in love with the language, era, and setting, not to mention the characters and story. My all-time favorite book, I have read it several more times, and probably own every movie and mini-series version as well. Although ours is no longer a culture of manners, life events and human emotions never change. Superb reading!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The core character in this novel is Elizabeth, an attractive and intelligent 20 year-old and the second daughter (out of five) of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet. . Her mother's main interest is to see her five daughters, all eligible, nicely settled down and married to respectable and rich gentlemen.Elizabeth's personality, very unlike her mother's, unfolds throughout the pages in a crescendo of emotions resulting from various issues connected with the whole family saga and especially to her own contrasting feelings towards a certain young man, Mr. Darcy. Will Elizabeth's passionate and sensible nature, combined with a certain degree of boldness (for those days), make her discover what lies beyond his seemingly unpleasant and unreadable personality?The graceful politeness in the prose is charming, delineating a faithful image of life at the end of the 18th century in England.The intrigues beyond wished-for marriages are very accurately described by Ms. Austen, with a touch of humour \\"hither and thither\\". I could not help myself comparing similar issues with nowadays. Beyond the characterisation and a part from the language, style and general progress, I believe that human nature, as depicted, is the same as it always was and it is not all just about \\"love\\", it is also about people attempting to incorporate into a higher position in society, seeking integration at a greater level. It was also interesting, I thought, to see how relevant (or irrelevant) the \\"worth\\" bestowed on the female gender was back then, compared to the present day in most societies. This, combined with the rapidity with which one fell in love, got engaged and/or was forbidden or denied to marry, could be stimulating subjects for ensuing conversations."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice was a good book, I really like it. Pride and Prejudice basically was about marriages. In old England, a man who has good fortune must need a good manner and charming wife, and a grown girl who has good education, high manner, a litter beauty must in want of a husband. That is why the whole story happen. In the author Miss Austen's book, she used very decent and nice words, and she described the emotion of the characters truely and let people feel the characters really existed."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a classic, no doubt about it, but why should anyone read it now? Austen's humor and satire are a bit understated in today's world, but for the reader who pays attention to the details and to whitty dialog, should get a kick out of numerous scenes throughout the novel. Another gift that Austen has is being able to portray intense emotions without having to spell those emotions out. I first read this book as a freshman in high school and I didn't finish it until the second attempt. After that I forgot most of what I read and then had to reread it about four years later and now read it every year just to remind myself what a classic book is really like."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I've just finished reading this book again for probably the 20th time. The first time I read it was in my early 20s. I was amazed that Elizabeth, the main character, a young woman in her 20s from early 19th century England,was so likeable and full of life. I definitely related to her.Seeing the famous BBC/A&amp;E production in the mid 1990s only increased my joy of this book.Austen was an incredible observer of the manners and mores of her time. This book lets her playfulness and human spirit shine through.This is one title I will never tire of reading."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This book is filled with memorable characters and beautifully written prose that deserve applause. I instantly liked it from the first paragraph. Certainly literature that demands a second reading."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is surely the most delicious of Jane Austen's novels. Austen writes with superb insight of the era she was living in!The characters are wonderful - the spirited and rebellious Lizzie Bennett, proud and handsome Darcy, the gloriously silly Mrs Bennett and the ogre that is Lady Catherine de Burgh. If you only ever read one classic novel, then this is the one to read. Follow it with the BBC video version (1995), a glass of wine, a large box of chocs. and curl up on the sofa. Enjoy !!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I was forced to read Jane Austen's &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; as an assignment in my British Literature class. Though it was not a voluntary thing at first, it soon became one. I could kiss my english teacher for making me read this! I read it in three days, hardly stopped to put it down, it was so engrossing. After reading it I promptly went out and watched the 5 hour A&amp;E movie (Colin Firth is to die for, and it stays truer to the book than any other movie I've seen thus far).Austen's writing style is brilliant and has such a nice, familiar tone that even though she is poking fun at much of society, she was probably quite fond of her characters. Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine, was a wonderful character and is by far one of the most real fictional people I have ever had the pleasure of reading about. I love how her relationship with Mr. Darcy changes gradually and his true character is revealed. My only wish is that sequels were in style then and Austen had thought to right one or simply make the book longer.I had to read this book because it is a classic. However, I would recommend this book to everyone, not because it is a classic, but because it is such a beautiful story with 3-dimensional characters who will pull you into a world you will not want to leave."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is an amazing, amazing critique and representation of nineteenth century society. All I have to say is wow. This edition, however, is very small print, and definitely not easy on the eye. I am reviewing this one because it was the version that recieved from school. It is so enticing, once i reached about halfway through the book, I couldn't put it down at all. I was delighted with the complexity of the characters and the way in which Jane Austen opens up the thought process of the main character, Elizabeth. This is one of the few classics that deserves the word &quot;classic&quot; to be applied to it. Pride and Prejudice is a must read for anyone, but requires a substantial amount of thought and maturity. I loved it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I must admit that when I finally finished reading Pride and Prejudice I wish I hadn't finished. This is by far the best story i have ever read in my short life. This woman is one of the best writers I have ever encountered and this novel got me hooked. I was so detirmined to finish it that i stayed up all night long reading. I could not wait to see what was ever to become of Elizabeth and Darcy. I started reading it as an assignment for my 9th grade honors english class one week ago and was kicking myself at the end of the book for not reading it on my own. I have now started Sense and Sensibility but I am sure that nothing could be as good as Pride and Prejudice. If anyone hasnt read this you are missing out on a great story. I have yet to see the mini series but i plan on borrowing it from my teacher. I urge everyone to experience Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The book was recommened to me and I did not think that I would enjoy it, but I started reading it anyway. The book drew me in adn I could not put it down. The characters are all so charming. Elizabeth Bennet is by far my favorite character. She is very admirable, witty, smart, well informed and always polite. She was always more concerned with her sister's love life then with her own. This brings us to another character, Jane Bennet. Jane is the prettiest in the Bennet family and her mother's favorite child. Her relationship with Mr. Bingley, the new neighbor, is the talk of the town. Their relationship is referred to a lot in the book, but the novel focused mostly on Elizabeth and her relationship with Mr. Darcy. This is waht kept me interested in the book. The story line is romatnic and kept me guessing as to what was going to happen next. The question throughout the novel is if anything will happen between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys romantic story lines."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I had expected this book to be so dry and boringly romantic that I almost loathed the idea of starting it. Once I got into it, however, I had to admit that not only was this book really well written, but it was far more captivating than I ever imagined it would be. The book is true to its title, using the plot of Elizabeth and her sisters and family to illustrate thoroughly the concepts of pride and prejudice as they related to 19th century England society. This book and its sister novel, &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; are both not only better written than most contemporary novels, but also share appropriately the attributes of being timeless novels. Though much lighter in spirit than many other &quot;timeless&quot; works of that and other early eras, particularly Joyce or Wilde, the novels nonetheless convey well an important intellectual body of work and culture."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I first read this book when I was about 15 years old, and I loved it. Even though it took me some time to understand the old english text, the meaning was still there. Just recently (now I am 18) I saw the tv mini series of Pride and Prejudice, and fell in love with it all over again! You can feel Mr. Darcy's anguish as he watches Lizzie from afar, and you squirm in your chair knowing that Lizzie despises Darcy because she thinks that he abhors her. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet make you laugh, and you can just feel the embarrassment that the younger sisters bring to the older ones. This is the most amazing story, and I do not feel that it is in the least an ordinary one. It is a hold-your-breath romance with comedy, intrigue, a little suspense, and coincidence. A beautiful tale of old English life, and an easy to love character - Elizabeth Bennet. This is by far my favorite story of all time. I recommend to anyone - including younger people."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"THIS IS A WONDERFUL LOVE STORY THAT HAS EVER BEEN WRITTEN.

I was fascinated by the little details of the characters' lives."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"How a spinster who was living in relative isolation in the English countryside during the earliest years of the 19th century was able to write the ultimate romance novel is a question that nobody now alive can answer.Yet in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, this is exactly what author Jane Austen has accomplished.Written at a moment in time when it clearly was too early to have been inspired by the writings of other authors, P-and-P has every component that the greatest love stories require. The lovers meet, there is tension, there is conflict, there is separation and, finally, with the reader's pulse quickened, there is the acknowledgment of their feelings for one another.Lizzie Bennett and her hero, the conveniently rich Fitzwilliam Darcy, are two of the most significant lovers to be found in literature. And, in creating them, Jane Austen laid the groundwork for the elements that would need to be present in the modern romance novel.All of Miss Austen's books are worth reading, but PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is unique among them in being great."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"My favorite chapter in the novel Pride and Prejudice is chapter 16 of volume III (or chapter 58) because Elizabeth finally accepts Darcy's marriage proposal. It amazed me how she was still able to say yes after she was insulted in every way possible especially after disliking him so much in the beginning of the novel.This book is appropriate for anyone who is able to appreciate well-written literature. Anyone would enjoy reading this book, from teenagers to adults.One literary device I appreciated was epigram, which is a brief, clever, and usually memorable statement. An example of this would be \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in wants of a wife\\" which is found on the first page of the novel. The entire novel was based on this quote. Mrs. Bennet wanted to get all five of her daughters married before her husband died.I liked the novel. I found Elizabeth's romance with Darcy intriguing. It was interesting how in the beginning she rejected his proposal and disliked him, and at the end she marries him."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"My favorite chapter in the novel Pride and Prejudice is chapter 16 of volume III (or chapter 58) because Elizabeth finally accepts Darcy's marriage proposal.

It's very detailed and it's a very easy to comprehend and read. When you read this book you will have a better vision of the women in the 19th century had to live. It also talked about entailment, which means that after the father dies , the next male heir takes over the property and females are not able to inherit.The novel is not your usual love story because in the beginning of this story the two characters who treat each other as if they were the devil end up falling for each other; although, in the beginning of the story you get a sense of who the characters are going to end up with, except one or two couples. My favorite chapter in this novel is the first chapter because it deals with pride and prejudice, exactly the title of the novel. In the first chapter you see that Darcy has a lot of pride and Elizabeth's prejudice towards Darcy.I like Jane Austen's use of dramatic irony because we as the readers know what's going to happen before the characters, like as the story goes on we know that Darcy will ended up with Elizabeth by the way they treat each other. I would recommend people of 16 and up to read this book because this novel does not make you want to go to sleep. It makes you want to keep reading."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice was such a delight to read. Anybody who enjoys reading will love the book. Its tales of love and money will grab and hold your attention. The author's use of conflict between her characters is marvelously done. Conflict was a literary device I appreciated from the book. It brings interest, excitement and wonder to the story.A favorite chapter of mine would have to be chapter nineteen. Austen's portrait of Mr. Collin is solidified in this chapter. The manner in which he proposed to Elizabeth was a prime example of his pompous nature.Pride and Prejudice is a light-hearted and romantic book. I would recommend the book to any teenager or adult. Its topics are very relatable to both age groups."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a classic novel from the 19th century. It is by far one of the best books I have ever read.The conflict that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go through is what makes this book such an exciting love story. I would say that the best chapter of this story is chapter 7 volume 1, where Jane goes to Mr. Bingley's on the horse and gets a cold. This is the part of the story were things start to change. One example of this would be the interest that Mr. Darcy starts to show for Elizabeth. This happens because Jane catches a cold on her way to the Bingley's house and Elizabeth goes to the Bingley's house to take care of her sister. As Darcy spends time with Elizabeth, he starts to show interest in Liz.Another important thing about this book is that Jane Austen uses imagery very well to make us get into the book. I must say that there were times when I was caught up in reading since everything was well described. An example of Austen using imagery is when she describes what kind of people the Bennet's mom and dad are. For example, at the beginning of the story, the writer talks about Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Bennet and how different the two people are. In chapter 1 the author describes Mrs. Bennet as a foolish person and a fussy gossiper. Mr. Bennet is quiet and kept to himself. In chapter 4 we have a very good description of personalities in two different important characters, Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bingley is cheerful and sociable while Mr. Darcy is clever but less tactful, and unlike Mr. Bingley he finds the people dull; in other words, he criticizes people way too much.I would recommend this book for high school students because it opens your mind to new and real things. It teaches you, mostly girls, to value the liberties that are given to you. I say this because back then women didn't have many choices or liberties to do what they wanted. Back then women had to do what their husband wanted and now women have many liberties."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"My favorite chapter in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is chapter thirty four because this chapter presented the plot's climax. The author has carefully built the plot so that Darcy's proposal comes at the height of Elizabeth's anger toward him. This chapter presents a new obstacle in the plot, Darcy's proposal to Elizabeth, who promptly turns him down. If Darcy had worded his proposal in a romantic way, Elizabeth would have reacted differently, but Darcy's pride makes him act in a superior way. When he proposes, he indicates that he makes the offer in spite of her minor social position and her ignorant family. Elizabeth's previously established prejudice against Darcy is intensified and she does not even consider marrying such an arrogant man. Darcy accuses Elizabeth of being too proud, while Elizabeth accuses him of being prejudiced, but the truth is that both characters are guilty of pride and prejudice.The ages for which this book would be appropriate are ages thirteen and up because it gives a good lesson on what life was like in the early nineteenth century. For example, women can't inherit their own estate; only men can.One literary device that I appreciate is Satire. The author satirizes the manners of all classes, exposing people who have excessive pride as rude and often foolish, regardless of wealth.I like this book because in many ways it is a very accurate portrayal of what a woman's life was like in the early nineteenth century. Its message is that love is more important than financial gain."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a one-of-a-kind book. When your start to read this intriguing book, you will see its magnificent plot. The main focus of the novel is the Bennet family. The family worried because their estate is entailed and Mr. and Mrs. Bennet only have daughters. When an estate is entailed, only a male can inherit the estate. Mrs. Bennet wants to help her daughter find a wealthy husband so she could be financially well off, but that wasn't her only reason. She also wanted to see her daughters get married and become mothers. That's where the entire novel becomes interesting.Well I don't really have a favorite chapter because it had many chapters that caught my attention and made me see things in another way. But if I would have to choose a chapter I would choose chapter one because that's where you see what the novel will be about. This novel would be perfect for teenagers and up to read.One literary device that I appreciated from the novel was imagery because I could picture big events in the novel in my head. For example, one big event that I could picture in my head was when Charles Bingley, a wealthy man, rented the manor known as Netherfield Park and that causes a great stir in the neighboring village of Longbourn. What specifically creates an image for me is that Jane Austen is very descriptive in her writing and she has a way of showing things to the readers. To be descriptive in her writing she uses powerful words to set the mood for what's taking place. For example, in chapter 22 and 23, news arrives that Mr. Collins has proposed marriage to Charlotte Lucas and she has accepted. Elizabeth is shocked but Mrs. Bennet, of course, is furious with her daughter Elizabeth for allowing a husband to escape her. Before that had happened, Mr. Collins had proposed marriage to Elizabeth, but she had refused. The mood went from pleasant to drastic in such a short moment. I really like this awesome novel because it opened up a new world for me; it showed me that in the old days things were different from what they are now."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is an illustrious and fascinating book to read because of its twisted plot that attracts readers. What really made me crave the book was the love-hate relationship Elizabeth and Darcy maintained. My favorite chapter of the book was chapter two in volume III where Austen gives an optimistic overview on Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship as well as Jane and Bingley. She expresses Elizabeth's strong feelings towards Darcy and foreshadows a second proposal.I enjoyed reading the book because of the setting and the era in which it was written. It's quite interesting to read their proper English and try to understand their rare humor. I believe that the right type of age group would be senior students, around the age of seventeen to eighteen and above because of the mature language the author uses. I strongly recommend this book especially to women who like &quot;fairy tale&quot; type of endings in a novel.The literary device that I appreciated was dramatic irony because I found it appealing to see how Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship was going to end up. It was exhilarating to see that Darcy was going to propose to Elizabeth for the second time and she not know about it while she was thinking she had lost him forever. That to me was good enough to want to read the book all over again."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is an excellent novel written in the 19th century about the hardships of love, pride, and prejudices.My favorite chapter in Pride and Prejudice is Chapter 8, Volume 1. In this chapter, Elizabeth goes to visit her sick sister, Jane, at the Bingley's estate and during her stay at Netherfield, Caroline continues to insult her. ELizabeth, being the head-strong, outspoken person she is, became fed up with Caroline's constant insultsand began to reciprocate in the same manner and made Caroline feel foolish.Pride and PRejudice is a great, romantic classic that most people would enjoy. In my opinion, this particular novel is directed towards a more mature audience. Because of the sophisticated language and the constant event change, I also think that this novel should be read at a high school level or higher, depending on the person's own reading level and his/her understanding of the use of language in the 19th century.One literary device that I appreciate is the external conflict between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. At first Elizabeth &quot;could hardly stand to be in the same room as him,&quot; but as the plot progresses, she and Mr. Darcy become infatuated with each other and will not speak of their hidden feelings.I enjoyed this novel because it challenged my mind. It made me wonder what role women play in today's society: it has indeed changed dramatically, but the process has been slow. The novel forced me to think about my past predilections and the disorder they caused in my life."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It is, to put it simply, unequalled. Not many books come as close to perfection as this one does. Flawless prose, crackling wit, good drama, fully developed characters and a perfect plotline make this the best novel in the English language. You may argue with me if you wish, there is no other book that satisfies like this one. Jane Austen was a woman for all time and she was a genius in every sense of the word. She understood people. We are blessed to have with us this remarkable work. How did she pull it all off so beautifully?I do not write much because I think that you, dear reader, should get your hands on this one pronto and stop reading this brief, rather trite review that does not come anywhere close to revealing Ms. Austen's creativity. I have returned to Longbourne, Netherfield and Pemberley several times in my life and will continue to do so. If I have the good fortune to meet Ms. Austen in the after-life, I hope that she will give me an autograph. Or at the very least, give me a nod in my direction."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I recently finished my 3rd reading of P&P;, and I cannot begin to say how much I loved it. This is one of those novels that you can read over and over and never get tired of because you find something new every time! One of the most satisfying experiences is just being able to go through it slowly and savor every little turn of phrase, though for me this was not possible until I had already read it and didn't have the urge to rush on and see how it ended. As for the novel itself, so many people have given a synopsis that it would be pointless for me to do so. All I will say is that if it sounds dull just from reading about it, I still would not give up because Austen is one of the few authors whose works are very difficult to give a plot summary for that does justice to the story.One other thing- I would also recommend this edition because it is one of the most pretty and elegant I have seen, yet still very affordable. A fan of Austen who would like to upgrade to a nicer edition of the novels should really consider Everyman's Library because there are few others that are more lovely or durable.In short, don't miss out on this wonderful reading experience!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the most beautiful and well-written stories throughout the centuries. It isn't meant to be viewed as a serious tale, but is instead satirical, poking fun at the different conventions of society at the time. The heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, is well-developed and extremely likeable, as is her sister, Jane. Even Mr. Darcy, whom everyone dislikes in the beginning of the novel, is likeable in his somewhat clumsy love for Elizabeth. The struggle that Darcy and Elizabeth go through to finally admit their love is complex and draws the reader into the story even further. I must say that my favorite character is Mr. Bennet, because his off-the-wall humor had me laughing out loud several times throughout reading the book. I read this book when I was 13 and thought it was wonderful, and over the years it has become even better. This book is such a remarkable piece of literature that it only gets more interesting and more fruitful of a read the more times you actually pick the book up and read it. Jane Austen is a master of literature."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"When I read this Jane Austen novel, I couldn't help falling in love with it. The romance, which I think plays the main part,was overwhelming, along with the beautiful charactirazation and the so well-thought plot. This novel contains everything it should contain to be a bestseller, and a besteller it is, even almost 200 years after it was written. This book is a true recommendation for everyone who likes his or her books well-written and full of humor, love, intrigues, social developments and such lively and realistic characters. Somehing that struck me, was the fact that Elizabeth is such an quick-witted girl that is so modern for her time: she wants to marry for love, (which girl wouldn't want that?! it really is just like a fairy-tale) and she has got a will of her own. She doesn't like to be toyed with and she has got her feminin pride that makes her so strong. Should you be considering reading this book, don't hesitate and just grab it, and you will soon see: it grabs you!&lt;BR"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"In &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; Jane Austen creates an entire universe out of the circumscribed world of genteel British society. The main focus of the novel is the Bennet family, consisting of a nervous and silly mother, her indolent and sarcastic husband, and their five daughters. Mrs. Bennet desperately wants her daughters to marry wealthy men, especially since Mr. Bennet's property will go to a male cousin, Mr. Collins, upon Mr. Bennet's death.Soon, a likely marriage prospect appears in the person of Mr. Bingley, who rents a nearby home in Netherfield Park. Mrs. Bennet hounds her husband to call on Mr. Bingley immediately so that the Bennets can make his acquaintance. To Mrs. Bennet's delight, Mr. Bingley proves to be a perfectly amiable and wealthy gentleman. However, his close friend, Fitzwilliam Darcy, is quite the opposite of Bingley. Darcy is a man whose arrogance and cold demeanor make him immediately unpopular with the Bennets, especially with Elizabeth Bennet, one of the daughters whom he particularly insults.&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; deals with the preconceived notions that people have about one another and how these ideas wreak havoc with relationships. Austen also casts her astute eye on the social mores of the time which made both men and women slaves to convention. Marriage was not just a pleasant state for a woman. It was a necessity, especially if her family lacked the means to support her for the rest of her life.One of the most noteworthy aspects of this novel is Austen's lively cast of characters. Elizabeth Bennet is surely one of the most vivacious, witty, and entrancing heroines in British fiction, and she meets her match in the dashing, proud, and inscrutable Mr. Darcy. Austen's portraits of the stuffy and pompous Mr. Collins and his overbearing and opinionated patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, are hilarious.Austen's novel is a high-class soap opera in many respects, with a myriad of romantic entanglements and much intrigue to keep the reader engrossed. However, it is much more than that. It is a masterful tale of how people deceive themselves and the traps that they fall into when they are weak-minded and easily manipulated by others. &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is also a beautiful and romantic story of how men and women find their soul mates in spite of seemingly insurmountable obstacles."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"If a classic is boring, then this is not a classic. If a drawing-room comedy is stiff and trivial, then this is not a drawing-room comedy. This is quite simply one of the loveliest, wittiest, most utterly _wise_ novels ever written about human relationships. Every word sparkles. The dialogue fairly dances. And Austen does this without any of the things that we often assume make for an exciting novel. The most suspenseful question that arises is whether a certain two characters in the novel have gone to Scotland or to London (this is suspenseful for reasons having to do with 18th-century English marriage laws and social mores). And this event, certainly the most sensational in the book, is really only important because it helps the two central characters make up their minds about each other. Austen's world is a world in which every detail really counts--in which the slightest look or the most insignificant word can have earth-shaking meaning. And the result of this, as of all great literature, is to send us back into our own worlds with the renewed conviction that it all really does matter. In that sense, Austen's &quot;realistic&quot; fiction is a lot like good fantasy, such as Lord of the Rings. By heightening certain aspects of our experience, Austen gives new life to the &quot;commonplace&quot; world we live in. This is a book that makes you feel alive, and glad of it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I found Pride and Prejudice an engrossing and well written novel. The book gives modern readers insight into the Victorian society, morality, and etiquette. The novel is made up of fascinating, well-developed three-dimensional characters. I loved Darcy and Elizabeth; although both were flawed people, they also had an essential humanity and goodness to them that made me root for them to get together. I thought the way Elizabeth's feelings for Darcy evolved was very realistic. I admired Darcy's love for his sister, and his strength, while finding myself frustrated by his arrogance and aloofness. I thought Elizabeth was a heroine modern women could relate to - she had fire, confidence and forthrightness.I also enjoyed the complex relationships between the various characters, be it Jane and Elizabeth, Elizabeth and Mr. Bennett, and Mr. and Mrs. Bennett. What I liked was that even the characters we weren't meant to like, such as Lady Catherine, were not one-dimensional (this isn't the case in Mansfield Park). I was just as interested in finding out what would happen to Lydia and Jane as I was in the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy. The one complaint I have here is that I wish that Darcy and Elizabeth had gotten closer sooner, so that the conflict with Lady Catherine could have been a bigger part of the novel. There were events that I wish had occurred earlier so that more time could have been spent on them - the novel got off to a slow start.That said, overall this novel has much better pacing than other classic literature I have read (notably Mansfield Park). The author does provide a great deal of detail and description, but she is such a good writer, and the prose is so captivating, that I didn't mind at all. The dialogue is superb. The novel had a lot of charming, funny moments. The uses of satire and irony were exceedingly well done; Austen is the master of this sort of comedy of manners."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is my all-time favorite book, and believe me, I've read MANY novels. Jane Austen has excellently captured human nature here, and all of her characters reflect the environment they grew up in which was determined by the social classes of the time period.The main conflict of the book is based on the interactions between these social classes, which is reflected by the title. The prejudice and pride of BOTH the upper and middle class is what the story revolves around, but it isn't the action and intrigue that mark this book, it is the characters that make this &quot;Timeless Masterpiece.&quot;Elizabeth Bennet, whose liveliness and quick wit have often attracted readers, is the main character from the middle class. Mr. Darcy is her counterpart from the upper class. These two drive the book, adding humor and depth with every word.Everyone over the age of 12, including BOTH males and females, should read this book. This isn't a silly romance novel for young girls, it is a classic masterpiece."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I love this book. It has so many levels. On the surface, it's a book about 5 silly airheads who chase men &amp; go to parties. They obsess over all the single men in town &amp; how much money the men have. On a deeper level, you see that women in that time period had no rights. They couldn't even own their own home. Their very existance depended upon finding a suitable husband. Of course they were interested in catching a rich man!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It doesn't get much better than Pride &amp; Prejudice, people! A smart, witty, and sarcastic heroine like Elizabeth Bennet, a man like *drool* Mr. Darcy...and the burning question: can they overcome their first impressions of each other? My absolute favorite book!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I found this book to be humorous and light-hearted. It was also satirical about society during the eighteenth century. Historically, the book was accurate and interesting. The book had a variation of themes; comedy, romance, irony, and so on. The style of the book enables you to feel the moods of the main characters. I felt hatred for Mr. Darcy and his stubbornness. Mr. Bennet's attitude about his wife and family was witty. Each character had their own unique characteristic, which showed the differences and faults of society.The situation between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy grows along with their love. The irony of how subtle their love has grown for each other is very entertaining. No one truly believed that Elizabeth loved Mr. Darcy rather she was spiteful towards him. But as the book progresses, she learns about her harsh judgments about him and falls in love for him. Her sister, Jane does not even believe in this love.The book also shows how life sometimes works out for the better when expecting the worst. The complications and different views on marriage show how people do not think a like. Charlotte Lucas, Lizzie's friend, does not believe in marriage for love, rather she thinks marrying comfortably is more than enough. In life, there are ups and downs, along with each human being. She rather learns about them after she is in wedlock, then learning before hand. Although everyone believes that Jane and Mr. Bingly would be married and loved each, conflicts occur. Different people, separating the two, misled Mr. Bingly and Jane. Luckily, the truth is learned and things work out. Lizzie has the most conflicts of them all. She finds a new guy that she likes, but realizes she loves the person who she least expected it from, Mr. Darcy.Overall the book was well written and I enjoyed the letters from others, showing each person's different perspective and styles. The details and descriptions are magnificent and captivating."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"although some may not notice it, this Austen novel is romantically-centered. The subtlety of the liaison between Darcy and Elizabeth and their psychological games leave the reader with the impression that the protagonist is doomed to spinsterhood, while her sisters one by one are exfoliated away by their respective bridegrooms.It's not until towards the conclusion of the story that Austen finally gratifies her desires by ( spoiler! ) bringing Darcy and Eliza together. Romance, courtship, and flirtation perceived as daring back in Austen's pre-Victorian era are so uncouth and perplexing to the modern reader that he/ she might miss out on a truly light-hearted romantic comedy with ludic characters and good-natured humor.This is one of Austen's finest works and I regard her as one of the great writers, female or otherwise."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"As embarrassing as it sounds, I must make a confession: I, a male college student, was up till two a.m. on a Saturday finishing this book. In short, the novel is well worth the attention of any personality type, any demographic, any fancy, any interest. It is a marvelous story, written flawlessly, and with such a humorous personality to bind it all together that one might frequently erupt aloud in laughter.The laughter, while abundant and universally entertaining, does not supercede the primary intentions of this novel, signified in the title by &quot;Pride&quot; and &quot;Prejudice.&quot; And, indeed, in these two arenas, Austin succeeds marvelously in creating a tale that thrusts upon the reader both of these emotions, causing him to experience and be embarrassed by his own possession of these two traits. In that case, Pride and Prejudice is a work of pure genius. Especially with the subject of the Prejudice, the reader becomes so involved in the misconceptions and assumptions between one character and another that he is thrown through the tumultuous emotions that form the characters into more just and honorable characters at the novels conclusion.Having had only Sense and Sensibility as a prior introduction to Jane Austin, I emphatically commit that Pride is the greater, more humorous, more emotionally charged, and more intellectually potent novel. To the very degree which the reader wrongfully dislikes--even abhors--certain characters in the book, makes the conclusions finale--long awaited and anxiously feared to be tragic--the more powerful of a climax. Never before have I read a book that so forcefully charged me to reevaluate my own convictions and prejudice of other people. It is truly a masterwork of reader manipulation, as the characters in the book are pulled ride along side, and both the fictional and non-fictional assumptions are cast aside and replaced with shame and embarrassment.In conclusion, there are so many reasons to read this book that it is impossible to deny. Read it for the laughter, for the story, for the passion, for the irrefutable and welcome reversal that it will no doubt spur in each reader who picks the novel up. There is so much to learn and so much fun to be had with this book, that no one should be deprived of the experience."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I read this book when I was 12 and because I had watched the Wishbone show and did not believe that the main character could be a dog. The words were a bit difficult but I read it and was really surprised. It starts out a bit slow, but after the middle, it became really interesting and after the book, I felt really good. I actually read the end a couple times again. The characters are really charming, especially Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I guess you could say it was the ultimate miscommunication. It is an adult fairy tale, is what I can describe it as."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"But for this book I have to. I first picked up Austen's P&amp;P when I was in middle school and it failed the 3 chapter test. (You know the test: if you aren't interested in the book by chapter 3 put it down.) I picked it up again a few years later and simply fell in love with the wonderful story.Austen may have written the book over a century ago but the themes that play out within its pages are universal today. Pride, wealth, and station in life are still as important today as they were when Mrs. Bennet was hoping to find husbands for her daughters. In P&amp;P Austen writes about falling in love, how we view it, and how we don't always understand it. Is mutual regard enough for a lasting marriage? What about passion? And does passion or regard equate to love? I reread this book every time I need a reminder that love isn't always fanfares and fireworks."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This book was execellent.

I've always liked Jane Austen's style, and I'm much interested in books during this period. This novel is a perfect example about feminine frivolity and Victorian ways of mind. It's also epidemizes the importance of humbleness.All the characters plainly suggest that the highest standard a woman had in during the early 1800's was being a rich man's wife. Pride and Prejudice narrates a story about a poor man's daughters and their stuggles in &quot;catching&quot; a man of high society.Jane, the beauty, longs for the attention of Mr. Bingley, the owner of Netherfield Park. Through parties, dinners, and occasional ailments, their love blossoms into a possible proposal.Elizabeth, the easygoing, proud daughter, battles the intolerably rude and snobby blueblood, Mr. Darcy. Though they can't stand each others company, this friction grows into love. The only problem is their stubborn pride, each refusing to acknowledge the fact that they've fallen for people whom they regard as the scum of the world.Lydia, the youngest and the rashest, hopes to marry the crooked Mr. Wickham, but Wickham has different ideas.I loved Pride and Prejudice, and I recommend this book to anyone who loves romances."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I love this book!

With dreams of someday becoming a writer, it almost seems necessary to me to read all of the great works. That was what started me on reading Pride and Predjudice. I was completely sucked in!From the first paragraph about the \\"obvious\\" intentions of a bachelor and his wishes to marry, to the ending underplayed scenes between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, this book is an utter delight from the get-go. Lizzy is by far the best female protagonist I have ever read about. I can relate to her on nearly every level and was thoroughly engrossed in the story.When you begin having dreams of being a character in a book, you know that the book has taken you to a new level.

It is no wonder that this book has been so wildly successful!Reading over the negative reviews of this book, I am very surprised that anyone could not like this story! I certainly don't know what these people were thinking when they decided that they didn't like \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". This has certainly surpassed all other novels as my favorite book of all-time. Perhaps some might find Jane Austen's language difficult to understand, but as a 14-year-old, I didn't think that it was that way at all. This book will certainly remain dear to my heart forever, and I can certainly see myself reading it still 30 years from now.Elizabeth is a delightful heroine, and there is nothing quite as satisfying as the humbling of Mr. Darcy. I only wished that there was more (or that I was assigned to read it for my English class, which I would do with much pleasure)!In conclusion--read this book, for goodness sakes! You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Books i dont think ever get better than this. I recently saw the movie that came out in november and i immeditaly fell in love with the story. I love how this book shows a true romance story. In this day and age i dont think teenagers or people my age even know what a romance movie or book is without the pg-13 parts in it. I was so elated to read about nothing of that sort. It is in my opinion a timeless love story that will win many peoples hearts over and over for generations to come. Mr.Darcy I thought was a very prideful man at first but the more you learn about him, he becomes a very loveable character and suprising one too. As for Elizabeth Bennet she is by far a outspoken but loveable character as well. I think all the characters you run into in the book are so colorful and i wouldnt have thought that a book written so long ago could have characters like that let alone some humor in it too. I think this book never got dull and that everyone should read it. However the words that are used can be quite hard to understand sometimes without having been exposed to words ,and phrases that are said differently, before. Over all it has become one of my favorite books and Jane Austen did a exceptionally good job at writing this."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"One of the all time best love stories about a young, feisty women in the 18th century, coping with everything from a mother bent on marriage to a seemingly snotty neighbor's friend.Elizabeth is the second oldest of five daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, living in England during the 1800s. And as you can imagine, Mrs. Bennet's main goal is to marry off all of her daughters to wealthy suitors. When word comes that a rich bachelor, Mr. Bingley, is moving into a neighborring manor, the Bennet sisters are beside themselves and Mrs. Bennet's mind is soon set on the pairing of beautiful Jane, the oldest sister, and Bingley after one ball. At said so ball, Mr. Bingely is not alone, accompinied by his sisters and importantly, the very handsome (and very wealthy )but snobbish Mr. Darcy. Darcy later insults Elizabeth, aware she is in his presecene. Now holding a grudge, Elizabeth casts him aside. From then on, event after event seems to throw the two together but the question is: Will their grudges every be able to transform into love?I expected this book to be boring and untolerable but I was forced to shove my own words down my throat after only one chapter. This book is funny with hilarious comments and realistic moments. Everything you could ask for in a book.Recommended- 14 and up. This book can be hard to understand so give or take a couple yearsOverall- This book can be quite confusing to the average American at first considering its sophistacated text, so read it slowly and maybe a second time after awhile.

Pride and Prejudice. New York: The New American Library Inc., 1961. 332 pages.Pride and Prejudice is the story of The Bennet family. With three lovely daughters, it is Mrs. Bennet's wish that they get married to successful men, although her husband Mr. Bennet thinks differently. With this we are introduced to Jane Bennet, the eldest of the three Bennet girls. She is the ideal daughter who thinks nothing terrible about anyone and who falls in love at first sight with a business tycoon. Then we have Lydia, who is a foolish girl, similar to her mother. She does no work, and goes around looking at all the troops who pass by their city and flirts with them. There she meets a young officer who she falls in \\"love\\" and elopes with. And last we have Elizabeth Bennet. She is the youngest and the brightest out of all three. She has both sense and beauty, although she is not as beautiful as her eldest sister Jane. Elizabeth is very loving and is especially close to Jane. Although at times she can be loud and rude, Elizabeth is never afraid to speak about what's on her mind. And then Elizabeth meets Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy is a very blunt and rude man according to Elizabeth, and the two just can't seem to get along with each other.

Elizabeth and Darcy's characters are carefully and meticulously created.Pride and Prejudice made me buy the entire collection of her works.Highly recommended! :-)"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I was truly surprised by this tale. I was drawn from the very first page by Mrs. Bennets gossip. What was equally delightful was the sarcastic manner in which Mr. Bennet responded to her chatter, and she was none the wiser. And so begins a tale of wit that engages the minds.From the moment Darcy is mentioned, with his ill manners, we know that he will be key to the story and surely he is. The engaging repetoire between Elizabeth and Darcy is what makes the novel such an interesting read. From their haughty demeanor to falling in love, this tale is rich with engaging conversations.This novel gives an enlightening aspect to the 'higher' society of British life. There is a wicked vein that runs throughout the book, for the outlook on such a life seems quite vain if not ridiculous. Miss Austen does an excellent job of conveying that life to us, with enough wit and sarcasm.I enjoyed this book immensely and would recommend it to anyone wanting a witty read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This book is filled with everything a good book should be.

Lovely to have it on Kindle to reread anytime, anyplace, anywhere!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen was one of the best writers ever. She has written many books and they are all great. She knows how to write and she knows what she's talking about when she writes too. Which is a major plus for her. She can write in different styles. She knows how to write about characters and she can easily make them seem real. When someone writes like that it is so much better because if you feel like the characters are real it's easier for you to really get into the story. It was a little hard to hard to get into at first but once you got into the book you didn't have a choice to read or not because you had already invested most of your time trying to understand the book. I had this problem. I would have liked it better if it was a little bit easier to read, but it was written a long time ago so I really have no room to complain.I thought the book had good context. Elizabeth was a strong and independent female character. She didn't let much pass her and she was mostly on top of things. I really liked the way Jane Austen had made her seem like a well raised, confident, young women who wanted adventure. She made Elizabeth seem real. Like she could really exist back then. I really liked that aspect of her.When she talked about Mr. Darcy you could tell he had so much pride for everything he had and owned. He was almost close to a stuck up snob, but he made him seem more pleasurable than that. You could tell he really did love Elizabeth too. At first she hated him. She wanted nothing to do with him and she got mad every time she saw him, which was conveniently often. Every time Mr. Darcy had tried to help Elizabeth or her family it just turned into a disaster and resulting with her more and more mad at him.I think Elizabeth finally realized how much she loved Mr. Darcy when he saver her little sister, Lydia, and her entire family from total embarrassment. He didn't have to go and save Elizabeth's family but he still did. Just for her. It probably helped that Lydia had run off with the right guy. If she had ran off with some poor guy she just met off the street he probably wouldn't have been able to do much damage control. But no she ran off with Wickham. This was good for their family, I think, because it brought Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy together once again and this time for good. It had to be a plus that he saved her family and made Elizabeth open her eyes to see that Mr. Darcy was the best man for her. Her perfect match. I would guess that after they got married they still fought like crazy, but what couple doesn't?Jane Austen did a wonderful job writing this book. You can tell she was a skilled author and writer. She cared about what she was writing and you could tell that in her books. It was almost as if she was putting a little bit of herself into Pride and Prejudice.Jane Austen wrote other books too, and like this book you can tell she really poured her heart and soul into her book. I will definitely be reading more of her books sooner than later."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I absolutely love pride and prejudice.

The character of Elizabeth and Dracy are brought out beautifully. The vivid range of emotions of all the characters are a pleasure to read they involuntary invoke reponse from the reader"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The book Pride And Prejudice is a very good novel; it takes place during the 19th century, when women were inferior to men. The title of the novel Pride And Prejudice has an actual meaning in the story that describes the main characters. This novel has some similarities to today's society in various ways.The meaning of the title describes the personality of Darcy and Elizabeth. Darcy had the personality of being proud, and Elizabeth was very prejudiced. The reason Darcy had that personality was because he was a wealthy man who didn't associate with people who were from a lower social class. He didn't have the confidence to tell Elizabeth that he liked her because of his pride. Elizabeth was really prejudiced because before she met people, she distrusted them. Elizabeth thought Darcy's love for her wasn't real when it actually was true. I think the way that Darcy and Elizabeth were acting was foolish because pride and prejudice are not good things to have. It causes problems among people.In the story the strong one was actually the woman because she did not let him play with her and that attracted Darcy to Elizabeth.. Chapter three appealed to me because that was the beginning of all of the misunderstanding in the novel, which made it interesting for the readers to read. The sparks lit up in that chapter. The pride and prejudice of Darcy and Elizabeth started and kept on getting worse throughout the novel because even though they felt an attraction for each other they had misunderstanding that made them have bad feelings. But like all stories it always has a solution at the end. I liked the misunderstanding because it kept on make me feel a great suspense that made me want to keep on reading to find the answer, especially when Darcy asked Elizabeth to dance and was rejected by her. This part of the chapter was the best part because it life me with questions about what was going to happen later in the story with them, and it also confused me because I didn't think that they were going to end up marrying at the end.I liked this book a lot. It is one of my favorite books right now. The rating that the critics gave this book was a wise decision, five stars, because it was well written and interesting. This book is appropriate for people in the age of 14 and up. If you like to read suspense novels, you will like this novel."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, although I found it to be quite difficult to get into at first, proved to be a truely enjoyable reading experience. Despite its difficult language and rather lengthy descriptions and dialog, which tended to confuse me and cause me to lose interest at several points throughout the novel, the plot and events of this book left me in uplifted spirits and with the positive feeling that love truely can overcome any obstacle put in its way. The romance between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, as well as the relationship between Jane and Mr. Bingley, left me guessing throughout the entire novel, and motivated me to trudge through the somewhat uneventful chapters inbetween exciting events. I recommend this book to any person with a high attention span interested in reading an uplifting story about the powers of true love."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It is generally considered a pretty, romantic book - like a swan on a lake. But much like the swan, it's what happening underneath that's important. I have always admired this book for its wit and sharp observations but also for the title. Clever and astute, as usual. But is it Elizabeth who is proud and Darcy who is prejudiced? Or vice versa? Or are they both proud and prejudiced? These questions keep me re-reading this masterpiece at least once a year and I change my mind about the answers every time. This book will give me a lifetime of pleasure."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is probably one of the wittiest and most delightful books I've read in a long time. I recall reading Jane Austen several years ago with Northanger Abbey and I absolutely despised it. But after, adoring the miniseries for Pride and Prejudice, I figured it would do justice to read the book. Pardon my disastrous attempt to sound sophisticated, but it is sometimes amusing to mimic another author's style while reviewing her book. I can hardly wait for Burgess.:PThe book certainly renewed my love for the movie as well as literature of the Victorian era. I've never been a big fan of literature from that time period, despising books like Oliver Twist, Phantom of the Opera, Wuthering Heights and Frankenstein because they dragged on and on with melodrama. Jane Austen varied in the sense that her book was light-hearted and full of comedy and wit.Her characters were lovable. Elizabeth was well-rounded and respectable and if I could have but half her wit in her replies, I would be much indulged. Jane possesses good nature beyond what one would deem natural. Mr.Bingley was good natured as well. And finally, Mr.Darcy who had that air of mystery about him soon grew warm in my heart with his charitable acts. And as the book progressed, I became more and more interested in their well-being and future happiness. However, the most memorable characters would be the secondary characters. Mrs.Bennet was absolutely hilarious. I was equally embarassed as Elizabeth of her mother and her immaturity and lack of understanding. Mr.Bennet on the other hand, with his odd and wry comments provided even more amusement. He has the dryest sense of humour. Lydia is virtually insufferable with her youth and fails to understand any of the pain she has caused her family. Poor Miss Bingley seemed to be such an annoyance to Mr.Darcy with all her attempts to win his attention. And Mr.Collins was a laughable mess. I could not help but love to hate him.Unfortunately, having seen the movie first, I had an irreversible tendency to think of the scenery and the characters in terms of the movie. However, I found it rather pleasurable since this was perhaps the first time I've read a book with a concrete image of the characters and the scenery since I usually ignore such facts and descriptions. The descriptions were never excessive either as they tend to be in Victorian novels. Scenes were never described beyond half a page. Comments were often made on the characters but they never dragged on for pages on end. Usually, at most, they lasted about half a page. As for the emotions of the characters, Jane Austen did not linger on them for long. Enough indications were given to entice the reader, but not excessively as to bore.The dialogue was the most memorable and quotes of Austen popped out everyone. I was disappointed to find that at certain places, Austen merely described the coversation instead of actually carrying it out through dialogue.I find the book is still nevertheless romantic in nature and more redeeming to females as it would be to males. But I suppose all you guys are just missing out! I'm not normally a fan of romance but the book pursues it with such intelligence that I could not help but like it. I'm still a bit unconvined of the actual plausibility of the marriages in the story but they seem so satisfying, you might as well take them to be true. Romance books are nice in the sense that in the end, that undeniable happy ending is always guaranteed to be there to satisfy. And overall, Pride and Prejudice and satisfied me at the end with a warm and happy ending but nevertheless leaving me wanting to know more of the characters. It is book whose charm lies in the style and the characters and could be easily read over and over again. This book definitely will be one of my favourites.My goodness, I am embarassed by my own review. I sound like such a ...!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I must admit that this is a very well written book: the situations, the characters, the idea. I must also admit, though, that for that very fact, I didn't enjoy the book. The book was a comedy of manners on society and people. Most of the people were irritating, and I couldn't get into it.

For me, it was a perfect introduction to the Classics. The language is similar to books such as Anna Karenina and the like, but there is an element of humor that even us twentieth century dimwits can relate to. Sometimes subtle, and sometimes not, Jane Austen keeps us on our toes with her eighteenth-century characters that somehow manage to be hip. No matter who you are, you will find yourself rooting for one or another of the characters as they struggle for something ... if not hapiness, then an extremely desirable position in life."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This review is for the Recorded Books Classics Library on CD.Austen is Austen, so the quality of her writing and character observation will ultimately elevate any spoken performance of her text. Of the dozen or so books I've listened to in the Recorded Books Classic Library series, though, this is the first where I really felt the reader let me down.Flo Gibson reads fast, notjustbriskbutfast. I understand the desire to keep things moving, especially in a text that has as many descriptive passages as narrative ones, but I also think Austen needs to be savored a bit to be optimally enjoyed. The cadence never quite gets to the point where the reader is talking so fast that you can't understand her, but it does get to the point where you really have to listen intently, which can be hard to do while driving (which is where most people I know listen to books on CD). I found myself rewinding or back skipping the CD several times to say, \\"What was that phrase?\\" Again, not enough to ruin it, but enough to make it a more frustrating experience than a pleasurable one.Acceptable for those familiar with the novel who want to revisit it, but if this is your first time through, do yourself a favor and curl up with the book first. You won't regret it.[For a good contrast or alternative, check out Barbara Caruso's reading of Edith Wharton's The House of Mirth in the same series; it is superb.]"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I am not much for writing reviews let alone writing more then a few words and don't like it when forced to so It's okay.

It applies only to the edition of P&P; with ASIN 'B008476HBM' (Pride and Prejudice) and only on basic Kindle, Paperwhite, and Kindle Touch (these pay attention to language attributes so as to use a 'matching' dictionary).This happens to be the only edition of P&P; enabled for WhisperSync for Voice (with a free audiobook available from Audible) which is why I got this edition and have discovered this issue.Otherwise, the formatting is good, and (so far as I've read) free of typos. The price is right. And of course, the story is great, and everybody should read it.It seems the language attribute for the book is not set to 'English' and so (again only on K/KT/KPW) one gets 'Dictionary Not Found\\" even though an English dictionary is available. On my Kindle Touch, it does a lookup in the Italian dictionary that I happen to have on there (and of course fails to find these English words). Dictionary lookup works fine on my Fire and I'm guessing on Kindle Keyboard and older Kindles, which always use the one and only default dictionary.It is probably possible to edit the language attributes (e.g. with calibre) so that it works correctly.

Like a metropolitan skyscraper towering over its suburban brothers, Jane Austen's novel prevails as possibly one of the most powerful novels to fall into a reader's hand.The witty heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, prevails as the most interesting and involved character. She mesmerizes the reader with her wit and grace. Although Mary is the dullest of a girl, the remaining cast and her are a most interesting bunch. The third person omnipresent narrative allows the reader to peak at every character; in the process revealing the Mr. Bennet's hilarious sarcasm and views on his wife along with Mr. Wickham's and Mr. Darcy's true positions and personalities, which I could never bring across to you with as gracefully as is done by Jane Austen, so you will just have to read the book.As Austen introduces the players of the marriage game, which proves to be the center around which the plot is set, she presents the two themes that control the novel and are the title of it, pride and prejudice. Victorian society prevailed as the perfect setting to play out the two themes, as it was an era when social and economical status made a person who he/she is. Age, money, family name, and economical differences steer almost every single conversation and decision throughout the novel. They create for a most suspenseful scene; will Darcy, Bingley, Jane, Liz, and the rest of the cast surpass the boundaries set by pride and prejudice, and come together or will they let those boundaries keep them apart. Only one way to find out how sad or happy the ending is; you must read!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"When my friends and I were younger, we used to watch 'Wishbone' and every time we saw one we'd say, &quot;I can't wait to read that book&quot;. Well alas, eleven year olds aren't really suited for the books interpreted mostly because of the use of 'big words'. I'll admit, when I first picked this book up, I got a little too lost in the language. The characters seemed tiresome and vacuous. But taking advice from my mother, and the incredible drive of wanting to see Colin Firth in the series, but wanting to read the book first, kept me reading. And as I read farther and farther, I liked the book more and more. The cute story of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr.Darcy really caught my fancy (sorry, still using the language). It's a story that can still resonate today. With all the crappy love series that are in publication today, it's nice to see a story that has a remarkable heroine and a handsome beau who seems stuffy and rude at first, but is found to be remarkably charming and amiable at the end. I really adore this story and I recommend it to anyone looking to get lost in a lovely tale of old."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The lasting appeal of Pride and Prejudice is worth explaining to those who haven't read the book or seen the movies before launching into a review of this British classic. First, there may be no finer book at exploring the topic of how appearances can be deceiving. Those who are physically attractive, employ pleasant manners and flatter us will earn our approval and cause us to feel affectionate towards them. Those who are less attractive to regard, keep to themselves and say insulting things will become people we will think poorly of. To see how misleading those reactions can be in assessing character, compare Abraham Lincoln to Jefferson Davis, the head of the Confederacy. Lincoln was dour, ugly and awkward with people. Jefferson Davis was just the opposite. When it came to character, Lincoln had enough to hold the Union together and is now viewed as one of our greatest presidents. Most people don't remember Jefferson Davis unless reminded.Second, at another level Pride and Prejudice is a delightful romantic comedy that looks at how love develops through a series of painful mischances. Although not as light and funny as Shakespeare's comedies are (A Midsummer Night's Dream comes to mind), Pride and Prejudice will certainly bring a smile to most readers' faces in this regard.Third, Elizabeth Bennet is one of the best heroines ever imagined. Most readers will identify with her and be rooting for her to succeed. You'll almost feel like you've developed a good friend from reading this book.Fourth, Jane Austen is very good at poking fun at the pretensions of those who are self-absorbed or fascinated with social position and money. But it's a loving kind of fun. She realizes that these people are just silly . . . and don't know any better. We can enjoy a good laugh at their expense, but we should still love and support them. It's a good model for dealing with any goofy relatives we have.Fifth, Pride and Prejudice is a benchmark at how far women have come from the days when they often couldn't even inherit property from their fathers. You'll be as outraged as Mrs. Bennet is at these anachronisms . . . but you'll be assuaged to know that the worst of those bad old days are behind us.So, if those reasons to read Pride and Prejudice appeal to you, read on as I briefly describe the story.The Bennets have a challenge: They have five unmarried daughters who cannot inherit Mr. Bennet's entailed estate. With few prospects in the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is always on the hunt. Mr. Bennet views Mrs. Bennet's fascination with this challenge as being something he would like to distance himself from.When an eligible young man moves into the area, Mrs. Bennet's instincts are engaged to the fullest. One of her daughters must marry Mr. Bingley. At the next ball, the pickings seem to improve when Mr. Bingley arrives with a friend, Mr. Darcy. Darcy \\"soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report . . . of his having ten thousand a year.\\" But Mr. Darcy soon turned the fortune hunters off by only dancing with his sisters and refusing to be introduced to any of the other ladies.Bingley finds himself very attracted to Jane Bennet and their relationship develops nicely . . . until he leaves suddenly for London with no plans to return. Jane waits for some news from him or his sisters and finds herself being cut off.In the middle of this, Mr. Collins arrives. Collins will inherit Mr. Bennet's property upon his death. He has just received a position as a clergyman from a powerful and opinionated sponsor, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and she has told him to get married. With four unmarried cousins, Collins decides the Bennet daughters are his best bet. In this way, he can provide a home for them and their mother after he inherits. First being inspired by Jane, he redirects his attention to Elizabeth after perceiving Jane's interest in Bingley and quickly proposes. Elizabeth will have none of it, and Collins soon finds a more enthusiastic prospect in another local family.The younger sisters are finding themselves more than entertained by the dashing officers in a local regiment. Through this connection, Elizabeth becomes acquainted with Wickham who confides in her that Mr. Darcy had treated Wickham with great unfairness after Mr. Darcy's father's death. That's just one more nail in the coffin for the case against Mr. Darcy.But in the background, we get hints that something is shifting. Mr. Darcy goes from finding Elizabeth to be ordinary in appearance to commenting favorably about one small aspect of her face, her mouth. But put the two of them together, and civil words do not follow. They are like oil and water.Jane and Elizabeth eventually make it to London where both hope that Jane will reconnect with Bingley. But no such luck.Just when things seem to be headed in a most bleak direction, a terrible event occurs that shakes everyone like an enormous earthquake. In its aftermath, each character finds herself or himself needed to re-examine their position and perceptions of one another.Will Jane and Bingley connect with one another again? Will Elizabeth find happiness? Will Mrs. Bennet marry her daughters off? You'll just have to read the book to find out. But unlike modern novelists, remember that Jane Austen wasn't against happy endings.Enjoy a great read!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen's great achievement (and she preferred \\"achievements\\" to \\"accomplishments,\\" if you speak early 19th Century English) was to produce a novel esteemed by its contemporaries for what they called its \\"probableness.\\" They noted she employed none of the fictional gimmicks of the time--their equivalents of car chases--and set a new standard for psychogical perception. Sir Walter Scott observed that he could \\"do the bow-wow thing\\" but he could not do this. Those who find fault with the centrality of marriage in the work do not recognize the limited possibilities for women at the time. Given the narrow sea-room available to her, Elizabeth did marvelously with the minimum possible surrender of her personal freedom. Really, though, the one who did marvelously was Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is, in my opinion, one of the best books written. Ever. I read this book as assigned reading in highschool, and fell in love with it. I was even accused of stealing my copy, which I didn't do by the way- I bought my own.Anyway, this book is so well written, the characters so well drawn, the plot so well planned, and the dialog so quick that I feel any praise I can give it will fall short of the mark. So suffice it to say that if you have somehow not been exposed to Jane Austen by this point in your life, you should IMMEDIATLY invest in a copy of Pride and Prejudice.For me this book was a gateway to the wonderful world of Jane Austen novels. Most highly recommened after P&P; (by me anyway) would be Northanger Abbey and Sense and Sensability. I found Emma and Persuasion interesting enough, but did not love them quite as well as I did the three others. I have yet to read the rest of Jane Austens works, but I most assuredly plan to do so.Anything written by Jane Austen is well worth your time."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It is not for nothing that this book is labelled as a classic. Austen is the greatest writer of this type of fiction and this is her crowning glory.Coming from the world of high society in England of the late 18th Century, Austen lived the life she wrote about. Having refused a compromise proposal of marriage herself, and lived out her life as a spinster, she was only too aware of the realities of the marriage game.Women in this society were marketable product, and both men and women were stratified by their annual income. A titled person or someone from a noble family might improve flagging fortunes by marrying untitled money, but in general money married money and titles married titles.Into this delicate balance Austen throws her heroine - Eliza Bennett. In any \\"proper\\" romance novel it should be the passionless and tame courtship of her older sister Jane to the wealthy Bingley and his bitchy sisters that should form the core of the story.Eliza opens the novel by turning down a proposal from an embarrasing, boring, unhandsome relative who has a modest income as a churchman. To society this would have been a proper match for Eliza and it is unthinkable that she should refuse it.But Austen opts to sell a true fairytale and in doing so established a modus operandi for much modern fiction. Eliza and Darcy begin by getting off on the wrong foot. The remainder of the novel is an Anabasis from the confused territory of mistaken assumptions and impressions to an epiphany of understanding and mutual respect.On either side of this love story are the very proper courtship of Jane and Bingley on one hand, and the dreadful elopement of a younger sister with a complete cad on the other.The prize at the end is not just Darcy, but his wonderful estate of Pemberly, thoroughly described in the novel. The reward for the characters is access to this estate (invitations to balls, summers holidays etc) and the virtuous are awarded open access while those who behaved badly are excluded and sent to parts of England furthest from Pemberly.The beauty of this story lies in the wit of conversation and letter. The cutting comments, the razor sharp assesments of character. The constant referral to income, house size, education and marriage prospects. It is here that Austen really excels, and to appreciate just how funny the novel is requires the attention of the reader to what is being said. Careful attention to the language carries a huge reward and I frequenly found myself collapsing in laughter while reading this book.I am not a fan of romance or of regency fiction, but I am a fan of this book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This book is available for free on the kindle (Pride and Prejudice) or cheaper by other publishers:Pride and Prejudice (Arcturus Paperback Classics)orPride and Prejudice (Oxford World's Classics)orFavorite Jane Austen Novels: Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion.It is a great book, but there are other editions that would save you money. I have no idea as to why it is called a 1st edition."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Sometimes people make assumptions about others without really knowing the person. Almost every character in the book Pride and Prejudice has some type of prejudice towards someone else whether it is money, pride, or jealousy. Elizabeth made the assumption that Mr. Darcy was stuck-up, but he was really just shy and uncomfortable with social events. Elizabeth also thought Mr.Wickham was nice and truthful, but he really was a poor, gambling liar. Mr. Darcy thought that Jane didn't really like Mr. Bingley, but she just doesn't show her feelings very well. Both of Bingley's sisters and Lady Catherine were both against the Bennet family because they were \\"lower class.\\" Some of the prejudices faded, and others grew through out the book. This book is full of pride, prejudice, and love. The theme in this book is really not to judge a book by its cover."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"While any book as widely lauded as this one will also find its detractors, especially from among the ranks of students forced to read it, it is worth noting the number of reviewers (count me among them) who cite PRIDE AND PREJUDICE as their favorite work of literature. I love this book and have read it more times than any other work of fiction.For me the greatest pleasure comes from savoring the many colorful characters, not only Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, who surpass even Shakespeare's Benedick and Beatrice as the thinking person's ideal romantic match, but also Miss Bingley, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Collins and all the others. Austen employs the vices and virtues of this cast of characters to great effect -- for comedy, drama, suspense, and especially dramatic irony. Individual scenes that come to mind are Elizabeth's rejection of her first marriage proposal, one of the most memorable comic scenes in English literature, and her rejection of a second offer of marriage, a scene that may very well prompt the reader to shout at the heroine in a futile attempt to intervene.With each re-reading I discover more to understand and love about PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Not only do the individual characters serve as foils to each other, but relationships between characters serve as foils to other relationships. On first reading, I saw how much love and respect there exists between Elizabeth and her father. I saw how similar Mr. Darcy is to Mr. Bennet and understood the perfectness of a match between Darcy and Elizabeth. On subsequent readings I discovered that Miss Bingley, who is so critical and so mocking of the Bennetts' humble position in society, is more like Mrs. Bennett than any other character, and a chapter in which Darcy seems to arrive at this conclusion himself came alive for me, and I now recognize it as a pivotal moment in the story whereas previously it had seemed like a duller chapter to skim over.All of this sounds very dry and intellectual I suppose, but the experience of reading the novel is anything but. What propels the reader through the book is the apprehension that Elizabeth and Darcy have gotten off on the wrong foot, and while at odds are clearly made for each other in every possible respect. This tension makes it a highly enjoyable page-turner. Nor is PRIDE AND PREJUDICE a fluffy romance novel or a \\"chick flick.\\" Given the economic realities of the times, Elizabeth is risking not only spinsterhood but also economic disaster by not seizing on opportunities to marry any man with a decent income or place in society. By refusing to settle, Elizabeth is a very brave character in her own arena, and for that reason we recognize her as a hero, a noble soul who honors responsibilties, stands fearless in the face of snobbery and oppression, laughs at folly (while exhibiting some of her own as well), and aches for true love. Who cannot root for such a character or rejoice at the happy conclusion of her quest?"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The \\"BedBook\\" format is so unusual, it should be made more clear to purchasers....I wouldn't have been interested if I had known this."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have not read the book yet, however I think ones opinion of the book is just that, ones opion.

We all know it as a timeless classic and it's difficult to review. What can I say that hasn't already been said? Thus, I'll continue.Lizzy Bennett: She's grown up in a humble and somewhat poor family. The only people she really see's eye to with in her family are her father and her sister. She's stubborn, passionate and proud of her family and life style.Darcy: He's grown up in a rich family and taught that he is the best as far as social interaction. His parents have since died and he is extremely close to his only and younger sister. He's persistent, quiet and sure he is the highest ranking person.So when the two meet, they're not exactly fond of each other. In fact, there's immediately animosity on both ends. They don't really expect to see each other often until Darcy's best friend falls for Elizabeth's sister. Inevitably they are brought together on numerous occasions. And as time goes by his feeling toward her change drastically.I realize that I could never give the story justice. It's classic for a reason. Beautifully written and surprisingly easy to relate to. It is also a great insight for the time period. A must read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The novel Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen intrigued me just by its mysterious title in which the two seemingly irrelevant words are put together. After I finished the first reading, I was impressed with her witty and sophisticated language that enlivened the characters with distinctive features and the descriptions of landscapes and atmospheres of that certain time period. Moreover, the most remarkable aspect of this novel was the title itself- Pride and Prejudice. The two words do not agree upon a uniform theme but after the reading, I could make multiple links between the plots/themes of the novel and the title. The only aspect I did not really enjoy was how the basic structure of the entire essay was stereotypical and the plots being somewhat hackneyed to the readers who are exposed to a wide range of romance novels.Before I started the novel, I could not really expect in advance what would happen and how the characters would advance. However, as I finished up the novel, my curiosity was fully disentangled. Some readers may interpret the title as Darcy being the proud character and Elizabeth being the prejudiced character. However, from another perspective, one can also interpret the title as that both characters are prejudiced by their first impressions and their social classes and are blinded by their pride, which explains why they both continue to be put in a form of conflict. Either way, the title lets the readers expect something that they have never thought and thus turns the thing around after the reading, which maximizes the dramatic aspects of all.Jane Austen's use of language is certainly highly sophisticated and classy especially when she describes the background scenes or setting of 18th century of England. Without watching movies, I could easily imagine each scene vividly. When she describes Longbourn, a typical country town, or Darcy's estate, it gave me right away an impression of what it was like during that epoch. Also, not only her picturesque and descriptive language, but her actualizations of the atmosphere of that certain era were directly conveyed to me that I once thought I was one of those daughters of Bennet family. She uses lots of details to offer the most explicit mood of realistic lives of an ordinary family in England and she successes regard to that.Austen's characters and perspectives are also some aspects that did captivate me a lot. The protagonists Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy stand out as very distinctive characters but minor charactors such as Jane, Bingley, Collins, Wickham, Lydia, Lady Catherine, and even her parents play tasteful roles that keep the novel stimulating until the end. The setting and background of this novel is something to focus on also because the lives of people in England during 18th-19th century were typical while the novel and plots deviate from such clich&eacute; by Austen making characters unique and distinguished. Elizabeth Bennet is unlike other women who were expected to be obedient and passive; Elizabeth seems vigorous in expressing her opinions, honest, straightforward and intelligent (and problematically she knows it too well). In a scene where Elizabeth confronts Lady Catherine, she does not fall back or cringes due to her lower class, but rather, she stands up defending herself and remain confident in saying what she wants to say to Lady Catherine. Her unique characteristic definitely explains why Darcy is so attracted to her in the first place.Austen integrates basic components of the lives of ordinary people naturally so that the readers today can easily compare their lives to that of old live and easily understand and even sympathize with the characters. She makes several conflicts between different class such as between Elizabeth and Lady Catherine or Ms. Bingley looking down on Jane to demonstrate how class distinction was so conspicuous during that time period. Also, the typical mindsets of women are displayed when Mrs. Bennet is very desperate to let all her five children be married to rich men or when Elizabeth's friend, Charlotte marries to Mr. Collins even without love. It was a prevalent thought back then that love is not the most chief determinant in marriage (This is why Elizabeth-Darcy relationship is more enthralling). The readers today can easily perceive what it was like in England by reading the novel and place themselves in the middle of the setting. Nonetheless, along with this, it was also an intriguing component that Austen used four different couples to demonstrate that diverse situations allowing the readers to compare.Except the fact that the basic structure of the novel was formulaic, I enjoyed the novel and I would like to recommend to those of my age because anyone of my age could easily relate to Elizabeth and be easily impressed by her attractive characteristics and eye-catching development of Elizabeth and Darcy's beautiful relationships."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It wasn't hard to not like, but it is introduced to me by my mom. In fact, it is her favorite translated books and so well known, it connected us to a time where everyone still cared about society decorum. It was more about finding love and still believe domestic live is still good for reason. It made women look good but made the truth more bearable about the constant bickering around home. It explained like Mr. Roger in the Neighborhood about who is coming and going in the social circle, and it made serious strive to explain the role of women in society and politics, but it did not aim to increase their role. It was a cup of tea on the role of gentlemen in their children's education, and it made their role around home more explainable. It made warring segment of the society less popular, but it reflected the sentiment of the times, it made peace more acceptable and finding the person to share life more condoned. It was the voice of the unpopular and the bluestocking type of \\"Jane\\" at the time, who wants their men to stay home and their women to enjoy the social life more. It is nothing but deplorable people who marry unsuitably and this reasoning made it ways to every nook and craning, essentially, it set out to destroy as much of unsuitable marriage as possible. But it did this elegantly, and the main character there, Elizabeth and Darcy, as well as Jane and Bingley as good as married. It does not seek to destroy any more thinking process on the other facets of the ordinary life in unordinary times, but it brought unrealized expectations as well. The thoughts of English ways does not prevail in their society is like reducing the mind to think only of the times they were conquered by the Normans, but it does not however, make the case for the natural ways people will continue to live their life as much as possible. So, at the end, everyone hoorayed at the English marriages and made sure whoever named Eliza will marry Fitzwilliam Darcy in the End, and not anyone forgot about Jane as well.The less known character then all got their satisfaction and knowledge that they all had their share of matrimony of stable life, which in fact, is the well-known intent of Jane Austen in almost every single one of her books. Perhaps all of them, though their maybe one or two which is read by the reviewer or because it is only partially finished. Most like the latter.So, who really cares about the malapropism of the weaker characters or the seldom attuned to reality Eliza, it was actually more fun to read it and not have to over think on who could possibly love the Darcy and Bingley set of the world. It was so well described, and it made the whole Bingley and friends' family the most beloved or the most hated family of all time. It made their social gatherings the crown of the gazette, all to serve and divert the attentions of the war. It also made some of their actions unforgiving at the same time as well, so in as much as the Bennet family created happiness by entertaining their social circles, it made the Bingley family more unimpeachable when the made the match for their son, right when they made the error of crossing over their duties their neighbors for more frivolous things like work and better gain for themselves.Reading through Pride and Prejudice is also a worrisome venture when in fact the reader is often at a loss on how to cope with the idea that Jane Austen herself is at the lower level of the society, without either access to explain their actual lives or scientific tools to deduce on how people like the unforgiving aunt of Darcy. It took witticism and it took the audacity to write based on hearsay, and it made philosophy more acceptable to women, perhaps. Least in my opinion it did."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I couldn't find anywhere whether or not this was an abridged or unabridged version.

I guess you get what you pay for, right?"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The marriage, property and inheritance laws of the late 18th and early 19th century, by today's standards, can be considered cruelly misogynistic.The Bennett family estate is entailed and, as Mr Bennett's family consists of his wife and five daughters (nary a son in sight), there is a strong likelihood that, when he passes away, the six surviving ladies will be left homeless and with no income or property. Mrs Bennett is deeply concerned with the situation and frantically searches for the expedient solution of the day (marriage to an eligible man of property whose family would provide her daughters with both a home and settlement of a suitable annual stipend for living expenses). On the other hand, Mr Bennett's approach is much more relaxed and he gives the impression that he feels the marriage of his daughters will take care of itself in due course and that all will ultimately turn out for the best.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, told primarily from the point of view of Elizabeth Bennett, the most sensible daughter in a family of ladies whose general attitude seems to be quite vapid and utterly self-centered, is a story driven not so much by plot as by character development combined with a comedic critique of the issues of early 19th century mores among the landed gentry - manners, upbringing, morality, education, marriage, conventions, etiquette, leisure, societal behaviour and so on. It might be compared to a much more modern equivalent in F Scott Fitzgerald's THE GREAT GATSBY or on a considerably lighter note, television's famous sitcom SEINFELD. The common factor here ... in a background of purely social commentary, nothing of note really happens. The social commentary IS the story!PRIDE AND PREJUDICE has withstood the onslaught of time and remains to this day (and justifiably so) one of the most popular novels in the entire pantheon of English literature.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"great book of course for any jane austin fan. this review is more for this kindle edition. i decided to buy the one dollar version after a few chapters because i do not like the repetitive use of dialog in all caps. it makes me imagine too much yelling. granted i do not know whether miss austin wrote it that way or the scribes of this digital book did. i just know i do not like it. if you are like me or unsure just get the sample first."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Perhaps the mother of all romances, this classic cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me Jane Austen story stands as a model that many modern romances seem formulated upon. Not a pure romance however, Austen offers so much more to her readers in P&P: realistic relationships, interesting characters, comical situations and compelling subplots force readers to think in many directions and entertain far and beyond boy loves girl. This particular copy of P&P would make a perfect little gift for anyone just introduced to the story or Austen through this latest movie version (or as a companion to the movie) and is a wonderful beginning to immersing oneself in the English language of 200 years ago. To be certain, this sort of old classic literature may be a challenge to peruse at first, but rest assured that it becomes easier to assimilate the more you read it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Despite the fact that there are literally hundreds of reviews of this book, I somehow feel it important to share my thoughts. This is one of my favorite books of all time, though I came to it very late in life. During my 5th reading of it, I started musing over why this book had such an incredible impact on me. I finally figured it out. This book and almost of all Austen's other brilliant novels speak to me about the life-altering possibilities of love. This reality was completely integral to the lives of women in the 18th and 19th century. If you were a woman, your fate -- whether you became a wife, a mother, a mistress of a fine home or stayed at home the rest of your days taking care of your parents -- was completely determined by a man choosing you. But this idea, even in our times in which women actually have options and power to change their lives, is highly compelling. These books -- these characters -- capture the feeling that everyone who has every fallen in love has that in one instant their lives, if joined with another, will be changed forever and exponentially and in ways they cannot even imagine. It is that feeling of possibility that Jane Austen has put into words, and why, I believe, her books are still as influencial as they were 2 hundred years ago."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I had heard good thungs about this book from my school friends and heard great praise from my librarian the day I checked it out. I had always wanted to read a Jane Austen novel and this was my first. I had completley fell in love with it when I was stuck inside, at home, on three snowy days and could not put it down. I immediately began seeking other Austen books, but this one stuck in my mind. I have read this, Persuasion, Lady Susan, and have seen the Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion movies. I have yet to see Pride and Prejidice, but I am looking forward to it.Pride and Prejudice's main character, Elizabeth Bennet, is strong-willed, intelligent, and witty. She makes snap judgments of others and must live with the consequences of her prejudices. She is the second youngest of five sisters and no brothers and is the favorite of her father.The eldest, virtuous Jane, is her favorite who rarely sees the wrong in anybody. Jane is considered the handsomest sister. The middle child, Mary, is principled and only lives to improve her accomplishments. The next is timid Catherine, or Kitty, who is followed by exasperating Lydia. Lydia is silly and, if you have ever read Persuasion, like the Musgroves. She is cheerful and a flirt going after the soldiers' and fancying herself always in love. Her mother is hopelessly silly and her father is sardonic. They meet this man, Mr. Charles Bingley, who is considered very rich that just moved into the neighborhood. He is a perfectly wonderful man who fell in love with a Bennet. His friend, Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, his name even convinces us that he possesses arrogant pride, is even more rich than Mr. Bingley but is disliked by the shole neighborhood.\\"It is a truth universally acknowlegded that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife\\", the first sentance of the book, states a theme of the novel. Marraige is talked of often in the book. Elizabeth meets both Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy and judges their characters. One she likes and one she doesn't. You can probably guess. But is her first immpression of Mr. Darcy wrong?"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"If you don't fall in love with Elizabeth Bennet and her existentially endearing family, well, your heart must be made of stone.Jane Austen's best heroine is at the center of this romance that is so strong and true that it can be mined by the film industry - with good, better and best adaptations - and still manage to stand on its own pinnacle of imaginative wonder.Pay attention to Elizabeth's words--I feel that she is most often voicing the thoughts of Jane Austen. There are many occasions where Elizabeth's character shines through. She is a complicated person, and did you notice, at the center, she combines aspects of all the other Bennet sisters in herself. It is as if Jane said, \\"Let us show in the sisters, what having one or the other trait, without a balance, might look like.\\"Elizabeth is multi-layerd.What can we say of Mr. Darcy except that he is Jane Austen's ideal man. He may not be your ideal man, but there are a lot of other men with other traits to choose from in the book, so plenty of variety, there. And, we admit, Darcy comes close to disappointing at several key moments in the narrative; he is allowed to keep his own counsel to such a degree that this fine quality almost becomes his personal tragedy. Isn't it funny how our best qualities can sometimes do that to us?Also, pay attention to Elizabeth's relationship with Mr. Bennet. Parents are not supposed to have favorites, are they? Yet, in a household of all daughters, you find that the two of them have a bond of love and sympathy that is endearing even when Mr. Bennet seems to be kidding, unobservant or flippant. He comes close to being the omniscient observer, yet, like Darcy, keeps his own counsel.Mmmm. Perhaps this has something to do with how Elizabeth is able to find and appreciate in Darcy qualities she has already admired in someone else...?Darcy is so well off that the reader is tempted to wonder whether Elizabeth has the qualities worthy of a Mr. Darcy. This may be why we have the interchanges with Lady Catherine de Bourgh. There is strength of character and nobility in both women, and we get an idea that in her youth, Lady Catherine may have been much like Elizabeth. We might even push the matter to suggest that in her old age, Elizabeth could possibly become as imposing as Lady Catherine. Or perhaps not, since there is so much of love and tenderness in her.I have tried to say all of this without giving any of the fabulous twists and turns of the plot away.Replete with bon mots, tender and surprising scenes, and characters that even when they are at their worst, are deeply loved by their creator - and us - this book deserves every paean of praise that comes its way.If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have read \\"pride and Prejudic\\" by Jane Austen a total of 5 times now, and it just gets better every time. This book is definately a classic. The characters are witty, and the story is timeless. \\"Pride and Prujudice\\" is an interesting love story involving a very proud man named Mr. Darcy, and stubborn beauty named Elizabeth Bennet. Together they create a conflict so strong that at one point, neither wants anything to do with the other. But their love for each other is undeniable, once they both get over their pride, and yes, prejudice against one another. They arent the only love story in this classic novel, however. Also fighting for love is Elizabeth's gentle, kindly older sister Jane. She has fallen for the very rich, handsome Mr. Bingly, and it is as if he is under a spell of her charm. Though his sisters try to tear them apart, they somehow find each other again before its too late. Still the question of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy's love for each other remains, will they ever give way to their love for each other? Or will pride and strong will keep them from eternal happiness?

After getting a list of books to read from my teacher, my dad said this would be the perfect one for me. I was slow to begin, but once I got started, I was quickly consumed. It had everything a great story should have. This book reminded me of a Danielle Steal novel, but written much better, and surely not a beach read. It took time and effort to complete, but in the end, the novel was worth the hard work. This book taught me a lot about myself. Even more than that, a lot about who I want to be. When I finished reading and discussed this book with my dad, I told him that I wanted to be Elizabeth Bennet. She was a great protagonist to watch grow throughout the novel. She was a very round character, who was revealed in pieces, not showing the true whole self until the end. It was amazing for me to see how much I could relate to a story written so many years ago. I feel now like the times have truly not change much. Love is still love, loss is still loss, and friends are still friends. This novel was a true untimely classic. Although this story is about love, it is not all good times. It takes Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy a long time before they become lovers. There are twists, turns, broken hearts, and shy wit along the way. This book was one of the first that made me both laugh and cry. I came out of reading this book with a slightly different outlook on life as I had before I began. At some points I wanted to just jump into the novel, rearrange some things, and come back out. It was so important to me for everyone in the novel to be happy, and everything to work out as I had it planned. The literary value of this work in unbelievable. As young as I am, and even though I have not read that many classics yet, I can tell you that this one is worth it. My favorite parts of the novel were the descriptions of the beautiful rolling hills, the wonderfully decorated rooms, and the people. Austen must have had an amazing picture in her head when creating this work! She truly moved me! This literary work was enchanting. As great as the novel was, there were some downsides you should know before picking it up. Although beautiful, the language was difficult to understand sometimes, for me at least. It was spoken in strong 18th century English, and not always easy to comprehend. This novel takes you winding through the souls of two people, both filled with pride and prejudices, hence the novels title.

Jane Austen rocks, baby!note: somebody at amazon made a mistake, and the cover that appears up there is from the Oxford Classics edition."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable.As much as I love Pride & Prejudice, I must admit that some of the words are now archaic and some of the references have become obscure due to the passage of time. ThePride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics)edition provides helpful footnotes to help readers understand the nuances of the novel more completely.In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were a few times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find any serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen is one of the great masters of the English language, and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is her great masterpiece, a sharp and witty comedy of manners played out in early 19th Century English society, a world in which men held virtually all the power and women were required to negotiate mine-fields of social status, respectability, wealth, love, and sex in order to marry both to their own liking and to the advantage of their family. And such is particularly the case of the Bennetts, a family of daughters whose father's estate is entailed to a distant relative, for upon Mr. Bennett's death they will lose home, land, income, everything. But are the Bennett daughters up to playing a winning hand in this high-stakes matrimonial game without forfeiting their own personal integrity?This battle of the sexes is largely seen through the eyes of second daughter Elizabeth, who possesses a razor-sharp wit and rich sense of humor--and who finds herself hindered by her own addlepated mother, her sister Jane's hopeless love for the wealthy Mr. Bingley, and her sister Lydia's penchant for scandal... not to mention the high-born, formidable, and outrageously proud Mr. Darcy, who seems determined to trump her every card. But the game of love proves more surprising than either Elizabeth or Mr. Darcy can imagine, and sometimes a seemingly weak hand proves a winning one when all cards are on the table.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is simply one of the funniest novels ever written, peopled with memorable characters brought vividly to life as they both succeed and fail at the game of life according to the manners of their era. It is a novel to which I return again and again, enjoying Austen's brillant talent. I have little respect for people who describe it as dull, slow, out of date, for as long as men and women live and fall in love it will never be out of style, always be meaningful, and always be funny. A masterpiece of wit and style; a timeless novel for the ages."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"One of the versions listed is published by \\"General Books LLC.\\" Another reader complained about the tiny and almost unreadable font - you probably bought the version published by General Books LLC - and here's the reason.General Books LLC is an imprint of VDM Publishing, (google them and take a look at the Wikipedia article on them) and they specialise in publishing books that are free of copyright without doing any editing or quality control.

In addition, Amazon is the Printer of these POD books and makes a substantial cut from them. Sadly, given that the General Books LLC version is lumped in with other imprints from genuine publishers, there is no real way of making potential buyers aware of the problems with this particular version of the book without inflicting it on all the other versions available.

There are typos and in several places in the text very, very simple errors are made: in a few places, the same word repeats itself along the lines of \\"the the chair,\\" a couple malapropisms I am positive were not in the original text, and other typesetter's error that, if this Kindle edition had been subject to even a cursory review by a proofreader, would have been caught.

I have never seen an actual book loaded with so many simple errors as this ebook is."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It doesn't get better than Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Whether you're the hopeless romantic or you just love the classics, you're going to love this book. Though I am only sixteen, I consider myself to be moderately well-read. I love reading, and, when I am between books, my life feels desolate and empty. One day, while in the most barren pit of ennui, I picked up Pride and Prejudice at my mother's recommendation. I do not ordinarily like my mother's taste in reading; her favorite books tend to be very dull, but so deep was my boredom that I succumbed to her suggestion. I wasn't displeased with what I found. I fell in love with the book at the first sentence. I brought my beloved book to the dinner table, to my classes and late into the night. I love everything about it. I love the characters; especially Elizabeth Bennet! I love the Victorian vernavular which works so well for this particular novel. I love the scintillating plot and the suspense created by knowing that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy should be together but their pride and prejudice (hence the title) are temporarily keeping them apart. The language that the novel is written in might be a little more difficult to read than contemporary literature, but once one gets accustomed to it, it makes the novel even more pleasurable. I cannot imagine Elizabeth or Darcy or Bingley or any of the other characters speaking any less eloquently; it would ruin the whole experience! The flowery language completes the whole effect of reading a Jane Austen novel. If a disgruntled female reader put down Pride and Prejudice, pick it back up! I strongly suggest it because it may prove to be tedious at first but if read again, it would probably read more easily. I can offer no suggestions to the male reader, however, because generally this book, in ever essence, is a female novel. I am not saying that men would definetly not enjoy it; I'm simply saying that I have yet to meet any male who has not addressed this book in a very vehement manner. I simply love this book in its entirety, and I know it won't be too long before I pick it up again. Jane Austen surely knew what she was doing when she wrote this one! Her Pride and Prejudice will always have an honored spot on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I am really enjoying this book. I won't comment on it from a literary sense. Everyone has already exhausted that area. However, I will say that the kindle version is great except that the text does not always translate in the proper fonts. Every so often the author has emphazied a word and it shows in the Kindle as all upper case. I supposed it was supposed to be italics. A similar situation occurred in the Complete Sherlock Holmes. Certain symbols are not translated properly. The intent was still obvious. I was very reluctant to buy a Kindle at first, but I have used up all the available space in my home for paper books. The Kindle is a joy to read though and it goes very fast."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is a most amusing and entertaining love story which has ever written that shows human limitations at its best. The title of the book is indeed well-named for pride and prejudice are the essence of the whole book. Pride of the hero Mr. Darcy and prejudice of the heroine Elizabeth Bennet combined to reveal what kind of character a person can be, regardless of his/her financial situation and social stature.British society under the Regency rule was exemplified and made explicit to generations of readers. The author was telling us about the everyday life of people living in rural England after the Napoleonic Wars, and Britain was on its way to become a maritime power in the 19th century. The Industrial Revolution of Charles Dickens' days had not yet arrived to upset the power of the English nobility and the landed gentry, so much so that gentlemen like Mr. Darcy, a landowner of vast estates, could live a life of luxury and self-importance, and could easily look down on the less fortunate who had to work for a living.Reading Jane Austen's work is always a pleasure. It puts me in with the characters, as if I were an unseen and unknown observer in the room! In fact, I feel that I am living in the early 1800s, doing the same things that those characters are doing, and feeling just as they are feeling."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have always loved the style and social politics of the Regency period (the time of Jane Austen.) But when I read &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; in 7th grade I found the first few chapters lifeless, dull and hard to read. Two years later I was encouraged by a friend to give &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; a try. I did and have since become a complete Janeite. I am now able to peruse joyfully through &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; with a new understanding and appreciation of Jane Austen. The reason? &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is fresh, witty and is a great introduction to Jane Austen's writing style without the formality of some of her other novels (unlike S&amp;S and Persuasion Austen does not give us a 10 page history of each family and their fortune.) If you have never read Jane Austen or have read her other novels and found them boring, read Pride and Prejudice. The characters, and the situations Austen presents to them, are hysterical and reveal a lot about Regency society and morality. This book perfectly compliments a great writer like Jane Austen and is essential to every reader's library. The Penguin Edition of the book is stellar and I personally recommend it not only for the in-depth and indispensable footnotes, but also for the cover that is non-suggestive of any of the characters' appearances. In summary &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is a great book for beginner Austen readers and seasoned fans, and Penguin Classics is a great edition for fully enjoying and understanding the book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Classics come to life under good audio treatment, as Irene Sutcliffe demonstrates by reading Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE with passion and style.

The story begins when an American civil engineer falls into an underground world. There he discovers a subterranean paradise inhabited by a race called the Vril-ya.These Vril-ya tell the narrator that they are descended from ancestors who escaped the 'upper world' as a result of a deluge which covered the earth. Their evolution has taken a certain course mainly because of the discovery of an energy source, similar to electricity.This energy, from which they also take their name, is called Vril. Lytton's narrative, published in the same year as The Descent of Man, is one of the first truly post-Darwinian novels. It incorporates many of the scientific ideas of the period, and the subsequent fears of degeneration and devolution. The narrator soon discovers that this subterranean paradise is not all that it seems.

As a story it is well developed and is one of Bulwer-Lytton's best works of science fiction. Also from a historical aspect it is an interesting document to see how the Victorian mind saw the world and what was beyond their horizons. This book had an incredible impact upon the reading public upon its release in 1871 and its influence, as well as that of Lytton in general, is felt greatly in later works of early sci-fi. I especially feel the stylistic influence in Upton Sinclair's \\"Millennium\\" and while for a review this is neither here nor there, this is important in understanding the development of the genre.The book opens up with the main character, an American, being invited into a mine exploration by friend. Within just a few pages of the most basic exposition the story begins. For this genre and being that the terranean characters matter little, jumping into the plot like this makes the reading fun. For a 19th century it reads very fast and before long the reader will be well acquainted with the ways of the vril-ya and \\"vril\\" - the power source of the coming race. It really is a fun read.The only problem with this book is that while Lytton goes through an enormity of steps to describe the culture and idiosyncrasies of the vril-ya the book at times reads more like notes of an anthropologist than a literary novel. Of course this may be the intention and since it is such a quick and enjoyable read, we can forgive the author of this. If you are fan of Lord Lytton or a fan of early Sci-Fi this is a definite read. I also would recommend this book to anyone who like 19th century novels and think this should be included in more high school English literature classes because it does not fit the stereotype and would be a welcome break for many students. While we know quite well that this work is purely fantastical it is really enjoyable to see how the mind of the 19th century saw the possibility of worlds going on underground and it is fun to imagine and believe...-- Ted Murena"},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"Written in 1871 The Coming Race was the last novel ever written by Lytton, he died two years later.

Worth a read, especially if you are interested in the development of science fiction."},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"In this 1871 work, Lytton presents the reader with an early science fiction tale about an American adventurer whom we come to know only as \\"Tish\\". The author wrote the story near the end of his own life in 1873; however, he exposes his protagonist to vignettes of technology and ethical concepts which would not actualize until the 20th Century!At the outset of the story Tish accompanies an associate deep into the bowels of a mine, presumably somewhere in Europe. It is therein that the two enter a subterranean world. The associate is killed almost immediately by a \\"krek,\\" a creature with, \\"...a vast and terrible head with open jaws and dull, ghastly, hungry eyes -- the head of the monstrous reptile resembling that of a crocodile or alligator, but infinitely larger than the largest creature of that kind I had ever beheld in my travels.\\"From this point to almost the end of the work Tish is exposed to, and made the dubious guest of, a highly advanced culture in terms of technology: the Vril-ya. They represent the futuristic, powerful faction of the larger underworld race which is referred to as the \\"Ana\\". The non-Vril-ya were regarded as barbarians by the Vril-ya and were kept on the fringes of the technologically superior Vril-ya regions, (a situation which I regard as symbolism of the Jewish People of Europe during this era).The author presents the Vril-ya as having aspired to social and civil preeminence; however, the excellence of their political systems and their philosophies, while devoid of conflagration and dispute, were shrewdly left for the reader to appraise.Vril-ya society, in a nutshell, was static. They had no desire for wealth since each person could have anything s/he wanted by way of \\"Vril\\". Their diet was pseudo-vegetarian, milk being their singular non-vegetarian indulgence. A lazy society by nature, they considered Democracy to be primitive and thus perceived to be found only in barbarous cultures. Their own form of government was classified as \\"benevolent autocracy,\\" except that the benevolence extended neither to the non-Vril-ya subterranean who shared their geography nor to any other. The most significant cultural divergence from surface dwelling humans hinged upon the fact that Vril-ya women were not only larger than males, they were also the assertive and dominant gender in their society.Lytton was quite clever in his approach to analogizing Vril-ya Society to contemporaneous European events and attitudes. The technique is reminiscent of a later work by a fellow Englishman, J.R.R. Tolkien, author of \\"the Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". It's also clear that Lytton was brilliantly intuitive in regard to his vision of futuristic technology.The work is quite provocative in this regard: Lytton leaves the fate of mankind as an open issue with his Hitchcockian conclusion. Hence, do the Vril-ya exemplify God's [first] \\"unsuccessful experiment\\" in creating mankind? We He nullify the power of Vril in the event that the Vril-ya and the surface dwellers come into conflict? Or do the Vril-ya represent God's success story... and will humankind thus be purged from the Earth's surface as part of a \\"Master plan\\"? The latter appears to be the author's rendition and interpretation of \\"The Revelation to John\\" (in \\"The Holy Bible\\").This is a superb yarn and seizes upon much of the \\"Hollow Earth\\" to-do of the period. This terrific book is timeless literature, expressed in the sci-fi genre and is just as compelling today as the day it was originally published. My highest recommendation even for non-science fiction enthusiasts."},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"The Coming Race is a fine sci-fi novel, of the 1800's variety. For the most part it is quite enjoyable, and Bulwer-Lytton's vision of the Vrilya is quite comprehensive. Still, though, overall the book felt a little too short, and a little too amateurish, when compared against H.G. Wells, or more modernish sci-fi authors. Still, a recommended read by all means!Regarding the Broadview Press edition, I always get one of these books if I'm reading classic fiction because I love all the extras they have, like essays or other short related stories by the same author or script and newspaper excerpts, however I was sorely disappointed to find none of the above in this book, beyond an introduction that didn't tell me much that Wikipedia hadn't already."},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"Written by Bulwer-Lytton of Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Competition fame, this isn't the greatest novel I've ever read.

Whatever that is. He goes through the usual discussions of how their language works, funerals, foods and all that that you might expect in this sort of work, but thankfully in less detail than usual (the whole novel is only around 100 pages).

Tolerable, but if that really bugs you, get a different edition."},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"Reviewed by Leslie Granier for Reader Views (5/07)\\"The Coming Race\\" is a book that will best appeal to individuals who enjoy studying different civilizations and learning about how their citizens come to behave and believe the way they do. It incorporates aspects of both science fiction and fantasy. This book follows the accounts of a man who has fallen into an underground world that is so different from the world he knows. The author utilizes a very descriptive style to portray the intuitive thoughts of this narrator as he recalls this experience.The residents of this underground society are known as the Vril-ya. They lead simple and peaceful lives in which there is no war and no crime. In fact, if someone is unhappy in their society, his only recourse is to emigrate to a different tribe. In their world, no individual is considered superior to another individual (including the leaders) in order to ascertain there will be no jealousy among the people. Another major difference is that children are the workers and are entrusted with the toughest jobs such as killing any dangerous creatures that are encountered. In the beginning, the narrator seems impressed with this seemingly perfect civilization. However, he comes to question whether it is a good thing to have such a controlled and stagnant society and worries that this type of advanced civilization may eventually take over the world.This book started off great and I expected it would be action-packed and full of adventure. However, I was somewhat disappointed that it turned out to be mainly a narrative. I would have preferred more dialogue between the characters. The chapter about the development of their language (Chapter XII) was particularly grueling and contributed to the slow pace. I did enjoy the author's use of lesser known vocabulary words. It is good to know that my high school years were well spent.Although this book was first published in 1871, there is much that can be learned from it. \\"The Coming Race\\" makes some important points about what constitutes a productive and successful society. Having no war and no crime sounds great, as does complete equality among individuals. However, once this type of \\"perfection\\" is achieved, life will become extremely dull as there can be no debates or exchanges of ideas to keep things interesting. The world needs conflict and change so there can be progress and growth.Book received free of charge."},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"If you like Journey to the Center of the Earth by Jules Verne, then you'll probably like this. It seems to have been inspired by it, but explores many social issues that were ahead of its time. It is a quick and easy read."},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"With my review I will touch on some points that may entice curious readers to spend the few hours it takes to read this fascinating book. As you will see, I found that reading about this book was even more interesting than the novel itself.Bulwer-Lytton's biography and list of accomplishments may surprise someone who knew nothing of him previously. As a musician, I was interested to learn that it was his novel, \\"Rienzi, the last of the Roman tribunes\\" (1835) that inpired one of Richard Wagner's early operas. His novel, \\"Paul Clifford\\" (1830), spawned the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, thanks to its opening sentence, which reads in part, \\"It was a dark and stormy night\\". What is less known but more important is the incredible influence of \\"The Coming Race\\" on subsequent generations.I was drawn to this book indirectly by learning a bit about the origins of Theosophy and the influence of the Theosophical movement on various aspects of Nazism and on David Icke. (The Christian researcher Chris White has shown the strong influence of Theosophy on David Icke.) But whence came Madame Blavatsky's inspiration? Believe it or not, much of her work is plagiarized from a single work by the novelist Edward Bulwer-Lytton, \\"The Coming Race\\".It was the very unusual character called Joseph George Caldwell who actually led me to read this book. He has done a great service in assembling passages from four different books in a 47-page document (easily found on the Internet) which includes only a brief introduction by Caldwell himself. Caldwell's essay, \\"On Edward Bulwer-Lytton: Agharta, Shambhala, Vril and the Occult Roots of Nazi Power\\", includes passages from books by Ren&eacute; Gu&eacute;non, Victoria LePage, Joscelyn Godwin, and the recently deceased Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke. The cited books are all available on Amazon. The various passages document the unquestionable influence of \\"The Coming Race\\" on various writers and certain political operators who followed Bulwer-Lytton.\\"The Coming Race\\" is replete with ideas that were current when the book was written, including Darwinism, especially Social Darwinism, and eugenics. Some of the science fiction aspects look several decades into the future with with the devices and contraptions depicted. The underground Vril-ya race is made to seem futuristic, yet timeless, with the archaic form of speech that Bulwer-Lytton assigns them. I would venture that it is probably more interesting to read this book in light of the enormous influence it has had rather than for its literary qualities.The novel closes with a warning from the first person narrator about The Coming Race. Little did Bulwer-Lytton know that the warning should have been about the novel itself."},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"Interesting text, and I guess where people can draw some of the Nazi images from, but don't read this expecting Hitler's master plan to come jumping off the page at you.

Not so much science fiction as much as it is a look into a utopian society that commands a power we can only imagine. He talks more of culture than technology and science.

In reading something old, you will find something new, as reading something new you will find something old."},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"Bulwer-Lytton's novella is like fine wine: drink slowly and savor each taste. His prose is both archaic and beautiful, not unlike Shakespere, a comparison I am happy to make. Complex and meandering sentences, sometimes a full paragraph long, add a note of authority and beauty to this fine story.Although its place is an abode within the \\"hollow earth,\\" its story is timeless and deals, in a very personal way, with the eternal debate about whether a mysterious utopia or the vagaries of life here on the surface, with all its problems and uncertainties, is preferable. Lest I reveal our hero's choice I will say no more.A wonderful read, certain to remain within the annuals of cult classics!"},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"I'm something of a Bulwer Lytton fan, so I looked forward to this, one of his rare works in the field of speculative fiction. Oddly, though, here Bulwer tends to disregard even the science of the early 1870s in which it was written. It's the tale of a Gilded Age American mining engineer's encounter with the super-developed subterranean culture of the Vril Ya. Despite its imagined aircraft and robotic automatons, the book is really a fantasy. It's based on the idea of a race of humans with innate supernatural powers who have created a fossilized and somewhat Buddhist-style peaceful society, but who also feel morally obliged to destroy \\"inferior\\" cultures such as ours. I think the author intended a parallel with the European colonialism of his time. There is also an interesting cultural reversal of the roles of men and women, which includes some of Bulwer's liveliest writing. But on the whole, the book is more of a prolonged philosophical anecdote than an entertainment."},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"A man named Bulwer Lytton had written a book called The Coming Race in 1871 which describes a race of men psychically far in advance of our own said to live in caves in the center of the Earth, soon to emerge to reign over the rest of us. The Vril Society established itself as a reaction to this book.The Vril Society (or the Luminous Lodge) combined the ideals of the Illuminati with Hindu Mysticism, Theosophy and the Quabbala. It was the first German nationalist group to use the swastika as an emblem linking Eastern and Western occultism. The Vril Society presented an idea of a subterranean matriarchal socialist utopia ruled by superior beings that had mastered the mysterious energy called the Vril Force.The Vril Society formed shortly before the Nazis came to power. They believed they had secret knowledge that would enable them to change their race and become the equals of men hidden in the bowels of the Earth through methods of concentration based in Ignatius Loyala's Spiritual Exercises."},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"This book perhaps was inspired by Lytton's s&eacute;ances with Daniel Dunglas Home. A character Zee is mentioned. \\"Z\\" was reportedly a spirit who influenced Lytton to write Zanoni. It is a very short book. It took me about an hour to read. I can see how it might have been interesting 140 years ago, but I think it can only be recommended to hardcore fans of early fantasy/science fiction. Lytton has a sprawling style of writing with paragraphs that sometimes drag on for a whole page. The one thing that I found slightly interesting was that with the concept of the \\"vril bath\\" he appeared to anticipate Wilhelm Reich's orgone box."},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"This is a dreadful novel, whose only claim to fame is that it inspired a large bunch of nutters to create the Second World War. It's content though entirely fictional prompted the creation of the Theosiphists, the Vril Society, the Thule Society and ultimately formed the philosophy of the NAZI Party. As entertainmant, its a total loss,a poor version of A Journey To the Center of the Earth. Even Tarzan at tne Earth's Core is a more enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"I bought this book hoping it would explain the inspiration for the Vril Society. Why would anyone be moved by this book to form a society following the idea of Vril?? Not only is it boring, but it is written like a children's book.

I'm being biased only b/c I've read so many things about how the Vril Society influenced Nazism...and now I can't imagine why.

However, the man stutters terribly and after he leaves neither Mason or Della Street can believe that he is actually a bishop. After the man is hit on the head, the story takes on many convolutions, in my opinion it is close to the most complex case that Mason has taken on. Gardner introduces many options, develops them slowly and then suddenly the \\"truth\\" comes out in a few pages.There are many possible suspects and near the end, Mason says that he has come up with an explanation that is a wild one, yet it is the only one that fits the facts. There are impersonations, ruthless con men and other lesser characters that distract you from the search for the real killers.The best part of the book is the scene where Mason is in the office of Hamilton Burger, his courtroom opponent. Unlike many of the other Perry Mason books, Burger is depicted as a man who respects and even likes Perry Mason and not as a bumbling fool with simplistic tunnel vision.

Perry notes the strange facts: if the shooter ran away, and Brownley was dead, who drove the car off the wharf? Perry is in an impossible situation. If Brownley drove off the wharf, he was not shot dead by Julia Branner (Chapter XV). A chance remark by Della Street puts a new light on one person's activities the night of the murder. Perry plays this hand and it pays off (Chapter XVI). They find out what happened to Bishop Mallory (Chapter XVII). Perry explained what happened, and why Julia Branner refused to talk (Chapter XVIII). The next chapter concludes this case.In this story Perry was very close to jail and disbarment. He was involved in more action than in other stories. This 1936 novel reflects the outlook of its day."},{"Title":"The case of the stuttering bishop (A Pocket book)","review":"The title character of Erle Stanley Gardner's &quot;The Case of the Stuttering Bishop&quot; enters Perry Mason's office one day and presents an enigmatic story about the granddaughter of a wealthy man. The girl's mother gave up the child for adoption long before, but now the granddaughter is coming forward to claim a share of her grandfather's estate. At the same time, an imposter has come forward--or so says the stuttering bishop. But is he for real, or is he merely an imposter, too?Before Mason can determine the answer to that question, the bishop is attacked in his hotel room and then disappears, apparently into thin air, while boarding a ship. At the same time, Mason is trying to track down the various parties and to determine who's who. When the wealthy grandfather is murdered, though, it appears that Mason has his first guilty client.Unlike many Perry Mason novels, &quot;The Case of the Stuttering Bishop&quot; does not end up in a dramatic court confrontation, and it therefore deviates somewhat from form. The case here is also significantly more convoluted than that in many of the Perry Mason novels. Because of this change of form, I found the novel less satisfying than the other Perry Mason novels I've read. The name Perry Mason, after all, connotes brilliant lawyering, and the emphasis on the detective work here left me disappointed."},{"Title":"The case of the stuttering bishop (A Pocket book)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I've always enjoyed the perry mason books."},{"Title":"The case of the stuttering bishop (A Pocket book)","review":"Enter a world of dark shadows, private dicks, and dames. Gardner's novel is hard-boiled and thrilling. Don't expect much characterization from Gardner, though; his specialty is non-stop action. Although the plot is a bit convoluted and at times difficult to follow, I really enjoyed the fast pace and sense of place. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Puritan Bride","review":"This is a complicated story of the H who is a Royalist and has been given a property previously owned by the h's family. He agrees to become betrothed to her for various reasons, including her possible right of inheritance to the property. She is a puritan and he is part of the excessive and liberal court of Charles, at that time.The story itself is fascinating and interesting and after a strange turn of events, where the h ends up at his home injured and without memory, the H falls in love with the h, without knowing who she is. She in turn softens towards him and they begin a relationship. Later when her memory returns she becomes angry with him once more.later they fall in love despite the schemes of many of the other characters but once again tragedy happens and the h lets the incident come between them. It really grated on my nerves that although our gorgeous H was always kind, patient and loving towards the h, she seldom softened. Honestly this carried on until the final few pages of the book and really spoilt what would otherwise have been an amazingly written and fascinating story.The redeeming characters were the H and his mother, if not for them I wouldn't have given this book any stars at all."},{"Title":"Days Far Away: Memories of Charles Paget Wade","review":"After visiting this man's house I wanted to know more about him. I obsessed about buying this book, and after several fruitless recon e-mails to vendors and the National Trust, I bought the book. WASTE OF MONEY. It is an edited version of CPW's original papers. Without serious psychological interpretation it doesn't illuminate his life at all. It's not even tactilely satisfying. The book is a flimsy small paperback."},{"Title":"Final Cut Pro 2 for Macintosh: Visual QuickPro Guide","review":"Most everyone I know that uses Final Cut Pro owns this book, and reads it far more frequently than the Apple FCP manual itself. That alone is enough to recommend it to any FCP user.Let's get out of the way what this book is, and what it isn't. What it is, is a well written, clear and concise how to book on setting up and using Final Cut Pro. It covers what's most critical (such as logging and capturing, and basic editing and transitions) in excellent detail. And it skims over other areas that most users aren't going to get into very quickly (image stabilization, video filters, etc.). What the book is not, is a &quot;Classroom in a Book&quot; style book, where a new user can just read it from front to back and follow the book while running through exercises. The other thing it is not is a replacement for the Apple FCP manual. Using this book as a reference can sometimes be frustrating as a result. But I use that criticism lightly, as that isn't the real aim of this book.Many people that get into FCP find the Apple FCP manual itself very dry, and daunting. Those are the people who this book is best suited for. Not the total beginner (though a beginner will soon get into it) and not for the most advanced user looking for detailed references."},{"Title":"Final Cut Pro 2 for Macintosh: Visual QuickPro Guide","review":"First off, it's good to point out that the title includes the words 'QuickPro', not 'Quickstart', What this means is, unlike other quickstart books, the book doesn't assume you're a dummy. It instead assumes you have some non-linear editing experience. It's intended at getting an experienced editor up to speed with Final Cut Pro. Coming from AVID and Premiere, this book was great for me. Having said that, it could be possible for a beginner to learn Final Cut Pro using this book, possible, but not the book's intention.The book doesn't have tutorials, but you can still follow along on your computer, or, because they're lots of screen captures you can read it away from the computer and simply imagine you're at the computer. The writing is clear and concise, and the topics are organized well. And the book is cheap!! Recommended."},{"Title":"Final Cut Pro 2 for Macintosh: Visual QuickPro Guide","review":"After cutting on film for many years I took the leap to digital editing with Final Cut Pro. I was lost until a friend showed me this book. This is not like other computer manuals written by antisocial engineers, it is easy to read, clear and concise. Even though it is a technical subject it never got too geeky for me.I'll be sure to get the version 3 book as soon as it comes out."},{"Title":"Final Cut Pro 2 for Macintosh: Visual QuickPro Guide","review":"i just purchased fcp 2.0 couple of weeks ago and its user manual (800+ pages) was just too much to digest. after a friend told me about this book, i ordered it and it is a great alternative to the official manual! this book would definitely help you on your project. highly recommend to any new fcp users."},{"Title":"Final Cut Pro 2 for Macintosh: Visual QuickPro Guide","review":"Final Cut Pro is a serious program for serious editors.

The manual is EXACTLY the same style but more complete. All I can see is a book that I paid money for when I have a manual that gives me exactly what I want.I got FCP2 as a present being I'd always talk about editing my DV footage so thought I'll get round to using it by buying a book, thinking it'd be better than the manual. The manual is great and easy to read. This book is just easy to read! It's like a selection of pages from the manual. If you want a summary of the manual buy this book. I've returned it."},{"Title":"Days of Awe: Stories for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur","review":"Kimmel provides three winning tales for the most solemn days of the Jewish calendar, one for each mitzvah, or good deed, a Jew must perform to obtain forgiveness for wrongs done during the previous year. He opens with the longest, on charity, or Tzedakah--the requirement for which Jewish tradition is most uncompromising.The glove maker's wife Rivka prepared for Rosh Hashonah, placing two loaves of round challah into her oven next to a pot of scraps of meat and some potato--hardly enough to be called stew. But she was grateful, as times were hard and others had even less.After a knock at the door, she expected a beggar, to whom she was embarrassed to have little to give. Instead, an elegant officer appeared. He asked her to care for his samovar--a family heirloom--during his seven-year posting to a distant land. She unwrapped the samovar to find it black with tarnish and covered in cobwebs, and polished it, with no effect.Another beggar knocked and she gave him a coin. The samovar brightened. She puzzled and polished it again. A poor old woman, barely able to pay her rent, passed in the street. Rivka ran to give her the larger of her two challahs.She returned to find the samovar again strangely brighter still.Rivka's husband then then rushed in, excited that a nobleman had bought a pair of leather gloves for which a widow had refused to pay. When Haskel asked for five crowns, the nobleman offered 100 and gave the glove maker 900 crowns more to make nine more pairs.The couple, confused, turned to their rabbi, who advised them that they had been visited by the Prophet Elijah himself. At the end of seven years, they would have to give the samovar back, and everything would be as it was before. \\"You have been given seven years of good luck. Use them well.\\"Rivka rushed back to the market, buying a fish for the widow, and bread, meat and vegetables for the other poor people. The samovar was now nearly clean. After the holidays, all the money was gone but Haskel sold gloves as fast as he could make them. Of this wealth, they used only what they needed and gave the rest to others. After seven years, the officer returned to find the samovar shining perfectly.\\"This samovar is older than the world,\\" he explained, his eyes beaming with kindness and wisdom. \\"In all the years of its existence, no one has taken better care of it than you. I believe you have earned the right to keep it.\\"Rivka and Haskel refused, but as they turned to take the samovar down for the officer, he disappeared. They lived for many years, and the samovar remained on their shelf, gleaming brighter than 1,000 suns.Kimmel's stories of prayer and repentance gleam as well.---Alyssa A.

(40 Days of Community, Workbook)","review":"I have led the 40 Days of Purpose 3 times in the past 3 years and it impacted my life greatly. But, its impact is no comparison to the change the 40 Days of Community brought within. I have learned how to love God and others better! It also helped me administer church discipline better as a pastor in a way which is more Christ-like. The book is also set-up better than the Purpose Driven Life was. The 40 Days of Community workbook has the devotionals, journal, and small group notes included. You get three books for one! The book covers.... 1.)We're Compelled to Love God's Family 2.)We're Commissioned to Reach Out Together 3.)We're Chosen to Fellowship Together 4.)We're Connected to Grow Together 5.) We're called to Serve Together and 6.)We're Created to Worship Together."},{"Title":"Better Together: What on Earth Are We Here For? (40 Days of Community, Workbook)","review":"I loved this book as much as his Purpose Driven Life bestseller. Rick Warren has a way of writing that is simple yet profound in bringing out the most important points we must consider in our Christian experience. This book is vital in tackling the struggle we face in our culture that drives us to isolation and independence, when God's truth reveals that we function so much better when we do life together...involved with other people, committing ourselves to each other, supporting and encouraging one another and just being together sharing life through good times and bad. He shines the light on the Scriptures that urge us to do life together, and gives us perfect bites one day at a time to consider and implement daily as we seek to be more like Christ and live a life that God desires us to live....one that is focused on relationships. I found that as I made a commitment to other people in my Small Group Bible study, my joy and peace has increased ten-fold. Doing life together really is Better..Together.

A vivid picture of plantation life, guaranteed to bring a tear to your eye."},{"Title":"Plantation","review":"I honestly don't know where to begin with reviewing this book. This is the third book within the past year that has left me speechless. This book has worked its way onto my all time favorites list which includes The Help and Kindred. I have never heard of Fern Smith-brown and I don't remember how I came across this book but I'm so glad that I did! The story was absolutely amazing. I didn't want the story to end. I fell in love with the characters and felt like I personally knew them because they were written so well. The author did an excellent job with the scenery and dialogue between characters. She stayed true to the vernacular of the times. I actually felt like I was transported back into time and lived among these people. The author stayed true to everything that happened during the Civil War error. She even incorporated some of the events that happened. Harriet Tubman even made an appearance in the story. The book is only 219 pages long but with the way the story was written, the author was able to keep the story moving along at a steady pace and wrapped everything up nicely in the end. I normally don't like books that contain reincarnation mixed into the plot but this story was so well written that I hardly even noticed it!I loved these characters so much that I actually felt a sense of loss and sadness when the story came to an end. There were parts in the story where I laughed out loud and there were moments when i wanted to cry. All of her characters had a profound effect on me. I don't want to give any of the plot away because it will reveal too much of the story and I want you, the potential reader to experience the wide range of emotions that i felt while reading it.There was only one event where I experienced a negative response and that was when one of the main characters had died. The character's sister didn't attend the funeral. That was totally unexpected for me. The character's sister was completely dropped from the story after the their father had died earlier in the story. You never hear from the sister again. I highly recommend this book. I wish I could give this book more than five stars!"},{"Title":"K-12 Classroom Teaching: A Primer for New Professionals, Second Edition","review":"I had to buy this book as a required text for a class, but I found over the course of the semester that the information was relevant and presented in a user-friendly format.

It's the first self-help book I've seen that allows you to compare yourself to others (not necessarily the healthiest thing to do, but certainly something I want to know). Sometimes, those percentile rankings made me wonder who his test subjects were. I suspect they are all from some reasonably prosperous, almost all-white suburb of a city in the US - culturally, the tests seemed a bit narrow. I am actually shocked at how materialistic most people must be, if the score spreads here are at all accurate.It's a quick read, and might be helpful to a lot of people. Just don't expect any deep revelations from it."},{"Title":"ABC and XYZ of Bee Culture","review":"The best of the book is that was written for a family members who have first hand experience in the field of beekeeping.Unfortunately the information belongs to 1947, which is the original copyright.

Shame on someone for not putting REPRINT on the title of this.This is a reference book that is updated every few years, and this specific, particular book is NOT the latest edition.Every bit of information in this specific book is from 1947.There is a lack of new and much more modern and needed information such as varroa mite, small hive beetles, as well as recent problems that have arisen within beekeeping.I bought this as a gift for my husband thinking it was the latest edition, and it was not. I went so far as to write on the inside cover.SURPRISE!

Langstroth, wrote the first edition of this work in 1877 and I believe the last revised edition is this one, published orginally in 1947. While it is not in the truest sense a modern guide to beekeeping, as pest and management techniques are issues now facing beekeepers that Mr. Root never dreamed of, it still contains a wealth of useful learnings. Bees and beekeeping have not changed much since 1877, even if some of their challenges have. This book is filled with minutiae helpful to the most modern of beekeepers and is, IMHO, required reading for every beekeeper or bee-o-phile! It is set up as an alphabetical encyclopedia, but includes an exhaustive appendix in the back, and the book encourages a spontaneous exploration of its astonishingly useful and interesting contents. The photos alone are treasures. And the recipe section is charming. If you are new to beekeeping, you will want to also purchase a more modern manual, but every beekeeper should have this book (as well as Dr. T.

That being said this book contains a lot of information, some of it complex, but Bennett writes it in a very user friendly, almost story like fashion. The 10 mystery format of this book allows the book to dip into such topics as \\"Are we alone in the universe\\" and \\"How will the universe end\\" as well as more scientific questions dealing with neutrino's and Gamma Ray bursts (a very interesting topic).Bennett does a great job at relating scientific theories and concepts in and across multiple chapters. He is also very careful to separate fact from theory. He does this while including enough information on the most widely held theory/theories to give the reader a complete picture on each topic. I think I will end up reading this book again, just to cement the wealth of knowledge contained in it. A whole book could be (and I'm sure has been) written about each of Bennet's 10 'mysteries'. I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in space or cosmology."},{"Title":"On the Cosmic Horizon: Ten Great Mysteries for Third Millennium Astronomy","review":"This is a very interesting book that discusses where scientists are, and where they're heading, with unraveling some of the most pressing science questions of the day.

Yet, you have to be grateful a Westerner is daring enough to do it on your behalf for the sake of enhancing your awareness in the comfort of your home. His depiction of Africa and Central Asia are unforgetable if not almost terrifying.His specific analysis of Pakistan is fascinating, looking at 'social' factors and then the 'physical' factors. He borrows this social vs. natural factor analysis from Homer-Dixon.As mentioned above, a dimension to his writing, is Kaplan's quality as an \\"intellectual aggregator.\\" He borrows material from tens of luminaries on various subjects. So, he rarely develops a theory in vacuum. He first aggregates different blocks of a political theory and then connects the dots between the blocks. He does that better than most. This makes for a very insightful and informative book."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"I think this is nicely done travelogue. His itinerary was a little haphazard toward the end, but one doesn't always have control over such things. Several accounts in the book have inspired me toward further reading.My main criticism is his writing style- he tends to end every section with a series of provocative questions to which he seems to know at least some of the answers, which he does not give. There is sometimes a sense of incompleteness in his accounts, perhaps not unlike the hurried pace at which he traveled from the Congo through Egypt (skippingly actually), Turkey, Iran, Central Asia, skipping through India and China, then finally to SE Asia. One nice piece was about an Iranian through whose camera lens much of the West saw the Islamic revolution and about some of his exploits to get photos without getting killed. I was especially amazed to read about Rishi Valley in India (Chapter 23). It was one of the few bright spots he visited, and read as if it were lifted out of Aldous Huxley's _Island_ (1961). It makes sense as we learn that Huxley had known Jiddu Krishnamurti, the philosopher whose ideas seemed partly set in motion in this part of India that has successfully followed a non-Western model of development.His earlier book _Balkan Ghosts_ garnered widespread praise for his prescience of the Balkan Wars. If any of what he foreshadows in this book comes to pass, we'll be in for some quite 'interesting times' indeed."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"I READ THIS BOOK TO BROADEN MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE 4TH WORLD (THESE PLACES DON'T EVEN QUALIFY AS THIRD WORLD). THIS IS NOT THE FIRST WORK BY THIS AUTHOR WHICH I'VE READ (HIS BOOK \\"SURRENDER OR STARVE\\" IS EXCELLENT) AND IT IS NOT, PERHAPS, HIS BEST. THE MEANDERING, STOP AND GO, RABBIT TRAIL PROGRESS OF THE BOOK WAS A BIT DISTRACTING AND FRUSTRATING FOR ME. THAT SAID, THE LACK OF ORDER IN HIS PRESENTATION OF THE MATERIAL DOES FIT HIS SUBJECT MATTER (HE WRITES OF HIS TRAVELS IN THE UNDERBELLY OF AFRICAN AND ASIAN CIVILIZATION). THE UNEXPECTED RESULT WAS THE FEELING OF HAVING EXPERIENCED TO SOME DEGREE THE CHAOS WHICH HE DESCRIBES.AFTER READING ABOUT THE LIVES OF PEOPLE IN THE FORGOTTEN UNDERBELLY OF AFRICA, I FELT A SENSE OF ANGST AND SHEER DESPERATION - THAT SEEMS TO CHARACTERIZE THAT POPULATION. ON THAT LEVEL, THE BOOK WAS INTERESTING AND QUITE ENLIGHTENING. ON THE LEVEL OF NUTS AND BOLTS - THE READ ITSELF - HOWEVER, IT WAS AT TIMES A BIT LABORIOUS, AS TRUDGING THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH.... I'D RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO THOSE WITH TIME ON THEIR HANDS AND A DESIRE TO EXPERIENCE THE FEEL OF THE 4TH WORLD FORGOTTEN SOCIETIES. THE WORTHWHILE NUGGETS IT OFFERS REQUIRE AN AMOUNT OF DIGGING TO REACH, BUT IT HAS ENLIGHTENED ME TO A WORLD OF EXPERIENCE QUITE FOREIGN TO MY OWN."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"Don't buy this book thinking it's merely a travelogue of some of the world's poorer and lesser-known nations. (In fact, if that's all you're looking for, then I highly recommend Pico Iyer's Falling off the Map instead.) No, it's a cleverly disguised sociopolitical analysis, but unlike most such works, it's refreshing in that Kaplan freely admits his observations are subjective and possibly wrong. But that's exactly the problem. Despite physically travelling to all these destinations, Kaplan seems to spend precious little time actually TALKING with real citizenry in most places. Instead he whisks from Western hotels in the capital to meetings with various pols and officials before scuttling off to the next country, sometimes just days later. And therein lies the failure of an otherwise worthy effort from an outstanding writer: the superficiality of most of his experiences in these places. Give him a few days in a country, coupled with a bit of background reading and perhaps a few conversations with experts at home, and Kaplan feels justified in making sweeping generalizations about where these nations have been, and where they are going. Had Kaplan just stopped country-hopping and stayed in one region for a longer time, I think his conclusions would have been much improved. A side note: having travelled to a number of these countries (as one of the &quot;backpackers&quot; that Kaplan scornfully derides throughout the book), his constant dramatizing of the mundane grows tedious after a while...I think the only person surprised that the third world can be dirty, smelly, and unpredictable is Kaplan himself."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"In this book, written some 15 years ago as huge parts of the world were coming out of decades of communism, US journalist Kaplan tells of his travels to some of the more troubled spots in the world: West Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, Indochina. His thesis is that huge parts of the world are going through a period of anarchy, or, to put it in another words, they are going to hell. The chapters about Iran and Turkey are surprisingly good (Kaplan bothered himself into learning about the history and politics of these places before going there, and his impressions are reasoned and intelligent); the material about Central Asia is by comparison, extremely poor (he doesn't seem to say there anything except that these countries reeks). The other countries covered are in between in terms of the quality of his comments. Overall, and given the fact that Kaplan has the opportunity to travel that few other people have, this book could have been far better. Despite the huge bibliography in the back, the research into it seemed particularly poor."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"Robert Kaplan's account of his mid-1990's travels through a range of developing countries is neither a gushing self-centred travelogue, nor a dispassionate analysis of societies and nation-states, but rather something more valuable than the former and more accessible than the latter. His experiences travelling from West Africa to South-East Asia with relatively limited resources provide considerable material for trenchant and penetrating observations and to record at times startling and unexpected details of the political and social climates of his destinations. While his observations are backed by considerable research and original analysis (I would disagree with his more negative reviewers who consider him almost a cartoon neo-con with predictable and excessively ethnocentric views), Kaplan does cover a lot of ground in 'The Ends of The Earth' and as a result this book is a bit uneven (his discussion of Central Asia is perhaps the most perceptive part of the book, that of West Africa somewhat less so) and appears at times to lack the nuance and rigour of his work in 'Balkan Ghosts' or 'Surrender or Starve'. That said, I still recommend Kaplan as an interesting and original observer of the world, and a potential springboard for reading and thinking further into some of the issues raised - even if the direction he is coming from is obvious."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"Although not everyone will agree with Robert Kaplan's perspectives, this is an amazingly insightful look at some key hotspots and potential future hotspots in the world. The first time I read this book, I was struck by how Kaplan seemed to have an unusual ability to grasp key social and political characteristics of places as diverse as West Africa, Central Asia and Southeast Asia. Having travelled to a few of the places that Kaplan wrote about encouraged me to look beyond my initial impressions and to think more about his thoughtful observations. Even though the book is now 15 years old, it is still a great and relevant read which I highly recommend!"},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"First a few criticisms: Kaplan covers a monster amount of ground in this book without developing a cohesive narrative element. For instance a journey along the Silk Road would have an obvious narrative element. He could have developed even a contrived means of guiding the reader along. Perhaps he could have matched the footsteps of Alexander the Great, or used geology or some common element to give continutuity and guidance to the reader. Some might argue he uses the common travails of the developing world to link his travels but instead he spent most of his time explaining how Iran wasn't Turkey for example. I think this lack of cohesion can confuse the reader. But ultimately, Kaplan is not for light reading. He is not intent on amusing. And he is very interested in giving the reader the unvarnished world as he sees it.So while I criticize Kaplan for not being Thoreaux of some other great travel writer it may also be his greatest strength. Kaplan is his own State Department, CIA and Assocaited Press. He gives background derived from copious research. He offers experiential comparisons. He draws on local sources. All balanced with what can almost be called objectivity.At times, Kaplans near love fest with Iran annoyed. But it is hard to fault someone with experience well beyond that of any diplomat or common reporter.All in all, this is not his best book but still extremely enjoyable and worth reading."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"Kaplan has got to be one of the best foreign journalists of our day. I especially could not put down the first section on Africa, where he describes the Third-World regions of equatorial Africa with such precision that the disgust, nausea, and blood-ridden condition of many of these people was almost like a pop-up picture book in it's concrete detail. His stark realism is absolutely stunning in describing (from a secondary source) the difference between the developed nations and Africa proper:{paraphrase}\\" A stretch limo with US.

Although hesitant to read it at first, this book quickly became one of my favorite books ever. Kaplan travels to some of the most impoverished and unstable regions of the world, including Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and the Far East, where he goes into great detail about what he has witnessed. As one can imagine the vast majority of these travels are extremely sad and makes one think about the state of the world. In addition, Kapalan provides much background information, about the regions' history, the people that inhabit the area, etc. Although sometimes it is not quite the easiest read, it is well worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"Those familiar with Kaplan&#8217;s work know the author doesn&#8217;t exactly travel to the world&#8217;s vacation spots. When most Americans go abroad, they explore prefer to Paris or sip espresso in a warm villa in Tuscany. When Kaplan goes abroad he finds himself traveling in countries where underpaid soldiers shake him down for bribes to pass their checkpoints and people live in appallingly squalid conditions. &#8220;Ends of the Earth&#8221; will give the reader a vivid feel for life in the Third World.Kaplan&#8217;s &#8220;Atlantic Monthly&#8221; article, &#8220;The Coming Anarchy&#8221;, is kind of a primer for reading &#8220;Ends of the Earth&#8221; (portions of it re-appear): much of the world depicted by Kaplan is nasty, brutal and harsh, as the collapse of law and order leads to a repeating circle of violence and chaos. The more the state collapses under the strain of violence, the more the violence increases. Environmental decay, in turn, makes natural resources scarce, which causes people to fight over these ever-dwindling resources. Kaplan concentrates on Africa in the original article but he has expanded on that point in &#8220;Ends of the Earth&#8221;, by pointing out that his thesis is applicable to other problems in the world: China, India, Egypt, Turkey, etc.Kaplan basically backpacks around each of the countries, staying in slummier hotels and living with local families. Like any good travel writer, Kaplan gives the writer a vivid feel for the places he goes to. A lot of travel readers might find Kaplan&#8217;s focus on history uninteresting, but I appreciate it because I agree that where we&#8217;ve been is the closest indicator of where the world is going. Someone once said that a page of history is worth a volume of logic, and I think Kaplan illustrates how history and geography dictate what sort of culture, economy and foreign policy a nation has.I particularly enjoyed the sections of the book dealing with Iran. I&#8217;ve long been fascinated by the Persian land, with its ancient culture. Kaplan presents a country that is misunderstood in the Western world: Iran is a land of rich culture and a deep appreciation of art and beauty. The picture that Kaplan presents to the reader is that, unlike the rest of the Arab world, with its spare and dogmatic adherence to Islam, Iran is a country with a deep appreciation of beauty and a great capacity for tolerance. Its people are intelligent and open-minded, its society is not rife with chauvinism and hatred and there is great possibility in Iran for a meaningful dialogue. The cultural observations Kaplan noted: how open-minded Iranian students were, how Iranian women were treated better and were more assertive than their Saudi counterparts, how tolerant the Shi&#8217;ite brand of Islam seemed compared with its more warrior-like Sunni counterparts, are all important clues to Kaplan that Iran is a nation far more willing to break bread with the U.S. and have some sort of partnership. The section on Iran is well-worth the price of the book.One of the great things about Kaplan&#8217;s writing is his ability to smoke out trends or facts that escape the notice of the modern media. His comments about Iranian culture and society are an example of this. Also interesting is seeing how environmental scarcity and ethnic and religious tensions drive history: the growth of the Thai sex industry, for example, has much to do with deforestation in northern Thailand. (In the book Kaplan explains that logging by the Thai military means that rural villagers in the north can no longer make ends meet because their farmland is being destroyed, so many girls in their teens and twenties go to Bangkok to work in the massage parlors and the go-go bars.) Before reading &#8220;Ends of the Earth&#8221; I didn&#8217;t know that, and I doubt that people would make the causal connection between the two.Liberals, I suspect, won&#8217;t have much to cheer from reading &#8220;The Ends of the Earth&#8221;, and most of Kaplan&#8217;s critics sit on the left. Kaplan sees himself as a classical realist, so he has no words of praise for idealists or those who bring their ideological causes to an analysis of the world. These liberals who think U.S. law enforcement customs are possible in the Third World are, Kaplan believes, getting the world wrong by bringing their own ideology to the table.Unsurprisingly, Kaplan&#8217;s unsparing criticism of African politics and government has provoked many to roundly denounce him as a racist, a charge that simply doesn&#8217;t hold water. Kaplan is no racist: he sees disorder and writes about it, and he sees the lack of African development and freedom (as compared with Europe and America) as mostly being a function of environment and social factors. Unlike many liberals, Kaplan has actually bothered to try and travel like a native citizen would: no limousines, no private jets. The world that he sees is the world that people live in. There is nothing racist in that.Critics also fail to note that Kaplan has criticized Western nations like France, England, Portugal, and Germany for drawing borders in Africa without any sort of concern for having them actually make geopolitical sense. As a consequence, Kaplan notes, often ethnic tribes are cut in half by European borders, contributing to the lack of unity and the social strife that has engulfed West Africa.Finally, I wish that Kaplan had devoted a bit more time in his travels to India and Southeast Asia, instead of Central Asia. As Kaplan notes, he&#8217;s been to Pakistan ten times in his life, so he has written volumes about the country. I was fascinated to read about India, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand because they were so different from the places Kaplan usually goes culturally and politically. After I got done reading the final section on Indochina, I thought: &#8220;I want to know more!&#8221;In the final analysis, &#8220;Ends of the Earth&#8221; is a terrific book. Those interested in the world around us will be fascinated. I highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"Having just travelled to a couple of former Communist Eastern European countries, I found this book to be an entertaining read and very informative. Kaplan definitely doesn't present a completely objective view, but I think that makes it more interesting. I especially enjoyed the fact that he frequently compared the different places that he had visited to each other. It gave me quite a bit to think about.The only thing that I would improve upon in the book, is that I wish he had described the different places in more detail. I say this, of course, realizing that if he had gone to the depth I would've liked, the book would probably have topped 2000 pages!Still, I recommend this as a good, but engaging read, for people who would like to learn more about international politics, other countries, and the gap between the Western world - and everyone else. It will most certainly change your perspective."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"With the recent events in Afghanistan and America, no more than ever is the time for people to start educating themselves on the world around them. This book shows, in part, the vaccuum created by the end of the Cold War, and the power struggles that can be blames on more than economics. This includes a very informative section on the Turkic cultures that inhabit Central Asia, as well as information on Iran. Do not rely on everything you see on TV - sit down and read this book!!!"},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"This is not a travel book and should not be judged as such. No superficial talk here of pretty buildings, uncomfortable hotels or quaint wildlife. Robert Kaplan does not attempt to merely travel in geographic space, but ventures to travel in time. And the image he brings of the future is chilling. I will not try to judge what he writes - that would neither be fair nor appropriate, but how he writes it. In that respect, he is very effective. He almost made me feel the sensation (dread!) of being in these lands and very successfully transmitted his message of the future he fears. Actually, it is perhaps that sense of dread that makes me withold that 5th star. This text is an introduction to much food for thought. I would strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"Robert D. Kaplan paints a very scary picture of most of the world. Unforunately, I think he is right. The United States, Cananda, Western Europe, and Japan...we are the exceptions. The parts of the world that are relatively stable. Kaplan shows through his journies to different parts of the third world the coming anarchy. Kaplan shows too clearly what poverty, crime, religion, civil war, etc. are doing to the rest of the world. Kaplan is giving us a warning and a clear reason why we can never be isolationalist. We must do whatever we can to stop the anarchy that characterizes much of the world from spreading too far. This book is a great read and quite eye-opening."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"Well crafted, insightful, wretchingly poetic, and horribly realistic. The ends of the earth, a slice of the misery from which Americans and other fortunate individuals in ordered societies are insulated, can upset their well-satiated stomachs. This is not a happy sweet book. Don't read it for dessert."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"This was one of those books that is hard to put down. Kaplan provides insight to the decay of the nation state and how boundaries in much of the world are being redrawn according to ethnic and cultural lines. Having myself travelled in some of the parts of the world that Kaplan refers to in his book (Kazakhstan, Western China and surrounding area) I have to admire the man not only for his thought provoking book but also for his endurance and absolute lack of fear. Some of these locations are less than safe for the average Joe to be travelling in. This is a must read for sure."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"A great book, Kaplan is good at using words and expressions that appeal to your senses and makes you feel like you were there with him. He fuses those writing skills with outstanding ploitical analysis and gives a dark ominous picture of what is to come to the developed world."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"Kaplan takes risks that few ivory tower academicswould dare both physical and intellectual.

I don't know why I am glad Kaplan did the traveling and not me. I am truly amazed that anyone can have enough courage to travel in such hostile environments. Well the grass is not always greener on the other side. It reminded me a lot of the Dr. Seuss book where the people who butter their toast on one side hate the people who butter their toast on both sides. It seems no matter where you go people define themselves by who they hate. I truly learned a lot from this book. I like the anecdotes but it bogged down in a lot of statistics and academic foot noting. Leave that to the college papers, I want real life stories. Fascinating, maybe pessimistic but then I am one of those sheletered Americans who finds Tijuana strangely trying"},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"This book is not your average travel memoir. It is an introspective analysis of the social and political conditions of developing countries from West Africa to Thailand. Typical travelogues can be titillating, but because the authors actually know so little about the cultures that they are visiting for a short time, readers learn more about the authors themselves than about the countries being described. However, this book is quite different in that respect--Kaplan obviously knows this region well, having worked as a journalist in the region for years. As a journalist, he knows which questions to ask and from whom. He describes conversations with high government officials (many of which wish to remain anonymous), as well as tidbits that he picks up from traveling companions and encounters with ordinary people. He backs up all of these personal anecdotes with hard facts and statistics footnoted to hundreds of resources listed in the bibliography. What he has to say can about the countries and cultures that he visits can be quite disturbing.One of Kaplan&#65533;s goals for his trip is to try to discover why some regions of the developing world are bordering on anarchy, or have actually slipped over the edge, and others seem to be working well for the community. By observing societies and talking to leaders as well as ordinary people, he attempts to discover what works to build a civil world. He considers the varying influences that tradition, religion, education, government, and environment may have on a society. While he points out that education, particularly literacy, seems to be vital for maintaining civilization, he finds that there are no absolute factors that can predict which societies will succeed and which will devolve into barbarism.Many of Kaplan&#65533;s observations are quite disturbing, such as when he points out entire regions where per capita income has fallen dramatically since the 1960s, yet population has risen, in contrast to other regions with similar levels of development in 1960 where exactly the opposite has happened. What&#65533;s more, Kaplan points out that many of the reasons for these problems are internal to the societies themselves, such as corruption and traditional practices. The people are understandably frustrated, they have little or no education, and they have easy access to powerful weapons. Unscrupulous or ill-educated leaders can easily point the blame for these problems entirely at the &#65533;West&#65533;, redirecting the anger of the masses so that the society does not implode with its own violence.Some readers may find some of Kaplan&#65533;s comments racist or bigoted, but having lived for 4 years in a place where the majority of the population comes from the countries that Kaplan describes, I find that every word rings true for me. Kaplan has put into words my own observations and speculations about what I see around me. The book is filled with hundreds of short remarks that capture so much of my experience here, such as when he quotes an Indian educator as saying &#65533;Only when children are taught to categorize and to analyze, rather than merely to memorize, can they achieve anything in the modern world. Intercommunal and tribal hatreds&#65533;arise from too much faulty oral memory and too little self-motivated analysis.&#65533; But the one that will stick with me for years is his point that you can&#65533;t give wealth, and you can&#65533;t pump it out of the ground. You can only create wealth. This book will be of interest to anyone who is trying to understand the forces behind current world events. It should be read by all top-level policy makers."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"If you ever wondered why the U.S. Intelligence Community tries so desperately to keep its annual budget secret from Congress and the citizens, this book might provide a clue: one man, very well-grounded in historical and contextual reading, is capable of reporting extremely valuable insights that neither a $30 billion a year spy world nor a $3 billion a year diplomatic community seem capable of either comprehending or communicating to the public.Robert D. Kaplan gets three big things right: he studies history before visiting; he is firmly grounded in a geographical or geophysical appreciation of every situation; and he travels on foot and at the lowest common level. The world he sees and reports on is not the world that the pampered and sheltered diplomats, businessmen, and journalists see or understand.Reading Kaplan is a treat for anyone who takes the rest of the world and America's naivete with some seriousness. He is correct when he posits a new World War, &quot;a protracted struggle between ourselves and the demons of crime, population pressure, environmental degradation, disease, and culture conflict.&quot;He is at his best when mixing his historical reading with his personal intellect and observations, to arrive at conclusions that contradict conventional wisdom--for instance, his appreciation of Iran as a structured and stable society, and of Turkey as the next mega-power and the keeper of the Islamic flame. His extremely sharp observations about Saudi Arabia as the hidden enemy of the United States of America are very very provocative, especially when one realizes that we are providing them with an extremely generous military and economic program at U.S. taxpayer expense. Saudi funding of terrorism, including Bin Laden, is increasingly documented in the public domain, and U.S. taxpayers need to begin questioning U.S. policy in this specific area.This personal travel narrative is invaluable as a means of contemplating the realities of nations that exist (e.g. the Kurds) alongside states that continue to persecute and deny these nations a right to live. Although another hundred pages follow, the real end of the book is on page 336 where he discusses a living map of the future world, one that is constantly changing and that reflects several realities--a reality of overlapping group identities such as those of language and economic class; a reality of legal boundaries and overlapping and sometimes conflicting cultural boundaries; a reality of power distributed and often shared openly between police, criminals, terrorists, white-collar thieves, and politicians; and a reality of population growth, disease, refugee migrations and genocide; as well as soil and water scarcity.His bibliography is quite worthwhile, and helps make his personal reporting even more valuable. I have but one disappointment, and that is that this prolific author and policy commentator, a major force (indeed, the only continuous voice on foreign policy matters for The Atlantic Monthly), has failed to provide a concluding section that pulls it all together in an executive briefing suitable for policy consideration. There are many valuable lessons and observations in this book, I recommend it highly, but I fear that the policy-makers who most desperately need to be educated will never, ever actually read the book."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"I give this book five stars for one reason: it is important to read it and to keep thinking about its main subject: the future of the nation-state and the possible consequences of its demise. Kaplan knows he is going to be subjective. That's fine. He is well-read and travels with a good piece of luggage: previous knowledge of the history of the places he's going to -unlike most of the backpackers he correctly mocks at-. Kaplan is a good writer. He goes to fascinating and really different places. But the important thing about the book is his reflections on the future of the world, from the standpoint of these societies. This book takes us to some of the places where the future of humanity will be decided, within the next decades. These are regions in crisis, in its clinical, primary meaning: artificial borders, paper-States, overpopulation, an exhaustion of natural resources, forced and vertiginous urbanization, and one more thing: the rapid increase in violent religious fanatism, as a consequence of the erosion of identity in the misery-ridden slums of the Third World. The rank-and-file of the fundamentalist threats is formed by poor peasants who suddenly had lo leave their land and become lumpen-proletariats in Cairo, Ankara or some other megalopolis. West Africa, Egypt, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Southeastern Asia, are &quot;fracture lines&quot;. These regions are living the beginning of the end of the Nation-state as the basic cell of human political organization, only in the other end of the spectrum, compared with the European Union. And yet there is hope. As in Rishi Valley, what we still call the Third World need not be lost for peace, prosperity and a promising future. At least, not all of it. For that outcome to happen, the West has to turn its eyes and minds to help. Clearly, the West can not do what these peoples themselves are not willing to do. But the West must help when it is possible. The elites of these nations must come to terms with their responsibilities in leading their peoples out of the bleak way in which some of them are embarked. It is possible, but first we have to know the problems. And Kaplan is helping with his books."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"Basially, in &quot;The Ends of the Earth&quot;, Kaplan employs the same finely-honed writing technique that he used to good effect on the topics of Yugoslavia and North America, respectively, in &quot;Balkan Ghosts&quot; and &quot;Empire Wilderness&quot; -- namely, to combine travel writing with social scientific analysis to craft a perspective on a locale that is both personal and abstract, immediate and general at the same time. This is a wonderful method, which makes his writing much less dry than other &quot;country studies&quot;, but also leads to Kaplan's fatal flaw of over-exaggeration and over-generalization. His theses on the third world and its future (the basic topic of &quot;Ends of the Earth&quot;) are ground-breaking, original, and probably a little bit too sensationalistic and over-hyped. Nevertheless, it's eye-opening stuff that takes you way beyond the news headlines and guidebooks."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"Although Kaplan attempts to style this dense book as a semi-linear travel narrative, it is actually more of an heavily footnoted eyewitness account of the dramatic transitions occurring in various developing regions. Chock full of provocative and disturbing ideas culled from many social sciences, the book starts with a largely pessimistic 89 pages of West Africa and 37 pages of Egypt. I didn't find anything particularly new or illuminating in these two sections, but they serve as a good introduction to the issues if you aren't familiar with what's happening there, although recent events somewhat date his account of West Africa in particular. It didn't take me long to get fed up with Kaplan's machine gun use of statistics to support his observations. That, and his tendency to repeat himself, undermine his attempts at literary narrative. Fortunately, I came to a deeply engrossing 45 pages of Turkey and the Caucuses, 70 pages of Iran, and 96 pages of Central Asia. These three sections were what made the book for me, even readers already familiar with the areas will find value in Kaplan's account. It was here that Kaplan seemed most comfortable and most knowledgeable. Lots of great info about the ethnic dynamics of the areas and great historical tidbits make these worth interesting even if you don't read the sections before or after. What follows is a sporadically interesting 100 pages on the Indian subcontinent and &quot;Indochina.&quot; The book is greatly aided by its maps, and Kaplan is careful to acknowledge the sources of the ideas he presents. There is also an excellent bibliography for those interested in followup reading. The great value in this book lies in Kaplan's insistence (correct in my belief) that population growth is the single most destabilizing force in the world today and that it must be addressed before all else."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"I read this on my flight to Turkey, as I experienced my first entry into a truly foreign country. Although I didn't take the risk of travelling outside of the &quot;bubble&quot; that Kaplan talks about, sections of this book definitely pertained to my trip. It altered the way I perceived the world around me. Instead of seeing some Istanbul neighborhoods as helplessly impoverished, I looked for signs of the middle-class ambition that Kaplan spoke of. I also realized that my standards of living are not available to most of the world, and The Ends of the Earth was a good introduction to this concept.I find particularly interesting the political context in Kaplan's travel writing. Not only do you get the direct visceral experience of travelling through so-called &quot;third world&quot; countries, but you get the political history. My friend said that the book itself is a journey through thought as it is a journey through countries. There is no final answer to why certain cultures develop in one way and others develop in other ways - but you'll certainly appreciate the process as Kaplan visits developing nations across the world and attempts to analyze the past's impact on the present.This book is highly readable. You simply do not get bored, and I can't think of another non-fiction book that I didn't want to put down at some point."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"I was introduced to Robert Kaplan's work through his articles for Atlantic Monthly. His analysis of the world stage is so insightful and realistic it makes most of the other things I've read in the area seem like Fairy Tales and Demagoguery. In a previous book he successfully foretold the crisis in the Balkans, in this book he brings his pen and his observational acumen to the edge of civilization.This book is essentially a travel journal; Mr. Kaplan joins up with backpackers, gets hassled at borders, gets overcharged for train tickets. Fortunately for the reader, Mr. Kaplan's travels have the singular, though somewhat opaque purpose of divining the state of the societies in which he travels. The things observed, though interesting in their own right, are weaved by Mr. Kaplan into a roughly hewn picture of the cultures in which he travels. Things as simple as the look in the eye of a street urchin or the way in which a woman covers her head contribute to this picture in invaluable ways.Kaplan's assessments are, on the whole, fairly pessimistic and he is skeptical about the efficacy of foreign assistance. One of Kaplan's overarching themes is that many of the dynamics that are at work in these places are nearly impossible to disarm from the outside, and that attempts to do so often cause more harm than good.There is a tinge of fatalism in the accounts of many regions, West Africa, for one. But Kaplan does leave his readers with a mere series of plaintive elegies. His reification of the mechanics of chaotic polity offer many constructive lessons on how to offer modest assistance, and more important, how to avoid exacerbating these situations through well-intentioned meddling.My understanding of the volatile regions of our world was greatly improved by this book. For that reason alone, I recommend it to all readers."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"Contrary to the review above,&quot;he doesn't get it,&quot;; Kaplan &quot;gets it&quot; all too well. Repeatedly in this book he cites the burdens of colonialism and the effects of haphardard geography and willingness to arm anyone claiming to be &quot;democractic&quot; or an anticommunist. I've had the opportunity to travel to some of his destinations and his reflections on the smells, the refuse and the human tragedy of mediocrity hits the mark. He unflinching frames failure in both developed and underdeveloped nations as a persistance of tribalism. Writing about places where non-white people dwell isn't always racist or narrowminded. This book is about first-hand experience and impressions; he balances these observations with facts, figures and literature. Kaplan's above being a neo-Richard Burton or Graham Greene; his work is valuable because it's objectivity with a twist of gut reaction so it's not CIA reports or embassey description. His contribution to und! erstanding the &quot;Third World&quot; is excellent as it is rare. Most importantly, the reader is spared the self-serving memoir or reflections of an academic on sabbical."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"In The Ends of the Earth Kaplan shows how the world is falling apart. This is no ordinary travel book. Kaplan doesn't waste his time by travelling through France or Italy, pointing out nice Bed & Breakfasts. What he does is roam the Third World -- where most of the world's population lives -- and tells us what he observes. Kaplan says that the Third World will be forced into absolute chaos as resources become more scarce and populations increase. There are several instances in history where that combination had disastrous effects on First World nations -- the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Viking invasions, the Mongol invasions, and WWII in the Pacific. Kaplan paints a vivid and terrifying picture of the near-future."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"I finished Kaplan's Ends of the Earth today. I liked the book. Kaplan has consistently been one of my favorite authors (Atlantic Monthly) His theme is consistent: many nation states are not really nation states. I felt that his comments about Iran were especially poignant, given how some view Iran as part of the \\"Axis of Evil\\". I get the sense that when this book was written, Kaplan had great hope for the futureof Iran as they struggle with theocracy.Ecocide, or the killing of natural resources is a new topic for me that Kaplan introduces. According to Kaplan, many developing nations have traded immediate benefits for the long term health of their natural resources. His observations are very very interesting, especially his observations from thepost-Soviet nations like Uzbekistan.Kaplan is a bold, imaginative and thoughtful writer, he is not merely another journalist or another travel writer.

If you have spent significant time in Africa, Central Asia or Southeast Asia, however, you'll find Kaplan to be exactly the kind of expat that made you cringe when they visited you abroad: twenty seconds off the plane, and he's already making sweeping generalizations based on the bathroom in the airport or the time it took him to get through customs..."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"I don't disagree with Kaplan when he is reporting what he actually sees, which I think is well done. However his theories on the reasons for these things are almost always based on some idea of &quot;culture&quot;, where this &quot;culture&quot; is completely fixed, doesn't change, and completely determines the actions of all the people in these &quot;cultures&quot;. For example, Kaplan almost never seems to pay much attention to recent or medium-term political events or actions in the countries he's dealing with - the only sources are either current news reports or colonial texts from two hundred years before. He also almost never talks about the impressions of the scholars and intellectuals of the countries themselves - his &quot;authoritative&quot; information comes from American analysts or from imperial tracts written during the colonial period. Finally, and in my opinion almost damningly, the impression I had was that almost none of the people he speaks to in these countries ever has a name. So, in the end, Kaplan's images are of faceless, homogenous masses that have no analysts of their own, no politics, no decisions, no independence. All they have is &quot;culture&quot;. When someone claims basically that a group of people's behavior is completely determined by their place of origin, we usually describe that as racism. I think that description fits Kaplan fairly well."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"I was severely disappointed. Other than the Togo sequence early in the book, Kaplan isn't interested in &quot;travel&quot; at all; he hardly ever talks to people on the streets, preferring to talk to each country's equivalent of Beltway insiders. Not bad as social studies, but this is NOT a travel book. A hundred years from now, there will be NO reason to read this book, which is not true of a good travel narrative."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"While the story itself is amazing and I would highly recommend it, the hard back version that it listed for sale is more than unfortunate!!! It is a homemade hardback! The \\"publisher\\" has cut the cover off, bound the book and then pasted the cover back on. If you don't like pirated CD's you will not like this hardback version. I recommend buying the paperback; that way you will not only enjoy the amazing story but also the book itself!!"},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"I only read two chapters of the book before I stopped reading. I found these chapters full of clich&eacute;s and sensationalized stories (at least they appear to be). They also lacked original work and rely too much on other references. As an African, I've read many such stories and I feel that such type of books fail to give one a good understanding of the continent that I know. They just reinforce the stereotypical image westerners have about Africa. If you are expecting a good and honest travel narrative book, this is not it. Don't waste your money or time."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"It made me bust a nut in my pants every time I read a word. So at the end of the book I was in a sticky situation."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"The Ends of the Earth reflects the experiences and thoughts of Robert Kaplan (a regular contributor to the Atlantic Monthly) while travelling in some \\"corners\\" of the world, in the mid 90s. Among others, the visited countries included Guinea, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Togo, Egypt, Turkey, Iran, Uzbekistan, Kyrzygistan, China, Pakistan, India, Thailand and Laos.Kaplan's focus seem to be a mix of history, geopolitics and cultural travelling. He makes an effort to provide some historical context to help the reader better understand the reasons for the cultural and political situation of each place. And he is always trying to wonder what the future may bring in these not-so-well-known regions of the world.The book might be interesting for independent travellers who want to know a little more about these places, as a complement to the typical touristic guide (like the Lonely Planet). It is also rewarding if the reader is just curious about how things were (or are) in these places. An interesting advantage is that Kaplan himself did this whole tour, and therefore his reflections have the same base. Kaplan is able to notice the difference between Uzbeks and Tajiks, the female behaviour in Iran (which seems to be slightly different that what Westerners usually would expect), and so on.It should be noted that Kaplan's travels happened in the mid 90s. Many things have surely changed since then in many of the visited places (ex: India, Thailand, Iran, Pakistan). This does not diminish the value of the book, but must be considered to avoid misunderstandings.I, personally, found the beginning too slow. And it took me a good while to finish the whole book.Actually, would have given the book a 3.5 rating if I could.Notwithstanding this, I still am glad of having read it. It gave me a view about life in these countries; something with more depth and thought than a typical travel book/blog.However, the reader must not expect a revolutionary work that \\"explains everything\\". This is just a \\"intelligent travel\\" work, not a geopolitical analysis piece."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"It seems aparent that many people look at this book thinking it is a travel book for possible vacationers. Obviousely, for any person with common sense, these are not places you would want to visit. Kaplan focus is more on the darker side of humanity, and what brings us to it. As seen with his foreboding telling of things to come in Balkan Ghosts, he has a gift of predicting serious human conflicts on our planet. But not only that, he has the remarkable ability to search for the most minor details to explain why. Most importantly though, Kaplan makes perfectly clear what many refuse to acknowledge...the human population of this planet is rapidly exceeding natural limits, while we fall behind drastically in ways to solve this problem. I highly recommend this book to anyone who feels that the relatively minor problems that we face on a day to day basis will soon be a pleasent memory if we don't wake up and realize what we are really doing."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"Robert Kaplan leads you through an intelligent survey of some of the globe's nastier places. This is good book. It is smart, interesting, and should make people think about some problems most of us would rather ignore. It is not a great book. I would say Kaplan got too ambitious, and it shows. He tried to pack too many things - too many countries, too many ideas, too many stories - into one book. As a result it's a very reportorial work - it tells you the basics, it surprises you with interesting bits, and it even digs a little bit beyond the surface. But when it comes time to say &quot;but what does it mean, Dorothy?&quot; - zoom! We're off to the next hellhole on our tour. There's nothing wrong with reportorial, but Kaplan seems to promise something more. He doesn't deliver. He would have been better served by devoting more time to fewer countries. For instance, by his own admission he spent very little time in Laos and did not get a good picture of the country as a whole. Then why write about it? Would this be a worse book without the sketchy Laotian chapter? Hey, I've been in Malaysia for week, but I'm not writing a book about it. The holes in the book are filled with Kaplan's self-important wishy-washy musings. He's full of ideas, only they conflict with each other, and he can't decide which one is the best or how they should all fit together. After a couple of hundred pages, I was yelling &quot;Look, do you have a conclusion or not? Because if you don't, why not have a lie down, figure out an answer, and THEN write it down!&quot; It's fine to write &quot;I didn't know what to think,&quot; it chapter 1, but by the end of the book, well, you should have a better idea what to think. You shouldn't endlessly pose the same answerless questions. Far too many chapters end with something like &quot;There was no more time. I was off to (Togo/Turkmenistan/Laos).&quot; Hmmm. Maybe he should have spent some more time thinking of some answers. I have to say I would have liked this book more if I had not read &quot;Balkan Ghosts&quot;. With that book I felt Kaplan actually knew the area and understood the passions and fault lines that tear the Balkans apart. It raised my expectations for this book. In &quot;The Ends of the Earth&quot; we have to be content with what we see on the surface. We're not going anywhere, but we're making good time."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"This is not an ordinary &quot;travel book&quot;, the author explores the culture, politics, history of parts of the world few westerners know exist. I was particulary interested in his travels through central asia (post soviet union countries) which I knew little about. His themes about population growth, dimishing resources, migrating populations, and their impact on the world were powerful and illuminating. We (in the west) may believe we are immune to the problems of the &quot;third&quot; world, Mr. Kaplan presents a very different picture. I read this book over six months ago and I'm still reflecting on it."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"I learned so much about life and current issues in the countries Kaplan covers by reading this book. I came away with a good understanding of the major issues of the regions as identified by an American journalist. Kaplan writes compassionately and with a desire to uncover truth and not just confirm popular myths. He has researched the book heavily, but is not himself an expert at any of the topics he discusses. This helped to make the book more readable and enjoyable for me, but it also inspired me to learn more about certain topics he brings up from the people who are experts. If you enjoy reading about far away places from a focus of development and sustainability as opposed to a focus on hot tourist spots, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"Robert Kaplan's \\"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia, a Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy\\" is an excellent and insightful travelogue of Robert Kaplans journeys in Africa, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia, in 1994. The reader accompanies Kaplan as he tries to understand the cultures and societies he visits.One drawback of a book like this is that it's dated. The world that Kaplan traveled in is 17 years-old. This is the pre-9/11 world with a burgeoning AIDS epidemic, not the world of today.Still, this is an excellent and fascinating book. Kaplan travels light and, although sometimes he stays with or socializes with Western diplomats, most of his travel is done at ground level, on local buses and trains, as he tries to find the true culture of the places he visits - the soul of the people he meets on the street corners, in the hotels, and on the buses.Kaplan focuses on a few themes - the increasing urbanization of these societies and the environmental cost of population increases. When he travels, he not only sees the history of the place and how it has shaped the present, he also sees the ethnicity and culture - and he tries to see the future based on the present and the past.In hindsight, his insights are interesting. In Egypt, he accurately predicts that the Muslim Brotherhood as the future of Egypt. However, when traveling through Iran, he believes that it is a sophisticated country moving toward democracy, that it is inevitable that it will one day be on good relations with the US, and that the Islamic revolution was a temporary \\"Islamicization\\" of Iran and just a sidetrack on its march to modernity. Although this may ultimately prove true (as the events of 2009 hint), the Iranian government has moved the country farther and farther away from western influence.Kaplan's story, even if dated, is fascinating and entertaining read. Ultimately, Kaplan sees the central power of states weakening in much of the world as ethnic and religious ties amongst its people strengthen."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"\\"The more I read about a place and about issues that affect it, the more I feel I am traveling alone. In an age of mass tourism, adventure becomes increasingly an inner matter, where reading can transport you to places that others only a few feet away will never see.\\" - Robert Kaplan in THE ENDS OF THE EARTH\\"The air had that dense and dirty fish-tank quality of the poor and crowded tropics: garbage, stray dogs, and crying babies.\\" - Robert Kaplan in THE ENDS OF THE EARTH, on arriving in Cambodia.THE ENDS OF THE EARTH: A JOURNEY TO THE FRONTIERS OF ANARCHY by Robert Kaplan will likely not serve as the itinerary for the next overseas tour organized by your retirement community's activities committee. Or, at least you would so think unless the community's HOA has the residents contemplating a paroxysm of purging anarchy anyway.Kaplan's tortuous route includes West Africa (Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo), the Egyptian Nile Valley, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Iran, Central Asia (Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Chinese Turkestan, Pakistan), India, and Indochina (Thailand, Laos, Cambodia) - not exactly a casual saunter down Piccadilly. I got exhausted just reading about it.To determine these countries' potential for anarchy, the author's self-described method was:\\"All I could do was poke around and use my intuition.\\" And this approach, energetically and intelligently applied, resulted in at least one nugget of wisdom which stood out for me and surely holds truth even today:\\"... in an age of localized mini-holocausts, decisive action in one sphere will not necessarily help the victims in another. People will either solve or alleviate their problems at the local level ... or they won't.\\"THE ENDS OF THE EARTH was published in 1997, so perhaps it can be assumed that much of what Kaplan observes is now, fifteen years later, outdated. However, the book almost compels the reader to compare Robert's conclusions with what is occurring at these ends of the earth in contemporary times, particularly in those countries that dominate so much of the news lately, e.g. Egypt, Iran, and Pakistan. Plus, his insights could also be applied to countries he didn't visit but which are now in turmoil of one sort or another: Libya, Syria, Iraq, and Greece.For me, a successful travel narrative either makes me want to catch the first plane out or vow to avoid a place at all costs. With the exception of Turkey - at least Istanbul - and Thailand, I wouldn't, from Kaplan's descriptions, visit any of these countries on a bet. So, by that measure, THE ENDS OF THE EARTH is a great success.The volume contains no photos, unfortunately, but it does include seven reasonably useful maps. Though dated, THE ENDS OF THE EARTH is worth your time."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"Fascinating book. Kaplan is an absolutely wonderful reporter. It's a very well-researched and thoughtful piece. Slightly dated but still well worth the read. Powerfully written but not annoyingly intellectual. 5/5. This book is good for anyone interested in comprehensive foreign policy based in historical and social analysis. Also a good read for anyone interested in ethnography and demography. It's a book about the *comprehensive* geography of land and people."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"Because all I have to say is that this is an outstanding book. Incredibly in depth, the bibliography itself is worth reading if only to garner more reading materials. Made me wish I had Lexis at home, to access some of the older articles he references.

Robert Kaplan presents the impact of a countries history upon its present condition in a style that is engaging and \\"page turning\\".

When I first found access to Internet in Northern Italy I ordered every book I could find from Amazon written by Kaplan.

I started the book and quickly stopped because it was tough to read. I then went on to read other books such as \\"Adventure Capitalist\\" by Jim Rogers that involved world travel on the ground. When I came back to this book, I discovered what the problems were. Perhaps it's best if I quote other reviewer's here: Kaplan is \\"very well-grounded in historical and contextual reading\\" and \\"he is well-read\\". That's the problem. Kaplan spends most of his time telling us what other people think. He goes off on tangents and leaves me wondering what it is that Kaplan himself thinks. Another reviewer wrote \\"sometimes it is not quite the easiest read\\". It is tough reading even if you are familar with the places Kaplan is talking about. And finally, \\"IT IS NOT HIS BEST. THE MEANDERING, STOP AND GO, RABBIT TRAIL PROGRESS OF THE BOOK WAS A BIT DISTRACTING AND FRUSTRATING FOR ME\\" sums it up for me. So, if you found the fact that I quoted other people distracting then you'll understand what it is that I didn't like about Kaplan's book. I suggest \\"Adventure Capitalist\\" as an alternative."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"very well written. tells a little bit about the history, present state, and possible future of each of the countries he visits. very interesting."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"I give him props for traveling the 'native way' and not in embassy SUVs with the free pass green plates, but that's about it.He did not bother to figure out the differences between cultures, climates, or anything, he just took mental snapshots and wrote them down, usually with misplaced and uninformed incredulity.The final straw for me was when he wrote about his visit to the Aswann damn and wrote about the dust on the photocopier, which he implied was due to lack of use. I've lived in the Sahel, just south of the Sahara, and I swept INCHES of dust from my house DAILY. That's what happens in parts of the world where there are dust and sand storms, and buildings aren't the sealed off stagnant cubes that they are in the west. It simply happens to be like that there, neither good nor bad. Maybe they hadn't used the copier, maybe they had. He obviously made his decisions long before bothering to travel to the places he wrote about.This book is insulting to the people it talks about and insulting to the people who read it. If you think critically, avoid it, you'll throw up your arms in disgust. If, however, you like snap judgements from uninformed, pretentious 'the sky is falling' types, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"After 438 pages and multiple destinations (many of which most people have never heard of) Robert D. Kaplan, the Atlantic's national correspondent, has an epiphany: \\"The more I saw of the world, the less I felt I could fit it into a pattern. No one can foresee the precise direction of history, and no nation or people is safe from its wrath.\\"Well, d-uh.This book is definitely one of Kaplan's weaker works, and lacks the intellectual force and gravitas of his better works and his Atlantic articles. Like the countries he covers in this book, the narrative is messy and chaotic.Still, there are sections of the book worth reading. On the section on Iran, Kaplan argues that Iranian society is much more stable, civil, and organized than those of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, two American allies. (Kaplan also successfully predicted that two allies would be future headaches for America.) The Muslim revolution has had less an effect on Persian society than Communism has had on Central Asia and anarchy in Africa. In this section, Kaplan also mentions that when Iranian students storm the American embassy and took the diplomats hostage, the diplomats shredded documents, as per protocol; the students slowly and painstakingly re-assembled the shredded documents. The question implicit in this section is: Does America really want to be fighting this kind of enemy?"},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"A thought provoking book. As we live our lives in relative security and concern ourselves with our careers and society, the author takes us through regions which border on anarchy (or are already there) where the common man has nothing to look forward to. A highly recommended book which relates to the reader the problems each of these regions face, the reasons and possible solutions. Also one thing I liked about the book was the author explores the problems facing each region and how it effects the common man, by talking to the common man. In a lot of cases the author is involved in the problems that plague the region.

When reading his chapters about Iran, I was quite disappointed to see that Kaplan does little more than to be taken around by his handlers to those they wished him to see and talk to. Furthermore, he does even less than a newcomer to the field would do; he does not even provide context or background. One of his primary interview subject is Mohsen Rafighdoost who stole so much that even his own backers could not tolerate him. Kaplan is also historically inaccurate and downright deceptive. He characterizes the Zoroastrian religion as pagan. He either does not know or he does this maliciously. This oldest monotheistic religion has been studied and discussed about so much that ignorance would not be a good enough excuse for its mischaracterization. Last, but not least, Kaplan borrows long paragraphs and essays from other authors about Iran where he thinks his stereotyping of the people needs backing. He does that without context and is patently fraudulent. For one, I have read \\"the garden of the brave in war\\" and where he borrows from that book, is arguably opposite to the intent of the author.If this had been a \\"pay for purpose\\" work I would understand its content, but as a proposed \\"independent work of authorship\\" I believe it is no more than a waste of time and money."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:j},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:A,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"card-container"},z=["disabled"],N={key:0},B={key:1};function M(n,i,r,u,s,o){const c=y("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[i[1]||(i[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",W,[(e(!0),t(w,null,f(o.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),g(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),o.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...h)=>o.loadMore&&o.loadMore(...h))},[s.isLoading?(e(),t("span",B,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",N,"See more"))],8,z)):b("",!0)])}const D=d(E,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-4373beca"]]),S=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/38.md","filePath":"quotes/38.md"}'),J={name:"quotes/38.md"},q=Object.assign(J,{setup(n){return(i,r)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(D)]))}});export{S as __pageData,q as default};
