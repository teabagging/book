I don't know that I will end up reading more than half of the book. What I had hoped for were intriguing discussions of particular typefaces or their history, emotional and aesthetic issues that came into play when designing a particular typefaces, or debates about the relative merits of specific typefaces, with some elucidation of aspects of the typefaces that make a difference. There is certainly some of that in the book, and there are a few gems that I have found so far. However, many of the essays which I have read from the book seem to trade in broad generalities. The book consists of very short essays or short excepts from larger works--nothing is longer than a few pages--which may make it difficult for ideas to be developed in depth. For experienced type design people, who bring much, much more knowledge to the topic, it may well be that these essays are much more interesting. I'm probably an unusual reader for this book, and certainly not part of its intended audience."},{"Title":"Typographers on Type","review":"I honestly had trouble staying awake reading this one. I'm very interested in type design and typography but the pace of this book made me feel like a kid with attention deficit disorder watching C-Span.

On each page, you look for a farm animal hiding behind a flap. It counts up - there's only 1 cow. Where's the other? Next page - there's only 2 pigs. Where's the other? type thing. Also on each page, there are a lot of different textures - more than in most touchy-feely books. My favorite page has a bunch of little chicks on it, each of which is fluffy.In summary, a fun toddler book with lots of flaps and textures with which to interact."},{"Title":"Animal Hide and Seek","review":"My 10-month old girl never tires of this book, so we usually read it twice in a row. The first time through, she goes straight for the flaps. The second time through, we stop and feel the \\"touchy\\" parts of the book, talk about the animals, and find the duck. (It is the same duck from the \\"Find the Duck\\" book.)My only complaint is that the flaps are positioned in a way that makes it very easy to shut them in the book incorrectly. I have to hold the flap down to turn the page safely. However, when I finally let my daughter do things all on her own, I found that it is easy enough to re-bend the flaps. They probably won't last as long as I want them too, but they are sturdier than they look."},{"Title":"Animal Hide and Seek","review":"Usborne has done it again!This book has at least 5 touchy-feely spots on each page!

The flaps are fun, the touchy-feely parts are very well done, and there are a lot of little details -- like spiders and worms in the farmyard -- that give you a lot more mileage for learning than a book with just a story.

Great educationally in terms of counting, basic addition/subtraction concept, and animals. We read this one near daily.As an aside, I titled my review the way I did however, because after two purchases on amazon of used copies of this, I've encountered the same problem! Specifically, I selected books described as \\"good\\" - both times, from totally different sellers, flaps were missing/ripped off!This suggests to me that a)there is something about this book that makes kids a little too excited about the flaps and b)amazon really needs to find a way to regulate the qualifications of book conditions (i.e. \\"good\\" has a lot of different meanings I've come to find).Hope this was helpful!"},{"Title":"Animal Hide and Seek","review":"This book has it all: animals, counting, textures, and lift the flaps.

It's very colorful and has touchy/feely parts.It keeps her entertained when she's eating!"},{"Title":"Animal Hide and Seek","review":"The reading (aloud) public's unquenchable desire to connect children with their agricultural roots (or at least their culture's roots in pastoral literature) ensures that the market for children's farm life books will continue to thrive even as many generations of consumers' families have not seen livestock outside of a zoo or field-trip. Animal Hide-and-Seek (with flaps), Jenny Tyler's bucolic odyssey published by Usborne's Touchy-Feely Farmyard Tales imprint, while a relative newcomer to the genre (2003), has garnered praise from critics and secured Tyler and illustrator Stephen Cartwright a place in the pantheon of children's touchy-feely literature.Much ink has been spilled concerning this barnyard romp; however, most critics have focused on the book's tactile qualities, seemingly accepting the literary content as an innocuous backdrop for the seductive text features. In Amazon Customer Review \\"Sensible Mac\\" MacLean calls it \\"super-cute\\" and \\"durable,\\" while Michelle \\"Kevsmom\\" declares it \\"the best touchy feely one I've seen,\\" and Patricia Young observes that \\"each page has several different textures as well as flaps.\\" The book does have its detractors though, including noted critic M. James \\"luvs2read\\", who argues that \\"the flaps are positioned in a way that makes it very easy to shut them in the book incorrectly.\\" He goes on to claim, \\"I have to hold the flap down to turn the page safely.\\" These pundits, even those who have quibbles with the quality of the touchy and the feely, ignore the greater concerns of Animal Hide-and-Seek (with flaps) at their peril; for beneath the fuzz and shine and scratch lurks a menacing thread of existential terror.At its heart, Animal Hide-and-Seek (with flaps) is a mystery. Superficially, this mystery manifests as a rather easily solved series of conundra: \\"Where's Curly?\\" \\"Where's Wooly?\\" \\"Where's Clucky?\\" And the answer, when the reader lifts the flap, is always the same: \\"She's [or He's] hiding!\\" It is tempting to plow through this book's ten pages pausing only to delight in the satisfaction of having discovered all of the missing livestock. However, we may find it discomfiting to face the deeper mystery that is not explicitly addressed in the text: \\"from what are Curly, Wooly, Clucky, et al. hiding?\\"In our travels through this farmyard--which, judging by it's scale and diversity, operates for sustenance rather than profit--we see the barn, the pigsty, the pasture, and the hen-house. But we are never allowed a glimpse of that which converts these lovable animals to consumable energy. The family abattoir, which an operation of this type would certainly require, is conspicuously absent. I submit that these furtive farm animals are hiding from nothing less than their own grisly demise, in the form of the friendly farmer who might at any moment lead them to slaughter. They, like us, may have never seen the slaughterhouse; but they are aware, through rumor or intuition, of its existence.When the hiding animals are revealed, their expressions do nothing to distinguish them from their brethren who graze in the open. They are neither surprised nor frightened, ashamed nor sheepish (except possibly in the case of Wooly); but rather, their faces reveal only slight resignation or dumb acceptance of their lot. They are aware of the futility of their attempts to cheat death, but compelled to continue trying nonetheless.Reading the book from this perspective, Tyler's final scene becomes particularly jarring. \\"You've found all the animals now,\\" she writes. \\"But where are Poppy and Sam?\\" The names Poppy and Sam are arbitrary and lack strong connotations, which is all the more effective when we realize that these names belong to a human boy and girl who are hiding behind their flaps on the hay trailer and tractor, respectively. Had Tyler given them generic names suggesting characteristics of their species--say, Fleshy and Thumbsy--we may not be as stricken by their humanity. Likewise, the children answer the question themselves--\\"I'm hiding!\\"--unlike the animals who chew and peck as the narrator explains the action. Poppy and Sam are individual young people, with names and voices, who despite their innocence, feel a need to hide. And unlike their animal friends who mill around in the foreground of the concluding montage, Poppy and Sam smile and wave to the ones who have discovered them."},{"Title":"Animal Hide and Seek","review":"I bought this book, I live in the UK.

He scratches at the thistle velcro and picks at the chicks fluff. We even dragged it with us for the plane ride to Mexico at 5 months to keep him entertained. The flaps get yanked on and have so far held up! I thought maybe he was extra gentle with pop-up/flap books but not so; he wrecked a different book in a day's time.

With well-rounded insight, the book sorts through the well-stocked witch's cupboard and answers all the questions left over for the well-practiced in magick. Whether your looking for a reference guide or didactic text, Dubats satisfies both. The book goes through the many different facets of Wicca and Magick while interconnecting them with eachother and the world around us. Ever wonder why certain colors are associated with certain emotions? Or why ancient peoples used the same &quot;tools&quot; for ritual as we do today? NATURAL MAGICK answers these questions so that the reader may see the connection between the energy of magickal objects and the results that they can manifest. This approach really gives magic a deep spiritual meaning and made it &quot;feel&quot; right for me. Astrology, Tarot, Numberolgy, and Runes are all discussed. After reading Dubat's understanding of divination, you'll never again look at numbers, symbols, or colors in the same way. Perhaps my favorite part of the book is the author's acceptance of all ways, faiths, and practices and her teachings that follow accordingly. You can't go wrong!"},{"Title":"Natural Magick: Inside the Well-Stocked Witch's Cupboard","review":"I found this book to be *very* useful, especially for Solitary practices. (Actually, I found it better than many books supposedly written for Solitaries.) It *does* get a little too &quot;white light dreaminess&quot; in some areas, but they don't come even close to the &quot;fluffy bunny&quot; garbage that gets printed so often these days.The best sections were those on runes, which describes a method of use and study that integrates them more easily into a more Wiccan-oriented practice. The herbal and crystal/stone section contains detailed information without dogma. Also useful were the energy descriptions for the individual Sabbats.The main drawback is that this book has no index, and the bibliography contains mostly &quot;modern&quot; books, with little reference to more scholarly works. But then, this is supposed to be a workbook, not a reference book. Best of all, it isn't put out by the Crescent Moon Gang. All in all, I consider this money well spent."},{"Title":"Natural Magick: Inside the Well-Stocked Witch's Cupboard","review":"Sally Dubats literary style is so reader friendly you can hardly put this book down.

This book should become a classic in Wicca tradition!"},{"Title":"Natural Magick: Inside the Well-Stocked Witch's Cupboard","review":"Having a strange compulsion to buy books on the magical arts, as well as one to spend every penny I own, I purchased this book with the last 10 of my student loan. And was it worth it? Well, yes and no. The book itself is very good, although Ms Sally Dubats writting style i find slighly pretentious and pious at times. She certainly knows her stuff, however, and contained in the book are easy-to-understand, alphabetical guides to different mystical plants, crystals and colours, as well as instructions on how to write your own spells. I found this especially helpful, as anyone who is interested in magic knows that it comes from within, so reading other peoples words out of a book is more in the domain of cartoons than reality! This book would be better for someone who is just starting out into the Astral plane, and, as it is written by a &quot;white witch&quot;, also has a leaning towards a female, wiccan audience and style. But hey, i'm a bloke, i'm not a Wiccan and I enjoyed it! Why would I write a review otherwise!

Just exactly the book I was looking for. The subtitle of this book is &quot;Inside the Well-Stocked Witch's Cupboard.&quot; I think it does a pretty good job of living up to that topic! The author gives some witchy basics, but most of the book is dedicated to natural magic. The second half of the book contains an extensive listing of herbs, stones, and crystals and their uses. People who like Scott Cunningham will like this book. Not all will agree with me, of course, but I feel it's a nice edition to your bookshelf.

It is about how the PEF's legatees--Peabody Normal College (1875-1911) and George Peabody College for Teachers (1914-79)--embraced George Peabody's motto: &quot;Education: A Debt Due from Present to Future Generations,&quot; about how they became in turn the South's pioneer model private teacher education institution, and how their successor Peabody College of Vanderbilt University has increased its leadership among teacher education institutions.Noting that in the 1990s through 2002 Peabody College of Vanderbilt University has annually been voted among the best U.S. graduate schools of education, Conkin ended his book with: &quot;Peabody...has enhanced the reputation of its host [Vanderbilt].&quot; He sees a realization of &quot;Philip Lindsley's 1828 dream of a great university in Nashville, with one of its colleges dedicated to the training of teachers,&quot; and lauds as reality &quot;Chancellor Kirkland's dream...of a great university center in Nashville.&quot; (Conkin, p. 409).As Peabody graduates (1956) we (reviewers of Conkin's book) know that Peabody was and remains an inspiring institution of higher education; that it faced greater financial challenges and class and race divisions than its northern and western counterparts; that it has risen phoenix-like again and again to produce educational leaders for the South, the nation, and the world; that it proudly carries into the twenty-first century George Peabody's 1852 motto, &quot;Education, a debt due from present to future generations.&quot;"},{"Title":"Peabody College: From a Frontier Academy to the Frontiers of Teaching and Learning","review":"While I expected a drab presentation of facts, I found this book surprisingly readable. I could hardly put it down! Conkin certainly knows how to write. However, as one with long association with the old George Peabody College, I found his patronizing tone and elitist judgments sometimes troubling. For Conkin, a professor is only distinguished when he constantly publishes. Peabody always stressed teaching and had exceptional teachers, even to the end. How can he refer to the great Kenneth Cooper as &quot;Prentice Cooper&quot; and suggest that any faculty that contains him could ever be a collection of mediocrities? Conkin is also sometimes inaccurate in his account of actions during the generally hostile takeover of Peabody by Vanderbilt University. Peabody faculty were brutally treated. Rather than being a savior, Vanderbilt destroyed one of the most remarkable academic cultures that has existed in American education, where students were nutured and faculty were free to explore, mentor, and teach creatively.Nevertheless, I wish that all historians were as stylistically skilled as Conkin. Perhaps more students would be better informed in the subject."},{"Title":"Clinical Social Work Knowledge and Skills","review":"this book is the instructors manual to the text, it's not the actual book, take notice. and thank you seller, for correcting the typo."},{"Title":"T.A.Z. the Temporary Autonomous Zone, Ontological Anarchy, Poetic Terrorism (New Autonomy Series)","review":"Hakim Bey is the purveyor of post post modernism.

Wow! What a masterpiece. How can such a tiny book create such havoc in my brain? I now understand the (ir)rationale for the drill bits.Hakim Bey writes in a beautifully poetic style. The book begins with a series of essays on chaos, art, sorcery, etc. Examples of what he calls poetic terrorism: Break into someone's home and leave a bizzare object behind, kidnap someone and make them happy, put up a commemorative plaque where you've had memorable orgasm, etc. Hillarious! If ever you're feeling down just pick a page at random and I promise you'll never find better medecine.The final portion of the book consists of a long essay entitled The Temporary Autonomous Zone. A T.A.Z. is a virtual/physical space beyond the reach of the Spectacle where no rules exist. It is temporary and constantly changing because only this way can it avoid absorbtion by the Beast/Empire/Spectacle/Choronzon, whatever you choose to call it. Ultimately though, any attempt to describe what the T.A.Z. &quot;is&quot; becomes a lie, like trying to define God or Tao.Another great thing about the book is that it is small enough to carry in your pocket.

But slowly it has been bubbling to the surface, often in unexpected places. The novel and film Fight Club, surely shows an affection for poetic terrorism, an idea rooted in Bey's ontological anarchism and closely related to the situationist tactic of detornement. T.A.Z. is not the property of any philosophy but chaos and elegant disorder. Sure, there are aspects of anarchism, chaos thinking, situationist leanings, but that is just a symptom of the spectacle and is such precisely because of it. These essays all point to a way out of this spectacular society, but the first step comes with the mere recognition of it. This is harder than it sounds, or perhaps easier. TV and the media are always easy components to recognize, the real challenge is to recognize how the spectacle, i.e., the prefabricated, artificial, consumerist milieu penetrates, influences and shapes even our most intimate thoughts--which we often mistake for our own desires, wants and needs. In T.A.Z. Bey offers suggestions on how we can extricate ourselves from this structure and start creating our own temporary autonomous zones, within this system of economic, social and cultural oppression. Immediatism, Poetic Terrorism, and the embrace of Chaos are just a few of the strategies that he advises, all of which presuppose a new dialectic with reality.This is only an outline, a mere review, I leave discerning and interpreting the details to you...Get this book today (also available in spoken word from axiom records)."},{"Title":"T.A.Z. the Temporary Autonomous Zone, Ontological Anarchy, Poetic Terrorism (New Autonomy Series)","review":"I am surprised that the sort of people attracted to such a work--to guess from previous reviews--are still apparently apt to want to swallow the thing wholly, assertions that \\"they lied to you, sold you ideas\\" and all. Personally i reckon that we are in the midst of a conspiracy, yes...but most likely an unconscious one--the aggregate of fear & complacency & ignorance & such things, that is, resulting insidiously in the effects of a sort of conspiracy. What sort of result, for example, would one really expect from blowing up a transmission tower? A sudden enlightenment of the populace? No: most people would likely become even more reactionary when faced with causes for alarm.Essentially this book, in spite of its claims to the contrary, seems to me a variety of art movement and not the \\"ultimate\\" anything, but as with anything so incendiary and beautiful its value can still hardly be overestimated. Who can resist Poetic Terrorism or Bey's felicity with language (eg. Chaote art)? The language and imagery are colourful and bursting full. Imagine a feast laid out on a table with barely enough room for the feasters' plates--and certainly not enough for their elbows--and everyone seated around it wearing purple plumage or velvet saris or nothing at all & laughing with food in their mouths.I'll take what i need and leave the rest, as it goes. Implicit in most of the writing is criticism of those who would reject any part of the \\"freedom\\" described, but who's afraid of Hakim Bey? I'm glad he wrote even if i won't be taking all of what he wrote to heart."},{"Title":"T.A.Z. the Temporary Autonomous Zone, Ontological Anarchy, Poetic Terrorism (New Autonomy Series)","review":"This book is great. It also is not copyrighted and the entire text is available online. If you haven't read this yet I recommend taking a look at some of it. A good search engine like Google.com or Yahoo will turn it up quite quickly. If you like it you will probably want a hard copy (makes for much more enjoyable reading). So if you can't print it out you will definitely want to buy one. Cheers."},{"Title":"T.A.Z. the Temporary Autonomous Zone, Ontological Anarchy, Poetic Terrorism (New Autonomy Series)","review":"My life and perceptions were changed forever by this book. If you have the nagging feeling that something's wrong with your reality, or if you find yourself inexplicably angry and hungry for something that you can't name, or if you simply want to take a crowbar to your worldview, read this book. Please.For those who are a little shy of cash, there are a couple of electronic versions of the book floating around the net. But really, if you have any cash, you should give a little to Hakim Bey by buying the book."},{"Title":"T.A.Z. the Temporary Autonomous Zone, Ontological Anarchy, Poetic Terrorism (New Autonomy Series)","review":"Bey's &quot;Temporary Autonomous Zone&quot; is a personal favorite of mine, and although many despise it and mistakenly write it off as mystification or the work of a phony posing as an avant garde philosopher, I am convinced it is an underground classic. This will shake your banal perceptions and your begrudging acceptance of the monotony of everyday life by advocating a form of rebelliousness and hatred for the ordinary the like or equal of which I've never seen in any other medium. Although I am in definite disagreement with his misguided denunciation of surrealism, without which he never could have written this book, Bey has created one of the most unique and fascinating revolutionary manifestoes written for decades. &quot;Poetic Terrorism&quot; is the most exciting idea I've encountered in a long while, and after your first read you'll be eager to start 'terrorizing' the norm yourself, even if you're the most self controlled and mild mannered person imaginable. The beauty of this tiny molotov cocktail is it's insistence that personal rebellion, rather than superficial political activism, is the real way to freedom, a conviction I've held firmly for a good deal of my life. Only through a reordering and a total recreation of the individual's perceptions can he or she be truly free, and even then the mental discipline necessary for true liberation must be maintained with the greatest vehemence. Talk about real postmodernism! This is rebellion itself. A must for anyone who distinguishes themselves from the conforming masses."},{"Title":"T.A.Z. the Temporary Autonomous Zone, Ontological Anarchy, Poetic Terrorism (New Autonomy Series)","review":"Hakim Bey borrows from Situationism, dada, the occult, and a few other sources to create Ontological Anarchism. The result is a very strange and very wonderful pattern for a revolution that starts now. Bey is not interested in whether the dialectic has reached its head. This is a personal revolt, an insurrection in everday life.The first section deals with Poetic Terrorism, an extension of Situationist praxis beyond street theatre. Basically, any action taken against the spectacle fits into this, but especially those aimed at institutions of misinformation. The second part is comosed of broadsheets detailing everything from surrealism to black magick. The third is TAZ proper, or improper as the case may be. Bey includes some fascinating information on pirate utopias and the lost Roanoke colonies that were almost certainly left out of your high school history book.The book does not so much suggest techniques as it does evoke a spirit of revolt. This is anarchy for those who like their insurrections occult and their politics way outside the mainstream."},{"Title":"T.A.Z. the Temporary Autonomous Zone, Ontological Anarchy, Poetic Terrorism (New Autonomy Series)","review":"The idea of a &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;poetic&quot; treatise on anarchism may seem unbelievable, but then so is Hakim Bey's &quot;TAZ.&quot; Bey proposes an anarchism of the mind, a realm as byzantine and fantastic as an opium fever-dream and every bit as &quot;real&quot; as any humdrum consensus reality we have ever been expected to deal with. An all-around wonder, &quot;Temporary Automonous Zone&quot; even includes recipies, helpful hints on parade themes and firework displays-- fun for kids and adults alike-- plus handy tips on how to build your own arabesque reality. If you read only one book on anarchism this year, &quot;TAZ&quot; is the one to buy."},{"Title":"T.A.Z. the Temporary Autonomous Zone, Ontological Anarchy, Poetic Terrorism (New Autonomy Series)","review":"Have a couple of dictionaries standing by, or be sure to have a few dozen bookmarked online while reading this, for if you're to appreciate Bey's prose, you're likely to need 'em. He writes in a strange way, obviously highly intelligent, but rambling, and if you're not quite sure what he's on about, it's just going to seem worse.There are a lot of ideas in here, based on things I'm not very familiar with, such as Sufism and dadism - some of which are at least partially explained, but this is one of those books you need to read, and then come back to later and see how it compares. Certainly on the first go struggling somewhat to get a feel for how his mind works on paper.It's a very inspiring work, which he may loathe to hear, but I intend to do something about it. I recommend reading it to anyone interested in expanding their interests and testing the limits of one's mind. Agreeing with everything he presents isn't necessary, but thinking about it is - doing even better. Highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"T.A.Z. the Temporary Autonomous Zone, Ontological Anarchy, Poetic Terrorism (New Autonomy Series)","review":"This is one of those pieces of literature that you simply cannot afford to miss. It's like discovering Marge Piercy at the tender, malleable age of 12, or finding Clarissa Pinkola Estes' book, worn and well-loved, after a ten-year marriage filled with abuse. Except, TAZ doesn't require you to be at any particular phase of your life to change it. It just does. Sometimes, it's not immediate. Sometimes it sits quietly in the back of your mind, bubbling up curt replies to oppressive corporate and societal forces that occasionally - tragically infrequently, to begin with - with issue forth from your mouth and cause bank tellers to go pale with shock.Temporary Autonomous Zones are nets of co-conspirators, ready to take the mass of over-bearing government and the thin veneer of so-called civilization down, not through bloody revolution, but rather through obsolescence. If we do not respect the right to control us, if we have our own power back to do our own work, only then are we our own people. And moreover, in &quot;Ontological Anarchism&quot;, we find the suggestion that we do not have to define ourselves by ANYTHING other than what WE feel we are. We are &quot;supposed&quot; to be productive, civilized, friendly, codependent, well-dressed, well-paid, well-fed and easily coddled. But humans are NOT that - we are animals, base creatures of a triple nature, as gods are, as goddesses are. And in each as our own deity, we cannot be truly shaped by anyone else but our own ineffable nature.And that's just the beginning...."},{"Title":"The Warden and His Brother","review":"This book touched my life in a special way. Although I am not a person of color I have been a single mom for a long time. The struggles the author went through are typical of the struggles many of us go through. Then she had the added complication of being a woman of color and the racism that goes along with that to battle against as well. The constant love for her self first and then her family are amazing. There are many people who will never rise to the challenge that this family did and I congratulate the family as a whole. I am also very impressed with her faith in God and how God is not mad at her, as she puts it. God is gracious to us all and I know as a Christian the battles we must fight. Mrs. Captain has fought her battles well. The contrast between the brothers is remarkable but their dedication to each other and their family is even more remarkable. In this day and age when the family is falling apart this fine lady teaches us in this book how to keep a family together, no matter what comes our way.

She successfully established and instilled in her three children the desire to love and respect one another and others. She lives out the dream of beating the odds and overcoming numerous obstacles that confronted her and to have a successful and great life. In the 1950s she is able to function sucessfully as a single parent and to provide the economic and spiritual foundation that her children need in order to gain the self esteem needed for survival.This book depicts the bonding between siblings that is unshakable as they face numerous confrontations in their lives. The author is able to bring the book to life and have you experience the manuscript as though you were there. It is a very refreshing book for those who can relate to the author and at the same time it is very insightful for those who are not black and did not have experiences that are similar to those of the author.It is a &quot;must&quot; read book!"},{"Title":"The Warden and His Brother","review":"In the past 6 months, another chapter to the story of &quot;The Warden and His Brother&quot; has been written by fate. Brian Flakes, the brother to the warden, was killed in a car crash in Dallas. Hopefully, Ms. Captain will write yet another 5 star book on the life of her lost son. Brian Flakes touched the lives of many in his brief life of 40 yrs.

It is indeed a collection of 'Zen Seeds', short, sparkling stories, thoughts and recollections breathing deeply from the very source of Zen - life itself. Those little gems are always down to earth, written as clear and poetic as mountains, wind and rain. If You'd like to inspire your meditational practice, or just enjoy some gentle thoughts while having a cup of tea - You should read this book."},{"Title":"Zen Seeds: Reflections of a Female Priest","review":"The wisdom found on these pages is deceptively simple yet infinitely useful. Aoyama cuts though to the essence of each topic she discusses. Her immense sense of calm and tranquility is transferable to the reader due to her eloquent writing style and choice of accentuating quotes. If enlightenment could be bottled, this book would be that bottle."},{"Title":"Zen Seeds: Reflections of a Female Priest","review":"Rather than provide worthless praise for this book I would like to comment on one aspect of spiritual practice on which I have some thoughts to share. On page 155-156 she writes, \\"For over thirty years the Chinese Zen master Ta-mei Fa-ch'ang secluded himself deep in the mountains and practiced zazen. People of long ago practiced zazen in this manner. We who are weak and fragile cannot practice in that way. Instead, we gather in a single hall...\\".I think seclusion is actually an easier path to enlightenment because it is easier to forget the self when you are removed from society. Your ego only comes into play when you are in the presence of others. In the wilderness you will quickly forget yourself and Zen to discover pure existence which is beyond the social fabric and religion."},{"Title":"Bump in the Night","review":"I originally just purchased this for the next installment of Eve and Roarke and was pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying all of the short stories. Each one of them contains some paranormal elements, yet each one is unique and fresh. I totally disagree with the editorial review given above.My only complaint is that these stories where so good, I almost wish they had been full length books. In the format and length given, it was almost impossible to fully explore the characters. In other words, the endings for two of them felt a bit rushed. This is especially true for Mary Blayney's story. I wanted to know much more about the outcome of the initial main character and felt disappointed that it ended so quickly.And while I completely enjoyed the J.D. Robb book, my actual favorite of the four was the story by Ruth Ryan Langan \\"The Passenger\\". The ending of this one, leaves you quite breathless, and wondering if you didnt just dream most of the story you just read.Of all four stories, the final one by Mary Kay McComas is the most original. While I enjoyed this one immensely also, I can't help feeling lost a little at the end. I know it had to end that way, but still...In summary, these were four very satisfying quick reads by four wonderful authors."},{"Title":"Bump in the Night","review":"**** \\"Haunted in Death\\" by J. D. Robb.I'm not sure how I feel about the introduction of a ghost into the series. It feels a bit like the magical healing in Ceremony in Death, but not quite as intrusive. I think how you feel about the introduction of paranormal elements into a series (or book) that's otherwise not paranormal, depends on whether you think those things do exist in real life. I'll buy the psychic in Visions in Death, but while I think there is something to psychic healing, I don't think it takes the form of magically making injuries disappear. The same with ghosts--I'll buy a feeling, and maybe a sighting, but not the elaborate production the ghost put on here.I thought Eve's reaction was exactly right, thought the killer's motivation was idiotic, Roarke was his usual credulous self, and Peabody was star-struck, also as usual.*** \\"Poppy's Coin\\" by Mary Blayney.Pretty standard story about a magic coin that grants the holder one wish. Hero's a major who was at Waterloo, guardian of two young children, no way to support them until he sells his commission, which is hard to do now that the war's mostly over. He wishes for lucrative & enjoyable employment, and the heroine, a well-off widow, hires him to be her escort. Entirely predictable, but not horrible.**** \\"The Passenger\\" by Ruth Ryan Langan.You could call it paranormal, I suppose, since a ghost/guardian angel brought the hero and heroine together, and there was some time distortion, but that was only on the periphery of the story about two loners/adventurers who find each other in the wilderness.*** \\"Mellow Lemon Yellow\\" by Mary Kay McComas.I'm not going to call this romance because, while the heroine does get married at the end, we don't see her falling in love. What we do see is her changing her life with the help of her childhood imaginary friend, a product of her imagination. \\"Mel\\" seemed to waffle between being an independent person and being only what she imagined, consciously or subconsciously. If I tried to think about it too much, it just got confusing. Pretty standard story of a woman changing her life and getting a HEA as a result."},{"Title":"Bump in the Night","review":"*** Eve Dallas finds herself with two murders set a century apart to solve in Haunted in Death. Though Eve refuses to believe in ghosts, she may have to deal with one as she once more takes care of the dead. Whether as Nora Roberts or JD Robb, this is one author you can always trust to entertain you. In Poppy's Coin, Mary Blayney tells of a magical coin that makes wishes come true in unexpected ways. The story is sweet and old fashioned, with only a hint of paranormal activity, and what magic there is could be explained away if you simply want a historical story. The Passenger, by Ruth Ryan Langan, uses a plane crash to bring about spiritual healing for two unlikely lovers as they literally face the ghosts of their pasts. Though sweet, this is the weakest link of the book, with a rambling style that makes it hard to enjoy. Finally, the anthonlogy rounds out with a very pleasant surprise in Mellow Lemon Yellow by Mary Kay McComas. Charlotte's father's funeral brings an old friend back into her life; a very handsome man named Mel (short for Mellow Lemon Yellow). No, his parents were not hippies, he's a living, breathing imaginary friend come to life, and someone Charlotte could love, but is he right for her, or is there a deeper purpose to Mel's visit. He's outrageous, funny, and loveable. Yet, for all the laughs, this is the most poigant tale in the book. Keep a hanky on hand when you read it. ***"},{"Title":"Bump in the Night","review":"I have read and enjoyed every \\"in Death\\" book.

As always, a great story with a lot of detail packed into so very few pages.\\"Poppy's Coin\\" is Mary Blayney's wonderful go back in time tale of two people who are determined to be independent but also have social and financial problems to solve. The magic of the coin -- or is it magic? -- and the touching romance made this a sweet and tender story.\\"The Passenger\\" is a modern story of a sports celebrity and daredevil who heads to pull off one more adventure and finds himself in a very mysterious, ghostly and magical place. It is also the story of a young woman photographer who is not good at relationships and is devoted to her career for an international magazine. How they meet, fall in love and resolve their pasts, presents and futures defintely gave me some goosebumps!\\"Mellow Lemon Yellow\\" is about a young woman who did all she could to please her parents but now they are both gone -- has to discover what she really wants from life and who she really is!

THE PASSENGER brings together two people who realize how much the need each other to fulfill their lives - but only when thrown together in a magical wilderness.

I can not wait for her next books."},{"Title":"Bump in the Night","review":"I automatically buy all of J.D. Robb's books so this was a no-brainer purchase for me. Robb kickstarts this anthology with \\"Haunted in Death\\", another detective story involving Lieutenant Eve Dallas and her husband Roarke. The year is 2060 and Eve is investigating the murder of Radcliff C. Hopkins III at Number Twelve, a building that that reportedly been haunted since the disappearance of Bobbie Bray 85 years ago. Bobbie's skeleton is found near Radcliff's body and the murder weapon, a gun (considered unusual in 2060), is the same for both murders. Eve is very pragmatic and doesn't believe in ghosts despite the cold chill and mysterious voices she hears in Number Twelve. The ending is a bit unusual for a J.D. Robb story but I was not disappointed.In \\"Poppy's Coin\\" by Mary Blayney, a young girl is told a story of a magic coin and true love occurring in 1817. David Lindsay has returned from the war with honor but no money and two children to raise (only one of whom may be his child). His daughter gives him a magic coin and he wishes for prosperous employment. Shortly afterwards, a wealthy widow, Lady Grace Anderson, hires him to be her escort at all the Society events as she doesn't want the hassle of men courting her. The story is a sweet romance with only a tinge of the paranormal.Ruth Ryan Langan's \\"The Passenger\\" explores the mystery behind Spirit Lake with its history of boats and planes disappearing and lights of unknown origin appearing. Grace Marin is a photojournalist who is at Spirit Lake to document the happenings there. Josh Cramer is an adventure junkie whose next journey is a trek through the wilderness, starting at Spirit Lake. While flying to his starting point, he notices a stowaway passenger just before his plane crashes. Grace sees the crash and rescues him. Together, they find true love while experiencing the mysteries at Spirit Lake.\\"Mellow Lemon Yellow\\" by Mary Kay McComas is one of the more unique stories I have read. Charlotte is the stereotypical accountant until her childhood imaginary friend, Mel, resurfaces at her father's viewing. Mel teaches Charlotte how to break out of her monotony and find that spark within her that wants to go scuba diving, wear stylish clothes, and find true love. She finally meets Sam and it's a sweet ending to a story about a woman's personal growth.Overall, this was a good anthology and definitely worth reading. I'm not sure the title fit the type of stories in the book but all four stories were very enjoyable. Definitely a recommended read!"},{"Title":"Bump in the Night","review":"I'm a HUGE Nora Roberts/J.D. Robb fan. I've read all of Robb's In Death books and always look forward to the latest release. Haunted in Death was enjoyable, but left a lot to be desired... where was Summerset and McNab and Feeney? She has built so much character into these characters that a person misses them when they're not there!The two middle stories were ok but not memorable.The fourth story - Mellow Lemon Yellow - was the worst story I've ever read. In my opinion, the book is very elementary. Did anyone notice Mary Kay McComas' incorrect use of the word \\"then\\"? I counted at least 3 times where she used \\"then\\" when she should've used \\"than\\". Doesn't anyone check grammar anymore? You'd think a prominent writer would be grammatically correct."},{"Title":"Bump in the Night","review":"As a huge fan of J.D. Robb, I knew I would buy this book for her story alone. While it was an okay short story, it's not great. In my opinion, both of the other short stories that Robb has done in other anthologies adds something to the overall \\"mystique\\" of the In Death series.I couldn't read the second story (Poppy's Coin). No interest.Both The Passenger and Mellow Lemon Yellow were interesting reads. Of course, throughout the entire reading of Mellow Lemon Yellow, I kept thinking about the movie \\"Drop Dead Fred\\" which explores a similar premise.Overall, enjoyable and easy reading."},{"Title":"Bump in the Night","review":"Since other reviewers have given a summary of each story, I will try to add to what has already been said instead of repeating the storylines.\\"Haunted in Death\\" provides the Eva Dallas fix for all of us J. D. Robb lovers. The somewhat paranormal flair is almost believable seeing that Eve is our doubting Thomas when it comes to the 85 year old ghost of Bobbie Bray and her never-ending battle to uncover the mystery surrounding the death of Radcliff Hopkins. This by far was the best story in the book.\\"Poppy's Coin\\" was a somewhat enjoyable fairy tale story except no other reviewers seemed to pick up on the fact that the storyteller starts out in London on April of 2006 and ends in March 2007. This storytelling was to span a few hours, not a year. Very poor writing and even worse editing. Plus the ending of the narrative and the parallel of the coin confused me. I couldn't understand if the woman to whom the story of David and Grace was being told was married to Jim (?) who she was supposed to meet at the pub in the beginning of the story and at the end of the tale-telling. Was this Jim a goner because of her wish or just what that was all about?????? Can someone help, please?\\"The Passenger\\" was just okay. Nothing to get excited about and all too corny for my taste. The ghost of Spirit Lake turning out to be who she says she is and then actually talking to and relaying bloodlines to Grace Marin and Josh Cramer (our primary characters). This scenario was a little too much even for a paranormal story and the conclusion was the ordinary, child-like, happily-ever-after, totally make-believe ending.\\"Mellow Lemon Yellow\\" was different and amusing and I guess next to Haunted in Death, was my preferred reading. It was a cute idea to drum up this lovable imaginary and quite real friend. Charlotte Gibson was a likeable enough character but I think \\"Mel\\" was even more likeable.All in all, I wouldn't knock myself out to go out and read these stories."},{"Title":"Bump in the Night","review":"Novelettes for the beach, perhaps. These are 4 novelettes (or novellas, I've never really been able to tell the difference) written especially for this collection. Many people will see this book pop up because they've purchased other J.D. Robb books, and if you are someone who is collecting every single bit of the \\"In Death\\" series, then I suppose you'll need this one. However, it's not really a very good story in the series. The theme of the book being \\"paranormal\\" stories, Robb has to try to fit something spooky into Eve's normally rational and scientific world, and frankly, I don't find that it fits well. The story and the plot itself depend entirely on things that could have happened in 2006 as easily as 2060; the part that's supposed to make it 2060 is that the murder has been done with a gun, and guns are quite rare in 2060, so that the other detectives and the medical examiner's office are not familiar with gunshot wounds. But the entire story could have been written without the paranormal element supposedly being there, or set in any year in the modern era, and would have been almost exactly the same.The second story in the book is a Regency romance, with a brief modern frame around it, and about the only paranormal element is the \\"magic coin\\" upon which our protagonists in the Regency era, and then our protagonist in the modern era, make wishes. Since I like the Regency era, I actually enjoyed this story more than the J.D. Robb story that called my attention to the book; the Regency story is a better representative of its kind than the Robb is of its series. It may be a disappointment to some because the paranormal element is so small; if you are thinking to buy this book because you are specifically interested in paranormal phenomena, you probably won't find enough here to be satisfying.In short, by having people who usually write in specific subgenres and specific time periods try to add something paranormal to their stories, it lowers the quality of both the period pieces and the paranormal elements."},{"Title":"Bump in the Night","review":"I, like many others, bought this book for the J.D. Robb story. The story was OK. Paranormal happenings just don't seem to work in the Eve Dallas universe, but this story was much, MUCH better than the remaining 3.Poppy's Coin was an alright story. I like history stories like this. So I didn't mind this particular one (although the paranormal aspects were a bit of a stretch).The Passenger was contrived, predictable, and boring. The characters were not engaging, the plot was laughable, and I just didn't care what happened in the end.Mellow Lemon Yellow was by far the worst story I've ever read. I skimmed through most of the story because I kept rolling my eyes at every other sentence. I just thought this story was too ridiculous. I couldn't even find humour in it. Just a complete waste of time. (I, too, found the similarities to Drop Dead Fred. Except Drop Dead Fred had one or two moments of fun, this one had NONE). I can't express how much I absolutely HATED this story.Buy the book for the J.D. Robb story, or wait until she publishes her story on its own. The other three authors did not make me want to rush out and buy any more of their books."},{"Title":"Bump in the Night","review":"I loved the J.D. Robb story but somehow I was expecting more from the other authors. I was disappointed and if it weren't for J.D. Robb I never would have bought this book."},{"Title":"Bump in the Night","review":"I purchased this book for #26 in the In Death Series.In story number one, we have Haunted in Death. The year is 2060 and Eve is investigating the murder of Radcliff C. Hopkins III at a building that that been haunted since the disappearance of Bobbie Bray 85 years ago. Bobbie's skeleton is found near Radcliff's body and the murder weapon is the same for both murders. I thought the idea of this story was excellent and very unusual, however it was missing something to me. Still good but not perfect.In the second story,Poppy's Coin a young girl is told a story of a magic coin and true love occurring in 1817. David Lindsay comes home from war with two children to raise, only one might be his. His daughter gives him a magic coin and he wishes for employment. Soon after a wealthy widow hires him to be her escort at all the Society events. This story is nice and entertaining.In the third story,The Passenger, Grace is a photojournalist documenting strange happenings on Spirit Lake. Where boats and planes are known to disappear and strange lights appear. Josh is an adventurer, his next stop, Spirit Lake. While flying he notices a stowaway passenger just before his plane crashes. Grace sees the crash and rescues him. Another entertaining read.In the last story,Mellow Lemon Yellow, Charlotte comes face to face with her childhood imaginary friend at her fathers funeral. Mel teaches her how to live life fully. She meets Sam and it's a nice ending to a good story.This is a good book and each story is unique and enjoyable. I just expected a different kind of paranormal from the title Bump in the Night."},{"Title":"Bump in the Night","review":"I read everything written by Nora Roberts and her pseudonym, JD Robb, and this novella, \\"Haunted in Death\\" goes on my shelf right along with all the others.That being said, I will likely never read the other stories in here again; they were well-written, but mostly uninteresting, and far too different from the one story I bought the book for. Still, you can't get everything, and not every anthology can be an all-round winner. \\"Haunted in Death\\" is, in my mind, worth the cost of the book all on its own."},{"Title":"Bump in the Night","review":"I bought the book just to read the J.D. Robb story. Unfortunately, Robb should've named the story Distracted in Death. It reads more like a basic outline which has not been fleshed out and provided with emotional depth and intensity. When Robb gives short shrift to the usual description of Roarke and passes him off as \\"handsome,\\" then let the reader understand that Robb, who is beautifully prolific with figurative language, is not really paying attention to the local color necessary to transform Distracted in Death into a fine story called Haunted in Death.The story is defined by its absences. Summerset, Mavis, Nadine, McNabb. Though it is true that all of these don't have to people an ...in Death story for it to come alive, these add levels of interest and connectedness that make the series unmatchable. Thus, their absence here is noticeable, especially given the quality of Midnight in Death, in comparison to which Distracted in Death is lacking.Thus, Distracted in Death is just going through the motions of being a J.D. Robb story. It does not meet the level of excellence of its predecessors, though it had potential to do exactly that."},{"Title":"Bump in the Night","review":"The cover says in capital letters \\"J.D. ROBB BUMP IN THE NIGHT\\". This book is a collection of four authors. J.D. Robb's contribution is 1/4th of the book. I didn't think it was very good story. Neither were the other three. -- All four stories had paranormal themes. When I buy J.D.

I loved the author's humorous, imaginative poetry, but never encountered her prose. I can't guess how I might have responded to it then, but this past winter I found these two books a sweet, old-fashioned delight. What surprises me as I think about them in review mode, though, is how much depth their characters have to offer an adult reader. We find good people doing what they believe to be best, and having it turn out badly (or at least imperfectly) because their &quot;good&quot; reasons contain hidden selfishness. We find flawed people living useful lives anyway, and those who love them accepting those flaws.That's what makes a children's book (so-called) timeless, I suppose. When a &quot;grown-up&quot; can also read it with pleasure and suspended disbelief, it's destined to endure beyond its author's lifetime."},{"Title":"The Interpretation Of Cultures (Basic Books Classics)","review":"When i found his Book - or rather a few of its included essays - it was like if it just had been laying there waiting for me to handle some of the very fundamental puzzlement I've had with the grand theories in social science. I have found use of it in my reflections about the link between micro- and macro elements of society postulated by such giants as George Ritzer and Jeffrey Alexander, as well the classical distinction between the existential and normative character of culture itself - formally defined in Anthony Giddens distinction between signification and legitimation - and, even more important, helping me to understand the analytical dualism of culture and structure made by Margaret Archer. Geertz was far ahead of them all, perhaps due to an enormously rich empirical material - which both enriches the &quot;thick&quot; theories he has as well as function as a pedagogic device to illustrate the points he makes. A must for anyone with an interest in how och why individuals and societys work as they do, regardles of beeing in the discipline of sociology, anthropology or any other field within social scienses."},{"Title":"The Interpretation Of Cultures (Basic Books Classics)","review":"Besides the great price on the book, they kept me informed as to when my book had shipped and the time-line in which I would be seeing it on my doorstep. Great service. I would buy from them anytime."},{"Title":"The Interpretation Of Cultures (Basic Books Classics)","review":"In the typical post-modernist sense, Geertz seeks to cast doubt on everything without leaving us with anything in place. Just like other post modernists, his theories are so vague, poorly stated, and in generally strange that they cannot be proved right or wrong. Even if he, like other post-modernists, is right, we do not gain anything but perhaps a somewhat edited understanding of our world.The field of cultural anthropology in and of itself is a \\"shady\\" field. The lack of biological evidence to back up Geertz's claims is immense. To think the Central Nervous System is a result of culture is simply asinine. To think that somehow culture exists out there for us to grab and chose and that it is somehow transferred through our genes and eventually influences evolution is outright ridiculous.Just because you can make claims and cast doubt on opposing claims does not mean you are correct. There is little evidence to show that the human race is still undergoing evolution in the Darwinian sense. Geertz's failure, or rather deliberate attempt to, distinguish between the mind and the brain shows his general distaste for any sort of reasonable logic.Please: Someone rescue anthropology from its current blinding veil of post modernist, post-structuralist ideology. Post modernism is like chewing gum that sticks to your shoe sole and impedes you from moving forward. OK, so it has our attention, now let us get it off our feet, move on into the future, and leave this decrepit, inane theory behind us all."},{"Title":"The Interpretation Of Cultures (Basic Books Classics)","review":"\\"Man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun, I take culture to be those webs...\\"These cultural \\"webs of significance\\" Clifford Geertz speaks of are constructed of religious beliefs and practices, cultural customs, social interactions, attitudes and behavior -- everything around us that we have constructed as rational beings capable of thought and imagination. According to Geertz, the role of the anthropologist is, in a sense, to 'decode' the symbolic meanings of these certain events, practices, customs and interactions that take place within a specific culture, however insignificant they may seem to the observer. Detail is of utmost importance. An anthropologist must become part of the culture -- looking in from the outside he will understand nothing. Of course, in order to reduce the occurrence of the anthropologist's own cultural bias and to attempt to more accurately understand a culture, one could easily say that it is imperative that anthropologists emerge themselves in the customs and practices of that culture. But, even then, is it ever possible for one to grasp an understanding of a culture in which one was not born into? Are humans socialized from birth to perceive all cultural customs and practices through a shady lens, clouded by perceptions of the world they have acquired during childhood?Geertz believes that, while to some extent it is possible to reach an understanding of a culture outside of our own, it is important to understand that anthropological writing is merely a \\"thick description,\\" an interpretation of an interpretation. In other words, the anthropologist is interpreting the culture's interpretation of the event that is taking place. There is nothing precise, categorically logical or rational about anthropological writing: Cultural analysis is strictly the process of creating various hypotheses, examining those hypotheses, and then deriving explanations from the best hypotheses. As Geertz says, the analysis of it is not an \\"experimental science in search of law\\" but, rather, \\"an interpretive one in search of meaning.\\" It is the job of an anthropologist to first attempt to understand how an event is interpreted by the culture in which it takes place, then to make an interpretation of that interpretation, and then it is left up to the reader of anthropological writing to interpret the final interpretations. It is difficult, if not impossible, to derive any absolute factual conclusion from data constructed of so many interpretive layers; thus, interpretation is not definitive.The role of an anthropologist, according to Geertz, is to construct the finest interpretations possible, and most importantly, to be an active participant in the culture, rather than a passive observer.This book is THE classical text for a modern cultural anthropologist. It's also an excellent book for anyone skeptical of social science in general, and serves as a great introduction for anyone just curious about anthropology."},{"Title":"The Interpretation Of Cultures (Basic Books Classics)","review":"This remains one of the seminal works in not just Anthropology, but also in the field of social science, written by a brilliant Social Scientist.When it was first written in 1973, it was not just \\"leading-edge,\\" but utterly revolutionary. Today however, in the era of full-fledged \\"cultural and ethnographic relativity,\\" and in the interim, where symbols have earned a more prominent if not wholly respected cross-disciplinary cachet and place in social science scholarship, many of Professor Geertz's seminal ideas now seem strangely \\"quaint,\\" but have in any case become as much a part of the mainstream as they have become controversial.For my money, I prefer to judge this brilliant scholarship, on its own merits as well as against the standards of the times in which it emerged. I have yet to read a first chapter in an English book that is as well constructed and as informatively exciting as that in this book. Geertz, in drawing a bright line between what is universal and constant about man -- versus what is local, ever changing, and merely parochial about him -- attempts to answer the question: Just how important are human differences, and especially differences between cultures?To answer it, the author moves with seamless facility across, between and well beyond the ossified boundaries of \\"normal\\" Anthropology, into myriad related and not so related, fields: such as sociology, philosophy, and the philosophy of science, linguistics, psychology and evolutionary biology, among several others. From their intellectual intersection, Geertz builds up a beautiful theory that culture is a system of shared symbols that allows its members to give shape and meaning to their respective experiences. In 1973, making the full connection between the significance of man's ability to weave meaning from webs of symbols and symbolisms, was not fully appreciated by most social scientists, and certainly (and curiously) even less appreciated by most Anthropologists, who arguably were \\"pulling up the rear\\" in developing interpretative theories upon which to base their mostly ethnographic practices.More than anything else, Professor Greetz \\"changed the game\\" and arguably brought the field of Anthropology out of the \\"theoretical backwaters\\" and \\"dark ages\\" into a more updated and respected place in the academic sun. With his philosophy of science and general philosophy bent, he gave the field of Anthropology a new more exciting cachet and a deeper more meaningful theoretical resonance, mandate and motive: If one was to fully understand culture, he had to first be able to unravel, and then decipher the web of intertwined meanings of symbolic actions and interactions: that is to say he had to be able to understand the full meaning of the whole panoply of culturally determined symbols, totems, events, customs, rituals, rites, politics, etc. Even so, there was only a limited amount that an \\"outsider\\" could expect to learn, as culture remains mostly an enigmatic \\"interior\\" enterprise. At root, studying culture is about trying to formulate a basis upon which groups imagine.To Geertz, (and this book is full of vivid and penetrating examples), cultural analysis thus reduces to that of sorting out the structures of significance discovered in ethnographic observations. And to him ethnography was about \\"thick description.\\" (A term he borrowed from Gilbert Rile, but then went on to make famous). \\"Thick description\\" is about the nested relationships of interpretations: It is about \\"the interpretation of interpretation, ... of interpretation,\\" ... ad infinitum.Most of his critics argued that there was nothing inherently new about this approach. However, the way Geertz proposed to go about it was indeed new: The Anthropologist could no longer remain aloof and stand detached \\"at a distance\\" as an innocent observer in the ethnographic experiment. He had to, as it were, \\"be on the inside looking out,\\" rather than \\"on the outside looking in.\\" He had to not just \\"stick his head under the tent,\\" but get inside the \\"bone marrow\\" of the culture and become an integral and interactive part of its practices. Doing this, of course raised it's own risks and a host of ancillary problems, which ever since have been the subject of much criticism. The least of these was not suffering the debilitating backlash of what is referred to as the \\"Heisenberg effect of social measurements.\\" This effect arises whenever one attempts to judge or gauge the meanings of cultural symbolisms by interacting with them. In doing so, one runs the risk of contaminating the very experiment he is attempting to study.But these concerns aside, Geertz's main contribution was not just in changing the way Anthropology was done, and the effect he had on shaping its theoretical outlook, but he also changed the way cultural habits were viewed, as well as the way theoretical language and concepts were formulated and used to describe them. For once human behavior is seen as symbolic action, questions of whether it is then just patterns of conduct or frames of mind or some mixture of the two, ceases to make sense. One is no longer able to reify culture as for instance, power, or a set of sociological mechanisms, or something from which behavior can be inferred and attributed, but as a context in which \\"thick description\\" takes place.100 stars."},{"Title":"The Interpretation Of Cultures (Basic Books Classics)","review":"I purchased this one as it was a part of course requirements at my major. Geertz' effort in the field of anthropology is undeniable. His contributions in understanding symbols of culture and how important interpreting them in the study of culture is, these things were discussed in my class. So for that, all students of Anthropology, especially Cultural/Social should read this one somewhere along their studies. However, it has to be said that the book is a demanding read. His sentence structures are complex, long-winded and hard-to-tackle academic reading. Parts of the book deal with New Nations (born after WW2) which are not that interesting, and which don't seem all that relevant.Still, Geertz' examples from the cultures of Bali, Trinidad and Indonesia make the book more understandable and all-in-all a good read."},{"Title":"The Interpretation Of Cultures (Basic Books Classics)","review":"This is a book for scholars but it is very readable and will definitely throw you into what anthropology is (should be?) about.

For instance, 'Religion as a Cultural System ..' is a classic of social science: one sentence of related abstractions and generalizations is punctuated by illustrations that define the terms and extend an argument to justify the one-sentence hypothesis. This article changed the way that I understood social science and anthro and is often a model for me whenever I write.excerpt from book\\"Let us, therefore, reduce our paradigm to a definition, for, although itis notorious that definitions establish nothing in themselves, they do, ifthey are carefully enough constructed, provide a useful orientation, orreorientation of thought, such that an extended unpacking of them canbe an effective way of developing and controlling a novel line of inquiry.They have the useful virtue of cxplicitness: they commit themselvesin a way discursive prose does not (which in this field, especially, is alwaysliable to substitute rhetoric for argument). Without further ado,then, aReligion is:(1) a system of symbols which acts to(2) establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by(3) formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and(4) clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that(5) the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic.\\""},{"Title":"The Interpretation Of Cultures (Basic Books Classics)","review":"When I'm reading some complex bit of social science theory, I have to remind myself that no matter what discipline, ANY social science didn't exist 200 years ago- they are recent inventions. It also pays to consider that 99% of the material for ANY social science has been rendered irrelevant by developments that have occurred since the late 1960s. Specifically, the introduction of ideas outside of the \\"positivist\\" \\"social science as hard science\\" school of thought- larger known as \\"relativism.\\"The idea that social sciences were an analogue of natural sciences foundered on the rocks of the complexity of human interaction, and attempts to revise various social sciences have in turn been dashed against the entrenched interests of the older generation of social science mandarins. It's a bit of a sticky wicket, I suppose, but in day-to-day existence it means that you can't count on ANY of the social sciences for ANY insight into human behavior.It's a sad state of affairs, and I analogize the state of social sciences to the state of the music industry: Rendered largely irrelevant by updates in technology, and not sure what to do about it AND free falling into oblivion in the mean time.One of the revolutionariness in the shift away from positivism into an arena of \\"relativism\\" was Clifford Geertz. Geertz was a trailblazer in the social science of Anthropology, introducing sophisticated ideas about human interaction that had been developed by European philosophers like Wittgenstein, sociologists like Max Scheler and linguists like Saussure into the contemporary american discipline of Anthropology.Writing mostly in obscure specialty journals until his Interpretation of Cultures was published 1977, Interpretation of Cultures was itself a collection of the articles he had written up that point, interspersed with bridging chapters. I think it's fair to say that the implications of Geertz's arguments vis a vis anthropological theory are still being addressed in the realm of professional scholarship, but I don't think he's really been absorbed into the \\"general reading public\\" in the way that he should be.Unfortunately, Interpretation of Cultures is far from being a good book in and of its own right, and in a sense it contains a symbolic relevance that mirrors Geertz's own discussion about the role of symbols in religion. (now a \\"sub-field\\" of Anthropology called \\"Symbolic Anthropology.\\") I actually ended up skipping his 100 page discussion of the idea of ideology and it's relationship to the newly emerging nations of the 3d world in the 1960s- but his \\"thick description\\" trailblazer \\"Notes from A Balinese Cock Fight\\" and his chapters describing the role of symbols in religion seem as fresh today as they were then.Interpretation of Cultures also contains a spirited anti-relativist tirade against his own predecessors: Ruth Benedicts \\"Patterns of Cultures\\" comes in for harsh criticism for being too mushy-mushy about describing the relationships between cultures as well as her description of cultures themselves. Geertz champions the deep, fully descriptive essay at the expense of making universal judgement about the whole of human kind based on observations of one culture.Maybe this is why these ideas haven't really penetrated into the genpop: They don't provide any facile or easy answers about explaining human behavior, just suggestions on a method for making observations about phrasing the questions."},{"Title":"The Interpretation Of Cultures (Basic Books Classics)","review":"Very helpful research book for graduate school study of ethnography.

Much of the hydrofoil history that I have seen uses this book as a source, and perhaps the same is true of seaplanes. The book deals with nothing later that 1914.

Fascist dictatorships then seemed to hold a franchise on the future. Stalins purges and the Spanish civil war appeared to reenact the drama which had seen a first performance at the end of the Roman republic, when a party-politician and republican General committed high treason and suspended the constitution, which opened unheard of opportunities and eventually swept the son of a small town banker to the highest office and absolute power. I said swept, but Symes monumental study shows that dumb luck and blind opportunity played only a small part in the ascend of one of the coolest, most ruthless, and most calculating minds who ever aspired political power. However considering the youth and inexperience of Augustus at the beginning of his career, and with a look at the staff of first class advisers that surrounded the young man from the very beginning, one wonders whether it was just Augustus calculation or whether history witnessed to the execution of a master plan by the same man who had had adopted the young Augustus (gossip says, for sexual favours) and who had set him up with means and advisory brainpower. After the dictators assassination the young fellow acted without hesitation, and succeeded against enormous odds. But the man who despite of his frail physique should become one of the longest ruling heads of state in history, had remarkably few lucky breaks. In 31 BC. he again had reached a point where he completely lacked constitutional legality. In order to consolidate his position, Augustus became the first dictator in history to call for a nationwide plebiscite. With due respect to Mommsen it must be said that Sir Ronalds study helps to straighten out Mommsens rather curious adulations on Julius Caesar. Yet both historians based their views on the same premise: that democracy inevitably leads to dictatorship, if the conservative forces turn out to be too stubborn and retrograde in terms of social and economical progress, or if they create a situation in which such progress disenfranchises societys weakest without compensating for the pain inflicted. Strange as this may sound: Caesar, Augustus, Musolini, Hitler, Stalin, Peron, or chairman Mao at some point had all started their career as a spokesperson for the people against the pillars of conservatism. When I look at the present scene in America, I wonder whether this lesson is going to be lost again. Who might it be, who is going to hold the peoples mandate without an election? I am afraid he is already walking among us. Legally, as the peoples tribune, a Roman emperor depended on his legislative veto-power. It was Augustus who first realized its importance. Of course the commander in chief of the armed forces could ask for whatever he fancied, yet Augustus had enough acumen not to depend on the loyalty of troops if he could help it. He was a Roman, and like the aqueducts his empire was built for posterity. When it suited them Roman emperors could even present themselves as the antique equivalent to the leader of a modern labor union: Domitian, &Ograve;the most careful administrator of the empire&Oacute; (Mommsen,) is known for his interventionist economics and he had an inventor of a new material executed because such innovation could have put people out of work. The senatorial gossip surrounding Nero has clouded the fact that his policies were immensely popular with the masses, even after his ignominious death. Ancient Rome had succumbed to military despotism, yet we should keep in mind that the same man who had done most to bring down republican liberty, had also left as his legacy the egalitarian rule of law, which remained to be surprisingly functional until Diocletians reforms. Many emperors thought it good PR to show themselves below the law like everybody else, and public welfare enjoyed the benefit. What impresses most in Sir Ronalds study is the way this historian manages to unravel the entangled messiness of cross-purpose policies, blind chance, and calculated action. Syme successfully avoids to create a picture of ironclad necessity, which so often mars the perspective of historical writing, but it also becomes quite clear, that in the end timely and better informed decisions succeeded over poorer judgement. Augustus was in no way &Ograve;destined&Oacute; to come out victorious, but he did because his opponents missed their chances. Eventually this supreme pragmatist became not only the richest man of his era but also the most opulent benefactor who funneled back most of his billions into the community. Augustus is one of the enigmas of history: an absolutely ruthless politician, completely untrammeled by even the remotest sign of a conscience, and yet at the same time a genuine benefactor, fond of mingling with lower classes at the dog-races; a man who preferred to live, away from his palaces and villas, in a small, rented apartment. Go figure. Not your everyday friendly mobster from the neighborhood. And this is the other great quality of Symes study. He clearly advances on Mommsens anachronistic imposition of latter-day party politics on the Roman political scene. With Sir Ronald we come much closer to the often purely dynastic competition in the Roman senate. However it would oversimplify the situation to dismiss this institution merely as a clearinghouse for perks and prestige without any conflict between principles and policies. The legislation of the Gracci had had introduced issues that really mattered and moved the urban masses to support populist dynasts, like Catilina and Caesar, against provincial upstarts on the conservative ticket, like Cicero, and even made them vote for military junta chiefs of dubious legitimacy like Augustus himself. Sir Ronalds book, meant as a warning to politicians of his own time, never compromises on scholarship and profound analysis. Historiography at its very best; an outstanding achievement."},{"Title":"The Roman revolution (Oxford paperback)","review":"First published in 1937, \\"The Roman Revolution\\" was a ground-breaking masterpiece that forever changed how historians look at ancient Rome. Some of Syme's conclusions were extremely controversial for years, but a great many historians now agree that his approach of looking at the events of 60 BCE - 14 CE as being greatly influenced, if not precipitated, by the histories and interactions of Rome's leading families is vital to understanding this crucial period in Western history. As Syme writes: \\"The nobiles by their ambition and their feuds, had not merely destroyed their spurious republic: they had ruined the Roman People. There is something more important than political liberty; and political rights are a means, not an end in themselves. That end is security of life and property: it could not be guaranteed by the constitution of Republican Rome. Worn and broken by civil war and disorder, The Roman people was ready to surrender the ruinous privilege of freedom and submit to strict government as the beginning of time....So order came to Rome.\\" In other words oligarchies will go to any (often short-sighted) extreme to protect their interests, even if it results in their eventual destruction. His work is as important today as it was in 1937, and is an essential read for anyone interested in Roman history in particular, and Western history in general."},{"Title":"The Roman revolution (Oxford paperback)","review":"Having read ancient history for my BA degree many years ago, I can only praise this highly acclaimed and groundbreaking work. Published more than 70 years ago, it's written by an old-school historian and definitely not intended for the novice or lay reader (as AJP Taylor claims). However, if you are well-grounded in the period or are studying this era, then Syme's book is absolutely invaluable.One must tread carefully when looking at Roman history because so little of it is known to us. Academically speaking, I always felt it was best to first read the ancient sources themselves before moving on to modern authors who offer a critical analysis of the period. Nevertheless, this book is an exception to that rule.Syme's objective is to explain why the old senatorial oligarchy that ruled Rome collapsed, and how it was replaced by a new upper class loyal to a monarchical form of government. This upheaval had far-reaching consequences, and undoubtedly constituted one of the greatest revolutions of the ancient world. The reader should also keep in mind that when Syme published his book, classical scholarship was still infatuated with 19th century romanticism. Caesar and Augustus were glorified as heroic revolutionaries leading on their victorious armies. Syme puts that myth to rest by reminding us that even ancient sources depict these men as corrupt demagogues who wouldn't hesitate to murder and double-cross their rivals.Far from being a mere recounting of historical events. this study is an in-depth investigation of how these \\"new\\" men revolutionized Roman politics: their networks of patronage, their financial backers, their agricultural and military policies, their manipulation of religion and public opinion.The authoritative scholarship and minute research displayed throughout Syme's narrative are more than impressive. Few other works are capable of providing such an understanding of the process culminating in the disintegration of the Roman Republic. Of course, as other reviewers have done well to point out, Syme's views can be questioned just like those of any other historian. Was the fall of the republic really inevitable as he claims it was? This is something which the reader will have to determine on his own.Be that as it may, Syme's book has endured as an outstanding contribution to classical studies. It's not easy to read, and its style is old-fashioned; but surely you can only profit from reading this great work."},{"Title":"The Roman revolution (Oxford paperback)","review":"This book is considered a staple for anyone who considers themselves a Roman history buff!

Unfortunately Professor Syme seems to be overly influenced by his own times( the 1930\\"s)in ascribing motives to J Caesar and Octavian Caesar. It's as if they were proto fascists rather than products of an oligarchic system that needed to morph into a government to rule a far flung empire. Does anyone for a moment believe that Brutus, Cassius, Cato or Cicero and the others were capable of ruling the entire Mediterranean world, Europe, Africa and the East? The conspirators who murdered Caesar didn't have a clue on the consequences of their actions. They set into motion events which overwhelmed them and in my view forced Octavian to wipe them out and to prevent nobles like them from ever again ruling without military oversight."},{"Title":"The Roman revolution (Oxford paperback)","review":"An immensely scholarly work examining a very specific period of time -- namely the transition from Roman Republic to Roman Empire in the years following the murder of Julius Caesar in 44 BC. The book concludes at around 14 AD with the death of Augustus (known earlier as Octavian) and the accession of Tiberius.For anyone who has studied ancient Rome, this period is both a fascinating and frustrating time. Fascinating because of the immense changes underway and frustrating because it is so poorly documented; particularly as compared to the period just preceding it. This was, of course, by design -- once he came to power Augustus destroyed much of the contemporary documentation if it portrayed him in a negative light.Syme does a masterful job in working with the available sources, basing his conclusions on what is said and also what is missing. What really jumped out for me in reading The Roman Revolution was the sophistication at play in terms of political messaging and Augustus' skill as a propagandist. Particularly in terms of having others sing his praises, which allowed him to maintain a decorous level of modesty. There's a reason so much of Virgil and Livy survive -- they were both on Augustus' payroll.All this being said, the book is extremely dense, with footnotes often in Greek or Latin, and the expectation that the reader already has a strong grasp of Republican Rome and First Triumvirate.Definitely not a beach read, but excellent if you have a decent grounding in ancient Rome are willing to put in the work this book requires."},{"Title":"The Roman revolution (Oxford paperback)","review":"I would have titled this book differently because a revolution is rather abrupt and his discrpition is rather long.

Syme's views (that Late Republican Roman politics was centered on intra-families aristocratic feuding and steered away from substantive issues) which has no appeal to me, but I think he has developed his point in the most throughly and consciencious manner - excessively so, I think. Classical scholars are a very conservative tribe, and tend to disregard questions of historical method, favoring instead a simple description of avaliable facts piled atop each other. That what makes this book one of the most dry historical works I've read so far. If you want to argue the point that Republican dynasts made politics on the basis of family alliances and that the Empire put an end to that,well and good; but it's not necessary to develop this point by describing tens of stemmas and tracking down who was the last consulate held by each aristocratic family - even the most unimportant ones!

In the end, a scholar must ask: &quot;Was there a revolution at all?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Roman revolution (Oxford paperback)","review":"This is without doubt Syme's masterwork. The praise has been lavish. A.J.P. Taylor said it was a \\"work of brilliant scholarship which can be enjoyed by the expert and the layman alike\\". Sir Maurice Bowra said \\"his work is extraordinarily persuasive and interesting, it is the best book on Roman History that has appeared for many years.\\" The Classical Review wrote that is the \\"one of the most important books on Roman history since Mommsen.Need more reasons to read it? Well, I'll try. I'll start by saying that this is one of the top 25 books I have read - though I by no means agree with everything Syme believes.What Ronald Syme has done is to lay bare the workings of the late Republic and early Empire. To do this required an effort of scholarship and synthesis on a gargantuan scale. And yet Syme manages to render the story in a lucid, straightforward, compelling manner. His arguments are often ineluctable. You find yourself drawn along, at times unwillingly, to conclusions you thought far-fetched.The period under scrutiny is 60 BC to AD 14. Thus he covers the last generation of the Republic and the first two or three of the Empire. In a nutshell his hypothesis is that the Republic simply was not equipped to manage what had become an empire. He believes that Rome was inevitably drawn to the rule of one.He writes of Caesar: \\"The rule of the nobiles, he [Caesar] could see, was an anachronism in a world-empire; and so was the power of the Roam plebs when all Italy enjoyed the franchise. Caesar in truth was more conservative and Roman that many have fancied; no Roman conceived of government save through an oligarchy.\\"Augustus, however, was a different matter. And it was Augustus, believes Syme, who wrought the revolution that forever changed the Roman way of life. To suggest, as has some have done, that there was no true revolution, almost defies sense and logic. And Syme ably makes the case.But aspects of the Syme's theory remain controversial. He writes: \\"The nobiles by their ambition and their feuds, had not merely destroyed their spurious republic: they had ruined the Roman People. There is something more important than political liberty; and political rights are a means, not an end in themselves. That end is security of life and property: it could not be guaranteed by the constitution of Republican Rome. Worn and broken by civil war and disorder, The Roman people was ready to surrender the ruinous privilege of freedom and submit to strict government as the beginning of time....So order came to Rome. \\"Acriora ex eo vincula\\", as Tacitus observes.\\"Wow. This is breath taking and highly controversial. He might as well have been writing about pre-Nazi Germany (and note that Syme wrote \\"The Roman Revolution\\" in 1939). And, frankly, I must tell you I do not agree with his condemnation of the nobiles. Nor do others.The most important voice in opposition remains that of Erich Gruen's. \\"The Last Generation of the Roman Republic\\" MUST be read alongside \\"The Roman Revolution.\\" Gruen believes that the monarchy was in fact neither anticipated nor inevitable. And he strongly believes that the Republic was functioning quite well, thank you very much, and could in fact have coped with empire."},{"Title":"The Roman revolution (Oxford paperback)","review":"This great work of scholarly history was first published in June 1939. In his brief foreword Sir Ronald Syme speaks cryptically about its publication being a matter of some urgency. From that we have to infer that he saw it as having contemporary relevance. From a slow and careful reading I would add that we ought to be very careful and circumspect in how we draw parallels and apply lessons. I don't dispute for a moment that a thorough and precise examination of what was done over the turbulent transition from the later Roman republic to the principate gives deep insight into human motivations and political processes. However if one particular lesson comes over loud and clear to me it is how terminology can be distorted for political ends, deliberate or even unperceived. Those prone to assert that \`reading history' will in some inevitable way support some cherished preconception of their own will, if intelligent and attentive, gain a salutary insight into what history really consists of, and with that a perception of the pitfalls of dealing in glib generalisations and citing as convenient parallels things that are no parallels at all.The first job of the historian is to clarify what really, or probably, happened and to interpret accurately or at least rationally what the sources for the period tell us. This is rarely a matter of simple fact in the sense that multiplication tables are simple fact. Syme's reasoning is bold and forthright, and while he has no claim to be taken as gospel he never seems to me perverse or unreasonable. I personally doubt that Antony was the straightforward and honest type portrayed by Syme - Syme himself can't get away from the part Antony played in the proscriptions. On the other hand he has every reason to ridicule Octavian's propaganda concerning the nonexistent threat posed to Rome from Antony's Egyptian queen and Octavian's official party line that elevated the naval skirmish at Actium into some mighty turning-point of history.The story I read from Syme is as follows. The Roman republic was always part-sham. Its official mode of governance was by the senate and people, with the consuls as chief officers of government chosen at stated intervals by the people. Real power was exercised by shifting coalitions of nobles together with the unseen influence of the moneyed equestrian class. The values that weighed with both nobles and plebs were tradition and \`authority', there being no written constitution. There was certainly some flexibility, but it was rare for the plebs to choose as consuls anyone lacking aristocratic status. There was no concept of progress whatsoever, and democracy on the Athenian model was despised. \`Liberty' was largely theoretical, except in the sense that free speech was untrammelled to a degree we would never tolerate now. There was no pressure from any class for reform let alone revolution, but the knights and bankers were provoked at the peril of any who did so (as Catiline found to his cost), and the plebs were prone to periodic revolt, offering a power base successively to Marius and to Caesar. Blatant inversion of the meaning of the laws was the stock-in-trade of anyone with a mission, invoking some higher interpretation as suited. Indeed what Cicero tried to do in opposition to Antony was much what he boasted of having repressed as consul in relation to Catiline. Gradually a single figure came to be dominant in the power-struggles. Sulla brutally put down the adherents of Marius in the name of restoring the right-and-proper dominance of his fellow aristocrats. However when Sulla thought his work done he simply resigned. Not so Pompey or Caesar. They sought personal dominance in a way Sulla had not done. Pompey was a brute, Caesar to some extent genuinely liberal (although I see no reason to believe that any Roman republican leader had any opinion except contempt for the plebs). However on attaining power Caesar went back basically to the status quo ante, but took the unprecedented step of accepting dictatorship for life and appointing a successor, something not even Sulla had contemplated.From there on fate favoured Octavian. His luck was phenomenal, his ruthlessness total, his skill in balancing interests and oligarchies unprecedented, and his mendacity instinctive and brilliant. He was the butcher of Perusia and the co-tyrant of the proscriptions, and he never really changed. He was by no means all-powerful, but he eviscerated the old aristocratic oligarchies and established his own. Unrest had suited him during his rise, stability after he reached the top. He had a genuine Roman respect for tradition, but he had a populist sense that the plebs would be kept on-side with a better water-supply. He knew a good idea when he saw it, and he first supported Egnatius Rufus and his private-enterprise fire-brigade until he realised Egnatius was a danger, at which point he executed Egnatius and nationalised the fire-brigade. He removed occasions of unrest by paying off retired soldiers with money rather than letting them loose to seize land in Italy, and he paid provincial governors a salary to reduce problems to himself from their practice of extortion. Throughout, he adopted the old names and titles while systematically inverting what was done in their name.Syme has had to interpret the sources, and I have had to interpret Syme. That's history for you. It is a matter of using our brains, and it won't just prove what we prefer it to prove. In the last resort this history gives no comfort whatsoever to my own enthusiasm for democracy. In the first place Romans disliked that idea, and in the second they traded their once-cherished \`libertas' (such as it ever was) for stability, such as it turned out to be. Augustus established a monarchy, leaving a successor of last choice who, as a Roman noble (unlike Augustus), wanted supremacy but hated the form of supremacy he inherited. It all lasted for 400 or 500 effective years. The thousand-year Reich of 1939 lasted all of 12, the British Empire roughly 150, the Soviet empire some 40 or 70 depending on when we start counting, and the New American Century looks dead in the water already. It was the creation of one city and of one man, through oligarchies of course. Go figure."},{"Title":"The Roman revolution (Oxford paperback)","review":"Syme wrote this, his first work, in 1939. He both challenged prevailing views of Augustus and demonstrated how family ties and allegiances affected the politics of the late republic. Above all, however, &quot;The Roman Revolution&quot; is a study in politics and power and the story of an adventurer subverting a declining system and seizing control.

One feels it is a \\"behind the headlines\\" view, much like one gets in a book by Peter Heather."},{"Title":"The Roman revolution (Oxford paperback)","review":"This is a monumental and absolutely first rate work of scholarship. It covers the period roughly from Marius to Tiberius, which saw the fall of the traditional oligarchic republic and its replacement by the despotic monarchy as designed by Augustus. While it has a great deal about the politics, it also addresses issues related to the administration of the Empire.Following the empowerment of the Tribunes of the People under the Gracchi brothers - enabling popular assemblies to make law, originally the exclusive province of the Roman Senate - and the expansion of the empire beyond Italy, Syme argues, the Roman Republic entered a period of unprecedented crisis. Not only did the army gain political power as enforcer and monopoly holder of organized military means, but the subject peoples became interested in accessing and influencing the old-style oligarchy. Moreover, with the multiple new avenues of power, including mob-inciting demagogues who ruled the streets, a cacophony of laws were promulgated (or more often, blocked). The result was over a century of recurring civil war, which invariably erupted during certain crucial transfers of power at the change of the yearly consulship. It was only Augustus who solved the equation of who should wield power with the creation of a kind of monarchy, in this view.Prior to this crisis, Rome was governed much as a Greek City State, with a narrow local elite taking advantage of its subject peoples to support their power games via the extraction of their wealth; responsibilities were thrust onto governors (for periods too short to learn much about their provinces) who had little knowledge of administration and cared nothing for the welfare of local subjects. The Roman Oligarchy had ruled for hundreds of years in this way, transferring power on a yearly basis to consuls as voted by the Senate, which prevented the development of autocratic power. It was essentially an aristocracy of Patricians (descendants of those who overthrew the monarchs) and rich Plebians who had achieved military glory in times of crisis (e.g. the Scipios, who defeated Hannibal). The Senators had to maintain their prestige through lavish displays of wealth in public events but also to help their client base, all for the glory of their families. Rather than parties or ideology, their power was based on family alliances as extended by a loyal \\"clientele\\" sworn to mutual assistance. Underneath them were the equestrians, who were businessmen and local aristocrats in the provinces; they made money instead of seeking glory. Finally, there was the proletariat. Only rarely did \\"new men\\", such as the military genius Caius Marius, arise to hold power in times of external threat.Politically, this system worked reasonably well until Rome became a Mediterranean superpower. First, the source of soldiers - gentleman farmers - proved inadequate to the requirements for years of military service: they were too few and had to work the fields regularly or face ruin. This opened the way to the establishment of a professional army by Marius, in which the proletariat and anyone else could serve for wages and make a career. Second, the subject peoples of Rome wanted the same rights as the citizens; they rebelled violently and were suppressed with increasing frequency. With the opportunities that the Tribunate offered to go over the heads of the Senatorial oligarchy, the great general Marius created a new structure of power, which included both his loyal soldiers and the proletariat as well as the provincials. Sulla, Marius' proteg&eacute; and then rival for power, attempted to reinstall the old oligarchy in a bloody civil war that wiped out a vast array of political talent from ranks of the oligarchy and equestrians. It was here that the powerful generals - Pompey (allied with provincials) and soon Julius Caesar (a patrician favoring the \\"common man\\") - emerged to battle the old oligarchy in a conflict that eventually could have destroyed the Republic.While still a teenager, Octavian (mysteriously adopted by Caesar just prior to his assassination and later known as Augustus) then stepped into the breach and after much struggle completely reshaped the power structure. The true genius of Augustus, according to Syme, is that he was able to use the power of the armies - he gained command of the most important nearby legions in case of need - while channeling the ambitions of citizens into service for Rome (and for himself, of course). He did this by creating legitimate outlets for the energies of ambitious men of talent (as military officials but also as professional administrators), who served the state and empire rather than constantly maneuvered for executive power within the oligarchy. Essentially, in addition to opening administration to talent from the provinces, Augustus made a major step in the establishment of the apparatus for a more modern state, replacing the amateurish behavior of non-professionals that was the hallmark of Greek City States.This is a wonderful interpretation that makes many aspects of Roman history comprehensible beyond naked grabs for personal power and glory. In Syme's view, the huge Roman Empire had become ungovernable by the fractious oligarchy, denuded as it was of talent over the previous 100 years of civil war; Augustus buried the old oligarchy while maintaining the appearance of the republic's institutions, bringing order at the price of liberty, which an exhausted citizenry welcomed. There is no doubt that much of this is accurate, in my opinion.That being said, Syme makes many judgments that I found questionable, though they are nuance rather than the core ideas that I find very sound. He portrays Augustus as a proto-totalitarian, while I think he was a simple despot. He likes both Marc Anthony and Tiberius, while I think they were mediocre libertines. These are things we can never know, of course, so my interpretation is personal.Regarding Syme's method, I want to add a note of caution for the reader. He assumes a certain level of knowledge; if the reader lacks it, the book will be very rough going and dry. You need to know not only who Sulla and Cato are, but also Livius Drusus, Crassus, the Metelli, and many many others. Syme did not intend to retell any of the stories attached to them. You also need to know the history and chronology from about 150 bc to 30 ad. If you have this grounding, the book is truly a joy of subtle interpretation and analysis accomplished by a great master scholar, who knows every obscure scrap of written sources that supports his case. The book also has a quirky, though elegant writing style.This is one of the best books on Roman history that I have ever read, but it is not for casual readers. You need to be something of a Roman history buff before you read this, either at the gradual level or having read the wonderful historical novels of McCullough. With these caveats, I recommend this book with the greatest enthusiasm."},{"Title":"The Roman revolution (Oxford paperback)","review":"How did the world's most powerful, free republic fall into dictatorship? This pressing question animates two classics of classical history--H. H. Scullard's &quot;From the Gracchi to Nero&quot; and Sir Ronald Syme's &quot;The Roman Revolution.&quot;Syme's analysis of the end of the Free State is as authoritative as it is magisterial. Written in the terse, energetic style of Tacitus, RR shares Tacitus' verdict on the falling Republic--that a princeps, however horrible, was the only &quot;solution&quot; for a state ruled by warring, short-sighted, power-lusting factions.But what a marvel those factions were to behold! For the patient reader, there is a gripping story herein--as intricate as Puzo's &quot;The Godfather,&quot; as high-stakes as Hugo's &quot;Ninety-Three,&quot; as vibrant as Shakespeare. I think this is historiography at its best."},{"Title":"The Roman revolution (Oxford paperback)","review":"Syme's 1939 work is essential reading for anyone who wants to have an in depth understanding of the Roman Republic's collapse. Although later works have disputed his thesis (Caesar was a proto-fascist), it is still an important book to read and well worth the investment in time and effort."},{"Title":"The Roman revolution (Oxford paperback)","review":"R. Syme reveals the real power players in ancient Roman society, the backers of the competing generals searching personal domination of the empire.That empire contained two classes of citizens: the patricians and the plebs. Rome was ruled without a real constitution (legality was a casual or partisan question). In fact, an oligarchy of 20 to 30 men detained all power strings. They represented whom? The main factions involved were the optimates (wealthy nobility), the nobiles (consular houses), the equites (provincial aristocracies, captains of industry and finance) and the novi homines (senators for the 1st time). Three other groups as a whole were politically very important: the plebs, the soldiers and the Senate.Ambitious generals tried to cement different factions into a block, a Party as a power base.Julius Caesar was a nobilis, backed by the plebs. By nominating many novi homines he took control of the Senate. He became the first Roman revolutionary by abolishing all political liberties and installing a dictatorship. He was stabbed to death by the defenders of the Republic.Marcus Antonius took the helm at the Caesarean Party, but Caesar also nominated a young nobilis as his heir, Octavianus. Provisory political stability was created through a triumvirate (M. Antonius, Octavianus, Lepidus) which installed a reign of terror, wiping out all political opponents through proscription and abolishing all private rights of citizenship. After the elimination of Lepidus, the two remaining triumvirs fought the battle of Actium: Octavianus became the sole master of the situation. In the choice between political freedom (and a new suicidal civil war?) or a stable government, the power players opted for the latter.The reign of Octavianus (Augustus) was backed by the plebs (panem et circenses), the military, the Senate (purified by nominating many novi homines) and the consuls (designated by the emperor). The power of the nobiles was broken. R. Syme characterizes his reign as plutocratic. Many novi homines were opulent men from the colonies and the municipia (Italy without Rome). In reality, Rome was ruled in secret by members of his family (Livia) and personal adherents (Maecenas, Agrippa).R. Syme's book contains many in depth portraits of major power players. A few examples: Cicero was the head of the optimates who intended to employ Octavianus in order to destroy the Caesarean Party and to restore political liberty. Octavianus was a hypocrite and opportunist chameleon, who seized power through bribery, fraud and bloodshed.This magisterially and clear analysis of a power struggle is a must read for all historians and for all those interested in the history of mankind"},{"Title":"The Roman revolution (Oxford paperback)","review":"if you are looking for a challenging history book on the roman repuplic and its decline, this is the book to have. extremly interesting, and it gives new look to current politics in many corners of the world (note that this book was first published on 1939)."},{"Title":"Solace: Rituals of Loss and Desire","review":"I have read everything of Mary Sojourner's work that I can lay my hands on. Her work is intense, gritty, and deeply moving. This book is no exception. Keep it up, Mary."},{"Title":"Solace: Rituals of Loss and Desire","review":"Keep in mind, this review is not being generated by a erudite, literary scholar ... having barely passed college english. Thus, this is the simple opinion of a complex personality.I encountered Mary Sojourner on a Yoga web site where her chapter on \\"Occupying Less\\" was presented. So enticed by her ability to articulate her thoughts on simplicity and nature that I ordered the book, clueless as to its future impact on my life.Initially, I was struck by her spiritual movement from dull, flat grays to brilliant, primary neons which interplayed with the shadows and lights. The grey world of childhood nuturing is juxtaposed against her eight year old ability to disconnect from the pain by focusing on Christmas lights... and hence forth, always seeking those luminous, transcendental moments of escape from the gray, monotonous ache.Sojourner's ability to express the concept of disconnection as both a survival skill and as a destructive force resonate with those seeking that fine thread of balance upon which many of us try to walk. Her absorption into a new homeland, the desert, and her desire to rally the cry for protection is inspiring. Yet, through her struggles as an environmental activist, she cogently identifies her own personal obstacles and emotional pitfalls.If for no other reason than cronehood, I believe this book should be a must read for all women who are seeking their path."},{"Title":"Solace: Rituals of Loss and Desire","review":"I bought this book while hiking out in the SW. I found within its covers a beautifully written map of a life lived full on. What amazing healing it provided. I yearn for those who can express and feel even one third of what Mary Sojourner has shared. If you want exquisite writing, uncut stories of raw life and insights into the human soul--read this. You will be changed."},{"Title":"Solace: Rituals of Loss and Desire","review":"The most compelling aspect of this rather indulgent memoir is Sojourner's retelling of her life and times with her ill mother. You really feel a sense of the anguish. Otherwise, the book unveils itself in a series of incomplete vignettes that are packaged like second-rate newspaper columns at best, and generally self-righteous and lacking in introspection.Sojourner is a real stalwart in Flagstaff; she manages to raise ver voice the loudest at most rallies. In truth, though, she doesn't live in the woods, as the marketing would like to present, but right off a paved highway in a cluster of cabins for tourists, two minutes from your local Walmart. And her rants against the corporatization of publishing now ring hollow given that she avidly sought to be published by a corporate juggernaut like Simon Schuster (and its Scribner imprint), instead of a truly independent press like Seal. Bottom line: so much for taking a stand; take the money and run."},{"Title":"The witches of All Saints","review":"The Witches of All Saints was a little slow in developing the story. It moves along at a pace that is tolerable, but if it was quicker it would be more interesting and easier to get into.

World wide unity is no longer optional, but is now a mandate of the age in which we live. It is time for humanity to establish world peace and abandon the false standards which allow prejudices, inequities and apathy with its lack of understanding compassion tempered by a sense of true justice to prevail to the detriment and ruination of human dignity. This work calls us to the highest standard and makes it attainable."},{"Title":"A Creed for the Third Millenium","review":"You know the story. The child Jesus Christ is born during the reign of Caesar Augustus, despite the efforts of the local monarch Herod. He reaches adulthood during the reign of Augustus's hand-picked successor Tiberius, and preaches a message of spiritual renewal to an oppressed population. His apostle Judas Iscariot acts as his ministry's manager, but later betrays him to the government. The story is later told for the ages by a Gentile named Luke.This book translates that story into the not-too-distant future. Unfortunately the translation is rather sophomoric. Dr. Joshua Christian (Jesus Christ) is born during the presidency of Augustus &quot;Gus&quot; Rome. His story unfolds during the presidency of Augustus's hand-picked successor Tibor Reece (Tiberius), when the government invents &quot;Operation Messiah&quot; in order to bring a message of spiritual renewal to an oppressed citizenry, despite the reluctance of Cabinet secretary Harold Magnus (Herod). Christian's advocate Judith Carrioll (Judas Iscariot) manages the project, to his ultimate detriment, while hired biographer Lucy Greco (Luke the Greek) tells his story for the masses.&quot;Creed&quot; is both less and more than a simple analogy for a time-transplanted gospel. Despite the many unsubtle analogies to the New Testament, &quot;Operation Messiah&quot; does not follow--cannot follow--the story of Jesus too literally, so author Colleen McCullough experiments with twists on the story in its twenty-first-century setting. Sometimes her twists makes sense, but more often they do not, and they leave the reader wondering where she was trying to go with her story. She may not have known herself. But she paints an interesting twenty-first-century America, despairing over climatic and economic changes, whose government goes searching for someone &quot;capable of teaching a sick nation how to heal itself&quot; and finds--then elevates--a made-to-order messiah.Even though this book slathers on the parallel names and other biblical analogs a little too thickly, I did enjoy it. The plot left much to be desired, but the writing was very good, the narrative flowed easily (even when the author seemed unsure about where it was flowing to), and the story was occasionally thought-provoking. The book was not deep, but it was engaging, and in the end a satisfying read if you are looking for entertainment and not philosophy."},{"Title":"A Creed for the Third Millenium","review":"I read this years ago and it stays with me. I looked it up just now to recommend it to a friend. I didn't feel that this book should be so simply explained as an attempt to rehash the story of the New Testament. I feel that it showed the fallacy of Man and Orwellian government at the start of the New Millennium attempting to artificially create a passion similar to that of Jesus to appease and inspire the demoralized dumb masses. I see parallells of this book in our society today. I hope that having read &quot;Stranger In a Strange Land&quot; didn't affect my perception of this book to much, because comparisons can be made with it also. This was not written for the &quot;Thornbirds&quot; crowd. &quot;Creed for the Third Millennium&quot; is worth reading and thinking about."},{"Title":"A Creed for the Third Millenium","review":"&quot;Creed&quot; is an unexpected offering from one of my favorite guilty pleasures. Colleen McCullough's &quot;Tim&quot; and &quot;The Thornbirds&quot; are two of my favorite books, but I don't usually admit to being a fan since these stories are somewhat simplistic romances. This book is very different from her other works. While the writing style is still quite simple and her symbolism is much too obvious, the novel offers a thought-provoking vision of a not-too-distant and all-too-possible future. The creation of a modern day messiah through the government's manipulation of the media is a fascinating premise. This book makes me a little less shy about admitting that I am a McCullough fan."},{"Title":"A Creed for the Third Millenium","review":"Ms. McCullough is a gifted writer who is not afraid to explore different genres. Here, she posits a United States facing a 21st Century Ice Age (when she wrote it global cooling, not global warming was in vogue). As futurism, that is one heck of an intriguing premise. But the tale falls short. She posits a new Messiah (whose surname is the rather trite &quot;Christian&quot;) and, as his protagonist, a witch of a government bureaucrat who &quot;makes&quot; the poor chump into an international icon. The story plods along until its rather predictable ending. Well, not every work can be a masterpiece, and it is unfortunate that this one didn't make it because it sure had potential.This being said, I would make a great movie!"},{"Title":"A Creed for the Third Millenium","review":"I loved Colleen McCullough's Rome series, but this book is terrible. It's hard to believe the same author wrote these books. The characters are totally cheesy and one-dimensional, and the story lacks any subtlety. The Christ figure is named Joshua Christian, and his betrayer is named Judith. Give me a break! Give the readers a little more credit for being intelligent and figuring out the biblical analogy on their own."},{"Title":"A Creed for the Third Millenium","review":"\\"Creed\\" imagines a future world menaced by ice. North American society has taken mainly to the warmer climates in order to escape the descending glaciers, and nobody's very happy about it. While war and international strife are all but gone, life expectancy is at an all-time low, overpopulation is a dominant issue, and it looks like man's days are finally numbered.So the President orders a search. A search to find a person who can cheer everyone up. They find a psychologist by the name of Joshua Christian. Mr. Christian serves as a media-born Messiah figure, guiding a crippled civilization into the dim light of hope and salvation.An interesting concept, sure, but McCullough does little to keep things together here. The writing style is utterly superficial and borderline-laughable, is utterly riddled with cliches. The dialogue isn't much better. There's some insight to be found in here, but it's buried far too deep beneath the author's almost-shameless preachiness.Most certainly not one of McCullough's finest moments, and most deservedly out-of-print, \\"Creed\\" is worth an expedition to the used-book store only if you're a fan of McCullough and/or the post-apocalyptic novel. You'd be a lot better off with McCullough's other work, and might I suggest Stephen King's \\"The Stand\\" if you're looking for a truly fine novel of Christianity at the end of the world."},{"Title":"A Creed for the Third Millenium","review":"Wow! How incredible to have just finished this book only a few days before the horrific attack on America. Much of the &quot;story&quot; is predictable, in some places tedious, however, the concepts have merit in the futuristic setting.

It is not offensive in my mind but others who take the Christian religion seriously may see this book as blasphemy.Others like me who are not so worried will find this an easy and entertaining read that will leave you feeling a trifle sad about the world she has created in this novel."},{"Title":"A Creed for the Third Millenium","review":"Having read &quot;Thornbirds&quot;, &quot;Ladies of Missalongi&quot;, and presently reading &quot;First Man in Rome&quot;, I am amazed at the variety of literary style McCullough has; however, this is certainly one of her more simplistic styles. There is no guessing what will happen because the reader quickly realizes Judith Carrol is Judas Iscariot, and the main character is Christ all placed in the future. The interesting twist is relating the idea to a twisted, sick love and admiration for someone, a person that must be controlled somehow. In that respect, there may be many who can relate to the idea of a power struggle within a relationship. I guess I simply got caught up in the idea of a type of second coming or more of a rehash of the first coming...as if it needed to happen again because it wasn't perfect enough the first time around. With that in mind, the ending seems fruitless and somehow, so did my reading of this book. Better to introduce yourself to this wonderful writer by reading &quot;Thornbirds&quot; or her Roman series."},{"Title":"A Creed for the Third Millenium","review":"I began this book with much anticipation, having enjoyed many other titles by this author, but was terribly disappointed.

Numerous poets are translated from central and South American, including a surprising poem from Jorge Luis Borges about Lee's soldier in the Civil War.Looking at poetry anthologies, readers are left to form their own links between poems and this collection offers some startling ones. With a theme of quilts and scraps, there is the Kentuckian Catherine Sutton's haunting &quot;Graveyard Quilt&quot; to Jean Valentines allusion to the Aids quilt.

I am in the middle of my second reading as I write this.Irene Ziegler has managed to bring to life the developing pre-adolescent Annie in such a delightful way. (One suspects that Ziegler was once a developing pre-adolescent girl herself, and that she was paying close attention to her feelings during that time.) She has a gift.I normally read fast. But this book is a Slow Read. I felt the need to slow down, and to savor each sentence, each phrase, as I read it.(&quot;Leigh?&quot; I said through my tears. She drew near, her face close to mine. &quot;Take me with you,&quot; I whispered, and in the single tear that moved in a slow, erratic path down her cheek, I saw my lonely, wounded self reflected.)Thank you, Irene Ziegler. I love this book."},{"Title":"Rules of the Lake: Stories","review":"I always know I've really enjoyed a book when I don't want it to end, as is the case with this book. I still want to know more about Annie's childhood and what happens to her as an adult. Ms. Ziegler's writing style is very real--she describes the tragedy and comedy of human nature in a down-to-Earth way. My very favorite story is about Annie's quest to become a Girl Scout. I laughed but also felt her pain. I hope Ms. Ziegler comes out with another book soon. I'll volunteer to be one of the first to read it. Thanks for taking me back to my own childhood."},{"Title":"Rules of the Lake: Stories","review":"In its sensory details, Rules of the Lake recreates an earlier, largely undeveloped Central Florida. There's a backyard lake and an undiscovered natural spring. The pre-Disney tourist attractions are tacky. And in orange groves and the pleasures of fishing and walking barefoot, Irene's Ziegler's stories of childhood take the reader to a Florida that is now much harder to find. And, if that's all there was to the book, it would still be a pretty good read. But into this Florida Ziegler puts Annie Bartlett. To discover her is to rediscover the experience of being a child. Annie longs to be one of the popular girls with an ache that will make the reader relive terrible preadolescence. She longs to be loved by her father. She longs to understand adult mysteries that are as elusive as the shadows that swim in the backyard lake. And if the stories stopped there they'd be well worth reading. But of course there's more. The thread that holds together the stories and the images of Florida and Annie is the author's voice. It's a great voice. Sometimes it speaks in kid-real dialect and inner thoughts and sometimes it changes mid-sentence to deliver a zinger. Sometimes it's poetry. I saved my reading of Rules of the Lake for late evening just before sleep, and always closed the book with the \\"Ah!\\" of discovery."},{"Title":"Rules of the Lake: Stories","review":"Irene Ziegler's Rules of the Lake is a deeply moving and often hilarious submersion into the murky waters of childhood and adolescence. Our heroine and tour guide is a remarkable young girl named Annie Bartlett who can only be described as the girl Scout Finch would have become had Atticus been an irresponsible, womanizing S.O.B.. Annie draws us into her amazingly vivid world on Widow lake in a small central Florida town back when it really was a small world after all. Despite her father's \\"rules of the lake\\" she learns all about the dangers of diving alone into the unknown waters of love and betrayal, dreams and harsh reality, mermaids and drag queens, death and rebirth. She reminds us how it feels to run through summer days and nights utterly defenseless against both joy and sorrow. Through a uniquely structured series of \\"connected stories\\" Annie's memories flow across the pages the way memories are meant to, not in neat chapters, but in vivid images and epiphanies. Annie's nameless fears drift like sudden cold shadows just beneath the surface of Widow Lake, but the mermaids are waiting there too, if you only have the faith to close your eyes and hold your breath. Rules of the Lake is a finely crafted piece of storytelling with totally engaging characters and an extraordinarily vivid sense of place. It resonates with humor and hope and the mysteries that always drift just beneath the surface."},{"Title":"Rules of the Lake: Stories","review":"Irene Zeigler's &quot;Rules of the Lake&quot; is written with a clean, simple style which goes hand in hand with the subjects the author has chosen. More elaborate prose would spoil the rural nature of these stories, and Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings did something similar in &quot;Cross Creek.&quot; But unlike Rawlings, Ms. Zeigler's narrative never becomes precious. It's a look into the past from a contemporary and adult perspective. The stories involve Annie, a preteen girl living on a lake in rural Florida. Annie watches her older sister, Leigh, experiencing adolescent angst, only to find herself suddenly facing it as well. Annie and Leigh's father is a central figure, equally charming and inept in both his relationships with his daughters and his various brainstorms which rarely amount to anything.My favorite of the 13 stories is &quot;The Raft,&quot; and its companion piece, &quot;The Stranger.&quot; In these two tales, Ms. Ziegler fascinates her readers with a balance of power between the sexes. In &quot;The Raft,&quot; Annie challenges a neighbor boy, Petey, to a swimming race. If she loses, she agrees to strip naked for him. Annie knows that she is more than capable of beating Petey, and so totally controls him. Yet she remains vulnerable to the siren song of compassion and sexual attraction. Ms. Zeigler creates a situation that is filled with feminine power, yet allows Aniie to give young Petey a thrill that's both visceral and vicarious at the same time. In &quot;The Stranger,&quot; she subtly shifts the balance of power in Petey's favor. Now more mature, Petey is in far more control of Annie than in the previous story. But after a short time in her presence, she has a palpable impact. By the end of the story, they have a whole new relationship that's built on the foundation of the old and a promise for the future."},{"Title":"Rules of the Lake: Stories","review":"I can't believe how close I came to missing out on this wonderful book. I checked it out of the library and started reading it the day it was due, thinking, &quot;I'll give it a page, then it's outtahere.&quot; I paid the late fee. Ziegler has created in Annie Bartlett one of the most poignant, hilarious and beautifully crafted characters I have ever met and plunks her down in a setting so seductive, nostalgic and rich I can't wait to go back there to breathe underwater again, and experience Annie's imagined transformation into a mermaid.

For many of us those words conjure up the opening scene of the commercials for the Olympic games, but for me, they will certainly invoke memories of Patricia McLinn's newest emotionally charged romance THE GAMES.McLinn has brilliantly put together a multiple cast of lively characters from Amy, the youngest, looking for her first touch of glory; to Tess, her coach, whose memories of past glory held bittersweet feelings of betrayal; and Andrei who looked for forgiveness from the one woman he could never forget. Some were strangers to one another but in the end, Rikki, Lanny, Kyle, Nan, Rob; all found and were strengthened by the bond of friendships that grew during the competition.Whether athlete or spectator you will find THE GAMES to be a wonderfully emotional rollercoaster ride of human drama in a behind the scenes look at the Olympics. Written with invigorating, breathtaking passion, I found myself jumping up and cheering for the wins, and sobbing out loud during the defeats. While the behind look at the competition was fabulous, I certainly don't want to overlook mentioning the sensual romance aspect that will also have you cheering, sighing, and all choked up throughout this wonderfully compelling read. This is an exceptional read, a winner worthy of the gold, and one I highly recommend!"},{"Title":"The Games","review":"I was holding on to my copy of Patricia McLinn's book THE GAMES to read next week while the Olympics are on.

An actual romance with a great current storyline was a definite plus! As an avid outdoors woman I could relate to the characters and their competitive nature, loved the book!!"},{"Title":"The Games","review":"Just in time for 06 Winter Games comes a book that affords the reader a behind-the-scenes look at what it might be like off the ice and off the mountain. This romance spins more than just the stories of relationships. The Games interweaves the emotions of love, competition, betrayal and friendship as it tells the story of loves past and new against a backdrop of international competition.The tension experienced by the reader will not just be of the sexual variety between characters. I felt my pulse racing as the athletes I came to care about competed. The peeks inside the world of world-class competition will give the reader a new perspective on what it must be like when years of training and perseverance come down to one final game, four minutes on the ice or the steadiness of a hand.If you are a fan of the Olympics, this a must read. And if you read just for the romance, you will not be disappointed either.Jerilyn Willin"},{"Title":"Sticky","review":"I really enjoy it, was hot and nice having this book on my hands.

Despite having been written by a professional writer, this book difficult to read. Unlike Studs Terkel, the author rarely quotes those he interviews, but tells their stories for them; his sensibility is the hero of every vignette. A related problem is his point-of-view. Although he finds it unfair that enlisted men to have to pay the army to learn a trade before discharge, he lauds their having been given the opportunity, but never contemplates that some might be capable of going to university. His point-of-view, ever upper class, assumes workers and farmers should be helped, but remain in their place. Although concerned about suffering, unemployment and fair play, his concern is intellectual & lacks emotion. While aloofness and filtering may be typically British, they make for difficult reading. Some have suggested that his non-fiction sounds fictional, as if he's making up what he's describing--a point he mentions and takes pains to refute. Inadvertently, his book reveals as much about his own attitudes as it does about those who are out of work. Despite such foibles, this book is an interesting documentary of English workers and farmers in the time between the wars. It may not entertain the general reader, but might provide background to those who study History, Industrial Relations, or Twentieh Century British Literature."},{"Title":"Die in Plain Sight : A Novel of Suspense (LOWELL, ELIZABETH)","review":"I listened to the tape.

The potential was definately there with a good basic plot of suspense and murder, but no surprises and therefore not much suspense. Romance between Lacey and Ian was never more than lukewarm. No big sparks between the characters and all the romance of watching paint dry. There is no challenge to the relationship, which is unusual considering it is Elizabeth Lowell and the relationship struggle is what I really enjoy about her previous books. I want the struggle to live happily every after with a true soul mate. All the hot romance, misunderstandings, trust issues, suspenseful plots with twists and turns were missing from this latest effort. Would the real Elizabeth Lowell please come back?

Instead she finds that her grandfather was a forger. Forgeries or not, though, someone wants those painting--especially the paintings showing violent deaths. When handsome bodyguard/art appraiser Ian Lapstrake shows up--chemistry flares between himself and Lacey. He knows that she is hiding a secret--but what he doesn't know is that that secret is about to put both of them into serious trouble.With incredible luck, Lacey, Ian, and Susa end up painting at the same exact spot where a fatal car accident once took place--and it turns out that the 'accident' was the subject of one of grandfather's paintings--except that in the painting, it was murder. And someone is willing to do anything to get their hands on that murder painting, even if it means murdering again.Author Elizabeth Lowell blends sex with intrigue to keep the reader turning pages. An excessive reliance on coincidence, the hackneyed rich family who runs the local police department plot, protagonists who won't guess what the reader will guess by page twenty, and a fundamentally implausible story line weaken the novel, however. As long as Lacey and Ian are in bed--or in painting table or anywhere else making love--the story flies. When it comes to mystery, there isn't much there."},{"Title":"Die in Plain Sight : A Novel of Suspense (LOWELL, ELIZABETH)","review":"This was a hand me down book from my MIL so it was not purchased.

I have to agree with other reviewers that mentioned the chemistry between any of the characters isn't well developed which makes it harder to believe. I read quickly because I wanted to know how the mystery unfolded itself but as the story moves on you can tell one of the twists easily.

Each of the characters was well-developed and easy to follow through out the story. The relationship between the main characters built a bit quickly (reminiscent of most romance novels,) but it was well defined and the interaction between the characters was fun to follow.The mystery (the reason I picked up the book in the first place) was interesting and the ending was excellent, if a tiny bit predictable.All in all, I look forward to reading more of Lowell's novels, and was happy to learn that there is a series based on Susa's family."},{"Title":"Die in Plain Sight : A Novel of Suspense (LOWELL, ELIZABETH)","review":"I loved this story.

Everything is centered in this 'Moreno County' but it doesnt exist! the author uses real city names, like Laguna Beach and Corona Del Mar, and Newport Beach and supposedly this Savoy Ranch is right here with them, but these cities are in ORANGE county. Why not keep your story geographically consistant? Furthermore, there is no place amidst these cities in Orange/Moreno County for a place like Savoy Ranch to realistically exist. If the story were set somewhere north up the coast, it would be more plausible. Why would she do this? Did she not visit/study the area before writing this little Gem? It makes the story that much less believable. Furthermore, MORENO Valley is certainly a place, and is located in the desert -- so, for someone who lives in southern california, who knows how completely WRONG it all is, it's really hard to keep any sort of an accurate picture in my head while reading.Ok. that is all."},{"Title":"Die in Plain Sight : A Novel of Suspense (LOWELL, ELIZABETH)","review":"The book \\"Die In Plain Sight\\" arrived very quickly; the book is in perfect shape, not markings or folded pages.

Upon his death, she inherits all the beautiful landscapes he had done along with paintings depicting gruesome scenes of murder. As striking and masterful works, David's paintings also create quite a stir when Lacey submits three of them to be appraised by renowned artist, Susa Donovan, while at a charity benefit auction.Ian Lapstrake is taken by Lacey at their first meeting at her shop, Lost Treasures Found - a combination antique store and second hand shop. When he sees Lacey at the benefit, he is even more intrigued when La Susa is certain they have been painted by another artist, causing Lacey to question whether her grandfather was really a forger. And why do these paintings cause the wealthy and influential Forrester family to sit up and take notice of a heretofore-unknown artist? Do they hold the key to three mysterious deaths from over 40 years ago?Suddenly, Lacey and Ian find themselves barely escaping from the mysterious fire at her shop and soon after they are also investigating the theft of not only Susa's paintings she'd done for the auction but also the theft of Lacey's grandfather's paintings. The attraction between Ian and Lacey is strong, hot and instantaneous. The romance starts early in the book and doesn't let up until the very last page. Ian is definitely alpha but he isn't domineering - although he knows that Lacey is in danger, he and Lacey work together to find out the who's, what's and why's of these puzzling events."},{"Title":"Die in Plain Sight : A Novel of Suspense (LOWELL, ELIZABETH)","review":"Cardboard characters, an improbable and poorly-developed plot, and a predictable ending mar what could have been an intriguing story of dirty deeds in the California art world. It's possible that Lowell knows something about art, or at least did a bit of research--the parts of the story that discussed art, and the art world along the California coast, were the most plausible and interesting.Unfortunately, both plot and characters failed to live up to their setting. The plot depends greatly on the protagonist's concealing the truth about who painted the pictures that attract so much (sometimes unsavory) interest. The reasons given for that secrecy, however, are so far-fetched as to be ludicrous. Her dad is angling for a judgeship and doesn't want his father's bad art associated with his name? And she buys this reason? And when she discovers that the unsigned paintings are actually very good and appear to be painted by a well-known deceased artist (although she knows her grandfather painted them), she assumes that they're forgeries? As do the well-known artist Susa and her bodyguard? Sorry, but it's only a forgery if you try to pass it off as an original. There's nothing particularly shameful about paintings done in the style of somebody else.The rest of the plot is almost equally improbable. Paintings that are \\"obviously\\" paintings of real murders? The paintings must have been a lot more realistic than this plot.And did I mention the cardboard characters? Take one attractive, charming, mysteriously unappreciated young woman who thinks she's ugly because she has a bad haircut. Add a tough-but-tender man who's somehow failed with every woman until now, and it's lust at first sight. Throw in a famous artist who's actually a warm and loving family woman, and stir well with a host of greedy, scheming powerful people who for all their wealth have but one emotion each. Half bake in a 360 degree coastal panorama. Place on shelf to cool and go read an art book.Why, you ask, if it's this bad, did I give this two stars instead of only one? Because I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and felt nostalgic at the descriptions of the coast. So I gave it an extra star for its setting. After all, it could have been worse. It could have been set in Lodi. (\\"Oh Lord, Stuck in Lodi Again\\")"},{"Title":"Die in Plain Sight : A Novel of Suspense (LOWELL, ELIZABETH)","review":"This book was definetly not one of her best.

I should have just waited for the paperback."},{"Title":"Die in Plain Sight : A Novel of Suspense (LOWELL, ELIZABETH)","review":"In California, renowned artist Susa Donavon will paint a canvas in front of an audience. Her work will be auctioned as part of raising money for the Friends of Moreno County. Additionally Susa will appraise any works brought in by patrons of the arts with the money raised also donated to the Friends of Moreno County.Art buyer and artist Lacey Quinn brings in paintings done by her late grandfather in the 1920s for Susa to evaluate. Susa feels that the works owned by Lacey are from highly regarded plein air artist Lewis Marten. Though she doubts it, Lacey, already interested in the life of her relative, cannot resist researching the darker portrayals of murder, but soon finds evidence that the homicides occurred and that history repeats itself.Insight into the California art scene adds a taste of reality to a suspense-laden tale. The heroine is a delight as she seeks her place feeling like the outsider in her family especially when compared to her two siblings. The murder mystery is thirty plus years old with frozen tundra trails yet Lacey relatively easily solves them, which takes credibility away from a well written fun story that readers will still value.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Die in Plain Sight : A Novel of Suspense (LOWELL, ELIZABETH)","review":"Unlike a lot of readers (make that reviewers) I love this reader and all of her books.

Wonderful story, exciting and Lacey and Ian were just wonderful...kept me turning the pages!! And having Rarieties back is the best!!"},{"Title":"Die in Plain Sight : A Novel of Suspense (LOWELL, ELIZABETH)","review":"I read this book very carefully because I thought it was a real mystery and I might need the clues in the early part of the book later. Actually, it did not make any difference as the book did not make any sense. I have three major problems with this book. 1. It happens too fast. The love story between Ian and Lacey develops too fast. The relationship between Susa, the mentor, and Lacey, the student, happens too quick. Even the remarriage or Rory and his ex-wife happens too fast. Why does this have to be a speed story? It only makes it silly. Adding a few more weeks to story would make it deeper and more interesting. 2. I knew who the mystery artist was from the beginning. No mystery there. And when it was finally revealed it made no sense. He did not seem crazy, or deranged, or obsessed. So why did he keep his identity secret for 40 years? 3. The ending was a real let down. Again, we had too many unnecessary characters who did not really add to the story during the book and were not brought back in at the end. What happened to Shayla, the partner? The business was totalled. What happened to the Pickfords when the property was finally divided? They were family. What happened to Angelique? She mad a merger in the works. Why did we need to spend time reading about these people if they were not going to make a difference in the story? And, most importantly, what happens to the mystery artist once he was finally unmasked?Bottom line... skip it. Too long... too silly. And the sex isn't even that hot. I agree with the reviewer who thinks this may have been a short story that was (unsuccessfully) expanded into a novel simply by adding a few subplots instead of developing the main one."},{"Title":"Die in Plain Sight : A Novel of Suspense (LOWELL, ELIZABETH)","review":"I have been a fan of Elizabeth Lowell since the Donovan series, and followed the Rarities series which came after. I have read all of them so far and have to say that &quot;Die in Plain Sight&quot; was a much better read than its predecessor in the Rarities series, &quot;Running Scared.&quot;First off, the lead couple were much more enjoyable and the focus on the romance can be seen in this book. The mutual attraction between Ian and Lacey grows throughout the book, and Lacey was much more fleshed out, especially when her family dynamic is introduced, which is important to the storyline. Altogether, she was a likable heroine. The hero was likable also, yet their was less characterization for him as a whole. In reading many of Ms. Lowell's books, you see a pattern in almost all her heroes (intelligent, stubborn, alpha males with some kind of past working law enforcement or for the government.) Dont get me wrong, their is nothing wrong with that, but in order to make the character stick out, some vulnerabilities, some quirks need to be added that differentiates the hero from other characters. For me, Ian did not really stand out, he seems recycled somehow, a cut and paste type character.I though the mystery was pretty good too, and although you are not too surprised to find who the &quot;bad guy(s)&quot; were, their are one or two interesting twists to the book and for me the lead up to the end (the path the protagonists have to take in order for the finale) was what I enjoyed more. However, I felt the ending was a little rushed and could have used at least one more chapter in order to clean up the loose ends, in order to get a better sense of closure.The focus on Impressionist Art was well played out and again Ms. Lowell does her research. And the introduction of Susa Donovan, and old character from her other books, was a surprising and not to unwelcome one.All in all, not a bad romantic suspense novel by Elizabeth Lowell, much better than the second Rarities book, &quot;Running Scared.&quot; She incorporated both romance and suspense more evenly this time. But it simply lacked something, although the story and romance were not to bad. To truly read the author at her best in romantic suspense, I would recommend her Donovan series: Amber Beach, Jade Island, Pearl Cove and Midnight in Ruby Bayou."},{"Title":"Die in Plain Sight : A Novel of Suspense (LOWELL, ELIZABETH)","review":"The writing was okay. I've read worse stories. The characters were not great. That was probably my biggest problem with the story. None of the characters had even the slightest ring of truth to them. Ian Lapstrake was the phoniest male protagonist I've seen in quite some time. Completely unbelievable. Almost romance novel caliber. In fact, the entire book has the feel of a romance novel that has been repackaged for wider appeal. Unfortunately, it fell well short of that appeal."},{"Title":"Die in Plain Sight : A Novel of Suspense (LOWELL, ELIZABETH)","review":"I, too, enjoyed the 3 characters of Ian, Susa and the protagonist, whose name escapes just now.

It's not a keeper."},{"Title":"Die in Plain Sight : A Novel of Suspense (LOWELL, ELIZABETH)","review":"I love Elizabeth Lowell's novels, especially those featuring the Donovan family, with its Alpha-males and super talented women. I hoped that \\"Die In Plain Sight,\\" with Donavan matriarch Susa as a major character, would be on par with \\"Jade Island,\\" \\"Amber Beach,\\" and \\"Midnight on Ruby Bayou.\\" Unfortunately, it is not. I have been disappointed in Ms. Lowell's last few books and that's a real shame, as she has long been a favorite writer. I'm not about to give up on her though. She has given me much enjoyment over the years and I am sure she still has many terrific stories to tell and dynamic new characters to reveal.Artist Lacy Quinn's grandfather bequeathed all his paintings to her upon his death. There are extraordinary landscapes and other, more disturbing canvasses depicting violence and death. Grandfather and granddaughter had an exceptionally close relationship, from the time she was a little girl and first began to show interest in art and painting until the man's death at a fairly young age. Lacy is different from her wealthy, society family - more at home painting in jeans than dancing in designer gowns. Her grandfather was a black sheep of sorts - so the two found comfort and inspiration in each others company. Lacy is determined to show famous artist Susa Donovan her grandfather's work and have it evaluated when she discovers Ms. Donovan will be in town to support a charity event. Lacy's parents, especially her father, warn her that bringing the old paintings to the public's attention might stir up some disagreeable truths, old rumors, that are best left alone. Lacy agrees to present the work under an assumed name so no one will identity it with the Quinn family - especially since the paintings are all unsigned. Standing in line, waiting for her turn with Susa, Lacy meets hunky Ian Lapstrake, an employee of Rarities Unlimited, Donovan friend and Susa's temporary bodyguard. Ian is smitten at first glance with the sexy, sassy young artist with the curly auburn hair. Also at first glance, Susa realizes the value and high quality of the paintings Lacy has brought. In fact, she believes she knows the artist. Ian is aware that Lacy is using an assumed name and offers his assistance to discover the long hidden secrets behind the artwork and a series of unexplained deaths that had been ruled accidental.Now don't get me wrong. The novel is worth reading. The plot is engaging, although it plods at times, detracting from both the mystery and the romance. The characters, as always, are well developed and interesting, but not as outstanding as usual. I hope the author does better with her next effort.JANA"},{"Title":"Die in Plain Sight : A Novel of Suspense (LOWELL, ELIZABETH)","review":"Die in Plain Sight is a mystery/suspense novel with quite a bit of romance thrown in. The focus on California high society and the conflict within a rich family reminded me of the TV series Dallas and other evening soaps. There is also a fairly in-depth look at the contemporary art scene. Elizabeth Lowell is either an artist herself or did quite a bit of research for the novel. Unfortunately, these elements don't always gel and the book, while compelling in places, drags at times. The story is quite complex, spanning several generations and many characters. It took me a while to get all of the names and families straight; listening to the book on tape probably made this more difficult, as with a printed book you can more easily backtrack and look up tidbits you may have missed. The book is quite ambitious in this regard, and is set up to be a sort of epic. It does not really have the content to fulfill this ambition, however. One thing that I found a little distracting was that the point of view frequently changes from one character to another. Giving the reader access to the thoughts and feelings of characters who turn out to be relatively minor can be frustrating.Lacey Quinn is an artist and the owner of an antique shop. Her socialite parents do not understand her or approve of her career choice. The one family member who she could relate to was her deceased grandfather, who was also an artist; he may also have been a forger. Lacey meets the mandatory tall, dark and handsome hero in the person of Ian Lapstrake (do people outside romance novels and soap operas have names like Lacey Quinn and Ian Lapstrake?). Ian works for a security company that specializes in evaluating and protecting works of art. Together they uncover an ever-murkier past that suggests that Lacey's grandfather may have been a murderer as well as a forger. To make matters worse, someone is stalking Lacey and warning her to stop asking questions.I enjoyed parts of the book, but found some of it a little repetitive. There is also a fairly strong leaning towards the romantic/sexual aspect of the story. The novel is probably geared more to female readers, which may explain some of my impatience with it. But I don't really like the idea of books (or movies) that are aimed mainly at one gender. The final few chapters seemed hurried after all of the build-up. One minute we are in the midst of a bewildering maze of danger, mystery and confusion, the next everything is wrapped up in a neat package. I admired the attention to detail Lowell gives to the art scene in California. She also seems to have something of a bird's eye view of the mannerisms of the upper class, or at least one subculture within in. A mostly good read, but the story could have used some tightening up and some of the characters could have been more fully developed."},{"Title":"Die in Plain Sight : A Novel of Suspense (LOWELL, ELIZABETH)","review":"\\"Die in Plain Sight\\" was the second Elizabeth Lowell I read. The first, \\"The Color of Death\\" was very good, and I was hoping for more of the same.What I got was a fluffy piece with no suspense, no real drama, and characters that were so incredibly superficial they were nearly transparent. The hero in particular is hard to believe, given he is flawless in strengths, smarts and looks it makes him not very interesting to read. Even if he had a scar or SOMETHING that made him a little more tangible, it would have helped.The heroine, a zany new-ager painting prodigy, stumbles through life as a victim of happenstance. Her adventure is a jumble of hastily thrown together occurrences which happen to end with her being the prot&eacute;g&eacute; of a famous and beloved painter and engaged to the man of her dreams. Never did a character in a book have to work so little to achieve so much.A disappointment for sure."},{"Title":"Die in Plain Sight : A Novel of Suspense (LOWELL, ELIZABETH)","review":"I truly enjoyed Ian and Lacy, but something lacked in this story. I will say that the story line that has been appearing in your Rarities Series are starting to sound predictable which leaves the reader disappointed. I will try to stay an avid reader of yours, but lately it&#65533;s been hard to shell out the extra bucks for hardcover that leave me rather unsatisfied."},{"Title":"Die in Plain Sight : A Novel of Suspense (LOWELL, ELIZABETH)","review":"Before this I read Lowell's The Wrong Hostage and enjoyed it. This, however, was dreadful. Pointless, inert and populated with cardboard characters. The publisher had to know how putred this was, but I guess they wanted to make a buck and avoid pissing off a lucrative author."},{"Title":"Die in Plain Sight : A Novel of Suspense (LOWELL, ELIZABETH)","review":"I got one-quarter through this book, and just couldn't endure it any longer. The plot moved at a snail's pace. Pages and pages were devoted to mundane events. The dialogue, especially that of Ian and Lacey, was incredibly hokey. Also, after the previous books painted Susa as this impressive, sophisticated woman, I found her portrayal in this book to be rather banal. Anyway, I have no idea how the book turns out, and I don't care. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Duo: Violin and Piano","review":"this dates from Carter's Middle period; the works after the massive \\"Concerto for Orchestra\\"and the upcoming :Third String Quartet:; this \\"Duo\\" for Violin and Piano reveals that you need to locate a new context if you want the genre itself to speak to you, otherwise you resort to nefarious predictable approaches as engaging the styles of Neo this or Neo that, and when you think of the countless Violin modern Sonatas that have been written,idly boring stuff. I would think you would want the genre not to be a deadend, and it has certainly the Beo-Romantic literature pummeled the Sonata genre into the ground,with Hindemith,Poulenc,Milhaud,Rorem.Carter here directly wants a situation where he is dealing with timbre,timbre exposed in and by-itself rather than utilizing the already given expressive shapes of this genre,and to manipulate and explore the unique characteristics of the two instruments and set up a situation where the two can be developed along fairly interesting lines of complexity, opacity and communication if possible. He allows only certain intervals to appear in each part,as a way of fixing the field of play, giving the instruments like a shape of unique colour; for example the Violin is dominated,saturated with the intervals m2,M3,tritones,P5,M6 and m7th fairly resonant producing materials,with double stops; the piano is burdened with M2,m3,P4,also tritone,m6 and M7th, there is also a Fixed Octave scheme established in the first 83 measures of the work, the tones(beginning on the g below Middle C),g,a,c,d,eb,f,ab,b,c3,e,f#,g,a,c,d,eb,f,ab,b. The rhythmic utilizations as well plays a role in defining the characteristics of the instrument, so the Violin has more a soloistic demeanor,anarchic, free with tied over the bar tones, more asymmetrical units displayed, against the sometimes more predictable percussive piano.The piano is utilized very much as in the earlier :Sonata for Violoncello and Piano:,like a time keeper/retainer, a walking bass or Baroque Trio basso continuo. You really cannot say there is accompaniment here merely another part. Carter also morvelously utilizes differign arrays of articulations in the piano, something you will find later in his \\"Night Fantasies\\", and \\"90+\\" for piano solo.The genre of the Violin and Piano is a well trodden, well reserfed for serious discourse in some respects, with Arnold Schoenberg's \\"Fantasy for Violin and Piano, one of the last works he wrote in the early Fifties.Also Milton Babbitt's \\"Joy of Sextetts\\", and \\"More Joy\\".The solo Violin genre as we travel past these times has not faired much better with Boulez's disappointing \\"Anthemes\\" utilzing antiphonal dimensions with very little to exploit or reveal or say, and Nono's weakest work of his innovative late period, the \\"Lontano. . . for two violins with also antiphonal handlings."},{"Title":"Ged Exercises: Language Arts - Writing (Steck-Vaughn GED)","review":"I don't always like their explanations, but this is a &#34;get ready for the test&#34; text.

I disagree with the professional review that found the characters \\"sermonizing\\"and that it bogged it down. My ideal Christian fiction is that which challenges me in my own walk. One thing I particularly liked about this series was the richness of the secondary characters. I also found the epilogue to be just the right closure to the book. The reason I give it a 4 instead of 5 is that I found the main character Jen a littlebland."},{"Title":"Heart of the Sandhills (Dakota Moons Series #3)","review":"Whitson's third book is hard to read due to lack of continuity. I love the characters and the historical part of the entire series, so I was interested enough to keep plugging away in spite of difficulty with the flow.Genevieve Blue Eyes is married to Daniel Two Stars and they find themselves in a tiny little rental on land that used to be theirs. Neighbors do not want &quot;those wild Indians&quot; living near them and make life miserable, culminating in a very, very intense encounter for Genevieve.As a war breaks out, Daniel serves as guide for the Army and little Aaron whom we met as a small boy in earlier books, has enlisted as a &quot;junior&quot; recruit. It is during this war that Daniel Two Stars faces one of the biggest challenges of his life and his marriage. The ending does somewhat make up for the hit and miss writing of the book, and since I am such a fan of Stephanie Grace Whitson, I would definitely buy the next book if there is to be one."},{"Title":"Discovering the Body: A Novel","review":"This book is much better than a typical murder mystery, offering not only suspense but also a nuanced portrait of the grief and fear that follow a murder. Howard's novel takes a lot of surprising twists and turns, yet always remains plausible. The main character, Linda, is an interesting heroine; she is neither damsel in distress nor crime expert. Thankfully, the book doesn't get bogged down in macabre details like so many recent mysteries, but the threat of danger throughout the novel was enough to make me keep the light on all night."},{"Title":"Discovering the Body: A Novel","review":"I couldn't stop reading Discovering the Body until I had finished it -- at three in the morning! I was taken in at once by the tensions among the characters -- by Linda Garbo's self doubt about her role as a murder witness and her certainty that there was someone \\"out there\\" observing her, waiting for her to make a false move. I was even more intrigued by her relationship with the murder victim Luci Cole. The two women had a bond based on Luci's need to depend on Linda and Linda's need to be needed, but their friendship had not gone very deep until it was too late. Remembering Luci, Linda comes to see how she failed her in many ways and may even have precipitated her murder. Luci's journal, like those of Anaas Nin, is an enigmatic blend of truth-telling and invention. The journal may or may not reveal the truth about Luci's life during the days before she died, and Linda's eagerness to treat the journal entries as if they were testimony add to the suspense as she closes in on the person she thinks is the killer. Linda realizes as the story unfolds that she has barely seen beneath the surfaces of most of the people around her. Luci was surely more complex, more troubled, than Linda had ever realized. Other townspeople, too, are barely appreciated by Linda until she starts investigating Luci's murder. Judy is Linda's opposite in many ways, a good friend against whom Linda can play off her suspicions. Other characters are equally well developed: Charlie, John Bender, Tess, Bill Allard. The minister, Reverend Gus, is an especially interesting character. One of Howard's strengths is dialog which reveals much more than characters realize they are giving away. I didn't see the ending coming at all, and found it very satisfying -- complicated and absolutely earned by all the detail that preceded it. All in all, this is a fine novel."},{"Title":"Discovering the Body: A Novel","review":"Mary Howard's thoughtful mystery, &quot;Discovering the Body&quot;, is carefully crafted and requires the reader to pay close attention. The narrator, Linda, is an artist who notices lines, colors, details. She is remarkably observant about outer details, but is uninformed, even naive, about inner details, about the emotional component of situations, about the true feelings of people. In these pages, we follow her inward journey as she learns more about the people of her small Iowa town. In the process she learns more about herself and how she is perceived by others. As Howard's tale unfolds, some mysteries are revealed. Other matters are left ambiguous. Howard's book, in the style of Ruth Rendell, makes demands on the reader: Some &quot;facts&quot; must be inferred, and other surprising facts must be assimiliated into the general plot. &quot;Discovering the Body&quot; is not a quick, toss-away pleasure, but it offers satisfaction to the patient reader."},{"Title":"Discovering the Body: A Novel","review":"With Discovering the Body, Mary Howard has created a very literate suspense novel. While many suspense and mystery novels are formulaic and the language seems designed to appeal to the least common denominator, Howard defies tradition and creates a well written novel with fully developed characters. Because of this, the novel moves more slowly than many typical suspense novels but the experience seems to run a little deeper than most as well. The action is slow and the revelations are few and far between but this does not count against the novel as a whole. If you're tired of formulaic suspense novels or mysteries, try Discovering the Body. And if you're a fan of well written fiction, you'll like it as well."},{"Title":"Discovering the Body: A Novel","review":"I certainly beg to disagree with Pavluvcik's review of this novel and I hope that others will not be so easily discouraged by it. Mary Howard is a fine writer, with a subtle turn of mind and phrase. If you are looking for a quick-paced, mindless plot with lots of action, then look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for a novel with a psychological twist on the meaning of memory and desire, &quot;truth&quot; and the way we all fit into our worlds, then this is the book for you. Try it!"},{"Title":"Discovering the Body: A Novel","review":"Linda Garbo comes home to find her friend Luci Cole dead on the kitchen floor with her throat slashed and a bloody knife lying close to the body. She believes she has seen the murderer and her testimony leads to neighbor Peter Garvey's conviction, even though he claimed that he didn't do it.The murder and it's aftermath throw Linda and Luci's lover, beekeeper Charlie Carpenter together and they marry two years after the trial. Then local reporter John Bender, who believes Garvey was wrongly convicted, talks Linda into meeting with the man she testified against. Garvey, who has admitted that he was Luci's spurned lover, casts doubts into Linda's mind about whether or not she got it right when she testified against him.Linda starts investigating Luci's life, determined to vindicate herself. However she's soon confronted by the knowledge that she knows little about who her friend was and as she sifts the evidence, she gradually concedes her identification of Luci's killer was a mistake and her effort to find out the truth places her own life in danger.Mary Howard has written an engrossing and complex psychological thriller that kept my up till dawn. I liked it very much and I think you will too."},{"Title":"Discovering the Body: A Novel","review":"Each sentence is carefully crafted, each sentence gives me a clear sense of place and character, each sentence leads me to wonder and question what will happen next -- all that means a &quot;great read&quot; to me. My biggest problem was that I wanted to flip to the end to see what happened because the suspense build-up was incredible. I didn't do that and don't you do it either because you'll miss too much of an intriguing story!"},{"Title":"Discovering the Body: A Novel","review":"I read the other reviews about this book which inspires a lively debate and opinions that are poles apart. After reading Mary Howard's debut novel, I confess to being of two minds! This thriller explores primarily the hazardous process of memory as a tool of evidence. On a hot, summer afternoon just outside a small, dusty town, artist Linda Garbo discovers the body of friend Luci, sprawled in the blood-drenched kitchen of her home. Her recollection of the events leading to this discovery helps convict neighbour Peter Garvey of the murder. But Linda, who subsequently married Luci's boyfriend and, oddly, lives in the house where the crime took place, has nagging doubts about Garvey's guilt. So does a local newspaper reporter. They become wary allies on the path to solving the mystery. In the beginning we know little of the murder victim's life, but by the end of the book a complex portrait has been drawn of a wayward, brutalised soul, as her personal diary is placed into Linda's hands and another powerful set of memories is revealed. Her diary implicates family and the residents in a small town which seems to be a hotbed of crime, perversion and paranoia. Any number of people had reasons to kill Luci. Howard spares adjectives and relies on resonant simplicity. Some of the time it works well and her writing is vibrantly alive in Luci's diary. However, I did find some passages woodenly constructed, as if Howard had tried too hard to pare her writing back. Where I expected suspense, there was a void. Linda's relationship with husband Charlie lacked credibility. However this is still a page-turning thriller that will serve well for holiday fare."},{"Title":"Discovering the Body: A Novel","review":"This novel is beauifully written and highly suspenseful. The characters are so well developed that every suspect is a sympathetic character -- which adds greatly to the suspense. I couldn't stop reading it! Howard is writing in the tradition of Dorothy Sayers and Ngaio Marsh. This is not what I call the &quot;salted peanut, throw-away&quot; type mystery, but rather a compelling novel about memory, envy, and denial. I recommend it to any reader who enjoys vivid language, memorable characters, and dramatic tension."},{"Title":"Discovering the Body: A Novel","review":"&quot;The suspense builds from the first pages of Mary Howard's debut novel--a book so sure handed and graceful that you might forget it's a murder mystery...Howard creates an intricate cast of characters, any one of whom might have killed the artistic, flirtatious victim. Strong dialogue gives us insight into the shifting relationships here, and into Linda's marriage to Charlie, Luci's boyfriend at the time of the murder. Charlie thinks Linda is being paranoid. But the reader shares her increasing uncertainty about her friends, and her facts.&quot;"},{"Title":"Discovering the Body: A Novel","review":"A fairly good mystery story, about the traumatic aftermath of a young woman's discovery of her murdered friend's body. The writing seems deliberately pared down, perhaps an attempt to re-create in prose the seeming simplicity of small-town Iowa life. Right up until the end, I didn't know who the culprit was, so I guess that's a sign that the plot was well-constructed, although the text is actually rather slow-moving, and somehow the revelation of who committed the murder didn't quite add up.For me, the best part of the novel had little to do with the unfolding of the plot-- what I found fascinating and revealing was the diary the author constructed for the murdered Luci, a disturbed, promiscuous woman. I've never understood how any woman can have sex with men to whom she's not attracted, and not enjoy it at all, yet continue compulsively to \\"sleep around.\\" Luci's diary entries, read by the protagonist after Luci's murder, describe the satisfaction Luci takes in flirting with and seducing a succession of men, the sense of power it gives her that has nothing to do with sexual satisfaction, and the way such behavior confirms her own self-loathing. Those insights were more interesting than the actual plot."},{"Title":"Discovering the Body: A Novel","review":"Discovering The Body is not what it is portrayed to be. I was ready for a \\"gripping, psychological suspense\\" novel but I was sorely disappointed.

I call it awful and would not waste my time reading it.I \\"struggled\\" through this book, and I only finished it because I was curious on seeing where it was trying to go.

I thought I was reading something an adolescent wrote - the style was not mature or sophisticated at all. There was absolutely no psychological suspense to this book at all. There is no depth, or passion or power to this debut novel. And no, this novel will not haunt you with its' beauty because there is no beauty contained anywhere in this book.I am a voracious reader, but this book is the first book that I have read that never ever lived up to its book jacket \\"thrilling\\" description.

I kept hearing wonderful things about and was all set to have it sent right away. . .until I read Pavluvcik's review. Strange, isn't it: no matter how many good things we hear about a book, the negative things really stick, maybe even determine whether we choose to read a book or not. I always tell my middle school students to temper their negative comments about books with the thought that some other reader might disagree with them, but I guess such niceties have no place in the cyberspace book club.

Most maps are Manhattan only, and I needed detailed coverage of the wider area to consider some commuting/apartment-hunting issues. Other maps are made from dreadfully old drawings -- when you see those sharp new images in travel guides etc, they are dramatically more readable and clearly drawn than the ancient looking draftings in most of the map books I looked at. Other maps don't offer enough perspective--all close-up detail, but no &quot;big picture&quot; pages to give you a sense for how they hook up. Finally, most books have a lousy format--hard to hold open, or poor binding, etc.This book at least covers the 5-boroughs, but totally excludes the nearby NJ areas, Westchester or Nassau. It also doesn't offer enough big picture regional info-- the subway map is Manhattan-only, the regional highway map doesn't offer a close-up of how to get in/out of Manhattan, there are no &quot;medium-scale&quot; maps that show how the huge chunks of ultra-detailed Queens all link together. The drafting is old but pretty readable. They chose odd landmarks to put in and exclude. The book is sturdy enough, but the giant spiral binding ruins the middle section of every page! There is surely a more elegant way to lay out the map around the spiral. Good luck finding Little Italy intersections or downtown Brooklyn addresses or many other key locations.

Not only is the story rich in style and characters, it potrays a very REAL, believeable shero ((Female hero, not to be confused with a hapless heroine)). Ariel's inner struggles with her husband's unwillingness to love her, her budding self assurance, and her age old mentality of having been a slave all war with her quiet desperation to free her one love from his prison of self-doubt. Yet the book isn't as much about her quest as it is the change she undergoes, becoming a stronger, more confidant individual, who is in the end surprised by just how much she CAN accomplish. As a college student reading this book, I was moved. I can only imagine the effect it would have had on me if I had read this when I was much younger and much less sure of myself. A definate must for anyone with a young female in the family. Believe me, if they even remotely like fantasy or SciFi, they will LOVE this book."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Gargoyles ([The Darkangel trilogy)","review":"I first read this book not knowing it was part of a trilogy, but now I can't wait to read the other 2!

When the darkangels get the souls they must give them to the witch where upon she would become immortal and take over the world.

The darkangel was one of my all time faves.I didnt realise she'd written more, and I wish she hadnt.I havent read the 3rd yet, but hope it improves.There was too much action and magic and too many characters, everything was spread too thinly.

I just cant get over it."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Gargoyles ([The Darkangel trilogy)","review":"Very amazing till the end of the book.

Their return to Easterness (Isterness) was greeted by the prince's mother, Lady Syllva and his secondborn brothers. Engulfed by his past sins, Irrylath kept distance with his &quot;Darkangel&quot; fourteenth wife despite of Aeriel's effort.Such a heartwrenching situation despaire her. But her task was not over yet. With the help of the other 13 angel brides, she got the second of the three of The Lady Ravenna's stanzas and set of to fulfill the prophecy. Her main quest was to find the lost lons before the Withe Witch found them.Will she succeed? Can she cross the distance between her and Irrylath?"},{"Title":"A Gathering of Gargoyles ([The Darkangel trilogy)","review":"This book is so sappy that ever page you turn just makes you want to drop the book down and puke.

I had read it twice (all 3) before the friend that let me borrow her book moved out of state. It has taken me YEARS to finally fined a copy of all three (they no longer publish it as one book). I've always been fascinated with vampires and Meredith Ann Pierce's description of vampires is entirely unique. For a YA series these books had a lot of character depth in exciting yet heart-wrenching tale of one peasant's journey into saving her mistress, herself, her captor, &amp; not to mention the world. Most everyone else will give you details of the book. I'll simply tell you that this series had such an effect on me that I wept when I finally had copies of all three books after 15+ years of searching ... Out of the 3 books, this one is my favorite."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Gargoyles ([The Darkangel trilogy)","review":"The copy we recived was from a library, and was a bit well used, but in very useable shape. For less than four dollars total, it really was a fantastic value."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Gargoyles ([The Darkangel trilogy)","review":"This, the second book of a fantastic trilogy, is a most beatuful book. This story follows Aeriel who was once the captive and slave of the Icharus (vampyre) Irrylath, and later falls in love with him. Who knows why she does this; why do any of us fall in love? It is this love that creates a great sense of pain and direction in this book.In this story Aeriel leaves her husband, who remains her husband in name only, and goes on a search for the missing lons. Each country/state in the surrounding lands had a lon protector and they had been lost. Aeriel is told by the spiritual former wives of Irrylath to find the lons. It is in this search that Aeriel finds a bit more of herself, her history, and those who love her.This story includes a voyage across a sea of dust, and a trek in many different types of lands, each haunted by its own Icharus and beast. The story brilliantly alternates between slower, more thought-demanding scenes and intense, suspenseful action scenes. A heartbreaking story of a woman who experiences unrequited love yet still does her assigned duty. There are new companions introduced, and old ones brought back to make this a well-rounded story with wholesome, believable characters.Every bit of the story, from beginning to end, will pique your interest and fulfill your wander/love/tragedy/fiction lust."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Gargoyles ([The Darkangel trilogy)","review":"This is the second book in the DarkAngel trilogy. If you liked the first book you will like this book. More happens in this book and it is just as creative as the first one. You definitely need to read the first book before reading this book though.In this book Aeriel is living in the palace with her Prince, Irrylath and his family; the problem is Irrylath cannot stand to be around Aeriel because he is forced to be in love with the evil water witch. When the second part of the rime/prophecy is revealed to Ariel she is forced to go on a journey to make sure the prophecy will be fulfilled and to save Irrylath from the water witch.The tone of this book is similar to the first book. Aeriel very much goes with the flow. She is an interesting character in that she does not seek out action, the action comes to her. Yet, she shows admirable strength in dealing with whatever hand is dealt to her. This book is a bit more of an adventure/quest than the first one was. Aeriel does a bit less waiting around; but there is some inconsistent pacing. Again Pierce has Aeriel go through a lot of action, then times passes as Aeriel waits, then action, then more waiting.The storyline is very fairy-tale-like and very creative. The writing is beautiful and descriptive; at times you feel as if you are floating through the story. It was a beautiful book and a great continuation of this story. While the main story point was resolved, the major storyline remains to be resolved in the third book. I am looking forward to reading the third book as soon as I can."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Gargoyles ([The Darkangel trilogy)","review":"The rare occasion where a sequel is just as enchanting, intriguing, and beautifully written as the original. Aeriel has saved the darkangel, Irrylath, from the evil enchantment of his mother the White Witch, but she suffers from a broken heart when he cannot return her love. Aeriel leaves him in order to unravel another riddle and defeat the White Witch by gathering the lons. On her adventures, Aeriel will perhaps finally discover her true identity. What propels this series into the extraordinary is the stunningly imaginative images, like something from a deep, dark dream buried long ago in childhood. The plot and character are deceptively simple, and therein lies the fantastically original beauty. Familiar elements from the oldest of fairy tales (East of the Sun, West of the Moon, Psyche, Beauty and the Beast, The Lotus Eaters) are blended into a captivating, gothic, dark, beautiful, dream-like, eerie, and original tale full of images that haunt and stun. A series that has my highest recommendations.

No character is flat or seemingly cardboard--they all have personalities, and flaws, and strengths.This is such a BEAUTIFUL tale that NOBODY should miss!

It includes yet another part of Ravenna's Rime, the first part we see in The Darkangel, and, being a riddle and puzzle fan, it was fun to try to solve it beforehand, and then watch as the solution became apparent at the end. Utterly fantastic. Ariel goes off on her own to try to find steeds for Irrylath's half brothers on her own, and to get away from her somewhat cold husband. She goes on an adventure by herself and comes across some amazing discoveries and adventures within her big adventure. It was absolutely riveting and something I will definitely re-read and share with friends."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Gargoyles ([The Darkangel trilogy)","review":"The whole trilogy is amazing!

If so, then you will want to read \\"A Gathering of Gargoyles\\" by Meredith Ann Pierce.This book is the second one out of three from a series called \\"The Darkangel Trilogy.\\" It is about a young girl named Aeriel who saves her new husband, a darkangel, from White Witch. In the first book, called \\"The Darkangel,\\" Aeriel sacrified her heart and gave it to her husband so that he would be able to turn back into a human after a spell was cast by the White Witch. In \\"A Gathering of Gargoyles,\\" Aeriel is back and trying to get rid of the White Witch for good. But first she has to solve a riddle told to her by some maidens. In order to do that, she has to find an oracle to help her, and also find the six lost lons of the west, which are magical creatures that Aeriel thought had been killed Aeriel and a new friend set out on their trip, and on their way they find Aeriel's six gargoyle pets - Greyling, Cat Wing, Moon Calf, Eelbird, Rapter and Monkey-Lizard. Will they find what they are looking for? You will have to read the book to find out!I greatly recommend this book for teen readers who like to read fantasy stories. This is a funny book that will keep all readers captivated from the very first page! The book is easy-to-read and easy-to-follow. Even though it is a fiction book, this fantasy story is written in an order that makes sense to the reader. It is well-organized. The author uses a lot of unfamiliar words to describe familiar objects. It would be easy to get confused by these new words, but the author does a good job explaining them in the story so that the reader knows exactly what she is talking about.I really liked this book because it is a fantasy story, and it is the type of book that will not let you put it down once you start it! In it there are birds that are bigger than a man, horses that can fly, and a lot more. You can easily imagine the scenes and creatures, almost like you are in the story and can see everything clearly. I can't wait to read the other two books in this series! \\"A Gathering of Gargoyles\\" is written for teens and young adults.Book received free of charge."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Gargoyles ([The Darkangel trilogy)","review":"In this second book of the darkangel trilogy we run into some problems. The main one is that Aerial, our darkangel saving slave heroine of the first book, has become impossibly perfect. The second is that although this book has an incredible amount of action and chase scenes and scary things, it drags in places. The third is that this book involves journeying over much of Aerial's world, but there is no map. Very frustrating.Other that though, in this book Aerial (who fell in love with her now non-darkangel husband very quickly and somewhat inexplicably) journeys the world to find magical mounts, the guardians or lons of the world, for her husband's younger brothers. She learns more of the prophecy of the darkangel and of her own destiny and heritage.All in all, not a bad book for the middle of a trilogy, which can always be an awkward novel in any series. I still maintain this series is not truly intended for, and is not just a book for young adults. I'm enjoying it much more in this second read at age 18 then I did at age 12. Having forgotten what happens in the third book since I read it six years ago I happily go on to see the conclusion to the great fight against the evil white Lorelei and her remaining six darkangel sons.Four stars."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Gargoyles ([The Darkangel trilogy)","review":"I am in love with Ariel, Irrylath, and this brilliant world of fantasy that Ms. Pierce has created. She has such style and an impecable imagination. Her characters are so real that your heart pounds and your brow sweats in anticipation right along with the characters. The gargoyles are the best yet - like big bony, stone dogs - they were my favorites!! I read the book in 2 1/2 days if that tells you what a page turner it is. It really lived up to the excellence of the first book - The Dark Angel. My library carries the first two books of the series but not the final book, so I must wait in anticipation for the final book - The Pearl of the Soul of the World. I'm almost afraid to read the final book simply because I don't want the journey to end!! I will probably end up reading them all over again as soon as I've finished the last one. Applause goes out to Ms. Pierce and her unique imagination!!!!"},{"Title":"A Gathering of Gargoyles ([The Darkangel trilogy)","review":"I first discovered Meredith Ann Pierce through the Firebringer books, then sought out The Darkangel because I needed to read everything she wrote. I love her style, and even after reading the trilogy several times I don't get tired of the language and characters.This is the only one of the three I had to replace because I literally wore out my paperback copy. The first is the most adventure and the third the most revelation, but A Gathering of Gargoyles is what moves the quest from impossibility to hope and gives Aeriel the beginnings of her confidence and identity. This is the best one to pick up and read on its own."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Gargoyles ([The Darkangel trilogy)","review":"This one doesn't live up to the two others, but it's still a must read in the trilagy.

She seeks the lons that were defeated by the lorelie's darkangles,who pillage their land for blood and souls. If she can get the lons before the lorelie can, there may be a chance to defeat the darkangles."},{"Title":"A Gathering of Gargoyles ([The Darkangel trilogy)","review":"Oh...I loved this second book. A Gathering of Gargoyles is probably my favorite in the trilogy with Dark Angel coming in a very close second. Aeriel's journey is one full of self-discovery and it is very touching. I felt so bad for her with how Irralyth treats her and I can tell she truly loves him. In a strange way I also believed that he loves her but just cannot show it. I am seriously considering writing a companion piece to this book chronicling Irralyth's journey. I'm writing it just for fun because I want to write more of him. I found him to be an intrigue but fustrating character. Though I must say I loved how Aeriel grows during Dark Angel and A Gathering of Gargoyles. It was very inspiring for me to read when I was a seventh-grade student. I am so happy my friend lent the book to me."},{"Title":"Road atlas: United States, Canada, Mexico","review":"Never buy Universal brand maps.

The translation of the Joseph Smith Papyri, mechanical as it was, was very educational. What really made this book worthwhile was the commentary on the papyri's actual meaning and what it meant to the Egyptians. From that I could pick out specific applications to the LDS endowment. There has been very little written by LDS authors on the LDS endowment. I loved it and look forward to the comprehensive guide to the Pearl of Great Price by Nibley."},{"Title":"The Message of the Joseph Smith Papyri: An Egyptian Endowment","review":"Nibley is, once again, thorough and thought provoking.

What is it that makes it truly extraordinary?Lucidity, clarity, and topical broadness make this work particularly impressive. Though it looks like a standard college freshman text, it doesn't read that way. You're not likely to read it cover to cover like a novel, but it's perfect for grabbing off the shelf after having watched that jingoistic Hollywood production of American history, or as a primer for indulging in more penetrating American history scholarship.It's not perfect. The regional sympathies of the primary author (Morison) are revealed from time to time. This book belongs to the Plymouth Rock School of history--the branch that teaches that everything lasting and good in American history came to New England around 1620, after St. Augustine, after Roanoke, after Jamestown. The 1840 map of the United States given on pg. 447 makes a gross error in misrepresenting the population of New Orleans, third largest city in the country at the time. Something tells me that Boston or Philadelphia would have never been overlooked in such a case. Serious students would do well to consult Woodward, Ayers, or even Philips with regard to Southern topics."},{"Title":"The growth of the American republic","review":"I am a high school student and i have enroled in the AP American History course for my junior year.

Doubtless it has been assigned as homework far more frequently than it has been read for pleasure and self-improvement. The real surprise is how well it rewards the careful reader. I think it will be slow going for anyone who is not already well read in American History, but it repays the effort on every page. Pick it up any time you need some perspective on events troublesome or puzzling in American public life. You will not be disappointed. One particular recurrent theme throughout this book is the idea that Americans have (or at least had) a peculiar genius for self-government that gave us the upper hand in so many struggles."},{"Title":"The growth of the American republic","review":"I am a high-school student enrolled in the Advanced Placement United States History course, and have been reading this book all year long.

It is a great resource for historians, history buffs, and people who are interested in American history. It is a highly regarded book by many and it contains almost anything you wanted to know. The first volume deals with the early years of the republic up to about 1865. The second volume starts from 1865 to what we now know as modern america. There are pictures, graphs, a bibliography and appendixes. Like I said before, this is a great resource and a really nice addition to any collection.

It's so simple, and yet such a brilliant idea! She complements the text with wonderful full-color watercolors and helpful diagrams. Also, she includes very funny stories about food and married life. Her tone is charming and sweet and romantic without being \\"cheesy\\" -- which I think is the greatest accomplishment of all. Her whole theory is that with modern life so hectic, the best thing a couple can do is spend _one_ dinner a month where you sit down to a romantic, delicious meal that you and your spouse make together. The back of the book calls it a \\"recipe for a happy marriage,\\" and it's totally true.As for the recipes themselves, the few I've tried so far have been great. I'm a decent cook myself -- not trained or anything, and I'm no expert -- but I found the recipes clear and easy to follow, unlike so many other cookbooks I own. The author obviously took great care in editing and researching her recipes.The book itself makes an amazing present, and I plan on buying many for my friends as they get engaged. It's hard-cover and very appealing looking. The pages are of the highest quality and, like I said, it's in full-color throughout. I can't believe something like this didn't exist before, but I sure am happy it exists now!"},{"Title":"Not on Love Alone: A Year of Delicious Dinners and More for Newlyweds","review":"I have had success with the recipes I've tried from this book, so it already wins a thumbs up. But it's the writing that I really have to rave about--in fact, I found myself abandoning whatever novels I was reading at the time and curling up in bed with this book to read instead! It is such a wonderful conversation from someone else who is new to marriage, and her charts, tidbits, and cheese play are amusing and helpful. My husband has taken her suggestions on salt and made them law in our house.On a practical level, this book is well put together. It does not overwhelm you with recipes but instead gives you one wonderful new meal to try each month, plus some other must-have recipes, all with the goal of getting you to sit across the table from your spouse. I also liked the book because the author is young, busy, and crammed into a city-style apartment with all its limitations. It addressed many real-life challenges I face in my own life and kitchen, making it more relevant than Betty Crocker.Everyone we love who gets married this summer is getting this book as a gift from us."},{"Title":"Not on Love Alone: A Year of Delicious Dinners and More for Newlyweds","review":"I loved this book!

Perhaps Saunders timed the release of the book to coincide with the strawberries that go in the torte.Saunders's drawings are evocative and inspiring. I can't believe she did them as well as wrote the book. How talented can one young woman get?JS (her husband, to whom the book is dedicated) must be one lucky guy.

I read it like a novel: while the food narratives and recipes are meticulously detailed and delicious-sounding in every way, equally enjoyable are the charming anecdotes about the author's husband (JS), father (Pops), family vacations, and dinner parties, as well as the whimsical illustrations, done, I understand, by the author herself. As a newlywed myself and a culinary novice, I feel inspired by Jessie to tackle and conquer my own kitchen! I'm particularly looking forward to making her chicken noodle soup and her peach bellinis, and as my experience grows, I may even feel confident to tackle her recipe for doughnut bites with chocolate ganache filling!

The opening exposition was bald and bland. Most of the characters were missing something. And the ending really really sucked. The most sympathetic character was Elena, the Russian wife (via Paris and Berlin) who was full of poetry and showed, that even though she knew what was going on, she was trapped in a drama that could never end well for her. There were some interesting ideas about painting and being an outsider and love in marriage and sex (and sexlessness) both in and outside of marriage. But it wound up being unclear because the ending refused to answer questions about the outcome of the characters. The lack of an ending was a major problem for most of us."},{"Title":"Exiles in America: A Novel","review":"This is the first novel I've read from this author and now I want to read them all!

However, they look so solid to everyone who knows either of them that they assume the pair will remain together until one dies. However, their close loving relationship no longer includes sex between them; instead Daniel has affairs while Zack has become celibate.When the college's resident artist of the year arrives, Iranian Abbas Rohani and his Russian spouse Elena with their two children, Zack and Daniel are the first to truly welcome them by inviting them to dinner. While Zack and Elena hold an intelligent discussion, Daniel tries to impress the arrogant attractive Abbas by showing him his paintings. Zack and Elena begin to forge a close friendship, but Abbas devastates Daniel by saying his paintings are poor. After seeing Abbas' superior work, Daniel and the Iranian hunk begin an affair that threaten both marriages at the same time that Abbas' pious older brother Hassan demands he and his wife return to Iran immediately.This is a well written interesting relationship drama starring four fascinating protagonists that is a modernizing of the late 1960s movie \\"Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice\\". The story line digs deep into the four prime players mostly through their relationships with the other three in a sort of rectangular connection. Though at times Christopher Bram seems to want to normalize the coupling which takes away from the prime premise that relationships come in all forms, fans who appreciate a deep character study will enjoy this fascinating look at Zack and Daniel and Abbas and Elena.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Exiles in America: A Novel","review":"That Christopher Bram is one of our finer novelists today is a given (The Notorious Dr. August: His Real Life and Crimes, Gods and Monsters, Life of the Circus Animals, In Memory of Angel Clare, etc). EXILES IN AMERICA is a very astutely constructed novel, one that explores the concept of displaced persons, whether those persons be gay men in a straight homophobic town, artists in a world of grounded minds, immigrant visitors in the land of the free, or Muslims in a path of fear guarded closely by the Christian ethic. Mix these possible people in a country post 9/11 and prior to America's (read Bush's) declaration of war on Iraq and there is a story brooding.For the most part Bram finely tunes this novel with well-drawn characterizations, a gift he continues to elucidate in his writing. But something has entered Bram's writing mind that is a bit disturbing: he seems to have lost some of the respect for his readers that has never happened prior to his novel. There are moments of 'dumbing down' the reader by excessive explanations of obvious knowns and even stumbling at the close of the book to speak not in the voice of the characters he has created but in his own vacillating voice as a writer - a section of this otherwise fairly tense read that breaks the magic and adds little.Daniel, an artist with painter's block who now only teaches art in Williamsburg, VA, and Zack, a psychiatrist who has given up his New York practice to follow Daniel to his present college teaching position, have been together as a couple for twenty one years, the last ten years at least of which have been an 'open marriage': both men are agreed that transient liaisons outside of their marriage are acceptable as long as they talk about them. Daniel, though in his late forties, has fears of aging and continues to pursue flings, while Zack has settled into a nearly asexual state. Into their milieu come a new guest faculty artist, Iranian Abbas and his Russian wife Elena (a couple with two children who also have an open marriage), and soon enough Daniel and Abbas are lusting after each other in what continues long enough to become an affair. The story is centered on how these four people react not only to each others' needs and fears, but how Zack and Daniel become enmeshed in the growing American suspicion of Middle Eastern 'potential terrorists', a factor surfacing when Abbas' older brother Hassan arrives from Tehran insisting that Abbas, Elena and their children return to Iran because of the incipient war between the US and Iraq. These conflicts focus the instabilities and consequences of the lifestyles of the four friends and introduces an entirely new attitude to Exiles in all its meanings.Bram writes brilliantly and moves his story at a terrific pace: EXILES IN AMERICA is a difficult book to put down once started. For this reader the only problem other than the ones mentioned above is the lack of charisma: it is difficult to truly care about any of the people in this book. But perhaps that is another 'alienation' Bram wants to introduce - a metaphor for the isolation among people that has been heightened by the current preoccupation with distrust of intimacy and people outside our individual realm. Bram poses questions, delivers the goods, and once again proves that he can create a fine story based on a tough theme. Grady Harp, January 07"},{"Title":"Exiles in America: A Novel","review":"It's intimidating to review a writer with the stature of Christopher Bram, but fortunately, this excellent novel does not disappoint.Exiles in America centers almost entirely on two couples and the complications that bloom among them. There's Zack and Daniel, a late-40s gay couple, together for 21 years, who don't have sex with each other anymore. The other couple is Abbas and Elena Rohani. Abbas is a visiting art professor at the university where Daniel teaches.An innocent invitation by Zack and Daniel to have the Rohanis for dinner because they're new in town leads to an affair between Daniel and Abbas, who is bisexual. None of this is secret, and soon the left-out spouses, Zack and Elena, find through sharing notes about the affair that they have a growing friendship.The reader's interest holds as Abbas' dissatisfaction over his career as a painter slides all over the emotional scale, affecting the foursome in turn. It's 2002 and early 2003, just when the Iraq War is beginning, and this event colors their lives in ways they can't imagine--including creepy visits to all of them from the FBI.It's hard to believe that the ruminations of relationships and the everyday lives of four fairly ordinary people can hold a reader's interest, but Bram's expert hand at characterization makes you want to be there as each layer of each character is peeled away. His sharp dialogue and realistic buildup of complications keep the story fresh and true.While I don't normally like frequent viewpoint switches, Bram is masterful at the subtle transfer from one voice to another, even in the same paragraph--something I would never try in my own fiction. A welcome, relieving epilogue brings the story full circle, though with questions about humanity still lingering in the readers' minds.One clear mistake, however, was Bram's choice at one important point to swing the story out of omniscient viewpoint and to directly address the reader (even using the words, \\"dear reader...\\"). This is a cheap shot that was not necessary and which weakens the story. In addition, there are a couple of characters that are completely unnecessary, most noticeably Ross, a friend to the gay couple who has no pertinent place whatsoever in this novel. Fortunately, Bram's storytelling is so good that such an error can be overlooked."},{"Title":"Exiles in America: A Novel","review":"I find myself reading Bram's works based on the subject matter, then kicking myself about half way through. He starts off most books with some interesting characters caught in a situation that should make a good story possible and then find myself disappointed when it does not happen. Too much time is spent justifying relationships or perspectives instead of letting the story do this for itself. Two very different couples; two middle aged gay men (Daniel and Zack) and an Iranian man and his Russian wife(Abbas and Elena), meet and a sexual affair between Daniel and Abbas takes place and a friendship between Elena and Zack develops. The first half of the book is basically Elena and Zack telling the reader how 'okay' they are with their spouses fling. Then comes along Abbas' brother, an Iranian official, and this causes unwarranted reactions from the FBI ultimately causing Abbas and Elena to flee to Iran. After 300+ pages the author actually throws it to the reader to finish it. What he really seems to say is \\"I didn't know where to go with Zack and Daniel, I didn't really care what happens to them, so you figure it out.\\" If I had cared about the characters I might have been angry, but ultimately I don't think that anyone was any different by the end of the book - they all had the same problems, they all seemed complacent with their decisions, and I was dissapointed and annoyed."},{"Title":"Exiles in America: A Novel","review":"Christopher Bram's latest novel EXILES IN AMERICA is essentially about four characters. Zack Knowles, a psychiatrist, and Daniel Wexler, an art professor at a college in Williamsburg, Virginia, have been together for twenty years. Their lives are as bland as a bad pastel. They no longer have sex, they watch old movies, and Zack reads Victorian novels. Then their lives run amuck when they meet Abbas Rohani, an often sullen, almost always insufferable Iranian, and his Russian wife, Elena, when Abbas, another art instructor, is hired at Daniel's college.The first two-thirds or so of the novel is about Daniel and Abbas' affair and how it affects them and their partners. Then Abbas' brother visits, and suddenly Abbas and Elena find themselves in a post September 11 quagmire because Abbas is Iranian.Mr. Bram does some things very well. He writes effortless dialogue and sometimes uses beautiful metaphorical language: When a snow storm hits Williamsburg, \\"threads of eighteenth century woodsmoke climbed from chimneys along the street.\\" Zack touches a client's \\"birdlike shoulder goodbye.\\" At other times the imagery does not work. For instance, the writer compares a sphincter to a wedding ring-- not one time but twice.What Mr. Bram does over and over is tell the reader what to think rather than showing him and then trusting him to use his intellect to ferret out the novel's meaning: Examples: The reader is told that MoMA is the Museum of Modern Art; and Elena reminds Daniel of \\"a bird woman by Grandville.\\" Then he tells us that Grandville is a nineteenth-century cartoonist. Bram also interjects statements and homilies throughout the novel that do not appear to be the words or thoughts of any of the characters. One example of many: \\"Life in couples usually writes white upon the page, except in times of crisis.\\" (page 23.) Finally practically at the end of this too long novel, the author actually talks to the reader and asks him a whole series of questions concluding with \\"Are you really that much smarter than Zack and Daniel?\\" Then he opines that he is in the dark with these two characters-- a very strange ending indeed. My difficulty with Zack and Daniel (and Abbas and Elena for that matter) is not so much that I am in the dark about them but that they unfortunately are not very sympathetic characters."},{"Title":"Exiles in America: A Novel","review":"This book is so complex, so layered, so rich with nuance ... it does take two readings for the remarkable quality of the characterization to sink in. Wow. Bram has nailed it, he's made a kind of lasagna out of different flavors and ingredients, only his flavors are people and his ingredients are culture and religion. Trust me! This book is a keeper."},{"Title":"Exiles in America: A Novel","review":"Living in Williamsburg (the one in Virginia) are two sexually estranged longtime companions: Daniel, a frustrated artist and now an art professor, and Zack, a psychologist. Passing middle age, Zack has adopted a somewhat ascetic outlook on their relationship (they sleep in separate rooms), while his younger and impulsive partner sows a few wild oats with the occasional meaningless fling. Enter a brilliant Iranian artist, Abbas, whose emotional detachment vies with an oversexed personality, and his indulgent Russian wife, Elena, who knew what she was getting into when they married, and their two children. The resulting affair between Daniel and Abbas is a foregone conclusion, and much of the book is about the resulting emotional chaos among the members of these two barely functional families.James Baldwin's \\"Another Country\\" travels through similar terrain (featuring three couples rather than just two), and the thematic similarity of the titles is probably not a coincidence. Like Baldwin's prose, Bram's meticulous sentences can be a thing of awe, and his characters, while often self-absorbed and even infuriating, are completely believable. Unfortunately, however, \\"Exiles\\" also reminds me a little of Patrick Marber's \\"Closer,\\" in the decorous loquaciousness of its characters, who hyperanalyze every experience, statement, and action, as if they all were infected by the worst excesses of Zack's profession. It's a lot of talk and introspection, and what might work on the stage or in a story doesn't necessarily fly in a 375-page novel. The conversations in the first half of the book, dealing with fraught and emotion-laden issues, are so civil and precise and articulate that they seem surreal--an improbably messed-up therapy group plunked down in the equally improbable atmosphere of a colonial tourist trap.The later portions of the novel are much less insular; the characters' self-inflicted crises are pushed aside by a truly perilous threat after Abbas's brother--a top Iranian official--sneaks into the country via Canada for a visit. Indeed, the last one hundred pages are so different in tone they seem borrowed from a different (and, dare I say, better) novel. Unlike many other readers, the ending didn't bother me at all; unless someone dies, relationships rarely resolve themselves in neatly wrapped Hollywood finales. Bram's postmodernist stance strikes just the right note. Forgoing the niceties of plot, the author instead sticks to his themes of exile and alienation; each of the four characters, flawed as they are, remain exiled in any number of ways--from their countries of origin, from New York, from their peers, especially from each other, and in the end from America itself."},{"Title":"Exiles in America: A Novel","review":"Christopher Bram has written his most thought-provoking novel to date. He delves sensitively but deeply into a number of topics currently rocking the American cultural psyche: the definition of marriage and family, the gulf between East and West, the tension between security and xenophobia, etc. It's a great read that will leave you asking yourself questions for which there are no easy answers."},{"Title":"Exiles in America: A Novel","review":"Exiles in America is a beautifully written novel that will be with me for quite some time. I was deeply touched by these characters and the drama of their lives. I, too, feel like an exile at times."},{"Title":"Exiles in America: A Novel","review":"I greatly enjoyed Bram's The Notorious Dr. August so I was looking forward to reading this book. I gave up a little more than half way through. I am a gay male married for over 40 years to a man. I've had my fair share of sexual encounters with other men. I am also a clinical psychologist. The dialogue about character, personality, and sex rings so unreal that I found the book boring and just gave up reading it. Bram fails to describe any reality I've ever experience in meeting a hot prospect for extra-marital sex, the sex act itself, or the feeling afterward.The two main characters have been married for over 20 years, do not have sex with each other and one has had no sex at all yet this is not explored and is presented as a usual thing in marriage. Perhaps it happens in straight marriages and I do know a few where that is so but i've yet to see it in a gay marriage. In any case, since this is not expected in a marital relationship between spouses under 70 the author has some responsibility to explain why. he does not do this but that is minor compared to my main complaint about this book.I can take many quotes of sexual events present in the book as illustrative but Amazon censures sexual reference here. Lets just say that the dialogue between these two grown men in bed is more like one would expect from two 13 year olds fooling around for the first time than it is from two adults.The book is full of this type of dialogue - dribble. The psychological analyzing isn't as bad as the sex stuff but it isn't good either. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"UTAMARO: A Chorus of Birds","review":"Kitagawa Utamaro was one of the premier woodblock artists in Japan during the 18th century. This Book of Birds was published at the height of his career in around 1790. This is a reproduction of the series of three books of bird woodblock prints by the artist in the metropolitan museum of art in New York.The reproduction is presented in a folding format similar to that of old Japanese books or screens. It is a beautiful work of art. The only thing that hasn't been able to be reproduced is the embossing and gold speckles in the paper of the original work, but you can still see where they are in the reproduced pictures. The front of the book gives us an introduction to Utamaro and the back of the book translates the poetry on each page (by the greatest poets of the era) and identifies each of the birds in all the prints.If you love birds and Japanese art then this a book you should put some effort into finding.

In an attempt to catch the culprit and perhaps also the killer, Donald hires a stripper to check into the motel and strip in front of the window. The dialog throughout those scenes was the best of the book and I chuckled as I read through it. Gardner is a master at writing scenes that are steamy and yet within the moralistic bounds of the early sixties. That section alone made the book worth reading.The climactic scene is sound and Bertha Cool is involved in a way that had me smiling. However, the end, where the hostility between Bertha and Donald is quickly forgotten, appeared weak. Bertha was ready to sell out Donald for a seat in the electric chair and he forgives her much too easily."},{"Title":"Bachelors Get Lonely","review":"First published in 1961 as part of the Cool and Lam detective series, Bachelors Get Lonely is little more than 167 pages of mindless drivel. Authored by the legendary Erle Stanley Gardner under the pseudonym A.A.Fair, this book is a monumental disappointment. The plotting is unwieldy, the characters repeatedly insist on doing things completely out of character and the dialogue, more often than not, is laughably inauthentic sounding. Do not waste your time reading Bachelors Get Lonely."},{"Title":"The Brown Book of the Hitler Terror and the Burning of the Reichstag","review":"When Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany in 1932, he began his terror and control by activating the storm troopers. These forces would be responsible at the outset of the Third Reich for numerous atrocities. This book was an effort by a left-wing based organization to bring to light the terror of Hitler's politics and policies. Written in mid-1933, it preceded the start of World War II and presented to the world the first steps that Hitler took that would culminate in the Holocaust. The book focuses initially on the burning of the Reichstag, which was staged by the Nazis to lay blame on the Communists in Germany, a sufficiently powerful sector to cause concern for the Hitler agenda. There is excruciating detail describing how the National Socialist set up the fire, including details that contradicted the official pronouncements. The authors also cover extensively the attacks on intellectuals, the acceleration and application of anti-Semitic policies, the establishment of numerous concentration camps, originally meant not just for Jews but for socialists, communists and basically any other opponents of the regime. Ironically, the leftist authors take pains to point out that the Hitler regime was essentially in cahoots with capitalists - Jew and non-Jew - and against the needs of the working classes. The writers proclaim the eventual triumph of communism, obviously ignorant to the eventual atrocities and mass killings which would occur in the communist countries that they championed. One gets a intimate exposure to the personal sufferings of those Germans who did not fit the Nazi ideal - the break ins into homes to arrest suspected enemies of the state, the brutal beatings, the fear in which much of the populace lived. It's too bad that the world did not heed the warnings in this book."},{"Title":"Some Lovely Image","review":"With unabashed, Victorian prose, Lawrence Quirk spins an emotionally arresting tale of love from beyond the grave. Tom Lanning is a Boston Brahmian aristocrat who searches to his untimely death for that special someone. Many years later, while researching his family tree, the narrator (Robert) comes across a picture of the long-dead youth in a Boston library. He is immediately mesmerized by the young man's beauty (Lanning dies in 1893 at the age of 23 from complications of a crude appendix operation.) Robert begins a loving and obsessive journey into finding out all he can about Lanning, oddly drawn in by an unnamed, somewhat veiled, mystic familiarity to the youth. Mr Quirk weaves his story through testaments and journals written by those who surround Lanning's privileged and socially insular life. As he delves further into Lanning's past intimacies, he uproots his own morose existance in Lynn, Massachusetts, moving into the Lanning home in Boston (now a rooming house and desolate memory of its glorious past.) The deft narrative detailing the decline of the Beacon Hill residence is rendered such that one gets an errie feeling it is the four walls themselves that ruminate their own disconsolate ruination, telling any and all of us who will listen. With his obsessive search culminating, Robert realizes (by events played out during Lanning's life, coupled with his own innate sense that they are somehow intrinsically and spiritually joined) perhaps there is more than a passing parallel between himself and the youth from long ago. The possibility that love transcends time and space is truly a romantic vehicle.C.G. Gross writes in a parallel review that this is based on true events. I would be interested in knowing more!"},{"Title":"A Grammar of the German Language","review":"Curme, George O., A Grammar of the German Language (New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing Co., 11th Printing, 1977), 623 pages.This currently out of print reference work, first published during 1904 and issued in a revised edition by Lakeside Press during 1922, precedes A Grammar of the English Language, published first by D. C. Heath and Company during 1935.Curme develops a grammar reference to the German language through an analysis of printed German. Students of German and educators teaching German will find this book useful. The analytical method used to develop this work answers a student's questions as to the thought behind the use of German.This book is written in English. Very dense text introduces and explains German. Samples of German text appear immediately following each explanatory sentence. Although a grammar fanatic might read this book from cover to cover, other readers will more successfully use this book to compliment other grammar texts used in university courses in German.The table of contents lists four parts: Phonology and Orthography, Parts of Speech, Word Formation, and Syntax. The sub-headings under these four parts explain how to use each component of German language to explain one's thoughts.Readers should note the formation of the German nation under Bismarck during the late 19th Century. During this period German language underwent a process of standardization. Curme completed this work soon thereafter. This work captures the origins of German language, explains the usage current at the time of publication, and shows the grammatical forms of new words entering the language from technology and from foreign languages."},{"Title":"A Grammar of the German Language","review":"This book serves as an excellent in-depth reference to German grammar. The explanations are clear; the examples are right-on. I have used this book for years both as a reference and as a source of little known points of German grammar.The section on the capitalization of compound nouns has an example, &quot;Erd-R&uuml;cken&quot;, with the second element capitalized to avoid confusion with &quot;Er-dr&uuml;cken&quot;. Would that all authors of grammars were so thorough!"},{"Title":"The Story of Art, with 370 Illustrations","review":"General survey course text.

The book was a great resource. It has a ton of great hikes with really good directions on how to get there. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Beyond Mount Si: The Best Hikes Within 85 Miles of Seattle","review":"I just started hiking this year and so i wanted a guide that would help me.This is the one i chose. It gave me exact directions, difficulty level, hike conditions, best season to go , whether fees are applied, whether kids or dogs can be taken, what to see, what all to take along, time for a round trip, how many miles to walk etc.I think that was the sufficient information for us. We have taken many of them and had a wonderful time in seattle.Give it a try, its a good reference book."},{"Title":"Beyond Mount Si: The Best Hikes Within 85 Miles of Seattle","review":"Simply stated, the book offers hikers of any caliber a great selection of day-hiking opportunities close to the Seattle area. I was in Seattle for a summer and bought this book from a used-book shop for a dollar... one of the best purchases I have ever made. I gave it away when I left, and now that I'm about to return, I'm going to buy this book again.Throughout the summer, I took about 12 distinct hikes from the book. Sometimes I went solo to move at a faster pace and start early in the morning, and other times I used it as a guide for selecting a hike for a group of not-exactly-in-shape people. The directions to the trail heads are excellent, although occasionally misleading about the road conditions... but if you have an SUV and not a cavalier or escort like I have, this won't be an issue for you. Never once did I get lost travelling to a hike.Moreover, I never once got lost on any trail. Washington state doesn't seem to label anything, unlike many trails in the East. But the small maps were enough to get me through all of the trails that I travelled, and the descriptions about the tricky points in the trails were a huge bonus. You might consider richer topographical maps just to be safe, but I was able to get through with little problem. I also really like the visualizations of the elevation changes so I have a good idea of what I'm in for climbing-wise. Also, the descriptions of times to hike (i.e. when the snow has melted) were great for someone from the East who usually doesn't see snow in the mountains past April.In short, an excellent guide to a great many hikes near Seattle. It's a no-brainer for avid or occasional day-hikers alike.NOTE: If you're looking for guides to hikes near Olympic park, this is *not* the book for you. All hikes are north, east, and south of Seattle... there are no hikes listed to the west."},{"Title":"Beyond Mount Si: The Best Hikes Within 85 Miles of Seattle","review":"Zilly is not just an outdoors geek. He is a great writer. His descriptions are user-friendly (I especially love how he signals a tough stretch with an \\"oof!\\" and a confusing fork with a \\"whoa!\\"). And the trails he's chosen offer great variety--I usually hit the trail in spring with the easier ones then graduate to the tougher ones in early fall. But the best part, I think, are the maps. They're simple, use recognizable icons and also offer an elevation cross-section, so you can visualize the elevation gain (or lack thereof). I buy all my new-to-town friends this book and they love it too."},{"Title":"Beyond Mount Si: The Best Hikes Within 85 Miles of Seattle","review":"best hiking book I've come across for near-seattle hikes.this book has -good- driving directions (and GPS coordinates). along the lines of \\"go north off exit #34 for 1.7 miles - trailhead is on your left\\" - I have never gotten lost trying to find a trailhead in this book.a lot of the hiking books I've come across are written by well-intended old farts who know the area like the back of their hand. unfortunately they assume you also know where you are going and leave out detailed directions. I sometimes suspect they have a secret agenda of trying to prevent too many people from actually finding the trailhead.nice selection of hikes - some of which are 30 minutes from downtown - others a bit further away. all of them are within a few hours drive."},{"Title":"Beyond Mount Si: The Best Hikes Within 85 Miles of Seattle","review":"Finally a comprehensive guide book for a variety of hikes close to the Seattle area - previously hikes around the area have been scattered through various guide books, some good, some not so good. This is a good one! The driving directions and hike maps are easy to follow and very informative. Each map stands alone with its own micro-legend. The rating system and elevation profiles provide a good starting point. There are gps coordinates for each hike for folks that know what to do with that info and for those who are just learning. Indicating which hikes are appropriate for children also helps in the selection process. This is a great book for sitting in a cafe on Saturday morning trying to figure out where to go for the day."},{"Title":"Beyond Mount Si: The Best Hikes Within 85 Miles of Seattle","review":"This is a great book for natives of the region who are into intense, strenuous hikes. I however, am more of a novice hiker and found only a few hikes in here that were of my skill level. There aren't too many hikes to pick from if all you want is an afternoon hike along the water or an easy day trip with the kids."},{"Title":"Beyond Mount Si: The Best Hikes Within 85 Miles of Seattle","review":"This is one of 3 local hiking guides I have of the area and this is definitely the most user-friendly one. The driving directions were clear and the description of the hikes was acurate and very helpful.The thing I appreciate most with this guide provides was that whether or not there is a fee (parking and/or permit) involved at each hike. By listing who manages each trail, I could avoid arriving at a hike just to find out that I did not have cash to pay for parking or that I should have stop by a local vendor to get a pass/permit.Also, I always take my dog on hikes, so it is good to know the pet regulation at each trail.This is defnitely a must for everyone who lives in the Seattle area and wants to explore the local trails."},{"Title":"Beyond Mount Si: The Best Hikes Within 85 Miles of Seattle","review":"I'm a Washington native and have been doing some type of hiking most my life and I enjoyed this book. I am not normally one for guidebooks, but this was a good one after moving northward and trying to learn the new trails I'd have access to. It's great for learning about hikes close to the Seattle and central King County. However this does leave out some great hikes that a little farther out. A good resouce for those that are centrally located. I like the elevevation chart as it gives a easily viewable representation of the trail, however I'd like to see Topographic maps as well to see a little more cleary how the locations come together. I also don't care for the directions as they all seem to indicate mileage from exits. Unless you follow the exact directions(from seattle) there are no mile marker references. So those of us who know some of the backroads but not the trailhead location are left to search our own route or take major routes more. I'd also like more information on varying the hikes along areas that are quite networked with trails(the Issaquah alps for example). Overall I'd recommend this book to anyone who lives along the 1-90 or 1-5 corridor and wants to get familiar with the local hikes, but if your much outside Seattle or Bellevue then this book starts to seem less useful."},{"Title":"Beyond Mount Si: The Best Hikes Within 85 Miles of Seattle","review":"My husband and I just moved here from California and we are both just getting to know the area here in Seattle, so this book has been great!

It offers a concise overview, turn by turn directions and the best maps.One of the issues with other books is the maps look more like a bad b&w; copy of a USGS topo map. Not this book!The maps in this book show the general area and most other trails in the area. Plus it highlights the exact route mentioned in the book. While this may seem basic, some other local books simply show the trails or have a topo like map without the trails highlighted.Its critical to have good maps as many local trail systems have confusing interconnecting routes.The other major bonus of this book is that it is really up-to-date and keeps to routes most folks can enjoy. Plus it gives honest comments about crowding and parking.I have taken seven hikes in this book this year and have enjoy each of them.This book is MUCH better than the Day Hike! series."},{"Title":"Beyond Mount Si: The Best Hikes Within 85 Miles of Seattle","review":"This book does a great job of describing so many of the wonderful hikes the greater Seattle area has to offer, rating them for difficulty and scenery and giving useful hints and directions.We took our nine year old on several of the hikes and it was nice to know which ones would be most difficult and to tell him what to expect on the hike."},{"Title":"Health Policymaking in the United States (3rd Edition)","review":"This book has some good content but needs some polishing.

These women were amazingly diverse, their letters ranging from kindly requests to their husbands on behalf of others to arrogant demands to their sons; from mundane business like household expenses to true slices of history, like Eleanor of Aquitaine's desperate plea to the Pope for her imprisoned son and the love letter that sent Catherine Howard to the executioner's block. There are also interesting summaries before each woman's letters of their place in history and the lives of their husbands and sons. Not to be missed by anyone interested in the periods involved."},{"Title":"Ambassadors at Sea: the High and Low Adventures of a Diplomat","review":"Ambassadors at Sea by Ambassador Henry Catto is an informative look through the back door and into the closets of world leaders. By recounting his experience on a very personal level, you live with the author among those on the international stage whose personas are usually submerged into and behind their official facades. Ambassadors at Sea is thus a footnote to history, and will appeal to those who wish to delve deeper than the news releases and headline portraits of those who shaped the world during a very crucial period of our history.Jesse H.Oppenheimer San Antonio, Texas"},{"Title":"Ambassadors at Sea: the High and Low Adventures of a Diplomat","review":"&quot;Ambassadors at Sea&quot; by Henry Catto is an informative, and at the same time,delightful book. Ambassador Catto has recounted his experiences as ambassador first to El Salvador and later to Great Britain, as Chief of Protocol, as head of the United States Information Agency, Ambassador to the European Office of the United Nations,and spokeperson for the Pentagon under Secretary of Defense,Cap Weinberger.There are wonderful anecdotes about all the Presidents he served under:Reagan,Bush, Nixon, and Ford, as well as interesting asides about Nancy Reagan, Henry Kissinger, Margaret Thatcher, and countless foreign dignitaries.Catto expresses his reactions to the famous and the fatuous in an honest and self-deprecating way. For example:he refers to a conversation with Nancy Reagan at a dinner party by commenting,&quot;To say she was hard to talk to would be a gross understatement&quot;,or on President Nixon;&quot;I never heard anyone accuse him of having a sense of humor&quot;.These bits of information make for fun reading., This book is both educational and enjoyable. What more can you ask!"},{"Title":"Ambassadors at Sea: the High and Low Adventures of a Diplomat","review":"This Ambassador has written a beautiful and witty book. It is a joyous romp through a glamorous career in which he finds himself in the &quot;sea&quot; of the world's great and powerful and enjoys every minute of it. Ambassador Catto worked in important positions under several administrations from the 60's to the 90's, including appointments in the Departments of State and Defense, US Ambassador to the UN (Geneva), Great Britain and El Salvador, as well as Chief of Protocol, and Head of US. Information Service and League of Pan American States. His perceptions give depth and breadth to the history and newsmakers of the past four decades, and shine light through keyholes of the rich and powerful. Ambassador Catto's view is so optimistic and good natured, you can't help but feel the past 50 years have been great after all. American Ambassadors have a reputation for being big financial contributors to presidential campaigns but not necessarily knowledgeable of languages, world history or foreign affairs, or sensitive, compassionate and tactful. Ambassador Catto, however breaks the stereotype and is uniquely qualified. As a knowledgeable businessman he was able to promote American business interests abroad, and being fluent in French and Spanish and a lover of people, and art and literature of other cultures, he was always comfortable in any society. His book is written with unfailing generosity of spirit, humbly giving credit for his successes throughout the book to his brilliant wife and others, including his good friend, President George Bush. He manages to be humorous, poignant and poetic all at the same time. I think his book should be made into a movie with Bill Murray starring as the lovable roving chief of protocol and ambassador. It wouldn't be Saturday Night Live, but it would be lively."},{"Title":"Ambassadors at Sea: the High and Low Adventures of a Diplomat","review":"Ambassadors At Sea, a private memoir of a public life, reads like a novel that you can't put down. In in, Catto---a self-described small-town Texas boy who grew up to be a Washington insider--takes us on a tour of his career in various high-level positions under several Presidents, culminating with his appointment as Ambassador to the Court of St. James, where he hung out with such world-stage stars as Margaret Thatcher. But Catto's book is not a dry laundry-list of a diplomatic career, but rather, a witty, moving, and always fascinating story of the wholly human characters who most of us see only through headlines---as well as the personal sacrifices and conflicts that Catto himself experienced. Throughout it all, Catto is charmingly self-effacing and always very witty. I simply couldn't put the book down--and was sorry when I came to the last page."},{"Title":"Coreldraw 7: The Official Guide","review":"Not having a full (i.e. reasonable) manual supplied with Corel Draw 7 Select Edition, I was looking for a more in-depth book and this seems a reasonable choice.

However I found most of the book quite useful but I have mixed feelings about some of the examples produced by the author, some of which are very crude.

Whitford writes engagingly and informatively. He begins by sketching the prehistory of the school in the 19th century arts-and-crafts movement and then goes on to examine van der Velde and the Weimar Art School that served as the basis upon which Gropius established the school. Whitford deals with all the major figures in the fourteen-year history of the Bauhaus and he uses contemporary documents (journals, personal accounts, etc.) to tell the story. I rank this among the best books in the Thames &amp; Hudson series. In fact, I assigned it as a required text in a course on the Bauhaus and the Weimar Republic. Incidentally, teachers might be interested to know that Whitford has also written and narrated a fine 60&quot; film &quot;Bauhaus: Face of the 20th Century&quot; (available in the Films for the Humanities series.)"},{"Title":"The Bauhaus: Masters & Students by Themselves","review":"Mister Whitford thoroughly chronicled the events that formed and shaped the Bauhaus - from the very beginning to the unfortunate end.

The author describes the historical context of the Bauhaus school, the development of the Bauhaus style, key figures at the school and within the movement, and the influence of Bauhaus art and design on future artistic styles. Most of the illustrations are black-and-white period photographs; the remainder (approximately 20%) are in color.This is a well-constructed paperback with a strong binding. It is a good introduction to Bauhaus, and also a good source for undergraduate students researching the style. For libraries with strong art and design collections, this volume complements others that focus on individual artists and designers."},{"Title":"The Bauhaus: Masters & Students by Themselves","review":"Frank Whitford provides an essential introduction to the Bauhaus in his book, titled simply--Bauhaus. Whitford follows the events of the school from a historical perspective starting with Walter Gropius' plan and motivation for the school, to its ultimate end in Dessau at the hand of the Nazis. Whitford also presents personal perspectives through the journal entries and personal letters of the staff and students of the Bauhaus. These personal accounts help create a connection between the historical and the personal, and track the change in mood within the school. Whitford's book spends very little time on the impact of the Bauhaus, which is an analysis beyond the scope of this book. Frank Whitford's book, Bauhaus should be of interest to any student of art, design or education.Copyright 2007 Of My Own Design, Josh Crain.

I probably would not have bought this otherwise. With that preface in mind... the book was pretty good. It gives a thorough history of the Bauhaus. That is why it gets high marks from me; it does what it was supposed to do.Now for the problems. The book reads like an art history book: very dry. A few of the students in my class had trouble getting past the first few pages. Second, the book is broken up into chapters based on content area. This makes it difficult to understand the whole timeline of the Bauhaus.

If you love Yanni's music, you will love this book too. It is Yanni's story of growing up in Greece, putting his all into swimming, becoming a Greek champion and then just giving it up. It is the story of Yanni coming to the United States, going to college and discovering that music is really everything that he is about. It is the story of Yanni devoting his life to music - rock and roll, drugs, promiscuity first - and then finding his way back to the music that he is so incredibly exceptional at composing and playing. It is the story of Yanni finding love with Linda Evans and then losing it because he put his all into having the world discover his music and then burned out from the pressure and just gave it all up. It is the story of Yanni finding his way back (through his deep depression) to his music and his destiny to share it with the world. Throughout the book Yanni says, \\"Faith is the engine and passion is the fuel.\\" Fighting his way back through his depression showed him and his fans that he has faith in himself and his music and that he is incredibly passionate about both. The book is written quite candidly and with intense emotion. It gives Yanni's fans a glimpse into his private life and the love and gratitude he has for his mother and father and the way they raised him and believed in his dreams too. In the book Yanni talks about \\"...cashing it all in and going to live on a beach someday.\\" Hopefully, this will not happen for a long, long time.

For as well known as his music is, until now no one has known much about the man. He&#65533;s given many interviews over the years but has revealed precious little about the events that have shaped his life and set him on a course to unparalleled success in the instrumental music industry. Let&#65533;s face it, Yanni&#65533;s success in instrumental music is nothing short of a miracle. There are many other instrumental artists who are just as talented but none have achieved his level of success. Why? Is the music of Constance Demby or David Arkenstone any less moving? Different, yes. But no less moving. Many instrumental artists have the capacity to profoundly affect people in ways that lyrical music cannot. And yet, Yanni is the only one who has reached countless millions around the globe and has even beaten Garth Brooks in concert gross revenue. Whether you love Yanni or find him easy to hate, still you must ask yourself how someone who does primarily instrumental music can reach so many.Yanni In Words is a very moving and extremely candid autobiography. His honesty about who he is and where he has come from is commendable considering how he has been pigeon-holed as such a gentle soul based on the sound of his music. Has anyone who&#65533;s seen Yanni perform or heard his uplifting compositions ever pictured him as someone who spent several years in a rock band doing not only original tunes but also ZZ Top cover tunes? Could anyone ever conceive of his having used drugs or of him having been rather promiscuous? Can anyone picture him \\"bombed\\", or as a long-time smoker? I&#65533;ve met several people who&#65533;ve put Yanni on a pedestal to the point of making him a god, less than human. Well, if you read this autobiography, there will be no question in your mind. He&#65533;s just another Joe Schmo like the rest of us! His unending drive and determination just happened to thrust him into the spotlight.Yanni in Words is a fascinating narrative of one man&#65533;s determination to get his hard-to-classify music heard. He begins with the events of his days in his birthplace, Kalamata, Greece, where he broke the Greek National Freestyle swimming record at the age of 14, without the benefit of professional training. He continues to his immigration to America at the age of 18 to his tinkering with original melodies on a dilapidated piano in a University of Minnesota college dorm where he studied psychology. He elaborates on his struggles with his first record label, Private Music (now owned by BMG), and moves into his coaching from, romantic involvement and eventual break-up with Linda Evans. He goes into detail on the monumental undertakings which were the &#65533;Live at the Acropolis&#65533; and &#65533;Tribute&#65533; projects. Both of these stories will inspire the most jaded to continue in perseverance of their own dreams no matter the capacity!This autobiography is a poignant and completely moving account of how success can be achieved against all odds. As I read it, I laughed aloud as Yanni recounts events such as a dinner he attended one night in China in conjunction with his performance at the Forbidden City. There he drank &#65533;their grappa &#65533; that tastes like socks fermented in gasoline.&#65533; He talks about &#65533;suspicious&#65533; dishes revolving past him on a lazy susan which he was urged to try because they were Chinese delicacies &#65533; &#65533;parts of animal bodies that I chose not to examine too closely.&#65533; About the &#65533;grappa&#65533; he says, &#65533; Drink one shot of that and you can eat anything. I remember getting pretty bombed that night and thinking perhaps I should have drunk some before the meal.&#65533;I felt the intensity of his depressed and burned out state as he spoke of staring at his hands upon waking up the day after the Tribute tour ended. &#65533;I realized without a shred of emotion that I didn&#65533;t care if I ever touched a piano again.&#65533; And he didn&#65533;t &#65533; for an entire year! For a man who lives, eats, breathes and sleeps music, that&#65533;s pretty amazing - but as he states, he knew he had limits but had never found them. When he did, he crashed and burned!Some Yanni nay-sayers may call what he has done in writing this autobiography &#65533;calculated&#65533;. In other words, he&#65533;s told his story which has been a relative enigma all these years to capitalize on his success. If that&#65533;s how some feel, tell me how it&#65533;s a bad idea to keep the public interested. Quite the contrary! If you want to stay in the public consciousness, you reinvent yourself and plaster your face along with your music everywhere you can! The average person has a very short attention span and they need to see as well as hear something more than once to remember it, particularly in the world we live in where we&#65533;re constantly bombarded by advertising. While Yanni will certainly receive monetary gain from book sales, I think he had a story to tell; a story he needed to tell. In a recent interview, he said, &#65533;A lot of the fans feel they know me through the music, and they do. They can feel the emotions that I deal with in the music, and they connect with it. I did it (wrote the book) to show that if a little boy from Kalamata, Greece, can do what I've done, then anyone can do it.&#65533;Yanni&#65533;s honesty in past indiscretions reveals a human being that has learned the lessons of life. His powerful views on creativity and his belief that anyone can not only exercise it, but become successful in it, are proven by his forceful will, unyielding drive and the immense level of success that resulted.Even if you are not a Yanni fan, I recommend this book. The reason is simple. If you are interested in studying what leads to the achievement of a dream, then here in plain English, is the story of an average flesh and blood man, flaws and all, talking about how he achieved the impossible. It wasn&#65533;t easy. In fact, some of what he ran up against would seem insurmountable to most people. Is Yanni unique in achieving success against all odds? Certainly not. But his story is inspiring and he is yet another person to study if you have a dream that seems impossible. We all have them and we all need inspiration."},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"I wonder why MARY from Long Island have it 2 stars...I've read many biographies, but this one is by far the best. This isn't one of those &quot;I wish this was shorter&quot; or &quot;*Yawn*&quot; type books. In this book, Yanni is very articulate about his emotions, but even more, it's exciting. It covers everything from his childhood in a picturesque seaside village to his historic concerts at the Taj Mahal to his insights on creativity. Words aren't quite my medium either, i'm an introvert, but I feel that people need to know about this book. Even if you're not a Yanni fan, this book teaches many valuable lessons, which has begun to make my life better believe it or not. And more than often, I've laughed my head off at some wonderfully hilarious moments.This truly is the man behind the music, or even more the spirit behind mankind."},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"Yanni is a genius and you should listen to his \\"Yanni- Live at Acroplis\\", \\"In my time\\" and \\"If I could tell you\\" to believe this.The chapter on creativity is so powerful and revealing. He shows you how he creates music by 'going into the black and surrendering to the unknown' and how you can do the same too. He says you can use the same process to create the life you want. The chapter itself reads like a poem. The author has done a great job understanding Yanni's life and philosophy and putting that into words."},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"A few reviewers refer to Yanni as arrogant and an ego maniac, so while I read the book, I was looking for those qualities in him. They're just not there. He actually has a lot of humility and at the same time a gratitude for and belief in his own power to create.He's very likeable and I found myself smiling at how he put things. He's actually very funny. I'm glad to have read it."},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"This is a book that Yanni fans should enjoy, assuming they are capable of remembering that Yanni is a human being. (Which means that...pause for a shudder...he actually did some not nice things in younger times.) Sheesh, people, get real. Is it really a shock?What are really amazing, though, are the stories of the travails that Yanni experienced while getting his music out to the many millions who now listen to it. It wasn't easy. The story behind the Acropolis concert, and then the tales from the Taj Mahal and Forbidden City concerts is worth the price of admission. Both the good and the bad!But you also have the story of Yanni discovering true, deep, and sadly rare love, and losing it. You have the driven nature, the obsession with making the music perfect, and giving the gift of his wonderful music to the masses, and the ensuing breakdown. You easily understand and appreciate the ties that bind, the family love and support, and the friendships that Yanni has formed over the years.This is an inspirational book. It does not come close to a masterpiece--you should listen to the music for masterpieces. But it is a good book for those fans that want to know more, or even those who don't much like the music but enjoy stories of hardship, perseverance and success."},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"I've been a fan of Yanni for a while now. I absolutely love his music. So when I heard about this book I had to get it. It's obvious Yanni gives his music 110% and after reading this book I realize Yanni gives everything 110%. The book is very interesting, starting with Yanni has a young boy and progressing through his rock band years, his relationship with Linda Evans, and his struggles putting on the Acropolis and Taj Mahal shows. The book was never boring. If you wonder how he got to where he is today this book is for you. If you think Yanni is \\"gay\\" (literal or figurative) and just for women, you'll be pleasantly suprised. If you think he got to be so successful because he was a born natural, you'll be suprised again. So how did he do it? You'll have to read the book to find out but basically it was tons of hard work and lots of passion. And that's what I enjoyed the most about this book, it's very inspirational. After reading it I really felt motivated to work harder at my goals and not to give up. That's why I think this book would appeal to non-fans as well. Everyone can make their dream come true."},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"I have always been a fan of Yanni. When his book came out I couldn't wait to read it. I was not disappointed - the book gave me insight into a person who overcame challenges, reached success and then had setbacks. A story similar to many of our own lives. I found his story inspiring. I would recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"With my busy everyday life I never find a minute to read the many books I have purchased. For the first time I dropped everything and read \\"YANNI IN WORDS\\" in just a short time!I really wanted to know about the man behind the fabulous music we are all lucky to have now in our lifetime.I was very interested to read about his childhood in Greece, his teen years and his success in music. I feel, his biggest daring challenge as a teenager was to leave his parents and hometown that he loved so much, to come to a great new country, America!He went through hard, lonely, sad and happy times, all which were expiriences that helped make him the man he is today. This book is very inspiring for all ages who have a goal and want to succeed.He brings out how difficult it is and how it IS possible! A challenge and a dream for anyone! Now he is also great writer with a wonderful personality!"},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"This is \\"can't put down\\" reading! How enormous a task it must be to bare your soul like Yanni has done! He has exposed himself for the human being that he is, warts and all. I find that very refreshing. Anyone who has a spark of creativity, whether it be music, art, writing, etc. will find inspiration in Yanni's words. This book is so loaded with powerful thoughts on how to pursue a dream that it not only serves as an autobiography of Yanni, but a thought provoking textbook for \\"you can do.\\" I feel I could really use a hi-lighter and red pen to mark areas to read again and again. Yanni went to college to become a psychologist but instead entered the world of music. While reading his words, one realizes he has immense talent in both areas. If you love Yanni's music, but want him to remain a Greek god on a pedestal, this book may disappoint you. If you want to know how he attained his goals in life and be inspired by this talented, but also very human man, this is a must read!"},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"I found Yanni to be very forthcoming about his life and experiences. Anyone interested in the hows and whys of the lives of famous individuals will enjoy Yanni's story of his reach for fame, his relationship with his family members, his birthplace, and his quest to embrace his &quot;focus&quot; for his particular brand of creativity. The chapter that spoke to me was the one that deals with the creative process, for artists and non-artists alike. Being an painter myself, I could definately relate to how he tries to find that balance between creating art and living life, in otherwords making a dollar to pay the rent. An easy read, I did it in a day."},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"Good deal. I ordered the used one and to my surprise, the book I received looks like a new one!

Will recommend this to all Yanni fans ..."},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"Just finished this book, took two days, hard to put down. Honesty and sincerity come across pretty strong and he is more than open about his shortcomings. It covered the period I was interested in, till about 2000, so more has been done since then but it probably followed the same pattern already spelled out in the book. I was disappointed that he didn't cover more about the music and the artists he worked with in his orchestra, I know there are several that have interesting backgrounds but the book mostly stayed on himself his philosophy, feelings and business dealings. Guess he figured those people could write there own book but for someone with such a high musical IQ I was interested to see what he thought of their talents and or lack of."},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"I am so glad that I own this Book. I think I did give a review once already on this Book. I don't read Music, but the Photo's that come with this Book, made the whole purchase very well worth the price. I'm glad that I've got it."},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"I''ve been a big fan of Yanni's over the years, but not so much where I knew his life story. After seeing his most recent concert for his new CD Ethnicity, I was inspired to read his book. I was pleasantly surprised that the book kept me glued from page to page. There were things I learned about Yanni I never knew. It's easy to conjure up an image of a famous entertainer based on interviews, media coverage, etc. His &quot;story&quot; was actually very enlightening -- like, I always thought Yanni was a health nut. I find out he's a big smoker and coffee drinker. (I think he's since quit smoking.) I thought he had help along the way in building his amazing career. He did not. He had to do it all on his own. The book reveals the amazing battle he had convincing the music industry of the appeal of his music. Yanni had to make everything in his career happen himself - including gambling millions of his own money to make the Acroplis, Taj Mahal, and Forbidden City concerts happen. It paid off for him in spades.I also got insight into his relationship with Linda Evans. Linda participated in this book.In the end, I now look at Yanni a little differently. When I listen to his music, I &quot;hear&quot; more -- I know his story from whence these songs come.Yanni fans will not be disappointed with this book. It's a very candid and honest account of Yanni's life.I can't imagine anyone other than a Yanni fan or one who appreciates the kind of music and artistry he's created caring to read this book though."},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"I have always been a devoted Yanni fan! I listen to his music at home, office and in the car. Yanni music can be smooth when you want to relax, it can be inspirational when you need that and simply good music when you're in the mood of pumping up the volume. The perfect breathtaking blend! I've been recently to a Yanni concert and all I can say is that I will never forget those three hours. I was simply in awe!Now about the book: I have to say that this book is one of the most inspiring books I've read thus far! Yanni's story behind the scenes is a story of courage and sacrifice, emotions and extraordinary strength. His life before, during and after Linda Evans is very moving and encouraging and buckets of virtues can be inspired simply by reading about it.Having read the book and been to his concert I now look at Yanni differently. When I listen to his music, I understand more, I understand the meaning in these tunes without lyrics. There is so much more meaning, peace and emotions to his songs than what it appears.However, one part of the book disappointed me. For the life of me I cannot understand why Yanni has chosen to write about his intimate life as a kid? And with such graphical detail? Instead of trying to forget that disgusting part of his life, he seems to still get a kick out of it. It almost seems like he is encouraging it. I honestly believe that Yanni, the Mozart of our time, will one day terribly regret portraying himself as so shallow repeatedly in his book!The phrase \\"Don't judge a book by its cover,\\" can be applied for this book positively as well as negatively. Never would I think that Yanni's story is so inspirational, yet I would never dream that he can be so low! If you read this book, you will understand the praise and the critique!"},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"When I first bought the book, I was very excited to start reading it.

It is so fascinating to read all about Yanni's life, beginning with his parent's courtship in Greece; his childhood and teen years; through his struggles as a musician starting out and even more struggles staging his concerts around the world. Even though David Remsin co- wrote the book, I could tell it was Yanni speaking. LOTS of juicy stuff too from his days as a rock &amp; roller.

I found it to bean enjoyable saga of Yanni's personal life. I am a big Yanni fan and relate so much to the Spirit and Soul of his music. With that in mind, I was very interested in finding out a little about this talented musician. I was so appreciative of the simplistic way the Yanni's story unfolds. I got a glimpse into the life of a man who is naturally gifted and talented. He is also a man who cares very deeply for humanity. I enjoyed reading about his day to day struggles, his fierce determination to break into the music industry with fresh and innovative music ideas, as well as the sharing of his philosophy on life. I am grateful especially for his sharing of how he taps into the creative force. There are also excerpts from Linda Evans (Dynasty) who he dated for nine years which I enjoyed reading about. If you are a fan of instrumentals one should try his music, it's very original and spiritually enlightening. It transcends any genres so don't try to pigeon hole his music. The book in and of itself helps you to see why. I often think abaout musicians and how much they give to the public in order to enrich, entertain and heal our lives; Yanni is one such entertainer/music therapist and I am truly grateful for his music as well as the honest account found within the pages of this book. Much love and healing sent back to you Yanni."},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"I have been a big Yanni fan for years and when I heard about this book; his autobiography I got extremely excited.

Granted there are some \\"skeletons\\" in his closet he is not particularly proud of, but it is truly inspirational how he overcomes to fulfill his life-long dream to be where he is, and truly be happy and content not only with his God-given talent, but with WHO he is a person!Thanks Yanni, for being brutally honest, and sharing some wonderful nuggets we all need to hear!"},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"This is a terrific autobiography about how Yanni achieved his success.

With Greek mania occuring at every corner (think Olympics, think Greek Weddings, think George Michael, think YANNI!), there could not be a better time for Yanni to have his memoir published.

I felt Yanni was talking directly to me. It held my attention and I loved reading about his childhood and his life philosophy. He admits his shortcomings but is also very inspirational. I was intrigued by his descriptions of how he goes into a 'zone' when creating his music where he is able to step outside of it during creation and not judge it until way after it is completed. His mother's spirituality and her prayer power was also motivating. I can't wait to go back now and re-watch my Acropolis video now that I know all he went thru to get there. Thanks for providing such lovely music, Yanni. You are living proof that you can truly do whatever you put your mind to."},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"As a newcoming listener to Yanni's compositions, I wanted to know more about the talented mind and philosophical greek that is Yanni Chryssomalis. Reading this book not only helped me to see him more as a person rather than just an artist with smouldering good looks, but it also motivated me. I found it to be very open, and humble in a sense. It's not your formal typical autobiography; it's graphic, and moving. I can only say that I think it's very bold of an artist of Yanni's caliber to be so honest and open with readers. Yanni is indeed an over-achiever, but he has come so far because he has \\"worked hard\\" for it. One thing that we should always hold present is that the media's portrayal of \\"Yanni\\" is one thing, whereas Yanni Chryssomallis is a whole different story. Once we realize that Yanni is not infallible and that he is human just like the rest of us, we will be able to digest this book without the unnecessary criticism and judgement."},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"I picked up the book because I love the man's music but my expectations were not high.

A look into what makes music,creativity and an inspiring life. In Yanni's words &quot;Dive in, and let the magic begin.&quot;"},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"YANNI IN WORDS, the awaited biography, of a great instrumental artist.The book is magnificent, full of events, stories &amp; lessons... Yanni is very open and honest, discussing most of his life details. The book is very surprising infact in several aspects.It's inspiring, emotional, interesting, uplifting, optimistic &amp; detailed.I recommend this book to all, whether fans or non-Yanni fans, since the book mainly focuses on life aspects, and how Yanni dealt with such situations. It's like talking about his journey with life, rather than focusing on his music only &amp; himself.Personally, I learnt many things about the man, life, and success, which shall benefit anyone who reads it. Yanni talks about his experiences, music, creativity, childhood, relations, concerts, achievements, his parents, Greece, etcI see YANNI IN WORDS as a book about Life, rather than just a simple biography of an artist. Simply, you live it... :)Way to go Yanni, another great master piece of work! ;)"},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"My review is a bit biased because I am a true Yanni fan that has been very moved by his music. His book is a candid look at the artist with fascinating details of the music business and the arduous road to stardom. Yet I have found its greatest value in the example of Yanni's pluck, drive, and determination to create his own musical genre and to have it heard even against insurmountable obstacles. A true &quot;believe in yourself&quot; kind of book that will encourage the reader to appreciate their own journey and to live with no limits. While his words can never compete with the depth of emotion and awakening his music gifts the listener, it is still a fascinating read of an exemplary life. Hard to put down."},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"Every chapter in the book was interesting and entertaining. He talked about a wide variety of things happening in his life. He did not limit it to a couple. Hopefully it puts an end to a lot of peoples questions about him and Linda Evans and they will not keep asking about Linda Evans several years after they broke up."},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"This is an awesome history of life. Yanni teach us through the book how to make creativity flourish and how we must use it in our daily life.I didn't want to finish reading the book fot it is so amazing!"},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"Not a real \\"can't put it down\\" kind of book, but very interesting."},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"This is a terrific autobiography about how Yanni achieved his success. By telling many of vivid real stories, we could see the pictures of the self-confident Greek young boy got National swimming championship at his 14, and then he moved to the United States to study and achieve his M.A degree in Psychology at University of Minnesota. To pursue the musical dream, he overcome the pain of losing the love ones, being cheated by his best friend, being satirized by others, putting all of the money into adventure, etc. Eventually, Yanni gained the spectacular recognition from the world. Especially, the book also shows extreme love and respect to Yanni's parents, who give him a beautiful childhood and taught him about truth, imagination, creativity, love, kindness, and compassion.Like Yanni said in the book, &quot;you don't have to follow&quot;, he did what he felt right. With his persistence and Linda's enlightenment, Yanni created the unique music, which like his personality-- passionate, inspirational, and natural.However, nothing can be perfect in life. Yanni is not a perfect musician; he has shortcoming as well as ordinary individual. Just because of this, we could see the integrity of him."},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"I needed a kick to move on to better things and picking up this book did it! I know understand his music more, for I know what he was living as he created it. Thanks for sharing part of your life Yanni."},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"This book is unlike anything I have ever experienced. It's, like, whoooah. It kinda made me ... well ... y'know. All over. Inside, too. Yanni manages to transcend the ephemera of life amazingly, making it all transparent to searchers. Even the most sceptical of readers will not fail to benefit from his eclectic witch's brew of spirituality and folk wisdom. The only reason it gets three stars rather than five is because I got it accidentally, whilst trying to buy a(nother excellent) book about Yannick Noah."},{"Title":"Yanni In Words (Signed Presentation Copy)","review":"A thoroughly bland book, written in a matter-of-fact, flat narrative -- sorely lacking depth and dimension. There is no sign of introspection or personal reflection, only Yanni's inflated ego. The book is a simple-minded retelling of his life. Yanni's self importance and arrogance lurk throughout. While he purports to &quot;tell it like it is,&quot; it is apparent he is most concerned with portraying himself in a certain light. Even when he talks about things like his rock 'n roll days, he makes sure he doesn't come off looking too bad, i.e. &quot;every one was doing it then&quot; and &quot;I was always upfront with the girls before getting intimate with them.&quot; (Hmmmm). It seems his ego is such that he can't really reflect upon his own weaknesses and mistakes - he can only make excuses. His memory and accounts of some of the facts in the book are equally biased and inaccurate. One can only hope that he isn't as monochromatic and one-dimensional in his own mind as he comes off in this book."},{"Title":"Heel and Toe: The Climbs of Greater Vedauwoo, Wyoming","review":"My wife and I are 50ish and have been climbing for three years. We cut our outdoor teeth on Veedauwoo and found Heel and Toe invaluable. Based on our knowledge of the area and compared with other guidebooks we've used, the book is an excellent aid. Area directions and photos are great, route descriptions accurate, and route grades on target. Some tongue-in-cheek humor mixed in (Jurassic Park). More important than our assessment, it is the guide that is used. Skip and Rob did a great job. Hope there's a sequel with updates."},{"Title":"Heel and Toe: The Climbs of Greater Vedauwoo, Wyoming","review":"The Vedauwoo area is unique in it's diversity of climbs and the climbers that frequent this area. This Guide Book has captured both aspects: the wild and mystical Spirit of Vedauwoo and the Hard Core attitude of the climbers. It covers the range of climbs from the Raw Gut Beginners to the Hard Skinned Off-Width Crack climbers that Shred their way up impossible looking ascents. The photos and route lay-outs are simply the best of any guide book in the Rocky Mtn. region and route descriptions give you JUST enough information without taking all the Adventure out of the climb!! A MUST HAVE !! for any climber in the area."},{"Title":"Heel and Toe: The Climbs of Greater Vedauwoo, Wyoming","review":"Heel and Toe is a necessity for anyone planning on spending time climbing, hiking or camping at Vedauwoo. The maps and photographs clearly illustrate the area."},{"Title":"Heel and Toe: The Climbs of Greater Vedauwoo, Wyoming","review":"...I have found that this guide documents alot of the climbing at Vedauwoo very well, but misses the mark entirely in some cases. After getting to know the long time local climbers it is really sad to find out that Skip Harper has taken lots of liberties with renaming routes, or assigning grades to routes that he abviously has not done. I give his book a two star rating just because of the lack of investigation in some cases and the complete disregarding of history that he puts forth in his book."},{"Title":"The Notebooks of Serafino Gubbio: Or, Shoot (Dedalus Nobel Prize Winner)","review":"Pirandello's execution is here exhibited in a pitch perfect symphonic staging. The Nobel Prize winning Italian author allows for the blurring of reality with art to take center stage, as existential absurdist tendencies of a transcendent consciousness adequately and subtly morph the spectacle of life into a vacillating universe where introspection is a projection of aloofness. The narrator is a cameraman for the fledgling movie industry in the early 1920s, and he seems to unravel the momentum of agency all around him are subject to. The Sysophian trade of being human is wrung to its dry core as being is culminated in a distant absent audition of one's own presence. It is undeniably a vintage Pirandello here, and even if his prefferred genra was the theatrical staging of like absurdist dramas, for reasons that are philosophical as much as literary, we read a narrative from the first person perspective that cradles the death of the actor, the indifference of being with abandon.The primary reason for this review is not so much to praise Pirandello with accolades he has already been favoured by, rather it is to applaud the translator Nicoletta Sinborowski, who in her able, illuminating and sensible art infuses a work with the same scintillating force as the original. A previous translation by CK Scott Moncrieff had been unable to reproduce such a marvelous poetic incandescence in \\"Shoot!\\", the literal yet inaccurate rendition of the title \\"Si Gira!\\" which implies cyclical tendencies rather than violent adumbrations(yes Moncrieff, the outstanding translator of Proust, perhaps here in a moment of senility). We welcome Sinborowski's work, who in \\"The Late Mattia Pascal\\" and Mirbeau's \\"Abbe Jules\\" and \\"Sebastian Roch\\" has alreay identified herself as a major, budding presence in English literature. She may well do for such literature what Gregory Rabassa has done for Spanish works, or Louise Varese for Rimbaud, or William Weaver for Eco, not to mention the above critizied Moncrieff for Proust.Intelligent, sparkling, eloquent, artistic, imaginative and nuanced to perfection in its lyrical and tonal stamp we welcome her for it seems that the days of JG Nichols (who has mauled many giants of Italian literature)of Willaim Fowlie's psychodelic homoerotic stutterings, or even Richard Howard's stagnant indiscretions are over, and a counterpart to the Spanish translators school, where we include Margaret Jull Costa, may yet grace us with brilliant renditions of literature that asks questions we should not avoid lest we become as prosaic as a JG Nichols' translation.I am sure Luigi Pirandello is as grateful to Nicoletta Sinborowski as we are."},{"Title":"Few Survived: History of Submarine Disasters","review":"If you have any interest in submarine accidents and rescues, this is the book for you. We learn of accidents from the earliest experiments centuries ago to the 1990's, and from little known mishaps to famous disasters like the Thresher and Thetis. Gray explains how these accidents happened and how technologies, like the Momsen lung and diving bells, have saved lives in seemingly hopeless situations.Gray says in his introduction that he wrote the book in part to come to terms with his fears of such horrid situations and indeed the terror of being trapped 150 feet under water in a dark sub is easy to understand. Sometimes it is much less simple to see just how a few managed to escape after all! One may feel the need to study hydro-dynamics and physics to truly comprehend how rescue is possible.I think Gray spends too much time trying to describe every accident on record. This approach adds little to the book and gives it a choppy quality. He should have concentrated on the major disasters and rescues and left the others to a listing in the Appendix at the end. But the book suffers little for this. Also, readers should be aware that an updated version is out that covers the Kursk disaster of 2000."},{"Title":"Celluloid Mavericks: A History of American Independent Film Making","review":"This is the best book ever written on independent film. I wish I could give it move than 5 stars, because Celluloid Mavericks is a pure pleasure to read: witty, informative and always extremely entertaining. No other book comes close to its breadth and detail, especially in regards to the previously uncharted territory between 1896 and 1960. This is my all-time favorite film book, well deserving of its many raves reviews."},{"Title":"Celluloid Mavericks: A History of American Independent Film Making","review":"This was the book that needed to be written on indie film. It's amazingly thorough, covering 1896-1999 and all types of film (not just &quot;art films&quot;), including exploitation. Merritt has done a fantastic job with much penetrating research, great photos, incredible stories, etc. At nearly 500 pages with dozens of rare photos, this might be the best bargain on amazon.com. This is my first 5 star review, but this book blew me away!"},{"Title":"Celluloid Mavericks: A History of American Independent Film Making","review":"&quot;Celluloid Mavericks,&quot; by Greg Merritt, New York, Thunder's Mouth Press, c2000, 463pp.On the one hand, filmmakers want to be courted by the studios, to receive phone calls telling them that yes, we are going to finance your picture big time. On the other hand, directors want creative control. They do not want Paramount and Warner and Fox and Universal to dictate what they put into their films. Those film- makers who are adamant about creative freedom may actually choose to raise the money for their films on their own, without any help from the big OR small distributors. What they produce completely without help from studios is called independent cinema, or indies. Some of these indies are later picked up by studios. They're still indies.Other filmmakers are willing to accept a even considerable degree of control from the suits in return for wide distribution and big bucks. Their movies are called commercial.As Greg Merritt points out in his lively new book &quot;Celluloid Mavericks: A History of American Independent Film,&quot; a large segment of films actually fit into a less precise category that he'd call semi-indies. Semi-indies are those works which are not produced by studios but do have guarantees of distribution before they are made. &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; is his example of a semi-indie, the $2,500 &quot;David Holzman's Diary,&quot; which consists simply of a man talking to a camera, is independent, and &quot;Titanic&quot; is commercial. Merritt's definition is distinct from that of &quot;Variety&quot; critic Emanuel Levy's, who states in his own recent book &quot;Cinema of Outsiders&quot; (reviewed in the February OFCS journal), that an indie is a film produced outside the studio network but one which must essentially be challenging, edgy, a personal vision. While Levy does not recognize the separate category of semi- indies, for his part Merritt does not require his indies to be edgy.He divided the book chronologically rather than topically but within each chapter, he sorts out the movies according to genre--gay films, porno, African-American pix, films that have more gentility than edge (such as &quot;Room with a View&quot;), sexploitation, blaxploitation, horror and the like. What may surprise some readers is that indies did not have their origin within our own lifetimes but actually were given birth in 1896, as one-minute flicks screened between vaudeville acts at Koster and Bial's Music Hall in New York on April 23. One of these flicks, featuring a shot of waves breaking on a beach, caused the audience to recoil with fear of getting drenched. Talk of naivete! Today's audience might, if polite, stifle a yawn at even some of the magical, highly financed pictures produced by IMAX.Since studios until recently had been reluctant to finance pictures representing points of view that challenged American policy, we do not wonder that during the troubled times of the1930s, movies far to the left of center were not appreciated by the moneyed set. King Vidor won a stream of rejection letters for his proposed &quot;Our Daily Bread&quot; in 1934 but got his movie into production by putting up his own $90,000 and then securing a $125,000 bank loan. Though the movie was screened by Pres. Roosevelt at the White House and was ultimately released by United Artists, controversy mounted. The L.A. Examiner called the movie pinko and the LA Times refused to run ads. Truth to tell &quot;Our Daily Bread&quot; was not a good movie, Merritt acknowledges. The conflicts are slim and the people are not real. When asked to throw their possessions on a common pile, they comply like zombies. Conflict, says the author, should have been born out of the very concept of cooperative lving and its departures from capitalism. &quot;Our Daily Bread&quot; does show people finding the ultimate fulfillment through the strength of a collectivist group. No individual wealth, no structured government, no profit motive.Greg Merritt runs through hundreds of independent and semi- independent films in this manner. The breakthrough pics are given some analysis, brief, of course, since the book weighs in at only 462 pages. For the bulk of movies, Merritt must be content with appraisals of a sentence or two each.Here are some of his incisive statements...He calls the 1995 movie &quot;Safe&quot;--which plays like a disease- of-the-week TV movie but is really a devastating critique of the self-elp movement and the devastating effects of modern society &quot;one of the best movies of the decade.&quot; And remember that Merritt is no blurbmeister. He insists that the success of art films is driven by reviews and word-of-mouth; that those who regularly attend nonstudio fare are &quot;typically more discerning than others and place greater emphasis on critical opinion.&quot; (Take a bow, Harvey.) When art movies are marketed, the advertsiing is literate and subdued, reflecting an aura of quality and a lack of celebrities or explosions to hype.He describes how an ordinary person can make a micro- budget movie: 1) limit the number of locations and characters, avoiding extreme weather conditions; 2) finance with bank accounts and credit cards; 3) use a nonunion crew or union members willing to work nonunion including friends; 4) shoot 16mm black and white; 5) rent an editing machine. Still you're going to have a hard time because &quot;most movies made without a prior agreement with a studio are never screened in a commercial theater...their directors are never known.&quot;&quot;Celluloid Mavericks&quot; is not only good reading for those in the general public who want to know more about the movies but can stand as a handy reference guide for critics who can use the volume to enrich their own writing.

I found it delightfully humorous, but also disturbing in the way he takes on society so innocently. Later, I read Slaughterhouse Five, and I must be one of the few people who enjoyed Deadeye Dick more. Why? Maybe because he dosen't force you to think about how bad things are so much this time. Vonnegut allows you to read this book on different levels: enjoying a work of fiction or reading a strong message. I personally loved both."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"Only Vonnegut could make such a tragic story humorous. It probably will rank as one of his most memorable books in my mind. Vonnegut once again weaves his story between flashbacks and flashforwards and keeps the pages turning. I read this book on a flight to Chicago and almost passed on the peanuts so I would not be interrupted. Definitely one of his best."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"This was the first Vonnegut book that I read, and it will always be one of my favorite books.His characters are superb, the story is (as always) great, and his style of writing really draws you into the movie.I especially love the way Vonnegut uses his main character to tell the story in &quot;playwright&quot; fashion.This novel really draws you in to other Vonnegut books."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"Of course, I'd like it if he stomped on a club sandwhich, mimeographed it, and surrounded it with threadbare stories of his Indiana childhood.

A dark comedy involving one Rudy Waltz who accidentally shoots a pregnant woman, killing her and her child, when he points his gun out his window and fires for the sake of it. The book deals with one wild thing after another, and pokes fun at the darker side of nuclear bombs, Hitler's art, gourmet cooking, and public atrocity exhibitions of prisoners. A wild romp and one of the few later books that is a must for Vonnegut fans"},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"This is my first Vonnegut novel. With a quick pace and bizzare set of stories it kept me intrigued through and through. In my experience people either label Vonnegut as one of the best authors of our era, or merely as a gifted entertainer, both are accurate. I find his writing style compelling and very powerful. The story unwinds slowly, but you are forced to follow Vonnegut's mind to find out how or where you will turn up next, whether it be listening to a twelve year old wallow about his ignorant father, or curiously watching as the chairman of NBC loses yet another wife. If in reading a book you desire to see only the plausible happen then look elsewher, for here you never quite know what psychological quirk might be next"},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"It was ok. it was written in the usual eccentric vonnegut style, but i couldn't really get into it like I did with Bluebeard. Maybe i'm not reading into it deeply enough, i'm sure that's part of the case, but whatever. I found the whole tumor imagery especially disturbing, but i have to say that Rudy's playlets were hilarious."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"Even though I was a fan of Vonnegut before I picked up this book, I never quite understood what the whole &quot;funny/sad&quot; part of his books was. I enjoyed Vonnegut because he was thought-provoking and had crazy, page-turning ideas.Deadeye Dick, though, really captured that humor mixed with sadness. I find that Rudy Waltz is one of the most sympathetic characters in literature, and his struggles to overcome the stigma of being Deadeye Dick are genuinely moving. This is a good introduction to Vonnegut's work"},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"This is the fourth Vonnegut book I have read, and I have to say it's probably one of his best. The story was interesting, and the moral was well received. I also enjoyed the fact that some of his characters from Breakfast of Champions made appearances in the book."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"IMPORTANT NOTE:It is primitive that you read \\"Breakfast Of Champions\\" before tackling \\"Deadeye Dick\\". The reason being is that you will get the story details a little more, and previous characters of \\"BOC\\" also are in this story, which takes place in Midland City, Ohio as well. We have Dwayne Hoover(used car salesman),Celia Hoover(Drano woman and wife/ex of Dwayne), Bunny Hoover(homosexual son of Dwayne and Celia and a piano player at the Holiday Inn. Fred T.Berry as well and even Karabekian is mentioned. And Hitler.So who is \\"Deadeye Dick?\\", well his name is Rudy Waltz and he got his nickname from being on the roof of his house with a gun that accidentally went off. Said bullet traveled 3 miles and hit an innocent woman in her house while she was vacuum cleaning. And she was pregnant as well. This incident happened at a young age for Rudy and has spent the rest of his life as a depressed sad asexual man of guilt. His only one thing of achievement was a play he wrote called 'Katmandu', which played for one night in New York to horrible reviews. His one and only achievement in life which also leads to his downfall.We also hear about his past and his relationship with his father and Arthur Gunther, his muse.This book is about people, plain and simple people living in the boring town of Midland City, (or in any small town in America),and how they each mesh with each other in different ways that lead them to different stations in life.Similar in his works such as \\"Breakfast Of Champions\\", \\"Bluebeard\\" and \\"God Bless You, Mr.Rosewater\\". I have now read every title by Mr.Vonnegut and \\"Deadeye Dick\\" did not disappoint and left me with the same feeling as his older classics. Oh how I miss him, but every time you read one of his books, he's with you all the time.\\"Deadeye Dicks\\" peephole was opened in 1982 and hasn't closed yet or ever will."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"Of all the books in Vonnegut's body of work, this provides the bottom of the barrel. If one is to grant that each book is a mirror of where he was at in his life, it's safe to say this was a bottoming point before he was able to reflect upon it with a smirk. The miserable moments provide neither glimmers of hope nor wistful pronouncements of ironic futility. For fans, it's a must read because hr wrote it, but don't expect what you felt with &quot;Bluebeard,&quot; &quot;Breakfast of Champions,&quot; or &quot;Mother Night.&quot;"},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"After hearing so many extraordinary things about Kurt Vonnegut, particularly about Cat's Cradle, I jumped with delight when I saw Deadeye Dick selling for [$] at a used bookstand in NY. I'm beginning to wonder whether or not I could have used that [$] for something better.I was thoroughly encapsulated by Vonnegut's unique style and honesty throughout his introduction and the first few chapters of the novel, which I later found was the best part. I felt as if the entire novel was a setup for some plot that was going to develop, but when I reached the end I realized that that was it. Not to mention that the only character with any character at all was Rudy's father. Yeah, yeah, the book had societal symbolism and isolated incidents that stood on their own without a plot, but the story in which they were presented literally had no point and went absolutely nowhere, therefore diluting the value of those rare gems of scenes. In addition, most of the dialogue seemed forced, melodramatic, and unrealistic at times. Novels about nothing can be good reads, but for some reason Vonnegut missed the mark. Tom Robbins and John Irving are much better at accomplishing a realistic sense of grotesque absurdity in their symbolism of the world.I will give Vonnegut a second chance and will read Cat's Cradle. I hope I have a better experience."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"vonnegut is among my favorite authors and this book was not disappointing. it is actually currently competing with &quot;god bless you mr. rosewater&quot; for my favorite vonnegut book. this book is just too great to describe, you need to read it for yourself...."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"Dead eye was the second novel of Kurt Vonnegut that I read. I thought that this book was just as entertaining and as delightfully humorous, as the last one that I read. It is kind of scary like Mike Wrong said about how he takes on society so innocently. I have heard a lot of good things about slaughter five. My mother has read it and she said it was of her favorite Kurt Vonnegut novels. I think that Deadeye Dick would be better than Slaughter house five. In deadeye Dick Vonnegut does allow you to read on different levels. I love the way that Vonnegut takes this sad story and adds some humor into it. This will probably be the most memorable book that I have read. Whether it is the average human individual who should not be allowed to be possess nuclear weapons, Kurt Vonnegut champions the theme that a man is too immature and a beast to handle technology. Who can deny humans the power they know how to create? He leaves no sloution for us to think about. Before I never really understood the funny but sad part of his books either untill I read this book. I will always enjoy Vonnegut because he is was so thought provoking and had crazy, page turning ideas that Deadeye Dick,though, really captures that humor mixed with sadness. I find that Rudy Waltz is one of the most sympathetic characters in literature and his struggles to overcome the stigma of being Deadeye Dick are genuinely moving and this is a good introduction to his work. I think that it is a wonderfull work of literature. This novel proves that Vonneget is the king of black humor. He takes something that is more grimm than people can imagine and he makes it so funny. As I read this book I couldnt put it down, his characters are superb. The story is great, and his style of writting really drives you into the book. I especially like the way Vonneget uses his main character to tell his story,in playwright fashion. Deadeye Dick was a blast of fresh air. A dark comedy involving Rudy Waltz who accidently shoots a pregnant woman. Killing her child when he points his gun out of his windows, and fires for the sake of it. Afterwards, theres complete chaos the book deals with one wild thing after another and makes fun at the darker side of nuclear bombs. Hitlers art, to take over the world gourmet cooking and public atrocity exhibitions of prisoners. A wild romp and one of the few books that I have enjoyed. I strongly recommend this book to people from 4 years of age of 98. If you can read this book then it's kind of for you. If you like humours novels then this book is definetly for you. If you do not have a copy of this book at your house then you must definetly go out and get one."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"wonderful book, true vonnegut form. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"Another failed Vonnegut character mopes through life, bemoaning his failures and viewing all with a jaundiced eye, as he waits for the end. This is a note that Vonnegut strikes often: a poor ineffectual fool passively accepts his fate in an absurd, random universe. The more Vonnegut I read, the more tired I become of this tune, but I must admit that the author makes some interesting points along the way.This time the fool is Rudy Waltz, who gained the nickname of Deadeye Dick when he fired a gun into the air, inadvertantly killing a pregnant woman a block away. The story is fascinating and real when dealing with this tragic mistake and its consequences. I couldn't help but feel some disappointment as the more absurd qualities of the story (ie, neutron bombs and radioactive mantlepieces) asserted themselves. Vonnegut writes well about real people dealing with real problems. I wish he would have restrained himself from introducing so many surreal elements; they smack of gimmickry and self-conscious symbolism."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"The first Vonnegut book I ever read, and the strangest I feel. The kid shoots some guy from a tower and his whole life falls apart due to that one event. He writes an atrociously parochial play that gets laughed at in the Big Apple of America. When writing about the failures of everyday life humanity, Vonnegut is at his best. This has all of the most tragically funny events and characters woven into a nauseous tale. My favourite part is where the kid who writes the play, writes his own script of the situation of his brother arguing with his brother's girlfriend. Some call it black humour, I think that doesn't do it's creativity justice. A must read!"},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"In Deadeye Dick, the underlying messages shine through Vonnegut's words, the morals of innocence, the corruption of being etc. etc.But Vonnegut forgot one thing in this book. The story. What is in his other books a perfect mixture of story and the underlying morals, here it is a decidedly lop-sided affair. The story is very unengaging and I found it quite tedious, to be frank. And unfortunately, it went downhill after an ok-ish start. Thankfully, those recipes he throws in very frequently at the first part of the novel are toned down because what was a good idea would have turned into an annoying one if continued too frequently.This is the most disappointing Vonnegut book I've read so far."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"Dead eye was the second novel of Kurt Vonnegut that I read. I thought that this book was just as entertaining and as delightfully humorous, as the last one that I read. It is kind of scary like Mike Wrong said about how he takes on society so innocently. I have heard a lot of good things about slaughter five. My mother has read it and she said it was of her favorite Kurt Vonnegut novels. I think that Deadeye Dick would be better than Slaughter house five. In deadeye Dick Vonnegut does allow you to read on different levels. I love the way that Vonnegut takes this sad story and adds some humor into it. This will probably be the most memorable book that I have read. Whether it is the average human individual who should not be allowed to be possess nuclear weapons, Kurt Vonnegut champions the theme that a man is too immature and a beast to handle technology. Who can deny humans the power they know how to create? He leaves no sloution for us to think about. Before I never really understood the funny but sad part of his books either untill I read this book. I will always enjoy Vonnegut because he is was so thought provoking and had crazy, page turning ideas that Deadeye Dick,though, really captures that humor mixed with sadness. I find that Rudy Waltz is one of the most sympathetic characters in literature and his struggles to overcome the stigma of being Deadeye Dick are genuinely moving and this is a good introduction to his work. I think that it is a wonderfull work of literature. This novel proves that Vonneget is the king of black humor. He takes something that is more grimm than people can imagine and he makes it so funny. As I read this book I couldnt put it down, his characters are superb. The story is great, and his style of writting really drives you into the book. I especially like the way Vonneget uses his main character to tell his story,in playwright fashion. Deadeye Dick was a blast of fresh air. A dark comedy involving Rudy Waltz who accidently shoots a pregnant woman. Killing her child when he points his gun out of his windows, and fires for the sake of it. Afterwards, theres complete chaos the book deals with one wild thing after another and makes fun at the darker side of nuclear bombs. Hitlers art, to take over the world gourmet cooking and public atrocity exhibitions of prisoners. A wild romp and one of the few books that I have enjoyed. I strongly recommend this book to people from 4 years of age of 98. If you can read this book then it's kind of for you. If you like humours novels then this book is definetly for you. If you do not have a copy of this book at your house then you must definetly go out and get one."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"Not a standout novel of KV, but a good read all around. I'd say it peaked around 3/4 through, and then the rest was really just filler, and not all too interesting. One thing I really like about KV, is his characters keep reappearing in various novels of his. A handful show up in here."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"Deadeye Dick is a novel only Kurt Vonnegut could have written - quirky, strange, thought-provoking, and a little bit depressing. The story of Deadeye Dick and his family is not a happy one. Rudy Waltz acquires his unusual nickname at the age of twelve by accidentally killing a woman in his hometown, but the whole story starts well before Rudy was even born. His father was supposedly a promising artist, or at least his own mother thought so, but he and his painting tutor did little more than travel around getting drunk and carousing with women of ill repute; after the tutor was exposed as a sham, Otto Waltz went to Austria to study in the years before the Great War; his lack of talent forbade him entry to the Academy, and he developed a friendship with another failed artist who later became chancellor of the Third Reich. This association with Hitler and some of his ideas would come back to haunt Otto in the 1940s. Rudy was Otto's second son, and on the day when his father bestowed upon him the key to the gun room, Rudy took a rifle up to the top of the cupola at his family's most unusual residence, fired it randomly, and unknowingly shot a pregnant woman right between the eyes while she was vacuuming - thus did Rudy receive the nickname Deadeye Dick. His father insisted on making a production about how everything was his fault, and life would never be the same again for the dysfunctional Waltz family. They lost everything, and life got little better as Rudy matured. The story of Deadeye Dick and his family goes on to include such events as a decapitation, a death by chimney (it was made of radioactive cement), and the eventual death of everyone in the whole town by way of an accidental neutron bomb explosion. There is a lot of symbolism in the book, and Vonnegut's discussion of what certain symbols mean in the introduction is particularly helpful in understanding this novel (although I'm still a little unsure about the random inclusion of recipes throughout the story). One experiences a definite lack of closure upon completing this fascinating read, and that inevitably disappoints some readers, including myself to some degree, but I don't think any can deny the fact that Deadeye Dick offers a typically Vonnegut-like interpretation of life and offers much food for thought to the serious reader."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"To my way of thinking Kurt Vonnegut is one of the greatest writers of all time, end of story. I've yet to read anything bad by him -- and even a subpar offering from him is leaps and bounds better than most other books out there. This is great for Vonnegut and the reader, but is most fortunate for Deadeye Dick because while it falls (just barely) into the category of lesser Vonnegut it is still a truly great book and a tour de force of creative writing. In its pages you will meet Rudy Waltz, a pharmacist and so-called neuter who has been hiding away from the world ever since he accidentally shot and killed a pregnant woman at twelve years old and became a double murderer known in town as Deadeye Dick. In typical Vonnegut style Waltz has a fascinating and unique way of looking at the world and telling his story, and is backed up with an endearingly eccentric cast of characters. His outrageous father is one of Vonnegut's best creations: a self-proclaimed artist with no talent or artwork, an utter narcissist and onetime friend of Hitler's who becomes a laughingstock after the outbreak of WWII because he had so ardently supported his friend without actually paying attention to his politics. So why does Deadeye Dick fail to join the pantheon of Vonnegut's greats like Slaughterhouse Five, Mother Night, and Breakfast of Champions? Because those three have a moral urgency to them that Deadeye Dick is just slightly lacking in some key parts. While it is certainly not difficult to get involved in Waltz's saga I couldn't help but wish that he had come to more definitive conclusions in the end. But it does have a killer last line, and I would highly recommend this novel to anyone familiar with Vonnegut or, especially, to anyone who has yet to experience his divine fiction."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"Deadeye Dick is the kind of thing that your average person might write after a prolonged lack of sleep when the 'giddies' sets in. It doesn't entirely make sense, and some of the themes are a little wacky, but it is still very entertaining and fun to read. Vonnegut manages to use plenty of his traditionally biting humor throughout the book and deals with neutron bombs, eccentric artists, criminal coverups, and life after Ohio is obliterated. I am already biased because I am a big fan of Vonnegut's style of writing, but I found the book to be consistently interesting and can't wait to get another of his books"},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"Although not Kurt Vonnegut's best novel, Deadeye Dick is an enlightening, fast-paced, and highly entertaining satrical look at the death of innocence and the randomness of life. Through the plot and the life of the protonagist, Rudy Waltz, we are shown how seemingly random and completely unforseeable events can completely change and/or wreck a person's life. Everything we do, however seemingly trivial, has a consequence. Vonnegut's writing style is as fluid and graceful as ever, with a prose, quick wit, and pace that will keep you reading. His ever-present humor and light touch with weighty subjects is apparent from the very first page. A good read that you will enjoy. If you are new to this author, I would recommend reading something like Cat's Cradle first, but this is a fine novel and recommended for all Vonnegut fans."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"After finishing one of Vonnegut's books, I always like to read essays and critical thought writings on the book. As I began to read some on Deadeye Dick, I realized that most people are morons. It doesn't matter what other people thought the book was about, where the symbols are, or how he meant for things inside it to be taken. Vonnegut himself lends his thoughts to this very idea. Look at the Author's notes at the beginning of the book. He gives a list of symbols that he included in the book. Did he do this for a reason? He certainly did. But in my opinion, and if youve been reading this, you realize it doesnt matter, but in my opinion, it doesnt matter what he thinks the symbols are. It matters how you percieved the opinions, and the way i percieved them is not at all how he did. Sure, he wrote the book, but I read it, and a book unread is useless. Life goes on.If you like Vonnegut, you'll love Deadeye Dick...."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"This book was quirky and an interesting read. The kindle version isn't great though - it seems as though the book pages were scanned and converted to text in order to create this ebook.

No more Kurt. Or, to borrow yet another phrase from \\"Deadeye Dick,\\" his 10th novel, he became an \\"innocent undifferentiated wisp of nothingness.\\" Whether that actually happened, only he can say. In any case, these and other famous Vonnegut euphemisms (\\"so it goes,\\" \\"the Big Black,\\" etc.) somehow help take the sting out of our ordinary notions of death without removing any of its angst-ridden implications. Perhaps one of his greatest contributions was helping to make non-existence palatable to the masses. If so, what an ineffable gift. But maybe non-existence is funny? Or, to quote the ancient Chinese philosopher Zhuangzu, who sometimes sounds Vonnegetian, \\"Maybe death will be so great we'll regret having ever lived?\\"Rudolph, or Rudy, Walz, also known as \\"Deadeye Dick,\\" the novel's narrator, regrets living. He regrets it so much he forswears physical pleasure as a \\"neuter.\\" After accidentally killing a pregnant woman by firing a rifle from the cupola of his house, his guilt overwhelms him. Particularly when his eccentric father, a once friend of Hitler, takes all of the blame. The two become immediate outcasts in the small town of Midland City, Ohio, succumb to a fair amount of police brutality, and then lose everything in litigation. Along the way Rudy writes a play, \\"Katmandu,\\" so appallingly bad that he's barred from the theater. In response to his father's insistence that the family has not one nanoparticle of artistic talent, Rudy abandons his dream of the writing life and becomes a pharmacist. His overachieving brother becomes the head of NBC and marches through a litany of wives, the first of which he marries because he accidentally throws her through a windshield. Eventually he falls from grace and dignity. Meanwhile, the most beautiful girl in town, Celia Hoover, destroys her sanity with pharmaceuticals, which leads Rudy to muse that \\"the late twentieth century will go down in history, I'm sure, as an era of pharmaceutical buffoonery.\\" Not only that, his mother dies from overexposure to a radioactive fireplace, and the population of Midland City gets decimated by a neutron bomb, though this doesn't affect the buildings. In essence, it's depopulated. Rudy and his now somewhat more sedate brother relocate to the Hotel Oloffson in Haiti, from which Rudy narrates his desultory tale. The book then closed in an open ended manner. No gestalt. Still, it does contain one of his most memorable closers, in spite of it seeming a little tacked on: \\"The Dark Ages - they haven't ended yet.\\"Vonnegut's novels are usually hard to summarize, but \\"Deadeye Dick\\" defies any attempt whatsoever. From ten thousand feet, it looks as though the novel's facile storyline exists merely as a framework for Vonnegut's observations on life and society. Calling it a first person character study does it more justice, as plot seems a mere tertiary concern throughout. Rudy's character, his upbringing, and his life's mistakes stay center stage. This does provide Vonnegut with a good vehicle to muse about confusing aspects of modern existence. The book is absolutely packed with these. As such, those who prefer Vonnegut's commentary over his storytelling will revel in Rudy's ruminations. Perhaps \\"Deadeye Dick\\" was an experiment of sorts, which may help explain why some readers love it while others loathe it. It does not stand amongst his absolute best work, but Vonnegut fans will bask in every page nonetheless. Read it before your peephole closes."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"Deadeye Dick had a mix of everything, murder romance and major accident resulting in the death of hundreds of thousands of people in a typical American town. Rudy Waltz is telling the story of his life. Vonnegut is a master of suspense, not the usual cliched way, but he gives you inforamtion bit by bit that makes you want to keep reading. ofcourse any person can read this book but it takes a true reader and analyzer to UNDERSTAND this book. while i was reading this wonderful book, it got to me that today &quot;...we're still in the dark ages; the darkages, they havent ended yet. (p240)&quot; the book is full of twists, one of the little ones is that rudy waltz's father, otto waltz, saved hitler from death and starvation in Vienna before world war 1. &quot;Think of that:my father could have strangeled the worst monster of the century, or simply let him starve or freaze to death. But he became his bosom buddy instead.&quot; A double murder, a neutron bomb explosion, a mysterious decapitation, just a few of the many ironical twists of this wonderful cynical look at society."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"I happen to be in a Kurt Vonnegut stage a few years back and was reading through his more famous books when I came upon this one. I think this is one of those little surprises in his career. Much as Vonnegut's work is this wonderful mix of sadness and humor, pain and suffering with a sprinkling of depressing . I can only say this about Deadeye Dick. There are moments, sentences, coincidences in this book that I remember years later, when I've forgotten many of the specifics of his better known (and for me 5 star) books. It's because of those moments, those things that stay with you, that I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"Inaction is action. Like the symbolic neutron bomb that wipes out the inhabitants of Midland City leaving all the inanimate stuff intact, Rudy's attempt to make himself a \\"neuter\\" hurts those around him. For example his insistence on referring to himself as a \\"murderer\\" breaks up one of his brother's marriages. even so he does succeed in limiting his effect on the physical world as he builds no family and has no lovers. For him after the neutron bomb wipes everyone out, nothing has changed. I read this while struggling with my own guilt over a bad thing I did in my past, and while Vonnegut says point blank that Rudy's accidental shooting in his childhood of a pregnant woman is meant to stand for \\"all the bad things I have done\\", don't expect any feelgood message about forgiving yourself or letting the guilt go. The message I took from it is that causing others pain is inevitable for a living being, and since some things you do or don't do will have bad side effects, trying to do nothing - to be a neuter - will have bad consequences too, except it is even worse because by its nature that life won't lead to anything good; it's pure bad side effects.Take Rudy's father's friendship with Hitler before he became the devil. \\"Only an hour before, Hitler had sold his overcoat so that he could get a little something to eat, eventhough winter was coming on. So there is a chance that, if it weren't for my father, Hitler might have died of pneumonia or malnutrition in 1910 [...] My father could have strangled the worst monster of the century, or simply let him starve or freeze to death. But he became his bosom buddy instead. That is my principal objection to life, I think: it is too easy, when alive, to make perfectly horrible mistakes.\\" But if Rudy's father had strangled Hitler when he was a nobody, Rudy's father would have gone either to jail or, if he had tried to convince people that Hitler was going to become the next Hitler, to a nuthouse. To anyone who did not know Hitler's destiny - which would have been everyone - letting him freeze to death would seem a perfectly horrible mistake. Rudy does not know that the baby in the belly of the pregnant woman he accidentally shot would not have been the next Hitler, but the lack of punishment for Rudy - the pregnant woman's widower, rather than taking an opportunity to beat Rudy up, writes a statement in the newspaper blaming firearms rather than Rudy - seems the worst possible punishment as Rudy is blessed with the curse of a mind that always finds ways to punish itself. So it goes."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"Deadeye Dick is unmistakably a Kurt Vonnegut book. With its meandering storyline, beautiful asides, funny and cynical writing, and memorable characters, there's no way this could be written by anyone other than Vonnegut, and much of the joy of the book comes from just enjoying Vonnegut's style. That being said, Deadeye is also one of Vonnegut's weaker books. The introduction - in which he explains some of his thoughts behind the book and gives some information as to some of the book's symbolism - helps clarify things a bit, but the book never really coalesces much, ultimately just kind of feeling ramshackle and strung together. That's okay, really; Vonnegut has always felt like that, and no one can make that sort of journey more satisfying and enjoyable. And there's definitely no shortage of events here, between a narrator who's an accidental murderer, an exploding neutron bomb, a mysterious decapitation, a Nazi-adoring father, fake painters, and more. It just never really comes together in the end to anything more than a general lament for the slow slipping-away of life, and the lack of focus ultimately leaves you feeling a little disappointed in the book or like you missed the point of it all. So, yeah, it doesn't compare to his best works. But if you're a fan, you'll enjoy the ride here, minor book and all. It's still funny, still beautifully dry, still delightful, still moving - it's just not all that focused. But it's still a great journey to take."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"Dead eye dick is a good summer read. The writing style easy to read yet witty and ironic.

Waltz is forever known as Deadeye Dick by the people of Midland City, a label he can only shake when he leaves Ohio for New York City. Only then does he realize that Deadeye Dick has become who he is, and he doesn't know how to operate otherwise.Meanwhile, Rudy's father can never escape his past friendship with Hitler and his innocent support of Nazism, as well as his reputation as a failed painter devoid of talent. Rudy's brother is defined by the booming voice that carried him to the top of his industry and crashing back down to the bottom, as well as his penchant for divorce. He eventually reveals the loveless disconnect he's felt with his parents throughout his life. Most tragically, Celia Hoover, the pretty girl pursued throughout life because of her looks, wishes she never came to be known for her beauty and prefers a face that would better match how rotten she feels on the inside.Without a real plot supporting it, Deadeye Dick comes to a rather quiet ending. Considering how Rudy Waltz described life as nothingness interrupted by sounds and light before disappearing into nothingness again, such a lifeless conclusion by Vonnegut symbolized Rudy Waltz most effectively."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"I am a big Vonnegut fan and I absolutely loved this book. The development of the main character, Rudy Waltz, is superb. When the book ended I felt as though I understood him better than some of my real life friends. The insights, the stories, and the memories which are described throughout the story are so personal that you can't help but truly understand Rudy as a person - as screwed up as he may be. As usual, Vonnegut does it all through perfect insight, beautiful words, and an excellent mix of dark humor, absurdity, and realism.I read some of the other reviews on this site and cannot believe that people had so many negative things to say about this book. The tidbits of adding recipes and switching into \\"play mode\\" (complete with stage direction) were great techniques that further brought you into the mind of a \\"nobody\\" from a \\"nowhere\\" town.

This novel, Deadeye Dick, tells the tale of Rudy Waltz, who loses his innocence at a young age and struggles to get a grip on life. He is detached from life, and Vonnegut writes Rudy's struggle with such peircing honesty and clarity that you can't help but feel for Rudy. He finds you in Rudy Waltz - there's a little bit in here that we've all been through. Dusted with some quirky, often ironic humor here and there, Deadeye Dick is a touching novel and vastly under-appreciated."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"This book is classic Vonnegut.

The characters and storyline were boring. A neutron bomb destroys a city, too bad it didn't destroy this book."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"First, let me say that I am a big fan of Kurt Vonnegut. I recently went back and read two of his books that I hadn't ever gotten around to, Deadeye Dick and Galapagos. I have greatly enjoyed almost everyone of his books that I have read, from Sirens of Titan to Timequake and God Bless You Dr. Kevorkian. That being said....This book is terrible. Absolute mush. Not a good representation of Vonnegut's quirky writing style or even a basic story. There is not a character in this book that any reasonable reader could possibly care about, relate to, or want to know more about.The first three or four chapters are decent and trick you into thinking you are reading another great Vonnegut novel. Then it all falls apart. A boy is taunted after unintentionally killing a women. His family is destroyed. A town's population is eliminated by a neutron bomb. And there are random recipes for cajun and soul food. You get the impression that his goal was to tell the most absurd story he could fathom...except that there isn't really a story here.I would steer clear of this even if you are a Vonnegut completist. Unless you are deluded into thinking that everything the man ever wrote was brilliant (which, sorry, no dice), you will almost certainly be disappointed by this tripe."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"An odd book. It is wrtten in clear prose, I like the style. There are no over literary wanderings. Vonnegut peoples his book with rather oddball characters and weaves an equally odd story. Rudy's parents are born rich and qualified for nothing in life. They feel like the Russian nobility, playing in their fiefdom while the world crumbles around them. Rudy shoots a pregnant woman accidentally at age 12 and his father nobly takes the blame - quite unnecessarily and to the destruction of Rudy's life. The chapters are interspersed somewhat bizzarely by recipes. I enjoyed this while at the same time being somewhat bemused. You can probably read this on two levels - as a simple, rather unique novel or as a deeper commentary on life and society. Vonnegut finishes the threads of characters he has carried from previous novels in one fell swoop. It is a bit like a soap opera where the actors have caused a bit of trouble with contracts so you have a big disaster and wipe them all out. In the end Midland city is so unimportant that it is pretty much instantly forgotten and the military get to do what they like with it."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"\\"Deadeye Dick\\" starts out with a vintage Vonnegut gem, as the opening paragraph of chapter one is a lovely and unique statement about how we set our values in life. Actually it is about how our values are placed on us by the environment in which we are raised and nurtured. He sets up the motif of our lives as peepholes which open when we are born, and close when we die, and that is it. It is a clever and original method of presenting this thought.This novel reads and feels like a typical Vonnegut in its style and simplicity, and I will not complain about that. The novel is told in first person by the protagonist Rudy Waltz (who earns the unfortunate nickname Deadeye Dick early in his life) and once again Vonnegut employs simple childlike language to deceive you into zipping along with the reading and then suddenly finding yourself immersed in the middle of a profound thought. Then you are stuck thinking about it, and it is off to the races. The narrative is told as Rudy recounts for us his life, and for the most part it is told in linear flashback scenes. Vonnegut also incorporates an interesting device here, as Rudy likes to examine bits of his life as little \\"playlets\\". This device is effective for a couple of reasons as it breaks up the narrative style of the novel, and it also highlights the idea of our lives as short bursts of theater or stories. We are all \\"tales told by an idiot signifying nothing.\\"Chapters twelve and thirteen of this text are mesmerizing in their simplicity and depth of theme, and in chapter twelve especially Vonnegut does something that is nothing short of amazing. He makes you feel immense and deserving pity for a person who accidently and arrogantly shot and killed a pregnant woman on Mother's Day. The reader finds themselves embarrassed when they recognize the fact that we seem to lose our humanity when we are confronted by the worst among us and fail to see that they too are human. Shame on us Vonnegut is saying, and it stings. Of special mention is an editorial that the husband of the murdered pregnant women writes in the local paper. It ends chapter thirteen, and although I don't agree with all of it, wow oh wow is Vonnegut on fire in this part of the book.On page 127 of the novel Vonnegut put his theme right out there for all to see. Rudy has spent his life connecting with no one and nothing. He is a virgin, has no friends, no real career, etc. All of this out of fear of hurting other people. It is foolish nobility, as pain is a part of life and is to be accepted, maybe even embraced as a sign of being alive. Vonnegut seems to be saying that the tragedy in Rudy's, and our, life is not that he has done an awful deed that forever changed his and others lives. It is that he gave up and stopped living once it happened. Vonnegut is warning us... Not you too! You will hurt and be hurt, but live damn it!At one point in the novel a character obsesses about a parachute while flying, wanting to guarantee a safe landing. \\"Deadeye Dick\\" seems to be saying keep looking, and don't stop flying in the meantime. Many reviews have said this is a dark novel. I disagree. I think it is urging us to live. At one point a character says, \\"This is as much Shangri-Lai as anywhere.\\" That is the point folks. Embrace your own place in this world, and make it work to some extent. Rudy Waltz is the example of what not to be. Vonnegut is not celebrating him; he is using him as a warning bell.Heed the warning, and read this book."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"Classic Vonnegut mix of humor, pathos, satire and social criticism. From 1979's Jailbird to present, he's been on a string of winners. They're not all stone cold classics, but every one is worthwhile read and has much to recommend. This is no exception."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"Vonnegut's mordant humour, born from dark despair is in full flight with this novel. His characters are haplessly and passively accepting of the card tricks Fate shuffles; cards turned with lusty zappiness. As he deepened his craft, Vonnegut's books eased into conversational pace. The quality is detectable from the early awkwardness of,'Mother Night' to this smooth,'Dead Eye'. At the height of his powers he gave us,'Cat's Cradle'(my introduction to his writing & still my favourite), 'Slaughterhouse Five,'(made into a passable movie) and later,'Bluebeard'. All of Vonnegut is worthy stuff."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"Deadeye Dick is a good Vonnegut serving of his trademark cheeky cynicism about the beast, Mankind. The beast is way over his head in the task of properly handling the power of technology. Tragic, yet smirking mayhem follows when a boy gets his hands on a 30-06, and a government gets its hands on a neutron bomb. In this story Vonnegut doesn't suggest any answer to save the swarming bipeds from themselves. He does show empathy, though -- as much as I felt for the fire-ants that writhed a few seconds after walking on a teaspoon of sodium cyanide I had once put on an ant hill. The hill went dead as fast as the world did when Vonnegut let Ice-9 hit the ocean in a better novel."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"Many reviewers have indicated that Deadeye Dick was their first Vonnegut. To get a better (if that's possible) experience from reading this book you should now read Breakfast of Champions, if you haven't already. One of Vonnegut's motifs through the years has been to bring up certain characters and plot lines in several books--Kilgore Trout being one of them. He does this most successfully in Deadeye Dick tying up many threads and characters from BOC. If you have not read either book read BOC first and follow it immediately with Deadeye Dick. While both books are excellent on their own, you will enhance the experience of both by reading them back to back. Although I read BOC almost twenty years ago, I was taken right back to it while reading Deadeye Dick. I enjoyed it more with each turn of the page. These two together are a knockout!"},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"Whether it is the average human individual who should not be allowed to possess a gun, or nations of humans who should not be allowed to possess nuclear weapons, Kurt Vonnegut champions the theme that man is too immature a beast too handle technology. In Deadeye Dick he is more successful in developing this theme than in the more famous Cat's Cradle, perhaps because Deadeye Dick is more serious. Unfortunately Vonnegut doesn't brook the question: Who is to deny humans the power they know how to create? He leaves no solution and if there is none, Deadeye Dick stands as a lament over hopeless humanity"},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"Deadeye Dick grabbed me by the scruff and brought me into a world that i belived was real. Few authors are capable of such mastery. This novel has a powerful theme which is unique in many ways, and could not be realized in the same manner by anyone but Vonnegut himself. Don't just read this book, savor it like a literary delicasy."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"It's been probably 15 years since I read any Vonnegut, after a few years when he was all I read, and this was a nice return. While not one of his best works, it's quintessentially Vonnegut\\" Life in Ohio, suicidal mothers, massive destruction and loss of life. No Kilgore Trout though. What I liked the most was how one doctor had proscribed speed to many of the people in town, and how they were all starting to lose it. The doctor's wife, especially, in one scene, tears up a pharmacy wigging out trying to get a refill. Sounds like most of the people I grew up with back in the day."},{"Title":"Deadeye Dick: A Novel","review":"Vonnegut strikes again with his wit, although this time his cynnisism seems a bit muted. He gives us Rudy Waltz, son of two of the most eccentric people you will ever meet. Rudy as a young boy accidentally kills a young pregnant woman with his rifle thus earning the nickname and book title &quot;Deadeye Dick&quot;. Rudy grows to become a pharmacist. He never leaves his parents and his accident as a child has a profound role in the rest of his life. He carries the guilt, is unable to forge new relationships, and is relatively unhappy for the rest of his life.Seems like it would be a bit depressing but Vonnegut keeps the novel rolling with his social commentary on parenting, the medical field, the government, etc. etc. etc. Of course the accidental shooting is not the only misfortune to enter the lives of Rudy and his family but why ruin the book for you?Vonnegut really kept me engrossed in this novel. It is a quick read and worth picking up, even if you haven't read much of his other work. A solid 4-Star novel."},{"Title":"Top 100 Pro Wrestlers of All Time: Wrestling Observer's","review":"I've been a hard core professional wrestling fan (as well as a wrestler for 13 years) for 44 years. I'm not even going to argue over who belongs on the list or not and who belongs at what ranking. That's all subjective and nothing more than a matter of personal opinion. There are some VERY OBVIOUS omissions &amp; the rankings are ridiculous on many levels, but again this is just the author's opinion.Maybe that's why the title is so hard to swallow. This work isn't even very close to living up to it's name.I have a very hard time believing that Meltzer edited this book. His work is consistantly excellent and without reproach, as evidenced by his weekly Wrestling Observer Newsletter.That's why I can't believe Meltzer had much at all to do with this disaster.This book is filled with errors and misinformation from cover to cover. Names are wrong. Many facts are in error.The old term &quot;error by omission&quot; is blatantly prevelant to anyone who genuinely knows their pro wrestling history.It's evident that Mr Molinaro does not.Is this a good book for a casual fans wanting to learn more about pro wrestling's history? Not really. While they may learn something about the wrestlers on Molinaro's list, there are too many important facts that have been left out. I don't know if the author doesn't know these facts, or perhaps he just glossed over them or left them out completely. This is unacceptable.Is this a good book for the longtime fan to perhaps find out some new insights into the history of the business? Definately not.If you already know your wrestling history, this book is a slap in the face. It's not even good for a laugh. It's just plain annoying."},{"Title":"Top 100 Pro Wrestlers of All Time: Wrestling Observer's","review":"One of the most popular oxymorons among wrestling fans is \\"wrestling history.\\" Unlike baseball, football or other sports that trace their roots and superstars back to forgotten eras, wrestling writers, by and large, live in the eternal now, with wrestling history stretching as far back to when they first became interested in it. It's not that they have no interest in the past; they just cannot conceive of it. After all, it happened before they were born.And it is this mindset that dooms what otherwise is an excellent survey of wrestling, replete with photos from the library of Dr. Mike Lano, one of the sport's greatest photographers. Ric Flair the #1 wrestler of all time? Sorry, but given the standards of history, that honor goes to Lou Thesz. Thesz was not only heads and tails above Flair as a wrestler, but it was also Thesz who shaped the course of wrestling history when he became NWA champion and united wrestling promotions across the country, giving the NWA, and wrestling, a cache it had never before enjoyed. Without Thesz, it could well be argued that there would be no Flair, for without the iron hand of Thesz, there might not even be an NWA surviving into the 80's.The inclusion of Japanese wrestlers Rikidozan and Antonio Inoki to such lofty spots also shows the myopic bias of the editors. This is the fallacy of the Hardcore fan, who has been so steeped in Japanese wrestling lore so as to actually believe it. When Inoki bought the Cleveland-Buffalo based NWF in the mid-70s, he quickly put himself over as champ. He just as quickly put the promotion out of business in the U.S., for here he had the charisma of a toad. Try Strangler Lewis, the dominant champion of the 20s and well into the 30s. It could be said of wrestling that it was fake, but no one called the Strangler a faker. How about Frank Gotch, whose 1908 title bout with George Hackenschmidt was covered all over the world?One might even make a case for Joseph \\"Toots\\" Mondt, a superb middleweight who, as a promoter, devised the game as we know it today. Over 90% of the finishes and about 60% of the finishing holds came from the fertile mind of Toots.So is this book worth your time and money? Yes. For the reasons that (1) there is very little of wrestling's past ever mentioned; and (2) At the least, this book will make one think and will encourage debate. Besides, every serious fan will purchase it anyway for his or her library regardless of its faults."},{"Title":"Top 100 Pro Wrestlers of All Time: Wrestling Observer's","review":"Here are excerpts from my Jan. 5, 2002, column in the (Charleston) Post and Courier:Toronto-based journalist John Molinaro takes a bold step in attempting to rank the greatest pro wrestlers in the history of the game in his new book, \\"Top 100 Pro Wrestlers of All Time.\\" Unlike many of the \\"best\\" and \\"greatest\\" lists that spread like wildfire at the end of the millennium, Molinaro's compilation has blossomed into a well-written, thought-provoking work that's sure to spark spirited debate among wrestling fans for years to come.And that's a good thing.Like many similar lists, the Top 100 is not one with which everyone will agree. Any effort to rank athletes in any sports endeavor over such a long period of time is a risky proposition at best. But Molinaro, who at age 28 is already one of the top writers on the pro wrestling scene, covers all the bases in his study, giving a detailed, biographical account of each wrestler on the list.The rankings are not solely based on the opinions of Molinaro, who was a driving force behind Canada's SLAM! Wrestling site. The list was compiled by some of the industry's leading experts, along with the assistance of several mat historians.The book is further strengthened by Molinaro's inclusion of Dave Meltzer as a contributing editor. Meltzer, longtime editor of the authoritative Wrestling Observer newsletter and author of \\"Tributes: Remembering Some of the World's Greatest Wrestlers,\\" lends his considerable expertise to the effort, explaining the selection process in great detail in the foreword of the book. Serving as a co-editor was radio broadcaster/writer Jeff Marek, founder and host of the world's longest-running wrestling radio talk show, The LAW (Live Audio Wrestling), based out of Toronto.The book's strong points are many. Not only is the writing crisp and concise, but some intriguing, rarely seen photos - most from the collection of noted wrestling photojournalist Dr. Mike Lano - accompany all 100 listings. There are countless stories and first-hand accounts of the performers who shaped the wrestling business, along with bios that help put their illustrious careers into historical perspective.Molinaro's Top 100 also is a truly global ranking, since it includes wrestlers - male and female - from all over the world, representing every style of wrestling, from every major promotion.Among the criteria used in determining the rankings were professional success (including the number of titles a wrestler had won), importance to history, ability in the ring, drawing power and mainstream status achieved. Also considered were those qualities that can't be measured in numbers, such as the ability to put on a great match each night.Perhaps the most studied and researched ranking revolved around just who was the greatest of all time, a question that has been tossed around, it seems, forever.For his consistency and longevity, along with his ability to make opponents look better than they really were, Ric Flair was unanimously chosen as the greatest pro wrestler to ever step inside the ring. It was noted that Flair put on probably as many great wrestling matches over a lengthy period of time as anyone in history, along with being considered by many to be the greatest talker the business has ever produced.This book undoubtedly will serve as fodder for lively discussion among those who follow the business. Molinaro said he expects Hulk Hogan's ranking at No. 5 to fuel the flames of the debate, but he's more than ready to defend his decision.\\"I don't find it the least bit controversial but I think a lot of people, especially casual fans, are going to have a problem with Hogan not being ranked No. 1 and having four guys ahead of him,\\" said Molinaro. \\"To so many, he was the biggest star of all time and I think to non-fans he's the one guy they automatically associate with pro wrestling. But I just felt that Flair, for everything he's meant to the business as the best in-ring performer of all time, deserved to be No. 1. There's just no question in my mind.\\"\\"Thesz, Rikidozan (No. 3) and (Antonio) Inoki (No. 4) all had much greater historical impact on the business as a whole than Hogan, and that's why they're rated higher than him,\\" added Molinaro. \\"But I don't think a lot of people will appreciate that and naturally scoff that Hogan isn't No. 1.\\"The 212-page book is beautifully illustrated with nearly 300 color and black and white photographs. Some of my favorite photos are part of a pictorial presentation entitled \\"Ring of Friendship,\\" a special section that shows a number of mat legends bonding backstage at WWE pay-per-views and at Cauliflower Alley reunions.With the recent spate of wrestling autobiographies on the market (The Fabulous Moolah, Bobby Heenan, Roddy Piper, Hulk Hogan, Jerry Lawler), this work is a refreshing change of pace. It's a must for any wrestling (or \\"sports entertainment\\") fan."},{"Title":"Top 100 Pro Wrestlers of All Time: Wrestling Observer's","review":"I'm sure that Molinaro had good intentions in putting this work together. It's well-written and has been edited by one of the top authorities on professional wrestling, but I'm shocked that Meltzer was editor for this book and let it get by with such obvious omissions and such a woefully compiled, misbegotten attempt at a list.There were so many important names omitted from the list and so many wrestlers who ended up low on the list but should have been much higher that the mind of a wrestling scholar boggles at such evident foul-ups.Molinaro should have just kept his list of 100 &quot;favorite&quot; wrestlers of all time to himself, but instead chose to go the route of hooking up with Meltzer to get himself published and his list of obvious favorites has now become &quot;the top 100 wrestlers of all time&quot;, which does nothing but slap the business in the face and makes Molinaro look bad, real bad and has done nothing to help Meltzer's standing as top authority.I could start listing all of the wrestlers who should be in the book and who shouldn't and could make an extremely strong case for all of my points, but there is a limit of 1000 words here, so I can't even begin to start what would amount to a volume of criticism.To sum it up, all I can say is steer clear of this fiasco. It's far removed from the reality of the situation and misinforms all those who read and believe it's validity. I guess you might enjoy it if you just want to read about these wrestlers and ignore the order Molinario has placed them in and are aware of the fact that there are at least 20 wrestlers who don't belong here at all and at least 20 more that have been ignored completely."},{"Title":"Top 100 Pro Wrestlers of All Time: Wrestling Observer's","review":"While I appreciate the fact that there is such a book out there, the number of omissions is appalling. with all of the Japanese wrestlers named - and there are far too many - where was Toru Tanaka?

ALLAH! ALLAH!\\" and then hit Zbysko so hard on the top of his head that it drove him knee deep in the mud!

I think they did a credible job, although this list will always stir up controversy. How do you rate wrestlers from the early 20th century? What is the most important aspect when rating wrestlers? workrate, drawing power, or importance to history? Casual fans will dismiss this list because Hulk Hogan, Austin, or the Rock aren't #1. People that take workrate too seriously and neglect the entertainment value to the casual fan would probably want all the old time wrestlers such as Thesz, Lewis, and Gotch in the top spots. Others will say there are too many Japanese and Luchador wrestlers ranked too high. Putting this list together will not please everyone, but it is fun all the same. I think they did a great job. The stories, while short are very imformative. The photos are great also. This would rank fourth on my list of favorite wrestling books behind Meltzer's Tributes, Foley's first book, and Dynamite Kid's. Just for fun, here is my top 10 list:1. Ric Flair- Great in all aspects of the business.2. Antonio Inoki- I knew who he was as an 9 year old kid. Even though he got the rub from Ali, his fame and impact were far reaching.3. Hulk Hogan- Even though he is terrible in the ring, he is most responsible for wrestling's expansion.4. El Santo- Learned more about him from the book than any other wrestler. Really was a fascinating cultural icon.5. Lou Thesz- Great for his time, however was too negative towards the wrestling of today. Should have evolved with the business.6. Andre the Giant- Wrestler I was most fascinated with as a kid.7. Bruiser Brody- Most influential brawler of all time.8. Bruno Sammartino- WWWF champion for 7 years straight.9.

The writing is good and the photos are excellent. Too bad the list itself is nothing but a bad joke.What makes it all the more annoying is that the casual fan will accept this list as being correct, being that Meltzer was one of the editors and he plugs it in his newsletter, but the Japanese influence has clouded his judgement, and the other two blindly follow his lead.Meltzer is definately a wrestling expert and knows the history of the business worldwide as well as anyone.

It is a well-written story with a mythological essence. The characters are brought to life by the excellent use of visual images. The reader is taken on an enjoyable escape to another place. There are many subtle messages that shine through. The messages of trust, loyalty, love, friendship and the need to have faith are necessary for our younger readers to hear. I would highly recommend this book for young readers between the ages of 10-16."},{"Title":"Sky Bounce","review":"\\"Sometimes, when the sweet night air is gentle and quiet enough, I can hear the voices. Slowly they speak, their hushed whispers arising softly from nowhere, drifting back and forth, in and out of nothingness. Though I cannot understand what they say, I feel a strange sadness whenever I listen, for the voices are like the last pleas for hope sent by hopeless souls.\\"Hesper hears these voices, though she is afraid to admit it to anyone except her best friend Tristan, for fear that she will be shunned. Tristan hears the voices, too. But Tristan is already shunned by his kind - the Mantaurs - so he has no one to share the information with anyway. Each night, when Hesper can manage to sneak out, the two friends share their thoughts and dreams as they sky-bounce through the skymounts and across the spongy ground of the Alula plane.Hesper is an Alula, a winged girl, living on the Alula plane of existence. She's being taught, as are all of the other Alulas in her flit, that there are several planes of existence, each plane having a different awareness of the Great Alula. She's also being taught that she may soon have a chance to see how others, on different planes, live and believe. She, and all of the other in her flit, know that they may be Sent at any time. Hesper lives in fear of being Sent. Her mother was Sent to another plane when Hesper was a small child, never to be seen or heard from again.Tristan, the Boytaur, is ever-adventurous, though, and he urges Hesper to take him to the place where the Sendings occur. While there, the two are spotted by an Alula, and Hesper's worst fears come to fruition. She is to be Sent!Tristan can do nothing to stop the Alulas, nor can Hesper, and soon she is living on another plane of existence - the human plane. Though she is reunited with her beloved mother, Hesper remembers nothing of her other existence as a winged girl, or of sky-bouncing with the Boytaur. Tristan is the only one who can help her, and it takes him a long while to figure out how to ride the interplane to the human plane.Ms. Miller has written a truly unique book in SKY BOUNCE. Not only is the storyline imaginative and fun, but it has a spiritual message that is greatly needed by the youth of today. The underlying spiritual tones of SKY BOUNCE tell of an existence greater than can be imagined, greater than what we can see, hear, smell and feel everyday - the existence of God. The characters walk young adults through situations that young people face everyday: drugs, peer pressure, good and bad choices, making friends, and just living life. The characters deal with these situations with help from God and the Bible. These lessons are woven into the story so artfully that the strong message of faith comes across as subtle and uncomplicated - which is a perfect approach for a Young Adult book.Ms. Miller's writing style is such that this book is an interesting and enjoyable read, her characters are strong and seem very real, though they are fantasy creatures created just for the readers enjoyment. The sweet romance that blooms between the two main characters was just as it should be between two young adults - not at all awkward, but simple and fresh.A masterfully creative tale, I'd give SKY BOUNCE a four stars on the rating system."},{"Title":"Sky Bounce","review":"Sky Bounce is a wonderful story of friendship that crosses the limits of ignorance, questions our thinking and ventures a little romance. Hesper an Alula, and the people of her kind, share the Alula plane with the Mantaurs. The Alula's inhabit the skymounts, the Mantaurs dwell on the land below, and for their own safety, the Alula's are forbidden to travel to the land below them.Hesper ignores this rule when she befriends Tristan, a Boytaur. Together they sky bounce using Hesper's wings and Tristan's strong legs, and a lifelong friendship is born. All is not well however on the Alula plane, for the parallel planes that run alongside it are changing. Each plane relies on one another to exist and the Alula's, facing possible destruction; send Hesper to the human plane to help. Sadly, the very process of sending causes Hesper to lose her memory of everything, including Tristan.Tristan cannot forget Hesper so easily and although he endangers himself, he finds a way to travel the interplane and find Hesper in the human world. Although Hesper doesn't remember Tristan, something inside her tells her that she knows him and together they return to the Alula plane where they seek out the problems that could cause the planes' downfall.Deanna Miller has created an appealing fantasy world whose spirit closely echoes our own. In this world, the main characters are faced with what we ourselves face daily, difficulty, a lack of understanding, and the need to put aside our differences and come together to reach a common goal.The book is aimed towards intermediate through young adult readers, ages 10-18 years, but as an adult, I found this book a wonderful escape, with an adventurous appeal that would indeed please any age. Deanna Miller's Sky Bounce, is a \\"...what happens next?\\" book. Children and young adults will love throwing themselves into this story and when the very last page is read - probably with some sadness, I'm very certain that they'll be bellowing for the sequel."},{"Title":"Sky Bounce","review":"The story is very well written and keeps the readers interest, yet it is not very difficult to understand, so it is best suited to young teens.... The story is centred on a group of creatures (Alulas and Mantuars) from a different 'dimension' or 'plane' as they term it, and how something happens that changes the lives of the main characters and leads to a challenge to save all the dimensions from destruction. This story is fairly unique and well thought out, the plot is not exactly complicated, but fits together nicely. Its generally a mildly romantic adventure story, I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Sky Bounce","review":"I'm no longer a teenager, but there's something about Sky Bounce that works well no matter what the age of the reader. It captures the innocence, mystery, and heartbreak of adolescence perfectly while offering a nice imaginative setting. Because it's grounded in the day to day reality of a young girl's Earth existence, her adventures in another world are all the more compelling."},{"Title":"Sky Bounce","review":"I ordered this book for my 10 yr. old daughter.She just finished the \\"Twilight Series\\" and I thought one of those books was a little mature for her.This book was highly recommended and she LOVED it!"},{"Title":"Sky Bounce","review":"In a different plane of existence, Hesper the Alula and Tristan the Boytaur are secret friends, even though their species are supposed to have nothing to do with each other. Late at night, they like to go flying, with Hesper and her wings supplying the wing power, and holding on to Tristan, a four-legged centaur. The leaders of Hesper's people find out, and, as a punishment, Send Hesper to the human plane. The barriers between the planes of existence are weakening, and the only way to fix it is to Send Alulas to the human plane. The downside is that those who are Sent lose their wings, and all memory of their previous lives.A year later, Hesper is your average high school student. One day, she meets an interesting boy in a wheelchair who likes hang gliding. Tristan has found a way to travel between planes and keep his memory. He just had to give up some other part of his body, like use of his legs. Hesper is reluctant to accept that she may have had a previous life with wings, but accept she does. The two travel to another plane, called the Barren Plane, where supposedly nothing lives. They meet a race of light beings called Dyaphinees, who tell Hesper that the Sending of Alulas to the human plane, is not the solution, but the problem. Hesper also discovers, to her shock, that her friend Tristan is not exactly who he says he is.This is a young adult novel that is not just for young adults. It's fresh, interesting, very easy to read, and well worth the reader's time."},{"Title":"Sky Bounce","review":"Reviewer: Brenda Dupas (Excerpt of original review at www.newradiance.com/may2003reviews.htm)This is a well paced, well written fantasy with religious/spiritual overtones. It explores the nature of friendship, loyalty, trust and faith. The messages the author wishes to convey, however, appear incidental to the story and thus become a seamless part of the whole. In that sense it is similar to Madeleine L'Engle's works which offer her young readers much food for thought. This is a spiritually uplifting book for young readers with an interesting storyline."},{"Title":"Sky Bounce","review":"Well-written fantasy for the bigger kid set, Sky Bounce fluidly tells the tale of Hesper the Alula and Tristan the Boytaur, friends who are separated when Hesper is sent to the human plane to save both worlds from possible extinction.Flash forward one year later, and now a high schooler, Hesper meets a vaguely familiar boy. Yes indeed, the boy is Tristan, who has found a way to travel between the realms with his memory intact -- at great risk -- to Hesper, who lives this new life now without memory of her other existence.Will they discover a solution to save both worlds? Only a daring return to the Alula plane will provide that answer, a mystery to which readers of this respectable book will be eager to watch unravel."},{"Title":"Sky Bounce","review":"I just finished reading a wonderful young adult fantasy novel called \\"Sky Bounce.\\" The writer is Deanna Miller, author of \\"Time to Tell \`Em Off! A Pocket Guide to Overcoming Peer Ridicule.\\"\\"Sky Bounce\\" is geared towards intermediate and young adult readers, ages 10 through 18, and will most likely appeal to girls. But this wonderful tale of friendship between two very different beings kept me entranced and I could not put it down once I started reading it...and I am in my 40's!\\"Sky Bounce\\" tells the story of two young creatures, the beautiful and winged Alula girl Hesper, and her friend the half-human half-horse Boytaur named Tristan. They live in a world where females, the Alula's, and males, the Boytaurs and Mentaurs, are kept away from each other for the most part, and Tristan and Hesper's friendship is frowned upon, to put it mildly. Not only are their gender differences a problem, but their \\"race\\" differences are as well. Alulas and Boytaurs are NOT supposed to be pals in this world!But their attraction to and respect for each other is solid and unyielding, and is much of the fun tension that underlies this story, and when Hesper is called upon to travel into a parallel plane to save the fate of her own world, nothing can keep Tristan from following her, even if the danger to both of them is great. The story picks up on good old Earth, with our two heroes as high schoolers with a mission to save all of the planes of existence. The catch here is that Hesper's memory has been erased, yet she still has a feeling she knows Tristan from somewhere...Once Hesper and Tristan return back to their own plane, the story really heats up as Tristan and his kind are accused of causing the terrible destruction occurring on Earth and slipping over into the other planes of existence. But Hesper doesn't believe this, and she puts her entire trust in her friend, Tristan, even when the truth of his own identity is enough to send her running in fear. It is their battle to prove to the Alula Council that Tristan and his fellow creatures are free from guilt before the Council sets about the destruction of Tristan's home plane that drives the rest of the story.This book works great on two levels, with one level of superb fantasy story telling fusing seamlessly into the fun romantic tension that propels the two character's behavior. It is perfect for teenagers, and pretty enjoyable for us adults yearning for the innocence and power of first love, and I was caught up in Hesper and Tristan's search for acceptance of their growing friendship. I also really loved the powerful spiritual undertones. This book is about more than just two friends living in a world different than our own. It is about prejudiced and fear, and how our misconceptions and misunderstandings of people who are different from us can often lead to violence and destruction.What a perfect and timely message to convey to kids, with our own country struggling to find its place in a world filled with those whom we do not always understand. Do we choose fear, and war? Or do we try to look beyond differences to what may be a surprising and enlightening reality we cannot see? These questions are explored in \\"Sky Bounce,\\" but are never hammered over the head. Deanna Miller is a master at subtlety, and her messages are well weaved into the storyline, making this book all the more pleasurable to read.I loved \\"Sky Bounce,\\" and highly recommend it to anyone of any age who likes good fantasy storytelling. The book was written with a sequel in mind, and I for one cannot wait to read it!"},{"Title":"Loco for Lizards","review":"This is a real find. Even if they have zero interest in reptiles, anyone who has curiousity and a sense of humor would enjoy this little book. The writing style is a combination of Dennis Miller's sarcasm, Bill Nye the Science Guy's mix of facts and fun, Monty Python's surrealism, and a pinch of David Sedaris's self-deprecation. A great airplane or lazy day read. I couldn't put it down. Made a great stocking stuffer gift for the readers on my list. Most amazing is this book's artful blend of solid information, interestingly presented and wacky fun. Great colorful graphics, too, including paintings by Hieronymous Bosch, Ed Mell, Maynard Dixon and others. Godzilla makes a couple appearances, as well.Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Loco for Lizards","review":"Sure, most of us just turn the garden hose on the little varmits so we don't have to hear the missus screaming in the background. But when author Jim Cherry takes us down to their level, we wind up feeling solidarity with our scaley brethren. Cherry scores points early on by informing us that lizards have been here even before Strom Thurmond and he even scores an interview with one of the largest lizard luminaries ever recorded (no not Jim Morrison --and you can be sure Mr Cherry busts the, err umph \\"Lizard King\\" for not singing the praises of his icky minions in his reams of bad poetry). This book is factual but most importantly FUUUN! Beautifully illustrated by the author, it's a refreshing refresher on something most of us know nothing about.Why doesn't someone give this Jim a nature show?"},{"Title":"Loco for Lizards","review":"Okay, I'll confess up front: I'm in this book. But when author Jim Cherry first contacted me to interview me for his book, I really didn't have a clear idea what the book was going to be about, other than the fact that it wasn't going to be about the care of captive lizards nor was it to be a natural history book about wild lizards.Well, Jim was wrong about that: the book is wild. It's wildly fun and colorful, a cornucopia of lizardly facts and artifacts, with lizards in history, lizards in movies, lizards on the walls, even lizards on CDs. Jim has put together a kaleidoscopic collection of information, art work and more in the exploration of the human relationship with lizards, both as living animals and graphic representations in a wide range of media and cultures.As a herp keeper and educator, I read a lot of books on reptiles. Loco For Lizards was a real treat for me, a welcome and often laugh-filled break from the mundane.

But I have a copy sitting next to me, and I can at least tell you what's in it.For starters, the ISBN is the same, but the volume is number 7, not number 8. It is a collection of papers on expert systems, and an analysis of the latest developments in expert systems.Here are the invited papers and their abstracts:1. Making a start: a view from British industry, by A. d'Agapeyeff (Consultants in Information Technology, London). &quot;The technology of expert systems is as much about knowledge as it is about computing. People are reluctant to believe either that they themselves solve important problems in a seemingly rough and ready manner or that they should rely on computers programmed to operate in the same way. This paper defines a meaning and a use of knowledge and gives a management perspective of knowledge-base systems, as well as discussing the possible uses of expert systems and the current involvement of some UK companies.&quot;2. Intelligent front-ends, by A. Bundy (Department of Artificial Intelligence, U. of Edinburgh). &quot;An intelligent front-end is a user-friendly interface to a software package, which uses artificial intelligence techniques to enable the user to interact with the computer using his or her own terminology rather than that demanded by the package. Several such systems exist and provide interfaces for finite-element, statistical and simulation packages. This is an important area of growth for expert systems. This paper discusses the techniques required in an intelligent front-end and debates whether general tools can be provided for their construction.&quot;3. Reasoning about uncertainty: a knowledge representation perspective, by P. R. Cohen and T. R. Gruber (Department of Computer and Information Science, U. of Massachusetts). &quot;Uncertainty is a vague concept. Nonetheless, it denotes a class of issues that must be faced if intelligent systems are to deal with real-world problems adequately. This paper discusses some of the circumstances in which uncertainty arises and thus clarifies what we mean by uncertainty. We will discuss important sources of uncertainty in rule-based inference, then present an organisation of AI approaches to uncertainty and, finally, propse a knowledge-representation view of reasoning about uncertainty.&quot;4. Expert systems for education and training, by M. E. Fox (Lecturer in Modern Sciences, Dunstable, Bedfordshire, UK). &quot;Expert systems for education and training are still at the experimental stage. Their general structure is explained in this paper. Four examples are introduced, to show what has been achieved: SOPHIE (to assist technicians in learning about electronic trouble-shooting), West (an educational computer game), and GUIDON and NEOMYCIN which are being developed to help medical students to learn the diagnosis of certain diseases. The general conclusion is that progress is probably limited by the scientific understanding of discourse, although some kinds of limited system may now be practical for regular classroom use.&quot;5. Knowledge-based expert systems--the state of the art in the US, by F. Hayes-Roth (Teknowledge Inc, Palo Alto, CA). &quot;This paper aims to describe the current state of knowledge systems technology and its commercialisation in the US. First, knowledge systems are defined and placed in a historical context. The introduction is concluded with a preview of major ideas. The paper will assess the technological state of the art and will survey the current state of commercialisation. Finally, some anticipated future trends will be discussed.&quot;6. Overview of expert systems in Japan, by M. Ishizuka (Institute of Industrial Science, U. of Tokyo) and T. Moto-oka (Faculty of Engineering, U. of Tokyo). &quot;In the move towards an advanced information society, novel technologies in the areas of computer hardware and software are urgently needed, in Japan as well as in other countries. The design concept of expert, or knowledge-based, systems holds promise for highly intelligent systems in a new era. Many R&amp;D programmes exploring the possibilities of expert systems have been initiated. The Fifth Generation Computer Project has been a significant influence in this field. The project is expected to provide fundamental tools, including hardware and software for knowledge information processing systems. PROLOG, the enhanced version of which has been chosen as the kernel language of the Fifth Generation computer, is being used increasingly in Japan. This paper introduces a variety of activities involving expert systems in Japan. The focus is on the application side, rather than on basic technologies.&quot;7. Knowledge acquisition, by A. Kidd and M. Welbank (British Telecom Research Laboratories). &quot;The paper considers the important problem of acquiring knowledge from human experts. It describes the important objectives at each stage of this difficult taks, reviews the associated problems and critically examines a number of commonly used acquisition techniques. The paper argues that knowledge engineers have tended to adopt a rather limited approach towards the problems of knowledge acquisition in the past and that a much richer and broader view of expert knowledge is necessary in order to construct expert systems which will act as powerful and usable decision aids in real-world applications.&quot;8. Knowledge-based systems in medicine: a review, by A. L. Rector (Medical Computation Unit, U. of Manchester, UK). &quot;Medicine, especially medical diagnosis, has proved a fertile field for reserach in knowledge-based systems. Paradoxically, practical use of knowledge-based systems is still something of a rarity. This paper discusses the projects hat represent the continuing development of the Stanford University Heuristic Programming Project and looks at the many other knowledge-based systems being used in medical research today.&quot; (Discusses MYCIN, NEOMYCIN, EMYCIN, and ONCOCIN; PIP, ANNA, and ABEL; and others.)"},{"Title":"Catastrophism & the Old Testament","review":"Patten doesn't know it, but he's unlocked the hitherto unfathomable Chaldean doctrine found in the babyloniaca of Berossus composed in 281 B.C., and arrived at the answer independently. This is truly a briliant theory. The Mars-Earth wars had to have happened."},{"Title":"Catastrophism & the Old Testament","review":"While I am still in the process of reading this book I think Patten and his associates have produced another interesting and thought-provoking alternative framework for interpreting the geological and cultural history, and pre-history, of the Earth going beyond the exclusive choices of \\"Uniformitarian-Evolutionist\\" versus \\"Fiat Creationist\\" alternatives. Their builds on the works of Immanuel Velikovsky in taking Biblical and extra-biblical native (and other ancient) oral and written traditions seriously. Nice to shake the cages of scientific orthodoxy once in a while - and also nice to challenge \\"fiat creationist\\" conceptions with alternative explanations of the same events - the Flood, the Ten Plagues of Egypt, the \\"Long Day\\" of Joshua, among several others - that still respect the Biblical accounts as historically accurate and that do not exclude the possibility of God actively ruling in both natural and political history. The planetary catastrophist hypothesis also seeks to explain the traditions and sagas of non-Judeo-Christian civilizations - such as the siege of ancient Troy, among other things. Also explains the rise (and subsequent decline) of the worship of the god Mars in various cultures of the catastrophic period."},{"Title":"Catastrophism & the Old Testament","review":"I found the book to be everything I expected. It is a serious study in this area of Bible study. I have been working in a parallel fashion with his previous work without knowing it. In fact I am having to refer specifically to his name often to avoid the charge of plagiarism. I have been writing on correct dating of the kings' list of Judah and Israel and using the catastrophes as given in 2nd Kings and Isaiah to get that period right while supplying interesting insights. I knew of Mr. Patten and his work through studies with \\"Redshift\\", a computer program on dating that is a junior version of the one used at the Jet Propulsion Lab. When I ran into the work by Mr. Patten on the internet I was very excited to find someone else working in this area. His writing on liquid gyroscopes has been particularly inspiring and helpful to me and my imagination when it comes to the \\"hows\\" and \\"whys\\". I have relied on his work to learn about the physics and astronomy needed for a complete work while at the same time incorporating the reign of kings with Biblical description of events that could only be real if we allow ourselves some imagination. Using imagination in this instance is not excusing fairy tales. It is requiring the mind to expand to assimilate these new but correct explanations for so many things in this area of prophecy where objectivity takes place of that imagination. I found that the dating of the period from 747 BC to 701 BC is marked by the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. Although history before the 8th century is pot marked with global catastrophe, I believe they canceled each other out until the period of 794 to 701 BC. My thesis is that there were six inside passes from fall equinox of 794 to 714 BC and a final outside pass by Mars in 701 BC, which Mr. Patten does a super job on. He used a difficult system to move time backwards to March of 701 BC where I use the Redshift program. I found that the last big event occurred a midnight March 28th. His dating of the reign of Hezekiah is flawed by accepting Courville and Thieles's dating that is wrong. 2nd Kings 18 states emphatically that Hezekiah was in his sixth year (722 BC) when Samaria fell to Sargon and that there were TWO invasions of Sennacherib, one in 714 BC and the last in March of 701 BC. Thank you very much for the book and it is in wonderful condition. I look forward to meeting Mr. Patten and comparing our viewpoints but I already know that my work hinges on the astrophysics and a willingness to study the prophets with an open mind that allows for explanation of the catastrophic disruption of natural order, not an act of \\"mother nature\\" who has come to be worshiped in later years more than God, who developed and introduced \\"natural law\\" or \\"natural order\\", not some freakish unknown spirit of \\"mother nature\\" out there, \\"mother nature\\" ready to pounce upon us.

I found it fascinating and mostly plausible. Serious students of the Bible should read this book."},{"Title":"Catastrophism & the Old Testament","review":"Patten's obviously meticulously researched and documented works are stunning. His style of writing is pondering and lacks the zip of the pop culture, but his theories and the subsesequent content is the freshest, most probably of any I've heard, and sure does explain a lot of what we could only shrug about before. With another good writer or editor and a reprinting I think Patten's two primary books could really shake up the status quo. Like he said, the evidence is not as much found in looking down, but up. I imagine our scientists could learn much more if they could think outside the box they've put themselves into. I would suggest that readers of his stuff take it slow and easy...try to understand before breezing on to the next topic...and I'd say the best laughing is done by those who laugh last."},{"Title":"Catastrophism & the Old Testament","review":"The review of Patten's Catatrophism and the Old testament by The Reader was not really convincing. He seems to dismiss Patten for the same reason he dismisses Velikovsky, but offers no reason for either. The Reader wrote his review in 1997. Everything I have read about catastrophism in science for the past ten years (2007) has only confirmed the essentials of Patten's thesis. The Reader wants to simply laugh off Patten, but I think he is overly sensitive.Patten's is a real explanation of causes and relations, which explanatory power is the main criterion you want in a scientifically-satisfactory explanation, which he explains in both his books.Patten as a catastrophic scientist is convincing in both his former and latter works: Ice Epoch and Old Testament. His theological conclusions in Catatrophism in the Old Testament I think, are over extended. Some are plausible - crustal skid in Joshua's long day, could be; the destruction of Sennacherib's army by a discharge of electricity from Mars, could be- but others seem to be incredulous to my mind.Both of Patten's books are strictly scientific in the presentation of the data. Patten's thesis is the most complete theory of catatrophism I have ever read. Nearly all the discoveries I have encountered to date confirm the essential parts of his scientific work, however I would flag his limitations at the point using a scientific explanation to prove theological conclusions.They may or may not be causally related in some cases, but it is up to the reader to accept that by faith, not the writer to assert it dogmatically. Both of Patten's works are highly readable and thought provoking, as opposed to laughter provoking. I recommend them both unreservedly for serious study and comparison with the observations."},{"Title":"Catastrophism & the Old Testament","review":"Donald Patten has continued in the proud tradition of Immanuel Velikovsky: producing a document which is indicative of the author's lack of scientific literacy. This book contains sweeping re-interpretations of the history of the human race. In this book Donald Patten attempts to reach the unusual goal of disproving evolution and creation simultaneously. If you look no where else, that goal is achieved. In this book every event in the Old Testament, from the Tower of Babel to David's victory over the armies of Sennecherib, are the result of the tidal forces created by Earth and Mars closely passing each other in their orbits. It also contains the &quot;truth&quot; about the formation of the solar system. Instead of the erroneous theory about coalescing interstellar dust and hydrogen gas forming the sun and planets, we are presented with the revelation that our sun wandered throughout the galaxy and &quot;collected&quot; the planets from other stars. When enough planets were obtained in this manner, our sun had an &quot;ignition event&quot; and became the bright star we now see. Patten has similar insightful knowledge about Mars. He has determined that Mars once existed with another planet which he designates as &quot;Astra&quot; These two worlds rotated about each other like a binary star system. Through an unidentified cataclysm Astra exploded about 2700 years ago and formed the asteroid belt which now exists between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. A large chunk the the exploded Astra struck Mars and caused its orbit to become very eccentric. This eccentricity created a orbital relationship between Earth and Mars which he designates the &quot;catastrophic era&quot; that lasted about 600 years. One outstading feature of this era is that Mars would approach to within 10,000 miles of Earth every 52 years. The results of such a truly catastrophic approach are all of the events we see recorded in the Old Testament. The Tower of Babel was destroyed by lightning exchanges between the two planets, Noah's flood was caused by tidal surges of the worlds oceans created by the gravimetric mass of Mars, all of the plagues faced by Egypt were caused by this close approach, Sennecherib was destroyed because his army had metal swords which acted as lightning rods, and Joshua's long day was because the Earth stopped rotating on its axis for a period of time. Patten also has a solution for why wooly mammoths have been found frozen in the arctic region. It is his contention that Mars had a third moon at one time. He calls this moon &quot;Glacis&quot; because it was composed entirely of frozen water. On one of the close approaches of Mars to Earth, this &quot;moon&quot; passed within the Roche Limit and exploded. The vast quantity of ice crystals from this event were &quot;vortexed&quot; down the north and south poles. The resulting rain of -300 degree celcius ice flash froze everything in its path. This book will present a person with numerous &quot;scientific&quot; proofs for this event. The one which caused me to roll on the floor in laughter was found in Jonathan Swifts' &quot;Gullivers' Travels&quot;. When Gulliver found himself in the land of Laputa, the astronomers there told him that Mars had two moons in a nearly circular orbit. According to Patten the only way Jonathan Swift would have been aware of such a fact is that he must have read an account of someone who witnessed the Mars-Earth close encounter. After about 600 years of these catastrophic encounters Mars settled back into the orbit it had originally and all has been well with the solar system since. This book is interesting if for no other reason other than the ridiculous claims it contains. There is much entertainment value in this book. I would recommend keeping a copy in a home library for use whenever a good laugh is needed."},{"Title":"Foul Play (Golden Rod Edition)","review":"As a novelist and dramatist, Charles Reade loved to investigate social issues of his day; prison reform, labor unions, and sexual issues all came under Reade's scrutiny. In this novel, published in 1868, his target was the shipping industry and insurance companies that would insure goods aboard ships for loss while placing passengers at great risk. If ships sank, the value of goods would be paid for in full, thus giving little incentive for shipping companies to maintain safe ships. The book is part social reform and part Robinson Crusoe. Robert Penfold is accused of forgery (he's the victim of a practical joke) and serves time in prison. Upon his release, he changes his name to James Seaton and signs on as a seaman aboard the Proserpine, a ship destined to be scuttled by its owners for the insurance money. When she does sink, Seaton and an aristocratic and consumptive woman named Helen Rolleston share a lifeboat. They make it to a deserted island where the Robinson Crusoe likenesses kick in. Seaton is a man who can do no wrong and has a solution for everything; if he felt like building a rocket to the moon, Reade would see that he succeeded. Helen, too, proves very resourceful and miraculously (thanks to all that sunshine and fresh air) recovers from her consumption. After being rescued, Seaton proves his innocence in the forgery he was accused of and goes back to being Robert Penfold, actually Rev. Robert Penfold. In case you couldn't guess, he and Helen marry. Much of what happens on the deserted island is unbelievable, as is Seaton's character, but that is not as important to Reade as the fact that by 1875 Parliament had passed a bill addressing the insurance issues he had brought to the fore in the novel. \\"The end crowns the work,\\" as they say, though it's a fairly pedestrian novel."},{"Title":"Essentials of New Testament Greek","review":"I found this at a used book store for $9.00 and it was well worth it. This is a book that Machen cites in his classic, so it gives you a sense of how old it is, but it is quite useful. This is the smallest Greek text book I have ever seen (it literally fits in one's back pocket) but the font for a lot of it is really not too small, so it is a useful text to carry around. It contains all of 1 John, the Lord's Prayer and 1 Cor 13, so on top of everything else it can be used for a tYPE of portable NT Greek prayer book. It has the complete grammar and seems to actually use the same paradigm charts that Machen would later use. The exercises are all from the NT but are short and the glosses are kept to a minimum. I would recommend this as a type of review/portable resource for someone who already owns Machen or Mounce or Summers."},{"Title":"Guide to Own Siberian Husky (Re Dog)","review":"I was very pleased with this book.

I was constantly referring to the glossary to see what terms meant. I finally went and bought Wind Strategy by David Houghton and High Performance Sailing by Frank Bethwaite, both of which I found easier to read."},{"Title":"The Sailor's Wind","review":"I am a meteorologist and bought this book as we sometimes give talks to our local sailing club. Reading this book was an exercise in total frustration. Mr Walker has undoubtedly catalogued all the winds he has experienced in different parts of the U.S. in detail. But unfortunately he does not seem to have the ability to explain how the wind patterns come about. His language is too wordy and ambiguous, his sentences too long, and leaves one in doubt as to how much he really understands weather patterns and dynamics. If he understands them, he does not seem to have the ability to communicate his understanding to others.For example, in one part of the book he mentions the environmental wind blowing inland. Anyone would then presume a thunderstorm at the coast would be advected inland. But instead he says such thunderstorms move parallel to the shoreline. This leaves one totally mystified. There are countless other such peculiar descriptions in the book.The positive reviews on the back of the book jacket are written by the author's old sailing friends and by his magazine editor, people who would for the sake of long acquaintance, undoubtedly write something good. One wonders how the average sailor (for whom the book seems to be written) would rate it, if they managed to survive reading the book.The book is valuable in that there are many examples of the types of wind flow one can get under different terrain and synoptic situations. However one is left knowing the wind pattern but not understanding how the wind pattern comes about. It is a great pity because this book would have been a very informative one if only the author knew how to explain the meteorological part clearly.Verdict : Buy it if you want a catalogue of the types of winds around the U.S. coastal areas. However if you want to understand how these wind patterns come about, forget it."},{"Title":"The Sailor's Wind","review":"Worth at least ten places at last week's 60th anniversary Lightning regatta at Skaneateles in the New York Finger Lakes region.

This book, Renoir: The Crown Art Library, showcases some of the artist's most beloved works and gives a brief overview of his life.A quick glance at this book tells you that Renoir's favorite subject was always people. In fact, it is possible to select an entire series of masterpieces from Renoir's works without including even one landscape--something that would be impossible with any of the other Impressionists.The people created by Renoir are always filled with the warm joy of simply being alive. Of the many illustrations in this book, most are in color, allowing us to both study and participate in the &quot;joie de vivre&quot; that Renoir, more than any other artist, communicated to the world.There is a short analysis of the evolution of Renoir's technique and we learn why he abandoned the dark, sombre colors of the Old Masters and turned to the brilliant reds, blues, yellows and greens of which he was so fond.We learn how and why the feminine form became a stronger and stronger element in his paintings, especially those of his later years, and we see how, in the last ten years of his life, he limited his palette to only a few colors--cinnabar, ochre, Naples yellow, black and some white, yet managed to create playful visions of a sun-bright world, seemingly devoid of weight; paintings in which contours of people and surroundings are blurred and all is joined in a concord of color and naturalness.Renoir: The Crown Art Library is a wonderful introduction to the life and style of this master Impressionist, the world's most joyous painter. Those looking for a biography of Renoir would be better off choosing Renoir, My Father, by Jean Renoir, the artist's middle son. In-depth analyses of Impressionism and Renoir's own technique in particular, are also better covered in other books such as Rewald's History of Impressionism.But for the vast majority of people, laymen who only want to increase their knowledge and appreciation of the world's greatest artists, Renoir: The Crown Art Library offers a wonderful starting point. With is lavish illustrations and lively text, it will broaden the scope of anyone's understanding. The book is a joy to browse and once insight is gained into the how and why of each painting, that joy is only increased.While certainly far from exhaustive, Renoir: The Crown Art Library, is a lovely book and anyone with even a passing interest in Renoir and Impressionism will find it well worth their while."},{"Title":"Renoir, (World art series)","review":"If you are looking for the book for Renoir, this is it. Large, slipcased filled with over 200 color plates (no black and white at all) this is currently the best book I have seen on the market for an overall glimpse of Renoir's work. He painted thousands of canvases, so this is a wonderful distillation of his career. Some of the old favorites are here, some are blown up to cover 2 pages.Most are at least full page size and cover the gamut of his career.If you need a general book that has excellent reproductions that are clear and a good sampling of his work, this book is very impressive. Some may be bothered by pictures that are split over 2 pages, but they are aligned so well, that all of the painting is visible and you don't need to break the back of the book to see it all. The majority are just on one page, taking up most of the space and very high resolution. Only 3 or 4 of the 200 + paintings are a little on the yellowish side, sadly enough the famous blue umbrella painting seems to be one of them. However, the vast majority are near perfect and the text is well researched."},{"Title":"Renoir, (World art series)","review":"This is a large and magnificent book. It contains a scholary text and an abundance of large beautiful color plates. The book is a truly a pleasure to browse, but also serves as the best serious one-volume monograph on Renoir found on the market today. It is a certainly a lifetime keeper and is protected by a sturdy, illustrated slipcase. Typical of the kind of books published by Abbeville Press, it is worth its full price, let alone the \\"steal price\\" on Amazon."},{"Title":"Renoir, (World art series)","review":"This book was very informative, of both Renoir's life as well as his art. I enjoyed reading it thoroughly and would recommend it to any art lovers."},{"Title":"Del Pueblo: A pictorial history of Houston's Hispanic community","review":"This book is a must for those true historians of Houston's Hispanic contribution from its formation up until the late 1980's. It begins with the exploration and mapping by the Spanish of Texas to the contributions of the Tejanos, Spanish and Mexicans in the Texas Revolution up until the decisive battle of San Jacinto. Dr. Kreneck also explores issues of racism towards Mexicanos and negative sterotyping. Dr. Kreneck then focuses on the urban contributions and presence of the Mexican American population as he examines their role in industry, economics, education, civil rights, social organizations, political oranizations, elected officials, music and sports. It's value is infinite as it documents in photos in chronological order historic events and historical subjects up until the late 1980s. Dr. Kreneck's love and appreciation of the contributions of the Hispanic Community of Houston, Texas clearly is expressed through his work of Del Pueblo A Pictorial History of Houston's Hispanic Community."},{"Title":"Del Pueblo: A pictorial history of Houston's Hispanic community","review":"Del Pueblo is a must-read and pictorial feast for anyone interested in Houston's history--Hispanic or not. Dr. Kreneck's love of, and intimacy with, Houston's Hispanic community is evident throughout. The illustrations are excellently reproduced and the text clear and lively. This is not an in-depth treatise on everything Hispanic in southeast Texas, but rather a pictorial history of the impact Hispanics have had since the first Spanish explorers arrived in the 16th Century to the waves of immigrants that materially changed the face and texture of Houston at the end of the 20th. The book is enriched by the extensive use of primary records and photographs, many of which Dr. Kreneck was involved in adding to the holdings of the Houston Metropolitan Research Center as an archivist there."},{"Title":"Chances","review":"I had read a couple of Jackie Collins' books before (loved them!) so when I saw \\"Chances\\" on sale in early January (2003), I bought it. I was half way through it when I decided I wanted to buy the rest of the books in the series to have available when I was done with Chances (of course bought them through Amazon.com). Jackie is such an awesome writer. I just finished Dangerous Kiss last night and now I'm done with all five in the series. You are kept intrigued with each book that you just want to know what happens until the end. I also love the way she incorporates past book's history into the storyline so that even if you didn't start the series by reading Chance, you would get enough information in the following books to get the gest of what went on (even though reading them all in detail is so much better)."},{"Title":"Chances","review":"Jackie Collins has gotten off to a great start in the \\"Lucky Santangelo\\" series. She's a woman with balls that wants in on the family business. While the father is away, the daughter will play. Gino is a fiesty old man who doesn't believe that daughters ought to be involved in the business. Lucky is determined to prove him wrong. In the end Lucky is on top of the game. When the family is threatened, father and daughter reconcile to form a powerful team for years to come. This is definitely a good book."},{"Title":"Chances","review":"Jackie Collins brings you into the world of the Mafia in the mid 70's like dropping a bomb. From the first pages, you're hooked, and she doesn't let you go until you're crying for more (thank goodness there are the sequels!). You absolutely fall in love with Gino Santangelo; you find yourself rooting for Carrie; you cry for Lucky, and you can't wait until Steven and Lucky finally discover the truth! This book has everything!"},{"Title":"Chances","review":"This book was an incredible adventure for anyone who likes to read and enjoys trashy romance and a little excitement on a boring night."},{"Title":"Chances","review":"The Book is absolutely fantastic ...i couldnt keep it down once i started it...Gino the ram....they call him what a character and lucky his daughter is exceptional.!! i've been reading books since the age of 5 ...but never one like this one..thumps up Jackie Collins"},{"Title":"Chances","review":"This book was exciting, thrilling, adventureous all rolled into one.

They even loved it for people who do not like to read."},{"Title":"Chances","review":"I thought that this was the best book I've ever read....The characters, and the story just blew me away...I like watching soaps on tv, but this was even better, good job Jackie, keep em' coming"},{"Title":"Chances","review":"I have read this book again for the third time. I just can't get enough of &quot;Chances&quot;! I read it when I was 16, 20 and 24. I know I'm reading it yet again when I'm 28! Gina, Carrie, Lucky &amp; Mario are characters that I want remember!"},{"Title":"Chances","review":"Undoubtedly influenced by the success of Judith Krantz, Jackie Collins turned her hand to the family saga with &quot;Chances,&quot; which, unlike her previous novels, actually attempted to go a little deeper than strung-together intervals of sex in exotic places and inventive use of profanity. The result is a really good Jackie Collins novel, which translates into &quot;slightly better than mediocre.&quot; Collins has never been much for character development, but compared to some of her other novels &quot;Chances&quot; is &quot;War and Peace.&quot; A great beach read still, as is its sequel, &quot;Lucky,&quot; despite the dated outlook."},{"Title":"Chances","review":"Chances gets the reader involved in the characters on a deep level and sets the scenes for the next books. I could not put it down."},{"Title":"Chances","review":"If you want to enjoy reading, to enjoy a book, to read a book the you don't want to end, read this one.As always happened to me, I read first the second part of this book Lady Boss, so I knew part of the plot of the book that is written in Lady Boss, but the way Jackie writes and describes everything about Gino and Lucky is just wonderful, I was in love with lucky in Lady Boss, but with this one I almost marry her, excellent book."},{"Title":"Chances","review":"I had an opportunity to meet and speak to J. Collins, at a book signing. she was fun and I enjoyed it much.Chances was a excellent book in a group of other stories about ms. Lucky. the book was great and it keeps you going."},{"Title":"Chances","review":"Jackie Collins and this book would be IT! When I started writing, I thought to myself, I want to be just like her!I loved the character development that carried over time. I loved the way you answered but yet \`didn't answer questions, thus allowing the reader to THINK for themselves. I hope that my books are as haunting as I found this one to be. I couldn't put it down...and it was a pretty big HARDBACK to carry around back then (smile)"},{"Title":"Chances","review":"I have to admit that it took me a while to get into the book. It, however, became really good when Gino had his heart broken by Leonora. He had his heart set on marrying her. Anyway, &quot;Chances&quot; has the elements of a great Jackie Collins novel. It is so campy and I love it!"},{"Title":"Chances","review":"Upon first reading &quot;Chances&quot; I was immediatly hooked!! Gino is such an amazing character. I did not want to put this book down for a second.I knew that when I was getting close to the end of &quot;Chances&quot; that I would not be able to ever find another family in writing quite like the Santangelo's."},{"Title":"Chances","review":"from the moment i picked up this book i couldnt put it down it is the most exciting true to life book i have ever read and id recommend it to anyone human because i know theyll feel the same"},{"Title":"Chances","review":"I first saw Chances as the Mini-series on TV I enjoyed it very much. The very next day I got the book from a friend and started reading it. From that point I was a life long fan of her books. Enjoyed Chances more then I ever dreamed of. I'm 22 years old and I have read this book at least 14 times. I have read the other books in the Lucky Series. I just can't wait to read the latest one."},{"Title":"Chances","review":"i have read most of jackie collins books and i was a little dissapointed by this one. although the characters are interesting and mind boggling...it lacks conviction. there seems to be a void in the reality of i t all. but, as far as trashy romance novels go, this one surely beats out its' many contenders."},{"Title":"Chances","review":"I recently read this book again;having first read it about 20 years ago when it first came out.

A real page turner :-)Chances"},{"Title":"Chances","review":"Mick Jagger once said of Madonna's music that there was a central dumbness about it. There's a central dumbness about Jackie Collins' books as well, but like Madonna's music they have a good beat you can dance to, or turn the pages to in Collins' case. And there are a lot of pages to turn in \\"Chances.\\" This is the epic story of Gino Santangelo, his daughter Lucky, and, to a lesser degree, Carrie Berkley and her son Steven, starting off during a 1977 blackout in New York City and flashing back as early as 1913 to the characters' pasts. Both Gino and Carrie are born into poverty and essentially left to fend for themselves. Gino, blessed with a sharp mind and a generous endowment, becomes a notorious gangster and ladies man. Carrie, a striking African-American woman with Oriental eyes and full breasts, is forced into prostitution, but later embraces the profession after overcoming a heroin addiction. Lucky wants her father's attention, but if she can't have that she'll settle for running the family business, especially since her gay brother Dario isn't interested. Carrie, who ultimately marries her way out of the sex trade -- and marries well -- provides a first rate education for her son Steven, described as \\"in the O.J. Simpson league\\" (this was a good thing in 1977), who grows up to become an assistant D.A.Collins has provided the framework for a rollicking read, but while \\"Chances\\" is often entertaining, it's not exactly satisfying. With a prose style that could be charitably described as conversational (assuming the conversation is with a gossipy, foul-mouthed neighbor who has no qualms about sharing her sexual fantasies/experiences in graphic detail), Collins is adept at thrilling us with the naughty exploits of her characters, but her footing is less sure when it comes to plotting and character development. \\"Chances\\" has several key moments--a disastrous party given by a sexually demanding senator's wife; Lucky's entanglements with her misbehaving school friend Olympia and a has-been film director; the grand opening of a casino--but the book is often stuck idling until it gets to them, regaling us with tales of Gino's sexploits and Carrie's mistreatment in the meantime. Details of Gino's rise in the Mafia, something that might have given this story a little more meat if not depth, are usually relayed in a few summary paragraphs as Collins rushes ahead to recount the well-endowed mobster's next fling. Had \\"The Godfather\\" been written by Collins, the Corleones' sex lives would be vividly detailed while that horse head scene would get mentioned in one measly sentence.Collins has even less patience for character development, preferring to get that out of the way by listing character traits in quick, staccato-like bursts. \\"B--ch. Child. Liberated lady. Temptress. Costa knew her as all these things,\\" is how she introduces Lucky. The reader is supposed to know her as all these things, too, though it's the first trait that dominates. How such an insufferable character as Lucky became the basis for an entire series of bestsellers escapes me, but maybe I'm expecting too much from my trash fiction. In fact, there's not really a likable character in this whole book, save the milquetoast Costa, Gino's implausible best friend, and Steven, who almost resembles an actual human being. Carrie is less a heroine than an object of pity.\\"Chances\\" does provide 500 pages worth of dumb, trashy fun. Unfortunately, it's an 800-page book."},{"Title":"Chances","review":"\\"Chances\\" was THE big book for Jackie Collins. Lucky Santangelo makes her sizzling debut in this tale of mobsters and high society glamour. From the opening prologue during the great black-out of New York City, the author puts all the characters in direct conflict with one another better than any night-time soap opera ever did. We meet Gino and Dario Santangelo and all the origins of that great story. Each chapter is filled with all the elements to really keep you turning the pages to see what happens next. It is a long book, but you never \\"wish it would end\\", in fact you hope it never does. I love this book and enjoy returning to it--if only for a chapter or two of mindless escape--You will love it...BW"},{"Title":"Chances","review":"It's 11pm on Tuesday night and I am still up reading. My husband had to take the book away from me it was that good. I bought Jackie Collins' \\"Chances\\" on Saturday afternoon and by Sunday I was halfway through it; by Monday afternoon I was so enthralled with the Santangelo family. Jackie Collins is what I would call a great storyteller, she literally took me by my hand and lead me into this world that she imagined and soon, I was her willing captive. This book has it all, love, sex, tradegy, joy, the good, the bad, the heart wrenching; it is one of the best books I have read in such a long time. I highly recommend it! If you were going be on a flight or a long boring bus ride, you would devour this book up like I did. I am a fan for life, I do believe!"},{"Title":"Chances","review":"This is by far one of my favorite books. I have read this book, so many times, and each time I love it! Chances is the first book in a series of Santangelo Novels. This book has so much depth to it. I would have rated it wit 10 stars if I could!This book is about a street hood named Gino Santangelo who grows up with the rough childhood. His Father Paulo, was a drunk, who beat on women, and was in and out of jail, leaving Gino to fend for himself. The one thing Gino knew was that he hated his father with a passion, and would not be like him. Gino,s fathers wife,Vera was a worn out prostitute who, took Gino in and gave him the closest thing to a home. Meanwhile Gino was in and out of Juvenile Homes, and Jail.In A boys Home Gino Met a small kid named Costa. Costa was a small timid boy, who was getting raped and molested by one of the Men in the Home. Gino walked upon Casta getting molested and came to his defense. This rescue formed a lifetime friendship between Costa and Gino. Shortly after Costa was adopted into a family, and Gino was released because he became of age.Gino was a small time hood trying to put money in his pockets by committing small crimes and driving. He became involved with Bonnatti a known big time Hustler, and made a name for himself. Costa was always in admiration of Gino, as soon as he was settled he invited Gino to his home. Gino met Costa's sister Lenora and was in love at first site. They made plans to marry, Gino planned on going home to save money then he would send for Lenora. Later Costa delivered the news to Gino that Lenora was already married with a baby.Years later Costa introduced Gino to Lenora's daughter Maria, it was love at first site. Maria and Gino married and had 2 children Lucky and Dario.Dario was gay, and never wanted Gino to find out, as Lucky had all the balls and followed in her fathers footsteps. Together Lucky and Gino built an empire which was legitimate Hotel Businesse's in Vegas. This book is all that it has so many twists and turns.You will be introduced and enthralled by so many more characters like Stephen, Carrie, Enzio, Olympia and so on and so on, dont want to give too much of the book away but I promise that this book is a winner, and Jackie Collins delivers in this novel."},{"Title":"Chances","review":"I really enjoyed reading Chances. It was my first book by Jackie Collins and I read it pretty quickly even though it is quite long. There were multiple story lines and the story started off in 1977, then backed up to the 1920s. This got my interest because I kept wondering what things had happened in the characters lives to get them to where they were in 1977. I have thought about the book since reading it and also plan on reading the other Lucky Santangelo books. I liked the dialogue between the characters also. This book was great. My only warning is that it is at least \\"R\\" rated... so don't read it if you are offended by swearing, drugs or explicit sex scenes."},{"Title":"Chances","review":"One might be attempted to regard this book as nothing more than a sexed-up version of The Godfather, but it is much more. At its heart, Chances is a story of the relationship (or lack thereof) between a father and his daughter; not to mention the repercussions of their life choices. This book is also a great historical novel that begins in 1913 takes us through prohibition, the founding of Vegas, through 1979. In between there is love and loss, children born, loved ones killed and a rollicking good time. Of all Collins' novels, Chances remains her best example of character development and well-developed plotting. The story hooks you from page one and charcters are the kind that actually make you root for them to succeed. Collins has written several sequels to this novel featuring Lucky Santangelo, but with the exception of the eponymous Lucky, none of them compare to this first novel."},{"Title":"Chances","review":"Oh, Jackie Collins. I have read countless titles from her, the majority from the Santangelo series, with good ole Gino and Lucky. I was excited when I was offered a review copy of Chances, where readers will see how it all began. This is the first Lucky book to be released as an eBook, and if you haven't gotten a chance to read it yet - do it! I've never quite figured out how to describe a Jackie Collins book, but while I was reading through her bio I saw that she has been called a \\"raunchy moralist\\" by Vanity Fair, and I feel like that's pretty fair. I was trying to describe this particular book to a girlfriend who just got done with the Fifty Shades of Grey series, and the word \\"filthy\\" kept being brought up. For sure - if you do not like very explicit sex scenes, foul language, murder, etc., I would keep away.For those who don't - wow, this is quite a book! I loved learning the beginning of the Santangelo's, and I mean the very beginning. The book starts off in the 1920's and switches quickly between characters and time. We learn how Gino got started in the streets, his family life, how he made \\"business acquaintances,\\" to when he fell in love with Maria and had his two children - Lucky and Dario. They both get to tell their POV's as well, and I had blast reading about Lucky getting kicked out of boarding school and learning where her Santangelo smarts (and balls) came from. The story also follows Carrie and her son Steven. Carrie was forced into prostitution at the age of thirteen by her own grandmother and uncle, and then sold off to a whorehouse where she fell heavily into drugs. It was fascinating to know that Carrie in the present had money, prestige, even fame, and to see glimpses into the past of how she was able to overcome all the horrors of her life. I never minded the switching back and forth so many times, it's the Jackie Collins style that I have learned to love, and I feel it almost made this (fairly lengthy) novel go by even quicker. The ending was so crazy! I was frantically pressing the \\"next page\\" button on my Kindle to see how the story would end, how the lives of all these characters were intertwine - and who would make it out alive. If you can handle these types of book, I would recommend not only Chances but many others from the intriguing Santangelo series."},{"Title":"Chances","review":"Gino \\"The Ram\\" Santangelo is one of my favorite fictional mobsters. Love, lust and murder abound this is my favorite book in the Santangelo family saga followed closely byLucky, the next book in the series. Chances begins fast moving and doesn't slow down.

The series is incredible, and both men and women can appreciate her take on the world and fall in love with the characters she create with skill and passion."},{"Title":"Chances","review":"I just love this story, it's about impossible to put down. It follows the crazy lives of several characters with love, betrayal, operations of the mob, murder-you name it- the only complaint is that it does include MANY graphic sex scenes, almost to the point of over-kill. This is definitely an adult read. I do plan to read the sequels too!"},{"Title":"Chances","review":"I'm a huge fan of Jackie Collins, and have read all her books! But I must say by far the Lucky series are the best! Make time, find time and you will read over and over again!"},{"Title":"Chances","review":"Those who still haven't met the Santagelo clan should definitely do so by picking up CHANCES. Storyteller extraordinaire Collins pens out an effective saga of a poor boy venturing into the Mafia business of the 20's, where a bunch of friends and foes suffer in the name of love, honor or revenge. The author does a great job delivering an edge-of-your-seat escapism read that goes back and forth in time. Furthermore, The now-infamous I-am-woman-hear-me-roar Lucky Santagelo character is even introduced. Oh yes, CHANCES should definitely be on top of everyone's reading pile.-----Martin Boucher"},{"Title":"Chances","review":"This book was recommended to me by an ex-boyfriend, I loved it!

I read the entire book from beginning to end and in this book I really admired the characters for going for what they wanted. From Gino's early beginnings in Brooklyn's &quot;Little Italy&quot; to daughter Lucky's ruthless ambition not to mention Carrie's humble beginnings as a child prostitute to a lady of glamour and elegance to passing on a better life for her son Steven, the action never lags and even when the story ended in 1977 you couldn't help but want more."},{"Title":"Chances","review":"This book will keep you at the edge of your seat and, trust me you will not be able to put it down once you start.

I have read it several times and turned some of my friends onto Jackie Collins with this book. The characters are wonderful. Gino is every woman's dream and Lucky is who every woman wants to be. You will have a hard time putting this book down!"},{"Title":"Chances","review":"Long, trashy fun novel about the rise of a gangster named Gino, and the effect of his life choices on his kids, esp. daughter Lucky. If you like watching soap operas, then this is your bag, because this book reads like one--but with more punch than any of the ones you've seen on TV."},{"Title":"Chances","review":"This is one of the best novels I have read so far.

It offers interesting characters with interesting quirks and interesting biographical stories, for the most part.As I read the book, I looked forward each day to picking the book up to read, and basically that's what a &quot;good&quot; book is all about (wouldn't you agree?), keeping the reader interested, wanting to find out what happens next, like an intriguing &quot;soap opera&quot; (I don't watch them, so maybe Collins is a substitute for that TV storytelling....and she works fine as a substitute....better, I'd say).The only criticism I would make is about the abrupt and somewhat unbelievable ending of this book. Yes, I know, this is the beginning of a series, but check this out. You are a long-time, experienced gangster (Enzio Bonnatti), already an old man, and you want to &quot;hit&quot; two rivals: Do you send a timid, ineffectual son to kill his own father and sister? No, you send a professional.Now, the hit fails (everyone but Bonnatti seems to see the failure coming) and one of the intended victims (Lucky) shows up at your home, which is guarded by whom? One overweight, incompetent lout (&quot;Big Victor&quot;)? Just one fat thug? (Russo doesn't count, because he's out picking up the wannabe movie producer.) I don't think so. Let's have a team of bad guys here, please. Now, does the lout frisk the intruder? No again. Instead, you, the old mobster who knows he has to be careful all the time meets the intruder in his own bedroom and, well, the rest is &quot;history.&quot; Jackie's history.But the rest of the book works better than this implausible ending. One more minor complaint. Why is it that Ms. Collins always has her men interested in the upper portion of the female anatomy, and not the bottom portion? She seems not to realize that not all men are interested in the female upper anatomy, as much as they are the lower anatomy. No men in this book have these different tendencies. They're all &quot;upper anatomy&quot; men. A shame for those of us like the lower half better, poor sniveling ingrates that we are.Why is it that I kept imagining most of this book taking place in Los Angeles/Hollywood? I know the blackout was in New York, but I kept seeing L.A. There are some references to Bel Air and other parts of L.A., but most of the action is in New York. Can you tell I'm not a New York person? I can. Diximus."},{"Title":"Chances","review":"I was looking for something new to read and for years I heard of Ms, Collins reputation as a writer.

I finally decided to investigate for myself, and since I enjoy reading fiction that involves the Mafia, I settled upon _Chances_, the first book in the Santangelo family saga. Wow! What a read! Suspense, steamy sex, violence, intrigue... it's all there. I found myself with a giant crush on the tough Gino Santangelo, and I came to admire his headstrong daughter, Lucky. Collins creates quite a memorable cast of characters in this novel. Some reviewers have noted that the story seemed &quot;dated,&quot; as this book was published in 1975, but I thought this was an unfair criticism. Afterall, all the great works of literature are &quot;dated.&quot; Not that I'm equating this book with great literature, but I thought this made the book even more appealing... giving the reader (who, like me, might have been very young in the 70's) a glimpse into that era. If you're a fan of Mafia-esque novels, and you're looking for a book that will immediately draw you in and carry you away, this is one I would recommend. I could hardly put it down! Now, I'm getting started on the sequel because I just don't want the journey to end!"},{"Title":"Chances","review":"I remember as a young girl growing up, my mother used to read Jackie Collins' books. I used to sneak them to my room and try to read them, but I would never get past the 1st chapter because she would always catch me and snatch it away, saying I wasn't \\"old enough\\" to read books like this... Boy was mom right! At age 10 I would NEVER be able to appreciate \\"books like this\\".CHANCES by Jackie Collins is one word -UNPARALLED. Never before have I read a novel so gripping and full of emotion... it is to the point where someone tomorrow can ask me \\"what is your favorite book?\\"... and instead of my answer being \\"too many to name\\"... I will respond \\"Chances\\".Meet Gino Santangelo - mob boss, father, business man, player, friend...he is all of these things and more. Gino had a very tough life growing up. His mother left him and his father when he was just a young boy and his father lashed out by turning into an abusive monster. He went from home to home, where he toughened up, got smart and vowed to never be like his dad. Collins' takes us through his entire life, never missing a beat. We watch him grow, and become one of the most successful casino and hotel owners. But then an unfortunate event takes place banning Gino from America. Who will take his place? In comes Lucky his stunning daughter, who is a carbon-copy of her father in every way imaginable. She is determined to be bigger and better then her old man.In this book we are also introduced to Carrie, a woman who was forced into prostitution at the tender age of 12, paving the way for the unfortunate circumstances she had to suffer through.Both Carrie and Gino's stories ones to always remember. Compelling, and out of this world, CHANCES is really a 10 star book. I will definitely be picking up the 2nd book in the Santangelo saga.Bravo Ms. Collins!!"},{"Title":"Chances","review":"Chances is a non-stop action. If you like sex, murder, intrigue, love and lust, the Santangelo Family for you. Gino the Ram who is almighty and powerful and a up and coming star Lucky Santangelo who has yet to begin her adventures. I have read all of Jackie Collins books except her latest LA Connections which will be next. But if you want to start at the beginning of the Santangelo Family saga, Chances is where I got hooked. ENJOY IT I did."},{"Title":"Chances","review":"Chances was exactly the right book at the right time for me. I'd been working very hard and needed a break. Happily, the next weekend was sunny and I was able to spend a lot of it out in the garden with my pink yoga mat (same shade as the book cover, incidentally), a pillow, and this book.Chances starts in 1977, as crime boss Gino Santangelo is on his way back to New York after a period of exile. Daughter Lucky, who has been running the show in his absence, isn't thrilled and a power struggle seems to be in the offing. Meanwhile, socialite Carrie is on her way to Harlem in response to a mysterious message which she thinks relates to the dark secrets in her past. The date is Wednesday, July 13th. Ring any bells? Not for me, so the blackout came as a surprise, throwing the characters' lives into chaos.The 1977 storyline is intertwined with the backstories, told in flashback, of Gino and Carrie, and finally all three strands come together - with a twist. I enjoyed all three narratives, but got especially absorbed in the story of Carrie, a young black girl sold into prostitution in the 1920s by her abusive family.Gino, brought up by a series of foster parents, comes from a similarly bleak background. He chooses a criminal career because it offers scope for his ambitions, which his legitimate job as a mechanic doesn't. His early jobs as a getaway driver are risky, but so is working under cars: a friend is nearly killed when the jack holding up the Cadillac he is working on collapses. At twenty Gino is building a bootleg empire. At forty, wealthy, feared and respected, he is building Las Vegas. But he has to pay a terrible price for his success, and in more than one way.His daughter, Lucky, is probably Jackie Collins's best-known character. She is very much a product of second-wave feminism. Trapped in an elevator during the blackout with Carrie's son Stephen, Lucky corrects him when he addresses her as Miss: it's Miz. Later, at his apartment (after a night spent trapped in the lift), when he suggests she could make them breakfast, she explains that she can't cook. Anyone further from the insecure, self-deprecating, slip-dress-wearing, barefoot, cupcake-baking (but burning the cakes, of course, because she's such a ditz) heroine prancing across the pastel covers of chicklit from here to eternity cannot be imagined. Thank God.I found that while the book didn't skimp on either sex or violence, these scenes were never gratuitous. They are there to tell the story. And it's a great story. Not perfect: I had to suspend disbelief about Gino masterminding a criminal empire while staying clear of both prostitution and narcotics, and I would have liked more detail to convince me of Carrie's transformation from call girl to society wife - I think it could be done, but not without a major crash course in speech, etiquette, fashion and a lot else.Bottom line: Chances is an exhilarating rags-to-riches rollercoaster. I'm looking forward to reading the sequels."},{"Title":"Chances","review":"If I could give Chances more than five stars I would! Chances is the first Jackie Collins book that I have ever read and I think that I started with the right one.Chances takes you from 1913 all the way up to 1979 in a tale that begins with Gino Santagelo the infamous mob boss and his rise to power. Gino came from very humble begings, an abusive father, a mother who abandoned him at the sage of five and a damageing stint in a juvinle detention center yet managed to work his way up to owning two of the most successful hotel & casinos in Las Vegas. But once Gino is force into exile his duaghter the beautiful Lucky Santangelo takes over the family business and makes a name for herself as one of the most powerful women in Las Vegas. And lets not forget the story of Carrie and her son Steven. Carrie was forced into prostitution at a very young age and lived a life filled with drugs and alcohol that took her from various whorehouses to running a very successful one of her own, until the birth of her son Steven that is, when she managed to find a better life for her and her son.This was a brilliantly written story, however, while the chapters that focused on Gino may have been more exciting, Carrie's story was really superbly written. This book is really a great lead in to the second installment of this series 'LUCKY' which I plan to begin reading right away. I give Chances 6 Stars!"},{"Title":"Chances","review":"This book is the birth of Gino Santangelo's career of a gangster and business, Carrie's tumultous life from thirteen in prostitution and drugs to her rise as one of the most elegant black women in America, and Lucky's childhood cut short by the murder of her mother, her rendevous with Olympia Stanislopulous in Europe, and start in the business her father created.

It follows Gino Santangelo a tough Italian kid from 1921 to 1977 and his lives and loves in America. It also follows the story of Carrie a poor black girl and what she goes through. This book has everything--murder, rape, sex, double-crosses and a huge cast of characters. Also this book introduces us to Lucky Santangelo--Gino's daughter--who has become one of Collins most popular characters. She's beautiful, strong and gets what she wants when she wants it. She's also been spun off into her own series of adventures.The book is very long--805 pages in my copy--but you're never bored. It moves VERY quickly and so much is happening that it's actually fun to read. A lot of people seem to think Collins writes trash but I disagree. Sure, there's tons of sex and violence but she doesn't get into detail. She makes it clear what's happening then moves quickly on. Also her characters are complex intriguing people. They act and sound like real people not fictional characters. The book isn't perfect. Some of the sexual politics are badly dated and there were so many characters I was getting a little confused at the end. Still this is a quick and fun read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Chances","review":"I really love this book, but I found a few misspelled words. Amazon need to get the book Lucky for the kindle"},{"Title":"Chances","review":"I was asked to review this book in celebration of the re-release of Chances for ereaders.Chances is the first book in Jackie Collins Lucky Santangelo series. This book literally has everything you can ever want in a story. There is family drama, mystery, murder, suspense, romance, and a lil comedy.The story starts with Gino Santangelo as a young boy. Continues telling his story with his wife, Maria, their 2 children, Lucky and Mario, and many of their thug like friends.My favorite story line is of Lucky, even though she is a female, taking over Gino's empire when he is forced of the country by the IRS. To see Gino's daughter grow into a very tough, hard, core woman made me envious. She truly made it to the top of a man's world in a time that women mostly were stayed home and behind the man.The side story of Carrie, a young lady, who grew up as a hooker and drug addict intertwined perfectly with Gino and Lucky's story. It kept me curious as to how the stories were going to mesh together over and over again. I loved how Carries son, Steven, and Lucky met and cannot wait to see where that story heads.Usually I am a fast reader with Chances I slowed way down so that I would not reach the end too quickly. Now that I am finished I want to read it again and again. I definitely will read the next book in this series."},{"Title":"Chances","review":"Filled with suspenseful, action packed, vivid characters, steamy sex, a vintage world, violence and action, this is a story that will keep you turning pages with its suspense. Set mostly in the 1920s and 1970s, the books flips between the two and touches the decades in between as well, following the lives of vibrant, memorable characters. Gino is something else, coming from such humble beginnings to change his life. He may do questionable things, but he shows he has a heart as well. His daughter Lucky is just as dynamic as he is. She gets into her own share of trouble and is sometimes misunderstood by her father, a man she adores--mostly. Carrie is such a strong character that she is inspiring. The things she survives...The story flows effortlessly, bringing the reader along on an adventure with details so rich it's almost like watching a movie. The characters are complex. One can sympathize with their suffering even though a few of them are tainted. When these characters do bad things though, they have their reasons. The leads are very strong, surviving against great odds amongst poverty and dire circumstances to finally live in privilege. They work hard, they play hard, and they face extreme danger.The sex scenes would make some people blush. Reading this story will give one a glimpse into the world of the other side, how the mob lives. The vintage aspects are interesting as well. It's fun to read about characters trying to make it in bygone eras.Fans of The Godfather books and movies should check out this book. It's the first in a series, epic in scope, following an intriguing family.Originally posted at LAS Romance Reviews"},{"Title":"Chances","review":"Always a good beach read> The book moves fast and no thought process is needed!

Sadly, the injustices he so passionately wrote about and fought against almost a century ago are still among us today, like: the criminalization of immigrants, the suppression of civil liberties, union-busting, police brutality, the prison industrial complex, imperialist war, the militarization of the US/Mexico border and the violence of white supremacist militias (like the Minutemen). I especially enjoyed his writings on feminism and his committment to bringing issues of racial equality into the labor movement. In sum, \\"Dreams of Freedom\\" is a ground-breaking work. Thank you AK Press and Chaz Bufe for keeping alive this vital chapter in people's history!"},{"Title":"Dreams of Freedom : A Ricardo Flores Magon Reader","review":"Dreams Of Freedom: A Ricardo Flores Magon Reader presents a selection of the revolutionary journalist and agitator Ricardo Flores Magon. Born in Mexico in 1874, Magon dared to criticize the injustices of the Diaz military dictatorship that ruled Mexico, in his widely read newspaper Regeneracion. Exiled to the United States, Magon remained an influential agitator behind the Mexican Revolution, earning the wrath of both governments. He was finally murdered in Leavenworth Penitentiary in 1922. Dreams Of Freedom presents Magon's determined and vibrant revolutionary writings in English for the first time, along with a lengthy biographical sketch to place his words in historical context, a chronology, bibliography, and an introduction by Benjamin Maldonado. Most of the individual writings are brief yet passionate and sharply to the point. Highly recommended particularly for students of political science and Mexican history."},{"Title":"Man, the unknown,","review":"_Man the Unknown_ (1935) by Nobel Prize winning biologist Alexis Carrel is a work of philosophy written by a \\"man of science\\" which attempts to provide an understanding of the human being in terms of what is known and can be known and the unknown nature of man. Alexis Carrel (1873 - 1944) was a French surgeon and biologist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine. Carrel worked in both the United States and Europe where he spent time at the Rockefeller Instititute for Medical Research. This book considers the need for a better knowledge of man, maintaining that man in fact largely remains an unknown. Carrel expresses concerns over the rise of the modern world and the growth of large cities and modern forms of entertainment. Carrel sees much of modernity as having a degenerative effect on mankind, leading to the rise of a vast unproductive class, a level of degeneracy among the children of vast fortunes, and an increase in nervous disorders and feeble-mindedness as well as criminal activity. Carrel explains man in terms of his physiology and biology and explains how these sciences relate to his psychology. Carrel also explains the role of science but also argues for faith and notes results obtained in the field of parapsychology. Carrel advocates a eugenics intellectual elite be set up to guide human breeding and advocates harsh measures be taken against criminal activity, including the death penalty for the worst sorts of criminal activity.This book includes the following chapters-Preface - explains the author's role as a scientist and a keen observer of humanity. Notes the importance of science for the modern world and explains how the author came to see the need for a new knowledge of man. Explains how modern civilization cannot be allowed to continue along its present course and must be guided properly to avoid further degeneration of the human condition and the beauty of civilization.The Need of a Better Knowledge of Man - explains the slower progress in the sciences of life than in those of inert matter and explains how this has led to a general ignorance of the nature of man. Notes the difficulties encountered by modern man in his world and contrasts this to the life of our ancestors. Explains how science and technology have modified the environment of humanity and altered the habits of man. Contrasts the old feudal system to that of the modern city and notes some of the unintended consequences of such a change. Notes how further developments in medicine have increased human life expectancy but also led to many unintended consequences including a rise in nervous disorders (also brought about by increased stressors of modern life). Explains how many of these changes were made with a complete disregard for the nature of man and the need for a more complete knowledge of ourselves.The Science of Man - explains the need for a science of man, the role of operational concepts and its applications to human beings, the need for a complete survey of the existence of man leaving no part out, and explains how the science of man is to be more important than all other sciences. The author notes that in the new science of man unexplainable facts are not to be ignored and distinguishes between man as body and soul. The author notes the role of physiology in understanding the human body and the role of intelligent animals in furthering our knowledge of physiology as well as many of the difficulties encountered in scientific experimentation.Body and Physiological Activities - explains the dual aspect of man and the role of consciousness and states of consciousness in man. Notes the role of cell types that compose the human organism, the role of blood, the importance of nutrition (as well as the changes undergone in nutrition in the transition to modern society), digestion and the role of food, sexual functions, the role of the nervous system and the prominence of nervous diseases in relation to modern stressors, both the fragility and robustness of the body (explaining how modern conditions have resulted frequently in bodily fragility or mental and moral weakness), and factors involved in health and the role of disease.Mental Activities - explains the role of man's mental activities and the role of psychology, considering man as composed of body and soul. Explains the role of intellectual activities and their measurement, the role of scientific certainty, intuition, logical and intuitive understandings, and the role of parapsychology including clairvoyance and telepathy. The author contrasts faith with scientific knowledge and maintains that the certainties of faith are similar to the knowledge obtained through clairvoyance as opposed to scientific knowledge. The author considers the role of moral activities and the decline in moral robustness with the rise of modernity. The author relates these to other consciousness activities, the role of intellectual, aesthetic, and mystic activities, the relationship between physiological and mental activities as well as the role of mystical states, meditation versus action, prayer, and miracles. The author notes the atrophy of consciousness, the decline in the moral state (contrasting the high morality of the Catholic saints with the general low moral standing of the modern individual), and the role of mental diseases including feeble-mindedness as well as mental degeneracy resulting from modern conditions.Inward Time - notes the importance of the conscious sense of inward time, explaining the notions of duration, extension and measurement, and relating measurement to inward time. Relates these issues to modern physical theory including that of Einstein and others, and explains the characteristics of physiological time. Notes the role of human longetivity but contrasts biological time to inward time, explaining how aging may affect men differently. Advocates artificial rejuvenation as a means for slowing down the process of aging in mankind but notes some of the difficulties and unintended consequences encountered through such procedures. Explains further issues involving physiological time and the individual as well as the role of rhythm.Adaptive Functions - notes the importance of the adaptive functions for duration, examines the regulation of the blood, repair of tissues, the role of modern surgery, the role of diseases and immunity to disease, both artificial and natural health, changes imposed upon the body by adaptive functions, and adaptation to social environment. The author maintains that adaptation to social environment has been impeded and that modern civilization has led to a general sloughing off of adaptive function.The Individual - explains the human being versus the individual in the quarrel between realists and nominalists (in scholastic philosophy). Notes the individuality of tissues and humors, characteristics of personality, individuality and disease, and modern medicine and the role of Universals. The author contrasts behaviorists who believe that environment contributes to development and geneticists who frequently advocate a system of eugenics. The author explains the temporal extension of the individual and notes that both realism and nominalism are indispensable for the understanding of man as both human being and individual.The Remaking of Man - the author maintains that a new science of man can lead to his rejuvenation following a period of modern decline. Here the author lays out some of his schemes for the improvement of society. The author explains the necessity for a change in intellectual outlook and some of the errors made by the Renaissance. The author notes that science has become more compartmentalized and it has become impossible for single individuals to master all of science and explains the need for improvements in the sciences. The author explains how individuals are to be selected into social and biological classes. The author advocates the creation of an elite based on voluntary eugenics and a hereditary aristocracy. This is in contrast to the degeneracy of modern aristocracy which fails to achieve the accomplishments of their forebearers. The author explains the important physical and chemical factors in the formation of the individual, the role of physiological factors, mental factors, health, and the development of the personality. The author calls for harsh measures to be taken against criminals, including the use of corporal and capital punishment for the worst offenders. Finally, the author explains how this new science of man will lead to his remaking and a new understanding of the human universe.While this book is certainly dated it provides an interesting philosophical study of the role of man and society and the relationship between modern science and civilization. The author concerns himself largely with problems that have resulted from modern civilization, the rise of degeneracy, and the role of criminality. Many of these problems continue to plague the modern world continuing on from the early 20th century when they played a more prominent role in the thought of humanity's intellectuals. I felt that this work was interesting for what it had to say about such effects of modernity and their role in society."},{"Title":"Man, the unknown,","review":"Dr. Carrel was fascinated with the mind-body connection and has brought to life his understanding after thousands of surgeries.

It was written at the turn of the 19th century and it was very interesting how the concerns then...are our concerns now.Conflict, burden, truth, knowledge, are timeless principles.My reservation is...it was a little long winded.

Similarly it goes into detail about how the Chisso Coperation (which was responsible for the polluting of the bay) consistently tired to first to cover up its responsibility for polluting the bay, and later its efforts to intimidate and discredit the victims of Minamata disease and their supporters. In this area the book does a very thorough job. The book however covers the cause of Minamata disease, organic mercury poisoning only periferally. I found this to be a flaw in the book. Although met as a &quot;human history&quot; of the effects of the organic mercury poisoning of Minamata Bay, the book still needed to cover several things. For example, how the mercury moved through the food chain, and how it finally caused severe disease and deaths in humans should have been covered. Adding this information would have greatly improved the reader's understanding of Minamata disease and made the book much more powerful. Still the book is very good and largely does what the author intended - to show both the suffering of the Minamata disease victims, as well as the extreme corperate irresponsiblity that led to so much human suffering and destruction of the environment. For those interested in a historical event which had a great effect on the environmental movement, as well as our understanding of how pollutnants can move through the foodchain the ultamately effect human health, I recommend the book."},{"Title":"Boatbuilding manual,","review":"This book is (or should be) truly mandatory for anyone constructing a boat or rebuilding a boat (sail or power) made of wood. It is an invaluable reference, and has a wealth of information and tips for the most experienced boatbuilder. Most importantly however, is that it paints a remarkably accuate portrait of what is involved in working with the media of wood and water. It will either encourage the motivated amateur, or discourage him or her with its no-nonsense explanation of the nature of such an undertaking.In short, it makes life easier for *anyone* who works with wooden boats, sail or power."},{"Title":"Boatbuilding manual,","review":"The Boatbuilding Manual is essentially a text book, in all sense of the word, of boatbuilding. It's a great introduction to boatbuilding for beginners and amateurs. If you're looking for a quick, purely instructional guide to building a seacraft, this might not be your cup of tea. But if you are looking for an in-depth, well-researched and well-presented book building a boat, then you have the right book."},{"Title":"Boatbuilding manual,","review":"I have worked as a carpenter professionally for thirty years and I have finally reached a point in my life where I would like to build something for myself. Why not a boat?Upon the recommendation of a naval designer, I purchased a copy of this book and a couple of others. Having had no experience with boat building, sailing, or the like, I was in hopes of finding some answers to questions like, \\"How do I get started?\\"; \\"What order do you work in?\\" and \\"where do I go for materials and fittings?\\"The first thing I discovered is that the terminology and language of boat building is far from anything I have known and the book helped a great deal with defining and aiding the understanding of the language. Next, the book opened up not only a whole new world of carpentry, but a history of the evolution of boat building through the various designs, styles, and methods of construction, and they are numerous.This is both an entertaining book, if you like boats, as well as an educational book if you are searching to answer the questions that plague a non nautical person faced with the task of building a boat. In the case of the latter, sometimes the first reading is not enough, but the answers are there.I would certainly recommend this book to anyone who wished to pursue the craft, with the warning that the Patinence required when reading to educate yourself, is proportional to that required to carry on the physical craft of construction. Take your time, work the math, and enjoy!This will definitely remain a resource for me througghout the project."},{"Title":"Boatbuilding manual,","review":"This book is a wonderful introduction and reference work on the art of boatbuilding.

Keegan provides a study of the styles of 4 generals &#65533; &#65533;heroic&#65533; leadership of Alexander the Great, &#65533;non-heroic&#65533; examples of Duke of Wellington and US Grant, and a &#65533;pseudo-heroic&#65533; dictact of Adolph Hitler. Each individual study paints a quick picture of the personality of a general, reviews political situation, military technology and the prevailing warfare doctrine, reviews major battles fount and lessons learned. Of a particular importance, as is always with Keegan, are factors of technology and personality. Each of the generals will answer the question of the personal involvement and his place in battle in a different way. Alexander in always the front, in the first raw of the phalanx, mounted on a white horse, or the first scaling the walls of the besieged town. For him a general attains trust and leadership by personal example. He is the &#65533;first&#65533; of his men. Wellington and Grant are &#65533;directors&#65533; of the battle, whose purpose is to provide logistics and advise on tactics. Hitler, although he paints himself the &#65533;first soldier of the Reich&#65533; is a psychologist and a technocrat, who seeks to provide moral leadership via demagoguery alone.This book reads like a breeze. Mostly impressive, in my own opinion, are reconstruction of the battles of Alexander from sometime scant historical evidence, insightful analysis of the unassuming leadership style of Grant, and the analysis of Wellington as an aristocrat of the battle. Great read!!!"},{"Title":"The Mask of Command (Leather-bound Library of Military History)","review":"Keegan's Face of Battle is one of my favorite books, indeed one of the finest works on the human dimension of war in print. Mask of Command, however, did not live up to that standard. While the depictions of Alexander, Wellington, Grant, and Hitler are insightful, Keegan's simplistic notion of the &quot;heroic&quot; paradigm of leadership (be it heroic, anti-heroic, post-heroic, etc.) is overdrawn and unsatisfying. For instance, Alexander is Keegan's embodiment of &quot;heroic&quot; leadership. If &quot;heroic&quot; was truly the standard for leadership in ancient times, why did Alexander's soldiers revolt against him (several times), even though Alexander never stopped being heroic? Alexander's leadership, warts and all, is better explained by the strength of trust that existed between him and his soldiers. Heroism was necessary but not sufficient to earn and sustain that trust.Leadership is primarily about trust: trust in the leader's vision and plans, judgment and decision-making abilities, character and competence. Keegan's discussion of leadership never penetrates to the heart of the matter; he surprisingly fails to uncover the criticality of sustaining trust between leader and led and the problems that arise when trust erodes.If you want to learn more about Alexander, Wellington, Grant, and Hitler, read this book. Keegan is a superb historian. If you are looking for insight on the challenges of leadership, however, you will not be satisfied with Mask of Command. -- Christopher D.

The physically courageous and flamboyant Alexander is styled the \\"heroic\\" leader; the understated Wellington an \\"anti-hero\\"; Grant, a humble man who had known personal hard times, as \\"unheroic\\"; and Hitler, a highly skilled practioner of theatrical propaganda, as the \\"false-heroic\\" leader. The case studies are engrossing if inevitably simplified for brevity; Keegan has captured the essentials of each man and the associated lessons of leadership.Leadership studies are a challenging topic. It should be noted that Alexander and Hitler were simultaneously military leaders and heads of state, while Wellington's and Grant's civilian leadership roles came after their military careers. Changes in technology and society have had enormous impact on military leadership. Leading from the tip of the spear as Alexander did was almost a requirement in his day but would seem foolishly exposed in our own. Wellington's hands-on tactical leadership would become impossible on the far larger battlefields of the 20th and 21st century. Grant's willingness to take casulties would likely be politically unsupportable now, as it nearly was in his time. Hitler's leadership was an aberation in more ways than one. Keegan gets well-deserved credit for producing such a concise and readable book on such a tough topic.This book is highly recommended to the general reader looking for an introduction into the study of military leadership."},{"Title":"The Mask of Command (Leather-bound Library of Military History)","review":"\`The Mask of Command' by military historian par excellence, John Keegan is, like his classic \`The Face of Battle' an analysis of a particular aspect of military history by a careful study and analysis of four great exemplars. In the earlier work, the exemplars were three famous battles. In this work, the exemplars are four great generals. The first thing that strikes one as we read the table of contents is his choice of military commanders. Alexander the Great and the Duke of Wellington are obvious. The other two, Ulysses S. Grant and Adolph Hitler, are quite surprising. Grant is often pictured as an average or even poor general, always in the shadow of Robert E. Lee. Hitler is generally pictured as a really bad strategist, forcing his generals to make all sorts of ill-advised moves. The fact is, Grant was exactly the kind of general the Union army needed after its long string of true incompetents and Hitler, especially early in the war, made several brilliant strategic decisions. The point of Keegan's picking these four figures is to fit his titular premise that command always involves some public mask the commander presents to their troops.Keegan's treatment of Alexander brings us non-historians in for some surprises, in that he shared some uncomfortable similarities with Adolf Hitler in his willingness to slaughtering conquered populations and Keegan's claim that Alexander destroyed much and created very little in his short life. This may be something of a surprise when we reflect on, for example, the great library in a city he founded, Alexandria, Egypt, but I believe that was all done by the Ptolmey dynasty created by one of Alexander's generals, to whom the conquests were parceled out at Alexander's death.Alexander is the model of the great hero as commander. Alexander's behavior in battle clearly reflected his belief that he was kin to the Olympian gods, through Heracles. He literally gave up direction of his troops from afar to wade into the thickest of hand to hand combat and dispatch as many enemies he could reach, with total faith in his own invincibility.The Duke of Wellington, especially at the battle of Waterloo, is presented as the anti-hero. Oddly, while Wellington, Arthur Wellesley, does not himself shoulder a rifle or wield a saber, he is remarkably involved in the minute to minute contact with the enemy, as he wanders back and forth along the most active two (2) miles of front, doling out reserves with a fine touch and the situation changes from minute to minute.Ulysses S. Grant is examined as the exemplar of the \`unheroic' commander, brought to command by that most unusual method (in the mid-19th century), the professional military school education given by West Point. Unlike all the major European powers who granted command commissions on the basis of title or social rank, the United States granted its most important command positions on the basis of professional education, a very unheroic origin.Adolph Hitler is the model of the false heroic commander. To begin, Keegan makes the case that Hitler always thought of himself as a military figure, starting with his service in the Austrian army in the First World War. Anyone familiar with the German army during World War II will not have any trouble recognizing that Hitler was the true overall commander of the German land forces, through his creation of the OKW (Oberkommando Der Wehrmacht) which superseded the previous leadership of the famous German General Staff system created by Prussia after the embarrassing send-down by Napoleon's armies.Keegan's bookends to these four exemplars are chapters of pre-heroic and post-heroic leadership. The pre-heroic leadership may be a bit conjectural to us, as it is based in the archeology of the dim past. Post-heroic leadership is all too familiar to us all. Since this book was published in 1987, it does not reflect the great shift in the world order brought about by the collapse of Soviet communism and the \`Eastern Block' and the rise of militant extremism. One must wonder what Keegan would make of terrorist commanders today.And yet, there is a very important secondary strain in the book's argument that is eminently important today. That is the great Clauswitz dictum that warfare is an extension of political action when other means fail. A corollary of that dictum is that when combat is contemplated, the most important calculus is whether the projected cost in money, lives, and political popularity are worth the anticipated results. One immediately thinks about the relative costs and benefits of two recent American actions, Vietnam and the war in Iraq, and wonder about whether the commanders in those cases properly calculated the costs and benefits of our entering these conflicts, versus the costs and outcomes of continuing with diplomacy.Like \`The Face of Battle', the primary virtue of this book is that it gives us tools to analyze other historical situations, such as the lives and careers of the likes of Caesar, Napoleon, Frederick the Great, and George W. Bush.A very important book!"},{"Title":"The Mask of Command (Leather-bound Library of Military History)","review":"The Mask of Command is a very commendable reading for different audiences: those interested in specific military topics, those interested in history (as myself), those who research on leadership and more, much more, because John Keegan writes with a dynamic and fluent style and expose his ideas very engagingly.Four historical figures are chosen as examples for this study, we may dissent with the choice.

Indeed, in many respects it is not a history at all. What Keegan is after in this book is a glimpse at different styles and techniques of command used by different historical figures.First, it should be pointed out that it is \\"command,\\" not \\"leadership.\\" The two terms, although frequently interchangeable, are not the same -- if you are looking for a tome that will advise you on how to be a leader in the business or sports environment, this is not it. If you are interested in learning about military leadership, or thinking about its applications in other areas, this is the book for you.Keegan takes us from Alexander to Hitler by way of Wellington and Grant. Each one of these figures represents a different answer to the question: out front -- sometimes, always, or never? Describing these differences, comparing them in a vaccuum, and then explaining them contextually is Keegan's point, and he does it wonderfully. Beginning with the personal mythos of Alexander, continuing with the distance of Wellington and the humility of Grant, and concluding with the concerned megalomania of Hitler, the book does a great job of exploring the different ways of creating a cult of personality, and inspiring subordinates. The Mask of Command is the freshest look at the importance of military history in a generation. This book will be invaluable to soldiers, business and sports leaders who need to move beyond John Maxwell, and teachers looking for a way to bring new meaning and importance to their classroom."},{"Title":"The Mask of Command (Leather-bound Library of Military History)","review":"Keegan introduces us -- or reintroduces, as the case may be -- to four of history's greatest commanders and assesses their personal character, their strengths and weaknesses, and the influence each had at critical moments.He gives us Alexander, brilliant and charismatic, succeeding almost as much by personal bravery and luck as by tactical skill; the Duke of Wellington, careful and precise but bold enough to win his greatest battle by a sudden change of tactics that was as much a gamble as a battlefield command; Grant, here unflappable and confident as he leads the Union's armies; and Hitler, the embittered, decorated infantryman of World War I whose distrust of the aristocratic generals caused him first to subvert and finally to overrule them,to disastrous results.As always, Keegan is not just historian but stylist, an elegant writer who is able to capture complicated concepts in a line or two where another scholar might go on for a page (his explanation of the motivation behind the Mexican-American War, just one sentence, is a classic example of this).Others have noted an inconsistent or careless quality in a couple of Keegan's latest books, but The Mask of Command is a brilliant, highly readable work of history by one of our greatest military historians."},{"Title":"The Mask of Command (Leather-bound Library of Military History)","review":"A common question of battlefield leadership:When should one lead from the front? Always, sometimes, or never?Mr. Keegan gives us a study of four emminent commanders: Alexander the Great, Duke of Wellington, General Ullysses S. Grant, and Adolph Hitler. Here all their personal idiosyncrasies and notable disparities and similarities in method of leadership are analyzed and compared. Reading this volume, especially in regard to the chapter on Alexander, gives one the impression of attending a lecture from a brilliant and inspired university professor. This should be no surprise, as that statement accurately describes the author of this fascinating book.Alexander: A true warrior by all definitions, whose battlefield prowess was only surpassed by his enormous charisma and panache. Alexander was a leader who led his army from the front ranks in attacks that were considered ostentatiously reckless even in his day. Frequently bearing wounds from sword, spear, and arrow, and sharing the same hardships as his most junior-ranking troops, Alexander would have told you that the commander's place is ALWAYS in the front!Wellington: Several centuries later, a worthy war-leader quite potentially on par with Alexander. Their leadership style had much in common, despite the change in tactics and technology. Wellington, although not precisely on the front lines, ...was still close enough to the carnage to be a casualty. In fact, its a miracle he wasn't killed in action, given the intensity of the battles he fought. There were several close-calls. He was a highly mobile commander, constantly riding up and down the lines, and his performance at Waterloo is well documented here. Wellington would tell you to lead from the front, ...sometimes, ...but don't risk yourself needlessly.Grant: A methodical commander much closer to the modern understanding of combat leadership, who largely conducted his operations from a post behind the lines. The nature of Civil War combat would not be unfamiliar to Wellington, but was well on its way into the modern age. Grant was also a brave commander who still found himself in direct contact with enemy fire, but needless to say, preferred to stay well-clear of incoming ordnance. Fifty years after the Napoleonic Wars, most of the armaments weren't radically different from the earlier part of the century, ...but rifled small-arms and artillery were considerebly more accurate, and lethal. Grant was not afraid to place himself in the front lines, but as a general overseeing battles that encompassed a front of several miles and tens of thousands of troops, ...it was not only an irrellevant risk, but severely limiting for the commander's perspective in most cases.Hitler: Professor Keegan gives us a very fair and objective assessment of Hitler, and his experience of battle. Hitler was a brave and competant soldier in the Army of Bavaria, taking great personal risk as a runner in the trenches. Like most in the front-lines, he had his share of injuries, to include temporary blindness from a gas-attack. In the Great War, he was an enlisted man. Over twenty years later, as supreme commander of German armed-forces, he found himself directly supervising men who were junior officers in that earlier war. Hitler made the observation that knew more about combat than his generals, who were mostly artillery or staff-officers in those days. In this he was largely correct.Hitler is quite possibly the most written-about personality of the previous century. His numerous flaws, faults and malignant personality are all thoroughly documented. Despite his worthy performance as an enlisted man in a previous war, Hitler ultimately failed quite spectacularly as a supreme commander. Was he a psychopath, or was he psychotic? There are many accounts of his increasingly hysterical shrieking outbursts during staff-meetings, his stifling micromanagement, and the reckless and inept gambling of human and material resources, ...let alone the genocidal policies upon vanquished populations. One man and his party brought a whole continent to ruin. While Wehrmacht and S.S. divisions fought savage actions in the most adverse conditions far from Germany, Hitler commanded from bunkers that were never even within hundreds of miles of the front.In fact, a most telling incident is included in this volume, that truly illuminates Hitler's \\"quality of leadership\\":Albert Speer tells of a meeting with Hitler aboard a luxurious private railroad dining-car. While the train was re-fueling in a rail-yard, a troop-train passed, loaded with starving, wounded, ragged Wehrmacht soldiers, ...fresh from the fighting on the Eastern Front. They were packed in box-cars. Hitler's table was well-stocked with fine food, pastry, and wine. Hitler and his guests were smoking fine cigars.What did Hitler do?Other leaders might have gathered up the contents of that table and taken an impromptu visit amongst the returning troops, shaking hands, passing out cigars and wine, telling the men from the front \\"Well-done & welcome home!\\"....Hitler told an orderly to close the curtains."},{"Title":"The Mask of Command (Leather-bound Library of Military History)","review":"In his introduction, John Keegan's describes his book The Mask of Command as, \\"a book about generals, who they are, what they do, and how what they do affects the world in which men and women live.\\" While this subject about command and styles of heroic leadership is a straight forward enough subject, the way in which Keegan approaches it is not. Through four case studies of Alexander the Great, the Duke of Wellington, Ulysses Grant and Adolf Hitler he reflects upon the changing character of generalship over two thousand years of Western history. He uses numerous historical comparisons to widen the study's focus and make it much more than a loosely linked description of four commanders.Keegan's \\"mask of command\\" is the face a leader shows to his followers, those external attributes contributing to the power over them, presented in a way that reflects their needs. In the case of Alexander the Great, it is the only image we have. We know little of his inner life and ideas. His mastery of the Greek world, conquest of the Persian Empire and projection of his power as far as India, left a model of heroic leadership for men since to emulate. It was a highly theatrical style in which the leader's spectacular armor, dramatic story and self-association with the gods set him apart, while his meticulous provisioning and close knowledge of and concern for his soldiers made him one of them. On the battlefield he sought victory by risk-taking and self-exposure. Alexandrian heroism found numerous imitators throughout the history of warfare, but increasingly, argues Keegan, a second theory of generalship began to dominate. Growth in the size and complexity of armies, intensification of drill and increasing use of reserve formations made it imperative for generals to know what was happening but at a suitably distant to be able to direct the battle as a whole.Keegan's analysis of Wellington's command at Waterloo gives an excellent picture of the Duke's tireless movement from one section of the battlefield to the next, in close range of the fighting. His used personal direction of the action, using the topography to screen his troops. He scrutinized enemy movements in search of an advantage and moved decisively when an opportunity arose. Wellington was, in Keegan's words, \\"perhaps the most perfect embodiment of the gentlemanly ideal England has ever produced.\\" He was disciplined, modest, self-assured, and reticent. Wearing civilian clothes, he avoided all self-dramatization and scorned Napoleon's dramatics. His was a deliberately antiheroic style. If Wellington's style suited aristocratic Georgian England, Ulysses Grant's reflected both the mood of American democracy and the vast technological changes that transformed war in the next half-century.Keegan examines Grant, supreme commander of the Union armies, as an example of the new professionalism. The growing density and accuracy of rifle and artillery fire created wider and more lethal killing zones than were previously imaginable. Railroads and the telegraph had also revolutionized logistics and communications. Trained at West Point, grasping fully the significance of river, rail and cable links, Grant was exceptionally good at anticipating the intentions of his opponents and ruthless in carrying the war into the heart of the Confederacy. In battle Grant remained close to the action, rallying disheartened regiments. He was neither in front like Alexander or exposed like Wellington. Instead, he exercised a kind of complete forward control. Keegan describes how this consciously un-heroic professional with his plain and simple style captured the popular imagination. He seemed an expression of the Republic's populism with his firm sense of the subordination of the military to civilian government and his recognition that the volunteer and largely untrained troops of a people's army must be led, not driven to battle.Keegan's final example of command is Hitler, who, like Alexander, combined in one personality, supreme political ability and the planning inconsistencies that marred the invasion of Soviet Russia. Numerous accounts have detailed his stubborn refusal to contemplate the real circumstances of his armies in the East. Keegan offers a fresh and perspective on Hitler's strengths and deficiencies as a military leader. The figure that emerges from this analysis is more soldier and front-fighter than politician. Hitler politics was war, at least the preparation for war, and his unswerving goal was to realize the victory that seemed near in 1918. While stubbornness epitomized his larger strategy, meddling with details increasingly substituted for professional tactics. This, Keegan argues, was superficial generalship, haphazard, amateurish. It was also \\"false heroic,\\" chiefly because it sought to eliminate the distance between commander and combat troops. Propaganda portrayed Hitler as a suffering hero allowing him to share the hardships of his soldiers.Each of these four case studies forms a separate entity of its own. Combined, they show a general theme about the reshaping of heroic leadership in response to social and military change. This has contemporary significance as well, and Keegan concludes with the nuclear age. His comments are brief, more tantalizing than substantive. He notes that the inevitable secrecy surrounding nuclear command procedures conflicts with democratic openness, but does little to explore the consequences.Keegan calls for a \\"post-heroic\\" style, one that will inhibit, not instigate, conflict. He calls for less posturing, less readiness to use foreign policy for domestic political ends, and more modesty, prudence and rational thinking to counter the computerized technology. Keegan's recommended style may be is too limited and too passive in the contemporary environment but, there is need for a different kind of heroism. Perhaps the courage to pursue forthrightly and unambiguously new strategies requires our leaders' place to be out in front, like Alexander. The Mask of Command causes us to think about what this new leader would look like.Walter S.

Henry, Rialto CAThe British military historian John Keegan (\\"The Face of Battle\\";\\" The First World War\\") has a knack for distilling military history into a few well-crafted paragraphs. He does so particularly well in \\"The Mask of Command\\" -a study of leadership styles among Alexander (The Heroic); Grant (The Un-Heroic); Wellington (The Anti-Heroic); Hitler (\`The False Heroic') and contemporary leaders (The'Post-Heroic').His point is to distinguish among military leadership styles based on the personality and initiative of the Commander.In a particularly insightful chapter, Keegan dissects the Battle of Waterloo on an hour-by-hour basis, paying particular note to Wellington's characteristic attention to detail and stamina (he is said to have slept fewer than eight hours during the course of the weeklong battle).The importance of Military Intelligence (the subject of another Keegan book) is especially vital in earlier conquests, when the gathering of intelligence depended largely on Scouts, as in the Civil War, and not on technology, as in America's latest adventures in World Domination.The lessons of the past, as in all history, are available to the Current Political Leadership: if only they examine them.--By Philip Henry (Rialto, CA, Vietnam Veteran)"},{"Title":"The Mask of Command (Leather-bound Library of Military History)","review":"John Keegan has done an admirable job in unmasking the great military leaders throughout the ages.

One of our finest military historians, Keegan brilliantly examines the role leadership has historically played in ancient and modern warfare. His case studies include Alexander the Great, whose daring, even reckless disregard for danger earned him the respect and devotion of his Macedonian force and its Greek 'allies'. Keegan's careful breakdown of Alexander's force, the strategies it employed, and Alexander's overall flamboyance on the battlefield contribute to a greater understanding of the period and military realities of the day. The second study, the Duke of Wellington, offers a more detached, though still fully engaged mind. Keegan describes Wellington as the anti-hero, in contrast to Alexander's heroics. A British aristocrat well aware of his station, Wellington employed all of his resources and cunning to win, but did so without Alexander's dramatics. Third, Keegan explores U.S. Grant during the US Civil War. Grant is the democratic soldier, committed to the republican ideal. He is engaged in prosecuting the war and always keenly aware that war itself lifted him out of obscurity and placed him in the critical leadership role. Finally, Keegan explores the twisted, though occasionally militarily brilliant mind of Adolf Hitler. Hitler commanded far behind the lines and continually inserted himself further and further down the chain of command. His justification for his own military judgment was his experience in the trenches of World War I. Hitler's growing disconnect with military reality as the war progressed spelled ultimate doom for Germany.Concise and well written, \\"The Mask of Command\\" offers fascinating insights into military leadership over the ages.

It would be interesting to analyze if the actual US President has the qualities and understandings required by Keegan's conclusion (which is so true).One of the most accomplished pages of the book is the essay entitled &quot;War and Hitler's World&quot;, which is a masterpiece of erudition and insight.This book could also serve as a textbook on management leadership. The question &quot;In front always? Sometimes? Never?&quot; can also be used in today's business; so many CEO's and managers today act as the &quot;chateaux generals&quot; of WW.I, those which served as a mistaken example of command to an unworthy Hitler.&quot;The Mask of Command&quot; will keep you thinking about leadership, human nature, today's world, technology, men and their circumstances; it will take you on horseback along Wellington in Waterloo and you will sit at Hitler's dinner table. You will learn."},{"Title":"The Mask of Command (Leather-bound Library of Military History)","review":"Keegan analyzes the idiosyncrasies of four very different commanders in order to characterize the nature of command and how it has evolved over time. He emphasizes the impact of technology and cultural change on the nature of command. Using four unique vignettes of Alexander, Wellington, Grant and Hitler, Keegan portrays the evolution of generalship from the heroic days of physical leadership to the nuclear age. I found the part on Hitler very interesting. Below are some of Keegan's illustrations.Alexander - the importance of physical courage, leading at the tip of the spear, and animating a theatrical quality, which inspires the soldiers.Wellington - still on the front lines, but not leading the charge. Keegan describes Wellington's careful orchestration of the conflict with Napoleon on the fields of Waterloo. He begins to make the case for the impact of technology (gunpowder and muskets) on the general's ability to influence the fight from the front.Grant - and \\"unheroic\\" leadership, as Keegan describes his style. The author praises Grant throughout the narration, especially how the Union General understood the changing nature of war better than most. Keegan cites instances of Grant's bravery (at Palo Alto and elsewhere) and refers favorably to Grant's Memoirs. This praise contrasts with the next case study, that of Hitler.Hitler - beginning with Hitler's service in World War I, Keegan demonstrates the impact of the Great War on Hitler's leadership style and understanding of war. Keegan highlights Hitler's mistrust of many of his \\"staff\\" generals, given his own insight from the front as a messenger during WWI. Most of the general staff officers never served near the front since technology had rendered the front so lethal that generals, invested with tremendous talent and education, did not wander there. Hitler derided them at every opportunity.This is applied history at its best. I found the piece on Hitler the most fascinating aspect of the book. Read The Mask of Command if you are a student of military history or enjoy reading about leadership."},{"Title":"The Mask of Command (Leather-bound Library of Military History)","review":"Dr. Keegan has another masterpiece. This book details leadership styles and techniques by answering a very simple question: \\"In front? Always, sometimes, never?\\" The historical perspective on the question is provided in 4 fascinating biographies of Alexander the Great, Wellington, Grant, and Hitler. Amazingly little changed in terms of how war was fought between Alexander and Wellington and yet the cultural impact of their societies had profound impact on their power of authority and the means in which they wielded it. I personally found the biography of Grant to be the most interesting and how the influence of rifled muskets and the large presence of cannon drove commanders farther from the front line and how democratic society supported that removal of \\"shared risk\\". Hitler's biography clarified a great deal of history and myth that I had not read previously: Hitler actually had a much more distinguished career as a soldier than I had previously understood and that had a profound effect on his understanding and misunderstanding of the circumstances of the Second World War. Hitler appeared to understand a large portion of the mechanisms of leadership and warfare but misunderstood the key lessoned to be learned from the First World War: that the leader on the scene is often capable of the best decisions.The text effortless weaves these historical perspectives into a short, concise study of leadership styles and requirements and then presents a clear thesis on leadership in the nuclear age. This thesis is truly terrifying in light of the implications of history; our origins appear to contradict the requirements for future survival. This text is as much a study in leadership and management styles as it is a military science text. It is well written and highly enjoyable. If only we could get Dr. Keegan to add an addendum to leadership in the age of stateless terror."},{"Title":"The Mask of Command (Leather-bound Library of Military History)","review":"As The Face of Battle provided us with a foundation for military history/strategy, The Mask of Command accomplishes the same task concerning leadership. The main idea explores the concept of the heroic ideal, and how it has shaped leadership on the battlefield, and in the command tent throughout history. The layout of the book is classic Keegan, analyzing four leaders: Alexander, Wellington, Grant, and Hitler. He brings out their good and bad qualities, and supports his conclusions with conviction. The section on Wellington is particularly well-done. After reading about heroism for 300 pages, I was surprised at his conclusion in the final chapter (Post-Herioc: Command in the Nuclear World). Overall, this is an excellent treatise, and a perfect follow-up to The Face of Battle. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"The Mask of Command (Leather-bound Library of Military History)","review":"I have always viewed fans of military history with suspicion, having known too many who are weapon-fetishists, power-worshippers or simply ghouls. Fortunately for me, a sane, gentle friend read and recommended this book (thanks Mike Malcolm, where ever you are), introducing me to a now favorite author. MASK analyzes and contrasts the military leadership of four men: Alexander, Wellington, Grant and Hitler. Each profile is fascinating in itself, but what impressed me profoundly was the final chapter, in which Keegan brings everything together, enumerating the &quot;imperatives&quot; of military authority throughout history, and finally asking how those imperatives can be met in the nuclear world, where the civilian population is on the front lines and generals must necessarily &quot;lead&quot; from behind. I recommend this book (and all Keegan's work) wholeheartedly to anyone who would never dream of reading &quot;military history&quot;."},{"Title":"The Mask of Command (Leather-bound Library of Military History)","review":"John Keegan is a modern master of military analysis. In this book, he applies his powers to the field of generalship, with consistently good results. 4 generals come under his scrutiny:1. Alexander the Great, with his propensity to lead from the front of his army, regardless of personal danger. 2. The Duke of Wellington, following his comapaigns in India and Spain up to the Battle of Waterloo - a man who lead from the midst of his army, but close enough to be in considerable personal danger. 3. Ulysses Grant in the American Civil War, who led from the rear but still close to his army. 4. Adolf Hitler, leading the German forces in WWII, a man who led from as far in the rear as was practical, never seeing his armies, and rarely seeing his operational generals.The analysis of each individual general is impeccable. For each, there are sections dealing with their respective armies' staff structure, intellegence operations, and campaigns. In addition, and more originally, each general is analysed as a product of the society they are raised in, and why they were so successful based on the political/military system they were born into and used.Naturally, each general is not represented in a vacuum, but is compared with each of the other 3 main generals in the book, and also with each general's contemporaries. The general theme is that as weapons came to have longer and longer ranges, generals naturally had to move further from the fighting front. He praises Wellington and Grant's abilities to maintain contact with the fighting troops in spite of their removal from the front line. At the same time, he condemns Hitler specifically (and by extension, many WWI generals, who shared this disease) for being too isolated to get a good feel for the mood and abilities of his army in any given situation.The book finishes off with a section on generalship in the nuclear age, which was very interesting and well presented.However, just as in Keegan's Face of Battle, there are some minor point with which I take exception in the analysis. For example, there seems to be a serious dichotomy between Grant and Wellington on one hand and Alexander and Hitler on the other. The latter pair were both the sole civilian dictators of their countries, in addition to being head of their armed forces. This contrasts with Grant and Wellington who, although later rising to the highest political offices in their countries, were never civilian leaders and generals at the same time.From any other author, this book would garner 5 stars, but as it isn't my favourite Keegan offering, I'll have to demote it to 4 stars. Still, very highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Mask of Command (Leather-bound Library of Military History)","review":"The Mask of Command is a fun read with plenty of good ideas to go around but the casual reader needs to be very careful as Keegan sometimes gets things just plain wrong.Take for example the essay on Grant, called \\"Unheroic Leadership\\". Analyzed as such because Grant subscribed to the idea of never leading from the front (mainly because leading from the front was both impossible and foolish by the beginning of the America Civil War), Keegan digs into what made Grant an especially fine general. While some of his finds are clever and his psychological assessment of Grant seems to hold water, his understanding of Grant as a particularly adept technocrat who adapted to the changing role of technology in the war is downright wrong.I direct those of you who are interested in the truth to both Charles Dana's accounts of the civil war and to Lincoln's writings. Both of these men found Grant's use of the telegraph paltry and Lincoln was many times found wanting more information from Grant's camp. Indeed, Keegan assumes that Grant's use of the telegraph was a key ingredient to his unheroic leadership because he harnessed new technology to direct troops appropriately, but this is patently false as Grant despised sending telegraphs to anyone at all. It is much more likely that Keegan was sniffing the right path in declaring Grant as extremely proficient in his ability to surround himself with capable men such as Sherman and McPherson proved to be.As I said, the careful reader will find quite a few discrepancies and a little digging will result in Keegan getting caught with his pants down, but there is also much to like about the book - just be careful with it because Keegan isn't.Three stars is a bit harsh, but four stars would be too much. 3 1/2 is about right."},{"Title":"The Mask of Command (Leather-bound Library of Military History)","review":"The Face of Battle is a very hard act to follow and I think any reader will understand that as he begins The Mask of Command. This is a study of four leadership styles of famous generals as they evolved through different periods in history. So much has already been written about Alexander the Great, the Duke of Wellington, Ulysses S. Grant and Adolf Hitler, it is hard to imagine how succinct and enlightening Keegan's presentation can be. He is a superb writer of military history and in this case, of biography and theory. Keegan always seems to succeed in escaping from the customary and, by now trite, eulogies and strikes out into new territory. If you would like to find out about Alexander the Great's sex life, how the Iron Duke really felt about the \\"scum of the earth\\" that fought for him, why Grant drank like he did and more, buy this book! Seriously, there is no one writing thought-full military history like John Keegan. The last chapter (Kennedy and the Cuban Missile Crisis) is pretty scary but you have to have this book."},{"Title":"The Mask of Command (Leather-bound Library of Military History)","review":"In this book, John Keegan examines the lives of four well-known commanders and analyzes their command through the lens of what he terms \\"the heroic.\\" He argues that the first armies began to organize themselves under the command of someone who met this heroic ideal, and demonstrates that, throughout history, successful commanders have adapted this ideal to suit their individual needs given the circumstances of the time.Keegan looks at the lives of Alexander, Wellington, Grant, and Hitler for his study. Each lived in different societies and fought different kinds of wars, yet each portrayed a variation of the heroic ideal. Alexander was the true heroic type-Keegan points out that he learned command from reading Homer, and therefore led from the front line and gave no orders once he himself joined the fray. Instead he led by example, being wounded many times and fighting ferociously for his life in every engagement.To Grant and Wellington Keegan ascribes a sort of anti-heroic leadership style. Both men exposed themselves to danger at times, yet neither actually fought during their respective campaigns. They were, however, nearly always on the battlefield. Wellington, in fact, rode the line of his battle back and forth, constantly giving orders and dealing with crises along the line as they appeared. Ranged warfare, says Keegan, influenced the way these men led and forced them to differ from Alexander, Grant having to depart more from the heroic ideal because the range of rifled weaponry made it unsafe for him to be too close to the action. Grant, as the head of a democratic army, had to also adapt his style of heroic leadership (Keegan uses Vicksburg, when Grant's men wanted to assault the city and he let them, despite his better judgment, as an example) and did so with great success.Hitler is the ultimate false hero, using his propaganda machine to perpetrate the image of comrade in arms yet commanding from hundreds of miles away. Each of these men are vastly different, yet as Keegan holds each up to the standard of heroic leadership the contrast is fascinating. Looking into the future Keegan analyzes the hero of the nuclear age and points out that, ironically, the heroic commander must be the one least exposed to danger. Many studies have been done on each of these men, but this comparison of them is certainly refreshing nonetheless. This is not light reading, but it is very, very satisfying."},{"Title":"The Mask of Command (Leather-bound Library of Military History)","review":"Prior to the publication of \\"The Face of Battle\\", much of military history focused on leaders and not on the led, set pieces and \\"macro\\" developments. With \\"The Mask of Command\\", Keegan returns from the raw shellshock of combat and furnishes four accounts of famous military leaders. However, his focus is not on strategic or tactical decisions, but on how these men led, the theatre and persona that these leaders cultivated to provide the trust and moral fiber which motivated their men. This is what Keegan means by \\"the mask\\" -- the image, the spirit, the incarnation of what subordinates needed to believe in order to fight. It is in some sense combative to claim that this persona is a \\"mask\\" -- that is, an artifice contrived to motivate and not strictly who these leaders \\"were\\". To some extent, it is impossible to know what any historical figure actually \\"was\\", or simply what we even \\"are\\", but in any event, these particular leaders had very interesting masks and Keegan does a superb job in each account.Clearly, if a leader is to be effective he must have the respect and trust of his men. The problem is that the mechanisms for gaining this respect are either fraught with personal peril, require the embodiment of a cause which is rarely stain-free, or rest upon a non-trivial ideological framework. The simplest starting point, then, is to answer Keegan's question, \\"In front: always, sometimes, or never\\". \\"In front\\" always has the advantage of pressing home the point to the men that the leader is bold, unafraid to assume the same risks as his men for a purpose in which he must clearly believe. \\"In front\\" also has the disadvantage of placing the leader in mortal danger. So a complication arises, namely, that good leaders are rare and precious, that losing them does a belligerent no good, but that to eschew personal risk is to court mistrust. Alexander, Keegan's first case study, chose \\"in front\\". He was able to do so in part because early warfare did not have the lethality of later warfare -- arrows rarely hit their mark and skill at arms could tell in the local heat of combat. Alexander could thus afford it, but he too felt it incumbent to act more and more heroically, i.e., to take increasingly greater risks the more he demanded of his men, finally risking too much and losing his life. Wellington opted for \\"sometimes\\", rushing about from regiment to regiment at Waterloo, courting stray musket balls and grapeshot at every turn, exhorting and directing at all times. Still, he did not lead from the front, which was probably a wise decision when impersonal bullets could kill men in swaths. Grant more-or-less chose \\"never\\", as did Hitler.The issue then arises for all leaders, but especially for those leaders who chose \\"never\\", to find other means of gaining trust and belief. Alexander would engage in dramatic antics, spending days in his tent in peevish anticipation of apology, and would don fabulous armor for engagements. Oration and rhetoric were vital to his success as he attempted to hearten at least a portion of his men. Wellington cultivated the persona of the stoic gentleman warrior, an iron will of perfection, fair to all but intolerant of sloppiness. Grant cultivated the image of being \\"one of the boys\\" -- surrounding himself with home-town friends, spurring his men by honestly showing them his hangdog vulnerability, and by relying on his men's belief in the justice of the Union cause - they were, after all, citizen-soldiers, volunteers, men of conviction.Hitler's leadership required the constant bolstering of a seductive ideology, endless infusions of propaganda. Belief in his command was cemented by the ceaseless exhortations of Goebbels. Like the uncreative and largely ineffective generals of WWI, Hitler hid in secret bunkers while his men died far away. That Hitler could get away with it for so long and so successfully was largely due to the dramatic improvements in communications, but also through the constant retelling of the Fuhrer's heroism in WWI. Ultimately, Hitler was not a hero, but a false god whose command withered with the monstrous dream of the Third Reich and his distance from the realities of the front. Here, Keegan does a particularly fine job detailing Hitler's neurotic infantilism, his growing separation from reality, his insecure sense of isolation, and his final ignominious demise.\\"The Mask of Command\\" is readable, compelling, and perhaps the most flawless of all of Keegan's histories. Quality, not quantity is the motto here. A brilliant and absorbing treatise."},{"Title":"The Mask of Command (Leather-bound Library of Military History)","review":"Its title comes from a theatrical metaphor, Keegan examining what a commander chooses to reveal of himself to his troops, what he conceals, and what he sometimes invents.But the book is much more than that. Through an examination of the armies, times, and personalties of four commanders -- Alexander the Great, Wellington, Grant, and Hitler (with a brief look at the command style of John F. Kennedy during the Cuban Missle Crisis) -- he shows us how command tactics and theatrics have evolved from Alexander's leading by example in the thick of battle, an heroic example, to the decidely unheroic and distant Hitler and Kennedy.You'd expect, in a book like this, some look at the politics, military structure, and arms surrounding each leader. And that's present as well as a look at the mechanics of battlefield communication. We're also shown how each of the above leaders personifies some leadership style.As with hisThe Face Of Battle, Keegan makes some of his most memorable points through telling details. We hear of how Alexander's leadership was constricted by the dust of battle, the impossibility of directing combat while heroically hacking at the foe himself; we see how Wellington was distanced from the battlefield by cannons, his vision even more clouded by the gray smoke of guns than Alexander's was by dust, and his intuitive estimation of how fast troops could move against enemies who had just discharged a volley; Keegan talks about the importance of clear and concise dispatches in 19th century battles and how Grant and Wellington's command of English served them well off the battleground; we read transcripts of a micromanaging Hitler who had far better recall of various weapons' characteristics than his commanders but a notable deficeit in strategic thinking.I found it interesting that all the commanders Keegan chose were political leaders, half unifying military and political commands at once, the other half pursuing political careers after their generalships were over. He doesn't explicity say why this is so, but a concluding chapter on \\"post-heroic\\" leadership over nuclear forces implicitly argues for a new style of command by our current military-political leaders.Whether you want a biography of any or all of the commanders studied in this book, a history of how warfare and the process of command changed through millennia, or a look at how a war leader must manipulate his followers with the right mix -- for his society and time -- of love, alienation, fear, and respect, this book is worth reading."},{"Title":"The Mask of Command (Leather-bound Library of Military History)","review":"The book itself is a biography of four military leaders, three that were brilliant - Alexander the Great, Wellington and Grant and one that was a failure - Hitler. Its discusses their lives, the limitation that society put on them, the methods of command and the problems that they personally had in commanding. He then comes up with a conclusion that in a nuclear age we don't want a hero. The trouble with this book I felt was that there were not enough generals (three and Hitler) to make any conclusion from particularly as all come from very different societies."},{"Title":"The Mask of Command (Leather-bound Library of Military History)","review":"This is an excellent book.

But again, like in 'The Face Of Battle', Keegan shows too much of his personal taste and motives. And again I strongly suspect that he is on the side of the British against the terrible French like in the 'good old days' ...He constantly tries to minimize the merit of french commanders, especially Napoleon, during his analysis of Wellington's style of command because, it seems, they don't fit in his chronological classification of styles of command: yes the french army was open to talents (most marshals and generals were not of noble roots for example), yes Napoleon and his marshals risked their lives many times in the front lines, yes the behavior of the French has had dramatic consequences on the future shape of Europe and no, not everybody thinks it is a valuable conduct to obey to old feudal rulers when during a few centuries the thinking of a complete nation established the basis to a new popular regime in modern Europe, called democracy.His views on command during the nuclear age are very interesting and I learned a lot through his books though...Finally, I think he belongs to this group of writers who think war will never really reappear in our society and who militate against war. I like the second part (I like only, it doesn't mean I believe it is always right), I am very doubtful about the value of the first one: we have seen terrible wars in the world these last ten years and we probably should stay very realistic..."},{"Title":"The Mask of Command (Leather-bound Library of Military History)","review":"I didn't think much of this book. Keegan's character introductions at the beginning of each section are quite good. When reading about Wellington's adventure throughout the four days of the Waterloo campaign, I believed that Keegan had written a great book. Then I got to his analysis and comparison to Alexander. As I fought my way through these subsequent pages of boredom I kept asking myself the question, \\"who cares?\\" The whole premis of the book would be better discussed over a couple beers and then only by history nerds. I would not recommend this book to anyone in the military, specifically in combat roles, hoping to mine some leadership leasons. I would have given the book two stars except for Keegan's undeniable command of exciting history prose, which is unfortunately only evident in small doses throughout this book."},{"Title":"Narcotics Anonymous","review":"The disease of addiction has gripped me since I was 7 years old and created such unmanageability in my life that I was suicidal when I found this..

If you or someone you know has a problem with drugs, this book is an absolute must to have."},{"Title":"Narcotics Anonymous","review":"NA is a reasonable way for an addict to recover, but so is \\"self recovery\\" where you simply make a commitment to never use again -- and then *really* never use again. If this sounds impossible, it may be because AA and NA have declared it's impossible and so many people have come to believe it that it's folk wisdom. However, most people who quit a substance and then stay quit over the long haul do so on their own, without ever attending a recovery group. This is verifiable fact!I myself was involved with NA for years, and never really managed to buy into the program completely. Oh sure, I could see many potential positive benefits from it. However, it really wasn't for me... I've always done things better on my own rather than as a \\"team player\\" -- it's just the way my mind works. So I never have found NA or AA very useful, and \\"leaving the rest\\" ended up being the majority of the program back in the days when I attended meetings regularly. Taking what I needed was mostly the social interaction portion, which was nice but there are other ways for people (\\"recovering\\" or not) to get involved with others. In the long run, meetings were boring and a serious drag. I guess I've never been guilt-and-shame-based in the way the 12 steps assume you are, because that's what most of them focus on. Nor did I ever believe that addiction is a 'disease' in the same way diabetes and cancer are. Get real.If you're like me, you might find Rational Recovery (rational.org) or another similar philosophy to be very helpful. Or you might just manage to quit on your own with no help at all, once things get bad enough and quitting becomes a whole lot simpler/easier than continuing to use. If not, and you do better in a group format and consider self-improvement to be very important to you and critical to quitting your substance of choice, you might find NA more helpful. Unfortunately, everyone out there likes to pretend that their own favorite option is the only one that works -- including many NA members (but not NA itself, this is an outside issue in terms of the traditions).As far as the NA basic text, overall I find it to be quite positive and uplifting. Having read the AA big book as well, I personally think the NA basic text is better, more \\"open minded\\" and more modern and accessible. You might do well to check it out, before getting directly involved in NA -- it's used so extensively in the program that reading it will give you a good idea of the NA program itself. However, it is not a panacea and will not be helpful for everyone. Just be aware that many do manage to quit substances on their own once the problems start to outweight the pleasure, and then go on to live relatively happy and fulfilled lives without recovery group attendance.P.S. note that the previous reviewer states \\"I just want to stay clean one day at a time and never have to shoot cocaine it into my arm EVER AGAIN.\\" He doesn't seem to realize that he never *had to* shoot anything in his arm in the first place, he just believes that he did! The fact is, people use drugs because they WANT TO, and addiction is a state of ambivalence where people both want to quit and want to continue using at the same time. Resolving the ambivalence is critical to quitting, i.e. the desire to quit has to be significantly stronger than the desire to continue using. Staying away from the substance for awhile is often all it takes to stay away for good, as long as using is no longer an option and the person is aware that using once will start the cycle all over again. You just don't need to be permanently \\"in recovery\\" and believe yourself to have a disease that makes it impossible not to indulge. How depressing. There's so obviously (to me) no such \\"disease\\" that renders people powerless over their own bodily actions. But give NA a try, and if you like what you hear and it works for you... more power to you."},{"Title":"Narcotics Anonymous","review":"I had no one or no place else to turn when I picked up this book.

The earlier volume is an extremely mature product summarizing the application of computer-intensive mathematical techniques to traditional economic problems--a subject the history of which goes back to the earliest applications of computers during World War II. The volume under review, Volume II, has a completely different character. Agent-based modeling is a young and vigorous, rather than a mature and technically plodding science. Mathematics, rather than being the central focus, tends to be rather a simple-minded tool, and the programming, rather than being of the number-crunching variety, tends to be a versatile and imaginative mirroring of real-world processes in silicon life-forms and object-oriented structures. The subject matter, moreover, is not limited to the bread and butter of traditional economics (computable general equilibrium, solving for Nash equilibria, macroeconomic modeling, parallel computation, dynamic programming, and the like), but rather explores novel themes in the interface between economics and the other behavioral sciences--especially in this volume politics, biology, and ecology. The chapters do accomplish fairly comprehensive literature reviews (but beware--in this fast-moving field some of the most important contributions are likely to be the most recent, and hence not referenced), but they are rarely technically detailed summaries of the state-of-the-art. Rather, chapters tend to develop themes that are particularly interesting to the author. This makes for a very readable volume, but I am not sure the appellation \\"Handbook\\" is truly appropriate.Tesfatsion's first sentence in her introductory essay to the volume gets right to the point. \\"Economies,\\" she asserts, \\"are complex dynamic systems.\\" What, we may ask, makes an economy a complex dynamic system? For one thing, the complex economy is never in equilibrium, but is constantly subjected to shocks, both exogenous and endogenous, that affect its short-term movements. There are frequent local nonlinear resonances that lead to significant deviations of economic variables (prices, quantities, wages, asset prices) from their equilibrium values even in the absence of strong or systematic perturbations to the system. We see such deviations in many economic time series, which often have the \\"fat tails\\" characteristics of the power laws of complex systems, as opposed to the Gaussian distributions of Neoclassical theory. Second, in a complex (a.k.a. real-world) economy, the Law of One Price fails. For instance, in the European Union, the standard deviation of prices rose from 12.3% in 1998 to 13.8% in 2003, despite the extensive dropping of trade barriers and movement to a common currency over this period. A third characteristic of the complex economy is that it rarely, if ever, achieves the sort of optimality that can be attained in simple engineered systems. For instance, since economies are rarely in equilibrium, most production, trade, and consumption takes place out of equilibrium, and hence is Pareto-suboptimal, at least when measured against a complete information Walrasian economy that has somehow attained equilibrium.It is evident, then, that standard Neoclassical economic theory, as taught in the college and graduate textbooks and developed in the mainstream economics journals, does not recognize that the economy is a complex dynamic system. If the first volume of this pair of Handbooks might be called \\"how to do traditional economics better with computers,\\" the volume under consideration could be called \\"How to transform economic theory using agent based modeling.\\" We can chart the following characteristics of the complex economy: (a) The complex economy is thermodynamically open, dynamic, nonlinear, and generally far from equilibrium, whereas the Walrasian economy is thermodynamically closed, static, and linear in the sense that it can be understood using algebraic geometry and manifold theory; (b) In the complex economy, agents have limited information and face high costs of information processing. However, under appropriate conditions, they evolve non-optimal but highly effective heuristics for operating in complex environments. There is no assurance that when faced with novel environments, individuals will shift efficiently to new heuristics. In the Neoclassical economy, by contrast, agents have perfect information and can costlessly optimize; (c) Agents in the complex economy participate in sophisticated overlapping networks that allow them to compensate for having limited information and facing formidable information processing costs. In the Walrasian economy, agents do not interact at all. Rather, each agent faces an impersonal price structure; (d) In the complex economy, macroeconomic patterns are emergent properties of micro-level interactions and behaviors, in the same sense as the chemical properties of a complex molecule, such as carbon, is an emergent property of its nuclear and electronic structure, or that thermodynamics is an emergent property of many-particle systems. In such cases we cannot analytically derive the properties of the macro system from those of its component parts, although we can apply novel mathematical techniques to model the behavior of the emergent properties. In the case of the complex economy, these higher level modeling constructs are currently largely absent, although agent-based modeling may provide the data needed to develop the appropriate mathematical tools. By contrast, the Walrasian economy has no macro properties that cannot be derived from its micro properties (for instance, the First and Second Welfare Theorems); (e) In the complex economy, the evolutionary process of differentiation, selection, and amplification provides the system with novelty and is responsible for the growth in order and complexity. In the Walrasian economy there is no mechanism for creating novelty or growth in complexity. In his chapter in this book, Axel Leijonhufvud develops the insight that many contributions to economic theory from the Marshallian tradition, effectively eclipsed by the influence of Edgeworth, Walras, and their general equilibrium successors, are echoed and developed in the agent-based simulations of economic dynamics.Several authors address the question as to the epistemological status of agent-based models. It is indicative of the youth of this brand of research that widely divergent answers are offered. One such view is that agent-based modeling is an alternative to formal analytical economic theory. It strikes me that this is not at all the case. Rather, an agent-based model is a set of empirical data, and building such models is akin to laboratory experimentation. One can use the results of such experimentation to inspire theorists to construct analytical models in which one can derive logically the properties of the system observed in the laboratory. Or, if the complexity of the system precludes analytical modeling, one can make broad generalizations based on a comparative study of different agent-based systems. In principle, an agent-based model could provide an existence theorem for a particular emergent phenomenon, but in general there are sufficient differences between a mathematical model of a process and its agent-based implementation (for instance, real numbers are approximated by fixed-precision floating point numbers, and random numbers are approximated by deterministic algorithms with long periods), that the two models could have substantively different properties.Representing ABM models as empirical rather than theoretical contributions is likely to improve the chances for publication in mainstream journals, and hence improve the communication among economists. Economic theorists often make the point to me that in reading an analytical paper, the assumptions and the method of proof are completely transparent, while an agent-based model must be taken on faith, since the model itself is not presented in a journal article, nor would it make much sense if it were, except to an expert in the computer language used. If the ABM is presented as a contribution to theory, it is easy to see why it is rejected by respectable journals: it is asking the reader to take the authors' assertions on faith alone. If the ABM results are represented as empirical data, this problem disappears.When agent-based models are not accepted in mainstream economics journals, modelers tend to place the blame on the closed-mindedness and traditionalistic mentality of the reviewers. I consider this a very serious error, because it gives the agent-based modeler no means of correcting the problem. I think that it is almost always good advice to blame yourself when a paper is rejected, because the you is the only one with an incentive to change to meet the reviewers' criteria the next time around. The authors in this volume do not make this mistake, and several have valuable suggestions as to how agent-based models must be crafted to increase their scientific value (Robert Axelrod's suggestions are particularly incisive).It is interesting that none of the authors appears to have noticed the inverse problem: agent-based models are all the rage in some circles, and many faulty models get past reviewers and are published in top journals, including Science and Nature. The fact is that if two researchers are given the same specifications and write the computer code independently, there is a very good chance their models will differ in substantial ways. There is simply no way for a reviewer to assess the quality of a simulation without spending a considerable amount of time going over the code. Moreover, I have found that researchers often bias code generation in such a way as to support their pet theories. The nature of this bias often cannot be revealed without a thorough inspection of the computer code. This sort of author behavior is not not necessarily due to our dishonesty, but rather due to our capacity to self-delude. If the ABM behaves the way we want it to, we leave the code alone. If it does not, we work over it to find out why. The resulting code is thus virtually certain to be self-serving and biased.I do not know how to get around this problem. It is reminiscent of a similar problem with econometric research with complex data sets, where it is virtually impossible for reviewers to ascertain the significance of the results, especially in the case of economic time series. In the case of econometric analysis, the problem is attenuated if researchers are obligated to place the data in the public domain, making replication feasible. In the case of agent-based models, there is usually no \\"data\\" different from the model itself. It would be a step forward to require researchers to place their code in the public domain, so that the threat of public scrutiny might serve to attenuate the temptation to torture the code whose results one does not like, while coddling the code that reinforces our prejudices and expectations.Another important issue not systematically addressed in this Handbook is the mechanics of producing an agent-based model. If the researcher does not do his or her own programming, clearly the researcher should generated a completely unambiguous set of specifications for programming the model. However, if the research does not know computer programming, this is impossible in all but the most simple cases. Even if the researcher is an expert programmer, he or she cannot pre-envision exactly how the model should function, since often one tries several alteratives for each piece of code, and one often does not know what the real dynamics of the model are until one has done considerable hands-on programming. For this reason, if I had my way, I would never accept a paper for publication that was not programmed by the researchers themselves, except for the simplest sort of models. Therefore, I believe training in ABM should include training in computer programming to the point of professional proficiency. I do not even accept using canned ABM software, because it is difficult to tell what the software is doing, the implementation is always painfully slow compared to a real computer language, and there are strict limits as to what can be accomplished with such software. However, I know that many leading ABM researchers disagree with this, and happily teach their students to use Swarm, StarLogo, and the like. Until this issue is thoroughly investigated and the truth sorted out from the myth, ABM will remain of limited value to the economic research community.I commend the Editors for doing a fine job in addressing the needs of the ABM community, while producing a volume that can be profitably read by those new to the field. Nevertheless, there remain hard problems that must be soberly addressed before ABM becomes a standard part of the repertoire of economic researchers, and ABM results appear widely in top economics journals."},{"Title":"The Great Pyramid Robbery (The Seven Fabulous Wonders Series)","review":"I'm surprised nobody's yet reviewed this, because it deserves a thousand reviews! I just read this today, after finding it completely by accident at some obscure shop, and I have to say it now ranks in as one of the best stories I've ever read in my life.I'm a big fan of young adult fantasy, and this is so original, set in ancient Egypt during the building of the Pyramids. There's a bit of a basis in ancient mythology and perhaps culture of the times, but it's written so well that everything seems as natural as if it were happening today. You can really relate to it and feel as if you were there! Tons of action, lots of magic and the characters were so well made that I was really moved for them and cried in parts.I just loved the idea of every child having an invisible \\"ka\\", or companion who accompanies them until they grow up. I can't repeat enough how well it's written in and naturalised, and the ka are just as solid characters as the 'real' people.I'd never heard of Katherine Roberts until I read this book (and a few others in this series), but now she's definitely in my top three favourite authors!

As I expected from Katherine Roberts, The Great Pyramid Robbery is a wonderfully written and very creative story -- obviously, the author has done her research. From the first page of the book you are transported into Ancient Egypt; via a boy and his ka you will experience the mysteries of daily life and religion. The detailed setting, unique characters, and magical elements put this book in a genre of it's own: historical fantasy mystery (?). The top-notch writing combined with the mystical and action-packed storyline make this a page-turner-of-a-tale that should appeal to a wide range of readers across practically all age ranges and either gender. There are some intense \\"scenes\\", but otherwise is appropriate for any age over about 8 or 9. The overall outcome could be guilty of being a tad predictable -- there's the unlikely hero that overcomes the circumstances to save the day complete with a happy ending, but that makes it a satisfying story that teaches the value of truth, being discriminating about where you place your trust (or judgment), and being true to yourself. I recommend reading the \\"Guide to Senu's World\\" at the back of the book before you begin (or as you read) if there are Ancient Egyptian terms you don't fully understand. I may read this aloud to my 8 and 10 year olds, then take them to Ancient Egyptian exhibit at our local museum -- they'll never view the artifacts as \\"just interesting relics\\" again!

I belonged to the second category, and was never fond of the monsoons, because it meant wading through water logged streets, and the general disruption that accompanied the monsoon season. But, what I liked about the monsoons was an opportunity to sit at home and drink endless cups of tea, and eat hot samosas and pakoras.So, it was with some misgivings that I started reading the book, and I was hooked within the first few pages. Alexander Frater does an excellent job of explaining all about the monsoons, and the methodical way in which the weather department in India follows the path of the monsoon. Some of them sound almost loving when the track the progress of the monsoon that starts from the South and travels up North, hits the Himalayas, and retreats back via the South, and showers the Southern state of Tamil Nadu. Chirapunjee in North Eastern India is supposed to receive the heaviest rainfall in the world, a fact that many school children in India will recite dutifully when questioned. But, due to the changing weather and climate conditions the rains have not been heavy of late in this area.Frater tracks the journey of the monsoon faithfully, and tries to race ahead of the monsoon's next port of calling. Frater literally chases the monsoon, and presents an absorbing, and interesting account of his mission. He spends a couple of months doing this, and travels all over in India, including Chirapunjee. Frater has an amazing eye for detail, and is able to capture the naunces of interacting with the Indian bureaucrats, and others that he interacted while chasing the monsoon.This is one of the best written books about an imporatant and integral part of India, the monsoons, upon which so many people depend. A good monsoon season spells bountfiful harvest, and a bad monsoon spells disaster. The monsoons still control the fortunes of Indian economy, and it is amazing that no one before Frater thought about writing a book on this subject."},{"Title":"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal","review":"Not just a 9/11 book, but a fully developed and fleshed-out account of the tragedy, what went before, and the aftermath - the amazing resurgence of a trading firm after coming close to being wiped out."},{"Title":"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal","review":"I actually got this book from the library, so I didn't actually buy it. But I wouldn't have felt bad about buying it, after reading it. Tom Barbash's writing makes you feel like you were right there interviewing and witnessing conversations with survivors and their families. I truely felt Howard Lutnick's loss for his brother and his other familiy at work. How mind blowing is it to know that almost 700 out of 1000 employees have died, and that you have to get your company back to what it was Sept. 10, 2 days after the attacks, so the Cantor families wouldn't be just put out in the cold. And during all of this, you still have to greave for your brother, best friend, and try to attend over 600 funerals of co-workers and friends you saw every day at work. It's a shame that the media tried to make Howard an escape goat. I've actually have a very different opinion now about Connie Chung than I did before. We always think the reporter, and especially a well known one, would give the audience all the facts instead of eskuing it to one side.Some reviewers have said it's a propaganda book--some propaganda book! The pain all these people went through are real. And I doubt that if that same reviewer was in Howard Lutnick's shoes, he would have done any better under the circumstances.In any event, the book was very eye opening and I have more of appreciation for the survivors and their feelings. I don't think I could now ask a Sept 11 survivior their story anymore. The healing has to begin somewhere, and after 5 years, I think it has begun."},{"Title":"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal","review":"This book is fabulous. As I read each page, the writer expressed the sorrow the people felt after this inhumane tragedy. Having worked in the bond market for 25 years, I was quite shocked when I read that if \\"Cantor\\" could not open and thus subsequentyly go under, the bond market would potentially collasped! Howard, you are a stronger man than you think. Although Mr. Lutnick lost so much on this day, he made the effort to put the company back together so that our free market economy would move on and prosper in the world. In my religion we refer to people like Howard Lutnik as \\"angels\\". Mr. Lutnik this book is so well worth the read!

However, the editor should be admonished for the MANY distractions! Does anyone read manuscripts besides MAC?"},{"Title":"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal","review":"The cataclysm (on many fronts) of September 11 in the United States came home to Cantor Fitzgerald to an extent unthinkable in other stories written to recount company disasters. Entire business divisions wiped out. Management levels both broad and deep decimated. Historical knowledge of a highly specialized industry vaporized in moments. A hard-won, top-dog position in a segment of the cut-throat financial markets thrown into terminal condition - to say nothing of the overwhelming human impact on hundreds of siblings, parents, friends, and extended families and communities.It's difficult to write a tepid review of this book without risking exposure to a similar storm of criticism visited on William Langewiesche of \\"American Ground\\" when he spoke of fire fighters' treatment of their fallen colleagues versus civilian dead at the World Trade Center/Ground Zero site. But \\"On Top of the World\\" had so much potential. It makes me sad to see that potential frittered away in the rush to publish.In more skilled hands that would have structured a better narrative, and with the benefit of some additional \\"aftermath\\" time (although one could argue that in many respects, such \\"aftermath\\" will never be reached), \\"On Top of the World\\" could have shared many lessons on both human and business fronts. Plus it still would have raised boatloads of money to help support the Cantor Fitzgerald families left behind. Ironically, however, the resulting book that is \\"On Top of the World\\" squandered its potential just as surely as the Trade Center collapse ended the potential of many high-performing and bright people.The narrative voice is so confused and vacillates so much that I had a hard time determining where Howard Lutnick left off and the \\"author\\" Barbash picked up. And while I realize that the book was as much about Lutnick as the aftermath of Cantor Fitzgerald, after several chapters I tired mightily of reading about \\"Howard this\\" and \\"Howard that.\\" (Although I did wonder why Howard - or someone close to him - didn't realize they should have retained public relations/media counsel BEFORE ever letting Connie Chung near him.) With all Allison Lutnick must have endured to create the Cantor Fitzgerald support center, she gets Academy Award-type \\"thanks hon\\" recognition from her husband; Barash's inclusion of even a few paragraphs of her first-person recollection would have added some substance to this narrative without spoiling the \\"one man, driven\\" focus of the book.In reading through the chapters, I continually looked for more background and fuller perspectives to understand WHY this loss, of THIS cluster of 658 individuals, was so profound. What were Cantor Fitzgerald's families really like? Was the drive to make money and spend time with their children all there was to their lives? Why was it so important to get eSpeed back up and running - and what would have been the ripple effects on the U.S. economy if that effort had failed? What did it really take for the heroic London office to assume key corporate functions until Cantor could begin to recover? Like so much else in this book, platitudes and generalizations were offered as full explanations when more substance was required.\\"Opportunity lost\\" was so much the story of September 11. And sadly, my lasting impression on reading this book. It could have been so much more."},{"Title":"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal","review":"The story of September 11...as told by Cantor Fitzgerald, by Howard, by Barbash (the ghost writer who won the byline after Lutnick dropped his).This thing is too far removed. Interesting angle but what I want to hear is Lutnick's own honest words, not some ghost writer take thirty minutes of audio and then stamping out a novel for quick publication. Alright, in all fairness this guy Barbash was old buddies with Lutnick and claims to have &quot;shadowed&quot; him for awhile after the trajedy. But this book doesn't really amount to much, and I just didn't enjoy it in the least."},{"Title":"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal","review":"The reviews reproduced here are a tribute to Tom Barbash, just as Barbash wrote the book as a tribute -- and an exhoneration -- to his college buddy Howard Lutnick. Therein lies the tale. Barbash and Lutnick have artfully exploited the suffering of others -- one to write a book (and to promote a novel), the other to strike an innocent pose. It worked! Look at the reviews that blindly defend the book and charge that any criticism of it is tantamount to insensitivity toward the victims of 9/11!This is wonderful propaganda indeed, and if I were to grade it on that scale the book would get five stars. Lutnick's obsession with looking good and Barbash's equally atrocious commitment to whitewashing exploits grief as it turns anger onto others. Sickening."},{"Title":"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal","review":"The rating given this book may seem harsh at first, but then that's because the author's intent is to defend an old college buddy's reputation. A careful reading of the book will reveal that Mr. Lutnick formed several very useful friendships at Haverford College, and that those friendships assisted him in his rather ruthless rise to the top. That several of those friends perished is of course a tragedy, but it also suggests that Mr. Lutnick's sense of having to help those families was as much a personal one as a business one, and that in turn Mr. Barbash is helping out an old Haverford buddy much as this little group had always helped each other. The true victims of 9/11 perished that fateful day or were family or loved ones to those who did (and in this sense Mr. Lutnick is a victim, for he suffered the loss of a brother and several good friends, including Calvin Gooding and Doug Gardner). But Mr. Barbash's indulgent look at Mr. Lutnick's evoling sense of victimhood is too much of an apology, and overlooks the fact that these Haverford boys were interested in doing well as well as doing good."},{"Title":"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal","review":"Living in NYC and having a cousin who worked and died at Cantor Fitzgerald, i was interested to read about that day and what the company did afterwards......I couldn't put the book down. What an amazing story of perserverance in such a time of sadness and shock. You realize while reading this what a bum deal Howard Lutnick got at first from the media, when he was doing everything in his power to keep the business going so that the victims could get money while at the same time mourning his brother, best friend and 656 of his employees.This book also has stories of others at Cantor who weren't at the building at the time of the attack due to a missed train, a meeting or vacation. There is also the stories of the phone calls from those in the building to other Cantor offices and families.This book has it all, it will make you cry, it will make you remember and most of all it will make you feel proud to see a company survive due to the sheer determination of its CEO and surviving employees to make sure that the families of their dead collegues are taken care of."},{"Title":"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal","review":"This well-written, easy-to-read book follows the ordeal of Cantor Fitzgerald, which lost more than 600 people in the World Trade Center attacks. The company was at the top of the first tower, right under Windows on the World and no one who was in the office at that time escaped. Fortunately, Howard Lutnick, who ran the company, went in late that day because it was his son's first day of kindergarten. He lost his only brother, his best friend and obviously a huge percentage of his employees in the attack. Lutnick, who before Sept. 11, had a barracuda-like reputation, was first exalted then vilified by the press (and the survivors of his murdered employees) after the attacks. (Largely because he stopped the employees' paychecks while families were still in denial.) The book follows him as he struggles to do the right thing -- which ultimately is keeping the company alive so that 25% of its profits can go to the survivors. A lot of people get fixated on the paycheck issue but it's obvious that if Lutnick had also died in this attack, the company would have gone under and there would have been no money at all. The book also describes many of the personalities at Cantor and the ways they interacted in a much more real way than the NYT Portraits of Grief. The full list of the dead is at the front of the book -- the fact that there are pages and pages of names from just this one company is horrifying. It's really a fine tribute to the strength of a bunch of spirited people, both living and deceased."},{"Title":"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal","review":"First of all &quot;On Top of the World&quot; would not have been able to have been written if Howard Lutnick had died on September 11, 2001. Cantor-Fitzgerald, as a viable company, would have died along with its 658 employees. The fact that Mr. Lutnick lived and; despite the loss of his beloved brother and most of his best friends, was able to figure out a way to bring CF and the remaining NY/England employees and systems together to save the company in JUST TWO DAYS were just outstanding. I probably would crawled into a corner for months. The book is very sad reading because of the magnitude of personal loss endured. Don't expect a happy, carefree ending. The fact that Mr. Lutnick has kept his promises and sometimes had to go above the montary amount to keep these promises shows the man has integrity despite his &quot;reputation&quot; on the Street. He also kept CF a viable company for his surviving employees. Good for you Mr. Lutnick, your wife, your sister, your friends and to Mr. Barbash for writing your story."},{"Title":"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal","review":"A good friend of mine worked at Cantor Fitzgerald and was among those lost on September 11th. I read this book in one sitting - I couldn't put it down. The devastation that this event caused to the people of Cantor Fitzgerald who lost so many of their family members and friends is astonishing. 955 children who lost parents, twenty sets of siblings who perished. I found that I wanted to be part of the team of people that tried to rebuild the company and help the families of those who were lost.I'll never look back on September 11th the same."},{"Title":"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal","review":"Howard Lutnick has been vilified in the press and on TV - I found his grief on TV deeply moving and have had no reason since to doubt his sincerity.

Give the man a chance."},{"Title":"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal","review":"I bought this on a whim after reading its review in the NY Times, even though the book received some pretty shallow reviews in the paper news. I was ecstatic just to see that a substantial chunk of the profits are going to the Cantor Relief Fund. In a time when many are trying to put 9/11 behind us as a society, so much that we are tired of being overwhelmed with tribute books and reminders, memoires and photo journals, I thought the effort was fabulous. What odds Lutnick had to overcome and what strength he had to find every day, and he survived. I can honestly say I feel great disappointment over Connie Chung and O'Reilly, as well as many members of the Cantor family who do not deserve to have this man care so much about them. Howard Lutnick and those employees who stood by him are remarkable, and this book proves the resillience of those who are determined to overcome an almost complete anihilation of all they had built with their bare hands, and resurrect it into something truly amazing to witness. These guys touched our hearts after 9/11, and it's magnificent to see they have made it this far. I am still pulling for them, maybe more than ever after this book."},{"Title":"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal","review":"I was unfamiliar with Mr. Lutnick or his company before 9/11 as I do not work in the investment arena. However, like many Americans, I was glued to the screen during the tragedy on that date and during the aftermath.For me, that day held a dual personal note in that I have personally spent lots of time at the Trade Center when in NYC on business (the WTC Marriott was always my hotel choice), I actually had visited my brother's office there at the Trade Center with my 2 year old daughter a week to the day before the attack (for the Labor Day holiday).My brother works for Merrill Lynch, and on that day, I was uncertain for hours whether he had survived. Fortunately, he did. Therefore, unlike many on the West Coast,due to my brother's proximity to the situation, I felt particularly attached to the tragedy. Thankfully, I fortunately do not share the fact of loss of a loved one on 9/11. Nevertheless, I felt keenly what that loss would be like during the several hours that I feared that I had lost my brother.All of this is to say that -- I know how difficult it must be for Mr. Lutnick to have lost his brother and close friends yet bear responsibility for keeping his company afloat in the midst of grieving.I am an employee benefits/employment law attorney and when I saw Mr. Lutnick on television that first night indicating that he would \\"take care of the families\\" I immediately thought -- does he realize what a commitment he is making? From a purely legal standpoint, his promise was far outside of his actual liability under the circumstances. It was clear to me that his promises were stated without benefit of legal advice -- simply from his sense of personal loss and sense of responsibility.From that point, I have followed the news on Cantor as Mr. Lutnick's grief that first evening so touched me. I thank him for sharing the moving story of those first weeks during the aftermath with readers. I am amazed that anyone doubts his sincerity. I sincerely hope that the company continues to thrive and that Mr. Lutnick is vindicated.The fortitude demonstrated by this man during this personal tragedy sheds light on why he has been so successful professionally. It was courageous of him to reveal the personal tragedies and challenges that he has had to surmount along the way in his life.My life experiences as a Black woman are quite removed from the lavish lifestyle that Mr. Lutnick probably enjoyed in his position at Cantor. Yet, I can fully appreciate his compassion, dedication, loyalty and hard work ethic that has sustained him through this ordeal. As far as I am concerned, the man is a real life hero due to the humanity of his spirit. I wish him and his company well."},{"Title":"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal","review":"How does one begin to describe this book? It captures what life was like for those men and women at the very center of the World Trade Center Attacks. It tells a fascinating business story, and then the complicated tale of Lutnick and his &quot;families&quot; those left behind. The book does not take sides as much as it simply and eloquently presents the days and nights of people pushed to their limits - it explores motivations, decisions, human responses - all with grace and dignity and ultimately with a degree of hope.

But a book like this gives a vivid picture of just what the ramifications were from so many perspectives. I was aware of the losses by Cantor Fitzgerald but was not that aware of the negative press about Howard Lutnick (not an O'Reilly fan). One may be skeptical of any book that portrays a man so heroically, but if half is true, I am incredibly impressed. It would have been understandable for most anyone in his position to have closed the doors of the company. To have the presence of mind to work through his own personal loss and keep the company going under such circumstances shows there are people in this world that are just born to lead. Almost as impressive was the dedication shown by the other members of his company, especially in the days immediately following the attack. Great story and well written."},{"Title":"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal","review":"This book made me do even more thinking about fate, whether I wanted to or not. it was hard to put down even though I didnt want to read it.its compelling.

From that day forward, Cantor Fitzgerald has been ingrained into my head forever. I did not want to put this book down. The story is told by Harold Lutnick and his friend Tom Barbash as well as a few surviving Cantor employees. The beginning of the book is a lot to take in; it was like reliving 9/11 all over again. Out of 1000 employees, Cantor lost over 600 people. After a few media interviews, Howard was made out to be a horrible person. He stopped paying all deceased and missing employees right away. He did this so that the company could survive and pay money to the families of the survivors. Many people actually questioned whether his tears were phony or not. Some parts of this book were difficult to comprehend. A lot of people seemed to be more concerned with money than anything else. This is a must read for everyone."},{"Title":"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal","review":"Bill O'Reilly, who is far more sleazy than Walter Winchell was at Winchell's worst, accused Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor, Fitzgerald, of failing to meet his obligations to his employee's families when 700 of Cantor Fitzgerald's about 1000 employees died in the World Trade Center.This book clearly and honestly shows, however, that Cantor, Fitzgerald as a small to medium business was unable to pay deceased employees after September 15 2001 for the very good reason that the events including the temporary closure of the markets, and the loss of the employees, cut off the company's air supply.Instead and in a matter that hasn't been sufficiently celebrated because the media (including O'Reilly and Connie Chung) specializes in the dissemination of false ideas, Howard and the remaining employees of his company worked terribly hard while grieving so as to pay out a far more generous amount in bonuses and other renumeration. They brought Cantor Fitzgerald back from a near-death experience.O'Reilly's attack had a nasty undertone of anti-semitism because it was conducted from the \\"point of view\\" of the \\"ordinary working person\\" who labors under the apprehension that ALL companies large and small have unused funds laying about the office and that NO business manager might not sweat bullets to meet each and every payroll.O'Reilly then took credit for \\"forcing\\" Lutnick to do what the latter had been planning to do all along, which was pay compensation based on 4Q 2001 profits which would not have been earned had the salaries been continued.A company like Cantor Fitzgerald is not a moral agent except insofar as it stays within the letter and spirit of the law, which Cantor Fitzgerald of course has done. But a *mensch* like Howard is indeed a moral agent and as such did not deserve to be precipitated, as a focus for inchoate rage, into a media spotlight in such a manner that for thousands of people (including former NYC mayor Ed Koch) he was merely \\"that guy, what's his name, who cried on TV and screwed up\\".Indeed, the situation was an almost mathematical model of how the media destroys knowledge by instead marshaling false consciousness. Lutnick was a decent person, no more or less good than the average CEO. But O'Reilly nonetheless used the Fascism of marshaling anger against \\"the unmentionable odor of death\\" to boost his own ratings.This week, a court decision has absolved Fox news from any responsibility to the truth in a case of two journalists fired from Fox based on their refusal to file a story according to Fox's rules. Here is another document in a growing case against this media empire which is also the mouthpiece for the Bush administration.Lutnick made a mark of himself by crying on TV shortly after the September 11 tragedy and was subject, I believe, to a post-human campaign conducted by a bully and a thug.This story needs to be kept alive today, since Dan Rather is under attack for his good-faith reportage of documents attesting to Bush's failure to meet his Guard obligations. Rather was misled by a forgery and there's a possibility that the forgery was provided through third parties by Karl Rove in order to discredit the Democrats, at least on this issue.In other words, systematic \\"spinning\\", primarily from the Right, have created a post-human climate of mistrust in which a CEO cannot also be a *mensch*, faced with a tricky business situation in which the banks could have put him out of business had he in fact paid salaries after September 15th.In fact, a basically good person would have accepted Lutnick's story because basically good people need to feel not quite so alone. There is nothing to profit from stories of people who betray their employees, or feed false documents to third parties, unless, of course, there's a pre-existing pattern.At the end of the day, even the ordinary reader of the New York Times can say that O'Reilly and Rove are thugs and bums while Howard L is probably OK.At the end of the day, even such an ordinary person can conclude that a society which is so consistently beguiled to believe instead the worst is a Fascist society with a capital F."},{"Title":"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal","review":"i cannot even express my words after reading this book. howard lutnick was treated so poorly by the press and then to have come forward and to do exactly what he said he would do.

Having lost a family member in the tragedy that was CF on 9/11, it strikes a deeply personal chord in my life.My cousin was only in his late 20's at the time. MBA educated on the East Coast, an incredibly bright and driven individual, and with a demeanor so uplifting that his personality was infectious. I remember hearing from him the day he was hired on by the firm. You would of thought the guy had just won the lottery. It was impossible to not be happy for him. He had big plans for his life, and he cherished every moment he spent at CF. Unlike most of us poor souls, he was living his dream.All that changed on 9/11, and this book is the story of a man facing impossible circumstances, yet he refused to let his vision for financial markets die along with his family, best friends, and colleagues. In an era when its ever so trendy to denigrate corporate executives and high achievers, this book is a breath of fresh air. It shows in gripping fashion how the ideologues of the world simply can't break American business and spirit.Shockingly, within a week on 9/11, even in this midst of losing over 2/3 of its highly specialized workforce and facing data loss issues on unfathomable proportions, Cantor Fitzgerald had brought its trading markets back online. Within a year and a half (and with considerable help from the London office of CF) the company had firmly reestablished itself as a major player in global financial services.All the while with their steadfast CEO declaring that 25% of the companies profits should go to the victims of this horrible tragedy.This book will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you relive those horrible days, but most of all it will make you proud. Proud to live in a country where we produce individuals with the strength of will and character to never give up, no matter the circumstances."},{"Title":"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal","review":"Inspirational book about a truly decent man who has overcome some unbelievable sorrows and obstacles.

I admire him for his courage, feel for his personal losses, and congratulate him on keeping his company (and, in turn, the families of those that were lost) together.A really good read."},{"Title":"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal","review":"Here's a 9/11 story of loss and renewal which goes beyond the individual experience: nearly 700 of company Cantor Fitzgerald's New York employees were lost on 9/11, and their friends and coworkers who survived only did so by chance. On Top Of The World focuses as much upon the recovery process of these coworkers as it does upon the events of the day itself, showing how an entire corporation absorbed disaster and kept the company from liquidation and opportunistic take-over. Very highly recommended, especially for business managers."},{"Title":"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal","review":"I read everyone's reviews. Here's mine: this is SOME story. Be grateful the truly gruesome details are not in the book, just the mildly nightmarish ones. The REAL story here is not the tragedy itself but how one man, Howard Lutnick, immediately came to the assistance of not just the families of his 677 murdered employees, but another 130 or so (800 total which includes everybody associated in any way with Cantor Fitzgerald on that day) both financially and emotionally. HOW MANY OTHER CORPORATE CEO'S DO YOU KNOW that gave 5 years of paychecks/bonuses and 10 years of health insurance to the survivor's families? I haven't found another one yet; please enlighten me if you do. Additionally, he gave out his home phone number to EVERYONE and opened the doors of his home too for months. They held board meetings in the closet. Yes the man has a few million in the bank but within days of 9/11, he moved $1,000,000 of it immediately into the newly established Relief Fund without a second thought. I really admire the man. But .. this is the reason some of us are born leaders and CEO's and some of us .. choose to do other things in life. I thought the book was a wonderful testament of what some people find important in their lifetimes and move mountains to achieve it because this is exactly who they are. I laugh when I read the reveiws of those that find the book 'self serving' in Howard's behalf. The people that had their lives ruined by 9/11 got a truly wonderful advocate for such a horrible situation with Howard. God bless the man and I wish the best for everyone affected by 9/11. I highly recommend the book."},{"Title":"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal","review":"This book is exceptionally powerful, reasonably well-written and blatantly self-serving. The good aspects overwhelm the bad by a wide margin.Everyone has heard the story by now, but what makes this so powerful is the reality behind the story. First-hand accounts of the horror, and perhaps most importantly, the aftermath within the whole of the Cantor family are especially moving.Even though this book was clearly written &quot;through&quot; Lutnick, his journey through the aftermath of 9/11 and the importance of his actions cannot be diminished. The ways in which the national news media sensationalized the tragedy for their own ratings is nauseating - although not surprising. Despite the fact that Connie Chung and O'Reilly no longer remain in the national arena of respected journalists, it is frustrating that they worked so hard to sabotage the healing process of the victim's families, and exploit the emotional fog which overcame them by instigating fear and helplessness.Throughout the last few months of 2001, Lutnick does well to counter the national media's feeble attempts at honest story-telling, and shows in his actions what he had promised from the very beginning of the aftermath. He did in fact take care of these families, and in a way that goes well above and beyond what most would consider &quot;reasonable.&quot;A great read, impossible to put down. Just keep in mind that the author is great friends with Lutnick."},{"Title":"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal","review":"I have not been able to put this book down.

The media was &quot;all over&quot; him about not paying the families and after reading this book, one finally realizes that if he didn't do that, there would be nothing today of Cantor Fitzgerald. The huge responsibilty he had to shoulder under such extreme conditions is remarkable.

He and his family didn't even have time to grieve their own loss before they were all over them. I believe that Mr. Lutnick was chosen to live thru this horrible event for a reason. If it weren't for him, the families of those that perished would have had no hope. People should dream not only of having an employer like this man, but also a true and loyal friend. This is a story of incredible strength and love while overcoming unimaginable obstacles. There are many unsung heroes of 9/11 and Mr. Lutnick, with his family and friends, should be named among them."},{"Title":"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal","review":"When it comes to the world of finance, I'm a total idiot. I also don't spend much time thinking of such things, since I've never had enough money to invest in a savings account, much less comodities. So some of what the story is about eludes me. I can't identify with the amount of dollars being discussed, or the money these people make, but they become human because of the pain they endured and the losses they suffered. Cantor Fitzgerald suffered potential fatal harm that day and the people who struggled to pull the company out of the ashes are to be commended, as well as consoled.

It's nice to get the other side of the story for a change."},{"Title":"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal","review":"This is an exceptional book. It is part history, part biography, part autobiography and from the point of view of a barbaric act, perhaps part \`true crime'. Most of all it is a book about leadership and heroism. That heroism is Hitchcockian. A person perceived to be average (though he had been very successful, he was not a household name) was caught up in a devastating act of terrorism. His response to his circumstance was to lead and to discover/reveal his own, remarkable heroism.This is Howard Lutnick's story, told by a college friend, but using many of Howard Lutnick's words. The trade center is destroyed. Lutnick's company is nearly destroyed. Competitors are nibbling at the edges, hoping to capture market share. The company must be rebuilt amid the human and corporate devastation if the profits are to be generated to aid the victims' survivors. Meanwhile, those survivors' pain must be attended to as the aid agencies struggle to understand their task and begin to perform it and the media are seeking heroes, villains and mini-dramas.This is a powerful story, the telling of which falls into a real but simultaneously literary plot arc. It is a story of death and destruction that leads, ultimately, to recovery and it is told in a gripping way that does not call excessive attention to its art and craft. Its constant focus is on human emotion and human triumph in the face of overwhelming odds. This sounds, of course, like a promo for a Saturday afternoon serial or a movie of the week, but in this case the story is true, the blood is real and so are the debts, the profits, the emotional scars, the human loss.Personal disclosure: I am privileged to call Stuart Fraser (Howard Lutnick's cochair, partner and close friend) a friend. I came to know him better as a result of Tom Barbash's book. I visited him twice in his office at the trade center. I still have my pass from the final visit, which occurred a little over five months before 9/11. Cantor Fitzgerald's story is a very special one. Barbash notes that the founder of the company, Bernie Cantor, was a great collector of Rodin statuary. The Cantor offices had been designated the \`highest museum' in the world. It was a place of art as well as commerce. Cantor's actions on behalf of the bond effort in World War II are not detailed here; he was an extraordinary man and this is an extraordinary story, one that every American should read."},{"Title":"On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal","review":"This is an excellent book -- I feel it's worth reading on so many levels ...1) Enlightening and moving historical record of such a horrific event in our country's history.2) Eye-opening view into the damage than can be caused by irresponsible media.3) Inspiring story of how this company was saved by so few people under the most extraordinarily difficult circumstances.4) Loving tribute to so many innocent victims who, sadly, now serve as a motivation and inspiration for those left behind.As a volunteer for Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund, I'd just like to mention that there are still many ways to help these families.

I just finished reading &quot;The Color Of Summer&quot; by the late Cuban writer Reinaldo Arenas--and what a challenge it is for me to describe or assess this extraordinary work of fiction. It seems to be a hybrid of memoir, satire, and wild, hallucinatory magical realism. Maybe I should de-emphasize the term &quot;realism.&quot; Historical events are exaggerated or transmogrified by the author--often with hilarious and irreverent results. The relentless pursuit of pleasure is constantly at odds with the pursuit of power. In one chapter entitled &quot;The Garden Of Computers&quot; Arenas brilliantly satirizes the bureaucracy of informants. &quot;...denunciations, backstabbings, and betrayals of friendship were the nourishment the machines lived on.&quot; This is as brilliant as anything Dickens ever wrote about corrupt institutions. Other authors that came to mind as I read &quot;The Color Of Summer&quot; were Gabriel Garcia-Marquez, William Burroughs and, especially, Salman Rushdie. The amazing word-play in this book(in which 30 tongue twisters are interspersed)is delightful. Credit for this must surely be shared by the English translator Andrew Hurley. Sex(especially gay sex)is an obsession with most of the characters in this book-including the central tyrant Fifo(Castro). This is not a book for the timid or prudish. However, underneath it all there is a powerful affimation of the human spirit. Arenas expresses profound sadness, frustration, and anger--which cuts right through all the raucous humor. But, more than that, he imparts a sense of real joy through his characters' acts of defiance and creativity. I thoroughly recommend this book. A masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Color of Summer: or The New Garden of Earthly Delights","review":"If the famous altarpiece of Hieronymous Bosch , similarly titled the Garden of Earthly Delights, could become words, those words would probably read much like Reinaldo Arenas' last volume. As with any fine writer (and make no bones about it, Arenas is one of the best of the Latin writers), the act of drawing an audience into a book is part enjoyment but also part labor. Plan on working to catch all the subtle metaphors and references as well as the obvious in-your-face slapstick that flows continously from these pages.Arenas' bifurcated feelings about his native Cuba are well know to the readers of his other novels: Cuba he adores - Castro he loathes. And as the author was dying from AIDS in the US he was able to concentrate all of his ambiguous responses to his native homeland into a grand guignol carnival Farewell Party. The precis for the story is the preparation for the celebration of Fifo's (thinly disguised name for Fidel Castro) &quot;50th&quot; anniversary of dictatorship. Arenas very cleverly separates his personality into three faces - Gabriel, Reinaldo, and Skunk in a Funk - in order to give us the many facets of view of living in Cuba now and before Castro. His characters are hilariously drawn campy creatures in an endless pursuit of earthly delights (aka gay sex) and if the interchange of gender pronouns (him/her) at times gets a bit overused, the premise is sound and keeps the stew bubbling. Even the atrocities attributed to &quot;Fifo&quot; are handled in sure polished slapstick that we are drawn more to laughter than to loathing. Cuba is finally liberated by being separated from its mooring to the sea floor to float out blissfully toward Europe..or....Arenas was a brilliant writer who died too young, but as this final translation of his output proves, his was a significant voice not only as a gay writer, but as a revolutionary thinker under the duress of loss of freedom that still plagues Cuba. Highly recommended book....just plan to work some and to take your time......."},{"Title":"The Color of Summer: or The New Garden of Earthly Delights","review":"Tragic yet hilarious, &quot;The Color of Summer&quot; is a bitter frolic through the lives of homosexuals in Fidel Castro's Cuba. Opening with a stunning 50-page play, the farce continues to sing throughout the remaining pages. The ill-fated sojourns of so many characters are detailed, but always with a willingness to see the humor within the suffering of men who seek pleasure despite the risk of punishment by a tyrant and his faithful firing squads. A nice piece of political commentary aimed at the seat of Castro's olive-green pants, &quot;The Color of Summer&quot; reveals the leaks in the dictator's &quot;air-tight&quot; oppressive regime, leaving Castro at the center of ridicule. With wonderful character development, gleaming threads of honesty appear within the blanket of mischeivous men whose tales are told in the most amusingly crass manner."},{"Title":"The Color of Summer: or The New Garden of Earthly Delights","review":"Amazing.

This book begins with a play then has many small chapters, filled with wit, humor, and all manner of unbeleivable images. Reinaldo makes no apologies for his sexual leanings, or spare the feeling of the dictator Fifo (Fidel Castro) or his brother Raul. Many people are mentiond by name, and many have mulitiple names, sometimes male, sometimes female. This book is enertaining, tittilating, and wonderful.

Anyone considering getting involved in an interfaith relationship, will definitely gain by reading this book and learning of the reasons behind Judaism's opposition to intermarriage, between Jews and non-Jews. I very much like the dialogue format of the book, and the mutual respect the rabbi, and the two gentiles have for each other."},{"Title":"Dear Rabbi, Why Can\`t I Marry Her?","review":"It's a great book because besides for being a very interesting topic (intermarriage), and that both, the Rabbi and Juan are very honest and smart, it's a REAL dialogue, and that makes it so real and a great page turner!"},{"Title":"Dear Rabbi, Why Can\`t I Marry Her?","review":"Sitting on my coffee table this evening is the darkly insightful book, \\"Dear Rabbi: Why Can't I Marry Her?\\" by Rabbi Eliezer Shemtov. Without yet getting into the details of how and why I came upon this book (and no, I haven't suggested an intention to marry anyone), I will wonder aloud what qualifies a Rabbi to write a book telling an atheist like myself whom he cannot marry? After all, I'd probably be called a bigot if I wrote an atheist's guide to whom Jews cannot marry.Through a series of made-up & real dialogues, Mr. Shemtov explains the idea that if a Jew were to marry a non-Jew, it would be like a brother marrying his sister. It's not that he finds intermarriage repulsive or gross. Actually, he doesn't find incest repulsive or gross either, it's just that both are outlawed by the Torah. If the Torah did not explicitly forbid it, I could marry a Jew or my sister with the Rabbi's blessing. By this logic, he WOULD condone marriage with a 1st cousin - the Torah doesn't forbid that one.Further he tells me that it is not just morally wrong, but simply impossible for a Jew to marry a non-Jew. You can have sex all you want, have babies, live together, grow old and die at each other's side, but God will never consider it a marriage. My logical reaction to this is to wonder what the problem is. I've never really cared what God condones as much as Santa Claus (who will at least reward my good deeds with presents). And if I can't \\"truly\\" marry a Jew no matter how hard I might try, why then did the Rabbi have to write a whole book about it? If this is unalterable law, then Mr. Shemtov clearly has nothing to worry about. Wouldn't a book about why I can't marry a Jew be as obsolete as one persuading me to obey gravity?Shemtov reminds me about the few Jewish weddings I've been to - there is always that touching moment when the Rabbi talks about how, according to ancient Jewish beliefs, the soul splits at birth to be reunited at the later date of marriage. Supposedly God divies up of soul in such a way that you are destined to meet, fall in love with & marry the other half of your soul. Thus, according to Shemtov, it seems Jews believe both in extreme narcissism (my soul is so special I want to marry it) along with extreme self hate (I am incomplete if I don't marry). The result is that when a goy falls in love with a Jew, he/she automatically becomes a murderer by preventing the reunification of the Jewish soul. I've been bragging about this to my friends all week and I'm considering adding \\"murderous goy\\" to my business card."},{"Title":"Maverick Marine: General Smedley D.

Butler and the Contradictions of American Military History","review":"It's somewhat ironic that someone as plain-spoken and hard-headed as Old Gimlet Eye would have a book written about him by an intellectual like Dr. Schmidt, but it says a lot about the relevance of Butler, his life in the Marines and in politics.The book displays how Butler served as both a Marine in endless campaigns for the United States, and how he later came, not to renounce the military or the Marines, but the use of US Military forces overseas as, what he believed them to be, tools of Big Business, and not serving in either the interest of the United States Constitution or its citizens.This book lead me to Butler's own small book &quot;War is a Racket,&quot; which was highly influential in my own opinions about use of military force outside our country's borders. Butler would never consider himself an intellectual, but he had heaps of common sense - a quality which is sometimes lacking from those with sky-high IQs. Marines are sworn to the duty of protecting the United States from all enemies, foreign and domestic, and they take this duty to heart. Once Butler realized that some of his fighting may not have served this interest, he became a very politically charged and controversial figure and speaker. How the hell could the former Commandant of the United States Marine Corps declare himself against war? Well, he didn't go against war, but advocated the prudent use of our military strength in the defense of the homeland. Sometimes he went a little far in supporting his points, but his intentions - to look out for both our country and those who serve it - are admirable traits in any career politician or general (there's little difference between the two once someone picks up that first star).The other things you'll pick up from this book are that Butler was one tough son-of-a-gun. He's one of the most fearless fighting men this country has ever had. I hope they kept some DNA from this guy so we can clone him enough times to fill the manpower requirements of at least one Marine Expeditionary Unit.I get the feeling that the author admired Butler's political career more than his military one. But, he successfully shows how Butler's intellect benefits from civilian life. In Butler's own book he said that, as a military man, he didn't have the capacity to question the ethics or motivations of his missions overseas. This is true, as the military's communal, self-sufficient environment isn't good for expanding one's intellectual sphere. Anyway, this is a good book about an American legend.-- JJ Timmins"},{"Title":"Maverick Marine: General Smedley D. Butler and the Contradictions of American Military History","review":"Most Marines know that Major General Smedley Darlington Butler was the only officer in the Corps to win two Medals of Honor. Most non-Marines, like Dr. Hans Schmidt, identify Butler with his 1935 diatribe of Wall Street and Big Business:\\"I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. The record of racketeering is long.... Looking back on it, I feel I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three city districts. We Marines operated on three CONTINENTS\\" [p. 231].Dr. Schmidt is a fan of Butler--the \\"patriotic warrior hero whose courage, physical command presence, and vernacular coarseness epitomized the popular ideal of a soldier's general\\" (p. 1). This is easily understandable; Butler's distinguished combat record and blunt, extroverted style of leadership endeared him to the mass media and earned him a legion of followers. Schmidt became a Butler disciple after writing the UNITED STATES OCCUPATION OF HAITI, 1915-1934 (New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press, 1971).MAVERICK MARINE uses sixteen chapters to interweave two subjects: (1) The life and times of Smedley Butler and (2) The Marine Corps's role as the strong arm of American foreign policy in the early twentieth century. Schmidt's coverage of the former is nonpareil; his treatment of the latter, however, does not hold up as well under scrutiny.Butler's career in the Marine Corps began in 1898 at age sixteen. During the war with Spain, Second Lieutenant Butler deployed with the 1st Marine Battalion to the Caribbean. There, he found his niche in life fighting along side the men of the \\"Old Corps\\"; after the war, Butler opted to align himself with the \\"uneducated, roughneck tendencies within the marines\\" (p. 10) rather than return to civilian life and school.During the next thirty years, Butler battled bandits and insurrectionists around the globe in a series of armed interventions. He served under Major Littleton W. T. \\"Tony\\" Waller during the Philippine Insurrection of 1899 and came to idolize the racist, bombastic, hard-nosed campaigner--calling Waller \\"the greatest soldier\\" he ever knew (p. 12). Waller, incidentally, earned the nickname \\"Butcher of Samar\\" for his exploits in the Philippines. Years later, in 1910 and 1914, Waller was in line for the commandancy; and Butler, of course, was one of his most vociferous supporters. Unfortunately, Waller's alleged atrocities in the Philippines tarnished his reputation; both times, he failed to rise to Corps's top position. Both times, Butler grew incensed at the \\"highbrow professionalism and Annapolis elitism\\" he perceived to be responsible for Waller's slighting (p. 121).In 1900, Smedley marched on Tientsin and Peking to relieve the Legation Quarter during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900. After distinguishing himself in China (and being wounded), Butler transferred to Panama to command one of the companies in the newly formed Advance Base Force battalion. Butler won both his Medals of Honor serving in subsequent expeditions to Nicaragua (1910-1912), Veracruz (1914), and Haiti (1915-1917). It was during Nicaragua, Schmidt asserts, that Butler \\"clearly established his preeminence in the tactics of colonial warfare--bold imperious leadership of small units so as to bluff the natives into submission, thereby avoiding the escalating costs, perils, and embitterments attendant to massive violence\\" (p. 47).Towards the end of his Marine career, Butler led a brigade to Shanghai in response to the Nanking Incident of March 1927. His most successful and least controversial mission, Butler returned from China in 1929 to his formerly held position as commander of Quantico. Now one of the ranking generals in the Corps, he was in line for the commandancy--but it was not to be. After Commandant Wendell C. Neville died in office, the low-key Ben Fuller ascended to the Corps's top post over Butler. In 1931, Butler retired from the Corps after an off-color anecdote about Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini landed him a court-martial (later reduced to a reprimand; see pp. 208-212).Butler made one last appearance in Marine Corps circles four years after retirement. In 1935, he contested General John Russell's confirmation as Commandant. Russell stood for everything Butler opposed: He was an intellectual, graduating the Naval Academy and War College; he embraced reform; and he saw little combat during his career, serving a long stint in Haiti--where, while on a diplomatic mission for the State Department, he befriended Franklin D. Roosevelt. Schmidt clearly sides with Butler by calling the occasion \\"a last hurrah for warrior standards that were diminishing in importance at marine headquarters and as a factor in congressional politics\\" (p. 214). Yet, Russell was able to reform officer promotions, create the Fleet Marine Force (still the backbone of the operating forces today), and nurture the development of amphibious doctrine--the mission that would elevate the Marine Corps to elite status in the Pacific during World War II. This begs the question: If Butler had his way, would the Marines ever have grown from international policemen to the six-division amphibious assault force of the Pacific during the 1940s? Sadly, this question is beyond Schmidt's grasp. Simply put, Butler was an anachronism.In sum, approach this book with caution. As simply a chronicle of Butler's life, Schmidt succeeds. However, MAVERICK MARINE has limited utility as an operational history of the \\"Colonial Infantry\\" Marine Corps. Although amply footnoted and richly illustrated, MAVERICK MARINE lacks depth and perspective. For example, there are no maps. How can you write of campaigns in half a dozen countries without one map? Likewise, there is a difference between a marine and a Marine; pedantic, to be sure, but irritating for the educated reader. Although I enjoyed the book and highly recommend it, it is not the final word on Smedley Butler. As a counterbalance to MAVERICK MARINE, I recommend reading Bartlett's \\"Old Gimlet Eye.\\" The truth lies somewhere in between."},{"Title":"Maverick Marine: General Smedley D. Butler and the Contradictions of American Military History","review":"This book is about an American patriot and career Marine Corps officer who had the ability to see through the motivation of many of the U.S. military adventures in which he played a leading role. It would be interesting if he were still living and able to share his insights and convictions about our current military entanglements beyond our nation's borders. His views are reminiscent of the warnings our first President, George Washington, gave in his Farewell Address."},{"Title":"Maverick Marine: General Smedley D. Butler and the Contradictions of American Military History","review":"Smedley Butler was a great American, a two-time Congressional Medal of Honor recipient, a General in the Marine Corps, and, in retirement, an articulate and famous pacifist, who could not be dismissed as effeminate or ignorant. His life is worth examining, particularly by anyone in the military.Butler was also a skein of contradictions: a Marine from a Quaker family, a general who joined the Marines as a private, a critic of politics in the military whose congressman father just happened to oversee the department of the Navy, a soldier who spent most of his days maintaining order in America's colonies, official and otherwise, who then went to vehemently condemn the deployment of American troops overseas, and perhaps most importantly, a soldier who inspired fierce loyalty. This list could go on and on.Unfortunately this biography reads like a police report and not like a measured and analytical examination of a truly fascinating American. Butler was a great man who deserves a much better biography. (Un)fortunately court historians who write popular political hagiographies seem to eschew the lives of quixotic Marines, however impressive, interesting, and instructive their lives may have been.As there are not that many biographies of Butler extant, this one may well be worth reading for the facts, but do not expect greatness from this book."},{"Title":"Maverick Marine: General Smedley D. Butler and the Contradictions of American Military History","review":"This is a compelling story about a forgotten and fascinating patriot. A much decorated hero, when he retired, he supported the bonus marchers and was there at their rally when the marchers were dispersed by General MacArthur, with whom General Butler shared an intense mutual dislike. Butler was also notable for expressing his regrets over his leadingtroops into the &quot;Banana Republics&quot; at the behest of banks and the United Fruit Company. At the end of his life, he urged AMericans not to enter the war in Europe."},{"Title":"Maverick Marine: General Smedley D. Butler and the Contradictions of American Military History","review":"This quote is absurd, \\"officer-warrior who lost his way as he advanced in rank\\" - Journal of American History. HA! MajGen Smedley Butler FOUND his way during these years. Conscience must sometimes be developed through experience, and for warriors often times at the expense of their own naive view of the infallibility and benevolent intentions of their own government and leaders. I can't help but shudder to think of the propaganda that the JAH rag is putting out if this is their comment on Old Gimlet Eye's expose on truth. God help us all! My recommendation is to read every bit of the Butler story in order to pull the truth back into America's jaded and blatantly obscured past. Study this story from all directions and in depth, and wake up to reality that's been going on since day one in America over 235 years ago.

Butler and the Contradictions of American Military History","review":"The book has a scholarly flavor and is well researched. I felt the author, at times, utilized a somewhat stilted approach to describe the life of a plain spoken Marine.

Butler and the Contradictions of American Military History","review":"I first heard about General Butler through references on the History Channel or a documentary TV program by Allister Cookeabout the Depression and the 1930's. The person being interviewed had to be reminded about the Army plot to take over theU. S. governemnt in crisis mode. It was Henry Wallace or somebody. (They thought FDR would be weak. Good luck on that one.) Anyway there was newsreel footageof General Butler discussing the plot and his refusal to take part. He was supposed to be the front man for a column of Bonus Marchers.I heard somewhere that Oliver Stone wanted to make a movie about the incident. Great! Finally there is constiracy movie from Oliver Stone thatI can believe in. I suppose the film projet fizzled as happens so frequenly in Hollywood. Too bad if so. I wonder who would have portrayedGeneral Butler? Bruce Willis maybe. The imagination flies.As far as Hans Schmidt's book goes, one could not make up a story of this man's life. He was involved in EVERYTHING. Boxer Rebellion, the \\"Banana Wars\\", the occupation of Haiti, the fight against Chaing-Kai-Shek in 1927. He fought bootleggers in Philadelphia as the Police Chief. Ultimately, he was court marshalledby President Hoover; a celebrity military trial much like Billy Mitchel's.The narrative sheds some light upon the politics of the Marine Corps leadership of the time between the World Wars. It is very informative about this colorful figure.I read this book in kindle format. Even the kindle edition has photographs from Butler's life.

The book is divided into three parts: the first is concerned with presenting their model of testing theory, the second provides a step by step account of how to develop tests for real life contexts and the classroom, and the third provides ten case studies of different kinds of tests, worked out in greater or lesser detail according to the model they present earlier. The book is therefore useful for students beyond a practically oriented teacher training level, and is suitable to introduce the concept of test development as a team effort, a project planned and managed by a team leader. At the same time, it is simple enough for those on applied linguistics or language teacher education courses who do not have the time or interest to pursue theoretical issues in detail. It presents one model, that of the authors, which draws a great deal on Bachman (1990) Fundamental considerations in language testing. It does not compare or evaluate different models in the way McNamara (1996) does. All of this makes the book accessible and useful, hence its popularity in the sales figures. The emphasis they place on keeping an eye of the context of situation and an analysis of language use and related factors as the basis for test design are very useful and sound. Also, the procedures given for developing tests are easy enough to follow. However, the book has at least a couple of things that might make it a bit difficult to follow, at least until you get used to it. For a start, the language used by the authors tends to be a bit dry and abstract. For example, for they call the planning stage of test development \`design', the writing stage \`operationalization' and the use and review stage \`administration'. They use the abbreviation TLU for target language use situation, a way of referring more or less to the sociolinguistic concept of context of situation. The use of terms like \`channel', \`form', \`language' and \`type' in the section on the communicative context may be a bit abstract for some. Despite the many examples of real situations used to illustrate their concepts throughout the book, the writing remains uninspiring, and it might have been better to use more colloquial language, a la Steven Pinker or Jean Aitchison. In addition, the structure or organization of the book with its three sections requires that some ideas are presented not in one section, but are found in smaller bits throughout the book. For example, the material on \`quality control' for tests, the plan for the evaluation of usefulness, is split between the theoretical coverage in section one, the actual \`how to do it' in section two, and the various case studies in section three. Overall, however, I found their approach sound, and the book is certainly a very useful one. I would recommend its use in undergraduate and postgraduate courses in applied linguistics and in language testing."},{"Title":"Language Testing in Practice","review":"This book isn't really a how-to-guide in the sense that it gives you one method to build a \\"perfect\\" test (which does not exist). The text does give you ways to think about what kind of information you want from a test, how to structure effective tests, how to use the information from proctoring the test, and so forth. I find this text to be a great resource for teachers both new and experienced. The text shows great examples of the process of building useful tests in a language learning situation. Examples come from the authors' experiences as well as from others they have reviewed."},{"Title":"Language Testing in Practice","review":"I have been very pleased with the way the transection pertaining to this book went.

The characters are legends in their own right, but we get to see all the levels peeled back. The banter is quick, the plot might feel light at first, but there's so much going on underneath. Secondary characters are detailed and deceiving! This might not be an easy read for everyone, but it is deep and thematic and emotionally satisfying."},{"Title":"The Fall","review":"Juliane and Ulrich really are legends in their time. She has the dubious honor of being the Queen of the Frigid and he has the sole distinction of being the King of Seduction. As the story unfolds, we learn how very much Juliane stands to both gain and lose if a man manages to rise to her particular challenge. Ulrich could easily have been a one-dimensional character in this story, but Dain peels back his layers and we find out how very much he has to offer Juliane.The most surprising thing about this book is its intense emotional depth. I expected a fun read and a great one, since it was by Claudia Dain. I should have expected the intensity and the heart-wrenching revelations, as well, but they somehow took me unaware. This book, like its hero and heroine, has many layers. It is deep, moving and satisfies on so many levels."},{"Title":"The Fall","review":"Claudia Dain never fails to enthrall me with her rich writing. The Fall is no exception.

Somehow, though, Dain manages to bring Ulrich and his frosty lady together in a manner that is entirely believable and true to their characters. Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Fall","review":"From the very beginning, I was drawn in by the beautiful writing. As I read on, the theme and symbolism caught my attention. By the end of the book, I was completely invested in everything, including characters and plot. The story was beautiful, made all the more powerful by the writing.

I can't wait to read more of them."},{"Title":"The Fall","review":"I love Claudia Dain! And I loved The Fall!While reading her Medieval Knights Series, I felt as though I was taken back in time. Her descriptions, characters and plots feel authentic to the era. If you are looking for bubble gum romance or a light romp you will probably not like this series. But if you are looking for something deeper, with more substance, you can't go wrong with The Fall or with any of the books in the Medieval Knights Series. This story and the others depict medieval England more accurately than others I've read. Yet there is still a touching and loving romantic tale intertwined throughout the pages.This book is a stand alone, but if you've read the others, a past hero is mentioned and plays somewhat into this plot. For me it's always fun to find out what happened to past characters once their book says \\"the end\\".Juliane is a strong woman and witty. I loved her attempts to frighten Ulrich away. But the lure of both land and the lady are too tempting to scare off the courtly knight with no land of his own. There are wonderful secondary characters, an awful villain, and a hero and heroine who are the perfect match for each other."},{"Title":"The Fall","review":"I've read hundreds of romances. This was one of the better-written stories. When I first read this book, I was so enchanted that I thought I would add it to my rare \\"Keep Forever\\" collection. The main characters play well off each other. The secondary characters were also delightful and several sequels could come from this. My only complaint was with the level of violence near the end. The heroine got cruel treatment -- something other romances authors usually stop short of doing to their characters. I realized then that this was going to be a \\"read-once-only\\" book for its higher than normal violence."},{"Title":"The Fall","review":"Juliane Le Gel married young as she was instructed. Things went wrong, however, when the witness of the consummation of her marriage told the tale that, though she was obedient and submissive in the bedchamber, Juliane's husband couldn't rise to the occasion and breach her maidenhead. Because the marriage couldn't be finalized with consummation, Juliane was divorced from her husband. Given a reprieve, as she saw it, from the hardship of marriage, Juliane built a reputation for herself as the \\"Frost Fair\\". The legend was that though many men had tried to win her, none could keep from \\"withering\\" when she looked at them.Ulrich of Caen is a [illegitimate] born knight with a reputation for the ladies. He comes to Juliane's home with a couple of his buddies to try to \\"melt the ice\\" of the legendary Juliane.I find myself writing this review in a very stilted manner, and can't help but think that it's because I've been damaged by the heavy medieval style in which this tale is told. This is not the first Dain book I've read, and she's usually very good at helping to create a tone for her book with her prose. If she's writing Puritans and Pirates, it feels like a book about Puritans and Pirates. If she writes a Western, let me tell you, it feels like a Western. Normally if she writes a medieval, it really feels like a medieval. This feels like a medieval, but one written by a Victorian author. \\"The Fall\\" is too vague, too wordy, too artificial to work. I had to force myself through the first fifty pages, the whole time shaking my head in disbelief that this could be a Claudia Dain book--often I slide along so easily in her prose that I find myself reading a whole book in one sitting. That was simply not the case this time around.Juliane isn't really frigid. She's just been skillful about creating an aura of it around herself. Employing servants, family members, and even animals in her quest to have a cold shower affect on every man she meets. Sure she was successful, but by the end of the book I have myself wondering why. The whole basis of the legend was a lie, Juliane's first marriage was consummated, she's not a virgin, but her husband was convinced to go along with the story and walk away from her by her father for reasons that are never really revealed and therefore seem fantastical. Why would her husband walk away?Also, Juliane's set up is as a strong heroine, and she is strong, but she's also a little dumb and emotionally ignorant. She's totally blind to the true feelings and machinations of an uncle who likes to meddle. It's apparent that she's into Ulrich, but she resists him like crazy for a reason that feels really false--she says she doesn't want him to know her legend is a lie or something to that effect. She runs off after their wedding and gets herself \\"intimately violated\\" (yes, actually \\"intimately violated\\") just because she's trying to prove that Ulrich doesn't control her or something. I just don't really like her.Ulrich has baggage, as even medieval rakes are wont to do. He has no money or land, and decides to marry Juliane when she's offered to him (because her father thinks she's the man for him just because he can get it up--even though the father knows the whole frigid thing is a myth) so that he can take the land he'll get and make the son he already has heir to it. Yeah. Juliane's own children will be landless and penniless so that Ulrich's [illegitimate] son can have the only estate they're given. Never would a medieval woman's family have made such a match for her, knowing that. Typical romance author mistake, though, we see this sort of thing all of the time. People forget the main consideration of arranged marriages was not furthering the interests of the two people marrying so much as it was furthering the prospects of any products of the union, and therefore the importance of both families involved. Sorry, tangent.Anyway, these two, somewhere in the middle of the strange little \\"game\\" of courtly love they're playing fall in love. Then (and here's the thing that really made the book a total loss for me), they consummate their marriage two days after she was brutally \\"intimately violated\\". Yeah. And it's a full blown \\"we're having the best sex of our lives\\" sex scene. Okay you haven't heard the worst yet. The \\"bedding\\" is witnessed by his best friend, her sister, and her brother. That's right. It's like a bad porn movie. And it's not one of those historically accurate \\"witness the consummation\\" moments. It feels really dirty. Squick.I have to give \\"The Fall\\" one star. It just doesn't have any redeeming qualities--though the secondary romance comes close. I'd love to play the part of fangirl (which I am when it comes to Dain, honestly), but I have to be honest. The plot looks like someone used it for target practice. The characters aren't very good. The prose, from an author who's normally excellent, is awful. And, there are some downright disgusting and horrific scenes. I love Claudia Dain, she's so much better than this. Go read \\"The Marriage Bed\\", or \\"Tell Me Lies\\", or \\"A Kiss To Die For\\", or heck ANYTHING else by Dain. She's normally amazing, but we all have bad days, right?Also, there are \\"Taming of The Shrew\\" elements here. I guess. Sort of. But not enough to mention. I don't really think that comparison was Dain's intention at all, nor do I really think it is founded."},{"Title":"The Fall","review":"I think there were about 100 pages too many.

Beware - and buy used."},{"Title":"The Fall","review":"I have enjoyed Dain's past novels, even when the violence toward the heroine made me uncomfortable. But this book simply went too far besides being totally unrealistic. What woman on the face of this earth, could be brutally raped and in the next minute consummate her marriage in front her best friend, her husband's best friend, and her BROTHER. Let alone enjoy it. This disgusted me. I cannot buy any more of her books if this trend is going to continue. Unless you have some masochistic streak in you, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"The Fall","review":"Really, I am curious how a book such as this could ever get published. Not one to normally review on books, I found that I simply could not allow this book to go without a review, at least stating that it is not worth your patience.

Don't waste your money on this book, you can find many others that are much more worth your time."},{"Title":"The Fall","review":"This is the second book I have read by Claudia Dain. I found that it was difficult getting through the first half of the book and it took me a long time to get through it because I had a hard time liking the main characters and the repeative nature of this part of the book. The constant wagering between the main characters, Juliane and Ulrich got old really fast for me. The second half of the book picks up in every aspect. There is more angst between the characters, more action, more romance, and more substance to the story itself. This author is unique upon the historical authors I have read that takes a more realistic view on the medieval period in her use of religion and religious doctrine which in that period would have influenced every aspect of the lives of the nobles or semi-nobles. The church did have an invested interest in the lives of the nobles and Dain's portrayal of these attitudes and the harsh treatment of women in those days is pretty accurate for the period.However, I found that I was more intrigued with the secondary characters of Avice and Edward and their interactions, angst, romance then I was with the main characters plot. I would have liked to see the secondary character's story develop more and their own story told in a book of their own. In the end I found myself continuing to read on to get the next tid bit on where the secondary romance would go."},{"Title":"The Fall","review":"Cludia Dain is a master writer of sensual banter and sexual tension. Her books have strong women who find more than a man, they find themselves. As the book unfolds you see all the characters for the complex personalities that they have become over time.

Ulrich is a worthy opponent for such a fiesty Juliane.Harriet, you have some of your facts wrong that affect the outcome of the conflict. The first husband did not die and it wasn't the \\"attraction\\" between Juliane and Ulrich that convinced her father of his worth, but it was his \\"abilities.\\" I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read it yet.I am hoping the ending is a beginning for Edward and Avice (I just loved how their conflict was developed) and who knows, maybe we will see Young William and Lunete in the future.

The story line starts slow until the lead couple turn into enemy combatants. From that moment the tale never looks back as the fine duet turns into Beloved Enemies. Though a late twist adds suspense, the tale belongs to the gender warring warriors.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Fall","review":"I bought this book based on an editorial review but I sure didn't find the sparkly repartee or seething sexual tension they did.

The author's attitude seems best conveyed with the paraphrased quote &quot;when i decided to write a book on appalachia, i had no idea i'd have to dig through dozens of rare or out of print books,&quot; Indeed, with just a little effort, more practical magic can be dug up from the region, which the author didn't even visit to write this book. Furthermore, i was especially disapointed by the chapter on &quot;death, dying, and haints&quot; in relation to the original title of this book _In a Graveyard at Midnight_ (but then i own a newer edition and perhaps info was taken out when they changed the title?). The book _Albion's Seed_ does a better job of showing appalachia's cultural roots in scotland and northern england. Still, i have to give _Mountain Magic_ 3 stars because of McCoy's treatment of the Appalachian region and it's people.(of whom, i count myself to be among) Though she does romanticize the area's celtic roots a bit, she definately portrays the settlers of past and present in a good light, does alot to dispell mythes about hillbillies, and explains exactly why the mountains are the way they are. Most importantly of all, however, she raises a very good point, even if she doesn't elaborate on it too well, that one does not need to look to ireland or the brittish isles to find magic, or even celtic and anglo-saxon culture, but that perhaps the best place to look for these things is in our roots right here beneath our American feet."},{"Title":"Mountain Magick: Folk Wisdom from the Heart of Appalachia (Llewellyn's Practical Magick Series)","review":"Mountain Magick gives an inside view of the people and ways that have survived since the nation's founding. Ways that are, regrettably, dying out. Luckily, Edain McCoy has preserved many of these traditions in a remarkable little book that is a joy to read, and an insipiration to a harried society that too often forgets the land it occupies. Being from Appalachia, many of these old legends and cures were familiar to me, but Ms. McCoy has attempted to reconstruct the reasons for many of the old ways; like telling the bees of a death. The book has certain omissions, and like many books dealing with folklore that has been preserved largely in an oral tradition, it will disappoint some, frustrate others, but on the whole, is a welcome addition to the genre. The book is not a definitive work, nor does McCoy claim it to be. But it is a lovely and lively discourse on a subject often ignored in the modern world."},{"Title":"Mountain Magick: Folk Wisdom from the Heart of Appalachia (Llewellyn's Practical Magick Series)","review":"Living in the Blue Ridge Mountains, I was excited to review this title. When I learned that the author is a descendant of the famous feuding Hatfields and McCoys, I was thrilled, as I have been a friend of an eighty-something year old Hatfield descendant for some years now. Some of my favorite Appalachian tales have come from his mouth, and memory.I have often wondered where the folklore he told me of came from originally. Many of those who settled in the eastern mountains of America had come from Scotland and Germany. Having these heritage genes running through my body I notice similarities to family history and I have often suspected that some of this heritage was responsible for certain folk healing and beliefs found in Appalachian ways. \\"Mountain Magick\\" confirmed these suspicions.Edain McCoy has uncovered and researched a wonderful collection of \\"Granny\\" wisdom and presented it in a delightful, insightful and useful guide to folk wisdom from the heart of Appalachia. Here you'll find a wealth of information, from how to determine what your baby's future occupation will be, to how to hold a Charivari (or Chivaree: an old American tradition of making a lot of celebratory noise at the consummation of a marriage.), to home remedies for everything from asthma to yeast infections (of course, these are cautionary and are not to be a substitute for a doctors care.).Because the Appalachian populations lived in virtual isolation from the rest of America for so long, their ways and beliefs have remained intact and practiced until the modern world intruded upon them. Edain McCoy has given us a rare glimpse into the magical world of mountainfolk. She has presented her findings, not with the comedic insinuations of Hollywood, but as a scholar and one who is proud of her heritage.I very much enjoyed learning about the roots of folk magick in Appalachia and some of its Native American connection in folk healing. I also enjoyed the lessons on \\"witches\\", not wiccans, and Granny Women. Weather watching, removing curses, bad omens, love and romance spellcasting: it's all in this excellent guide and entertaining read.If you ever wondered how Johnboy Walton's Granny knew so much - now you can learn what the writers might have found for their character research. In any case, you can put to rest the myths of the media and learn the truth about this large part of American culture."},{"Title":"Mountain Magick: Folk Wisdom from the Heart of Appalachia (Llewellyn's Practical Magick Series)","review":"McCoy's book is a good introduction to the Appalachian belief system of folk magick. Being from Appalachia myself, I was extremely interested in the subject and McCoy's take on the subject, since she is not a native to the region. I was not disappointed in McCoy's writing style or her ability to translate a tradition that dates back hundreds of years into modern language and importance. Highly recommend this book to anyone interested in any type of magick or Appalachian studies."},{"Title":"Mountain Magick: Folk Wisdom from the Heart of Appalachia (Llewellyn's Practical Magick Series)","review":"In a Graveyard at Midnight was the first title this book was released under. I found it at the local library filed in the juvinile folklore section of all places. I decided to check it out and I feel so/so about it. The major thing to point out is that I highly doubt, rather Im sure that mountain people have never used the now popular \\"magick\\" spelling for magic. The addition of the \\"k\\" was made up by Aliester Crowley, a crack addict with a big ego. That being said, this book does present some neat charms and folk practices. Unfortuenantly it also comes with typical Llewyllyn fare. My advice would be to buy it used."},{"Title":"Mountain Magick: Folk Wisdom from the Heart of Appalachia (Llewellyn's Practical Magick Series)","review":"Notice I said FOLKLORE, and that's what most of this book is (with some real magick), but the author tries too hard on implying this FOLKLORE into the reader's daily life calling it magick which is something I wouldn't reccomend considering some of the customs such as brewing tea from dog drool and the fact that it seems to me that most of it is FOLKLORE, not real magick!!!! The author also seems to add Wicca into the book too much and adds some of her own chants and opinions which I don't really think is necessary, but many Appalachian ancestors were Celtics with Pagan beliefs though. All in all it is a good book with some great information and some practical magickal ideas that you could try for yourself from the most interesting Appalachian region of the United States!"},{"Title":"Mountain Magick: Folk Wisdom from the Heart of Appalachia (Llewellyn's Practical Magick Series)","review":"A fairly decent read but has little information of help.

I love Appalacian history and was hoping for more usable spells and herbal information."},{"Title":"Mountain Magick: Folk Wisdom from the Heart of Appalachia (Llewellyn's Practical Magick Series)","review":"Yes, it has omissions, and no, it's not a definitive book, but it reminds me of my childhood in Tennessee when I'd sit on the porch drinking sweet iced tea and listening to the grown up women talking about haints and who was sick and what should be done about it and granny women. Even the things that are different than what I was told as a child are similar enough that I would guess it was just a different family tradition. This book was wonderful in reminding me of things that everyone used to know, but that no one remembers any more. Many of the old folks who had this knowledge are gone, and so many of the rest of us who might have learned, moved to cities and forgot.A lot of Appalachia was settled almost exclusively by Scots/English/Irish people, some of whom intermarried with the Cherokee, but very few of whom had slaves. Except for a part Cherokee great grandmother, I can go back in my family tree to the mid 1700s before finding an ancestor who didn't have totally English or Scots/Irish roots. And of course, he married a local woman and his offspring blended right into the general population in a generation.I remember when the dialect in that area was almost a separate language. TV reception in the mountains before cable wasn't very dependable. And that's assuming you had electricity."},{"Title":"Can You Sue Your Parents For Malpractice? (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Lauren Allen is in 9th grade, she has weird parents, an older sister that is perfect and about to move in with her boyfriend and a little sister who wants to go &quot;on the road&quot; as a comedian. She signs up for an elective at school on &quot;Youth and the Law&quot; and meets Zak, a younger man, and is torn between a former boyfriend who wants to go too far and someone who is a true friend. As an 8th grade teacher my students identify and laugh at what happens to Lauren. She has feelings and problems that reflect what happens to them. It is also told in a light-hearted fashion, so it doesn't bog them down with problems that can't be solved. What my students like is that everyone has a problem that needs to be solved, just like in real-life. The teacher prints an unauthorized newsletter, Lauren's mom is going to sub at her school, her father can't accept that his perfect college-aged daughter is moving in with her boyfriend and Zak is suffering ! ! the results of a painful divorce, as well as a move from California to New Jersey. Students and teachers alike can relate to Paula Danziger's tale of teen-age angst and the solutions that they wish would come so easily to them. It tells of survival, not of the fittest, but everyone - eventually everyone grows up. I recommend it to all who want a fast read, a chuckle and some genuine young adult emotions."},{"Title":"Can You Sue Your Parents For Malpractice?

Lauren is 14 years old and everything in her life seems very unfair to her, so she is thinking of possible ways to sue her parents for malpractice.

Lots of things happen to Lauren: her sister Melissa leaves the house, there's a lot of quarreling going on between her mum and dad, and she meets this new kid, Zack.From the beginning of the book you can see Lauren growing up, she's handling everything quite well and she learns how to cope with a lot of confusing feelings. She is also making up her mind about whether or not trying to sue her parents.Although this book is meant for young adults, I read it for educational purposes (I am 36), and I loved it.

I just thought it was funny. Onto the review.As a teenager, I've read a few &quot;teenager&quot; books. Now, being quite an open-minded teenager, or at least one that sees reality, I've found most of these books unrealistic. All with the same message: it's all normal, wait till marriege to have sex, be yourself (you think?), blah blah blah. The herione is always a troubled girl (well, in Then Again, Maybe I Won't it was a guy, but I'll get to that later), who thinks she's ugly and wants to fit in (therefore has troubles like- should I wear something I don't like to be hip? Go out with a guy I don't like? and ect), all go really well with their families- either they have their moms or sisters as best friends, and one best friend besides that. And usually, a guy that they like because he is popular. All teenaged books I have read, so far, are like that, expect Then Again, Maybe I Won't, which I also thought was a little bit more realistic than Judy Blume's previos attempts.And then there's this book. Laurn is 14. Her boyfriend, who is 17 (or was it 16?), and broke up with her because she didn't want to go all the way with him. He broke up with her for the school's lead cheerleader, also known as the school's slut (?). She lives with her dad, who moans about the nmoney his makes, her mom that doesn't work but tries out for quiz shoes and wants to become a sub, her younger sister who wants to be a comedian and is entering adolsence, doing stuff to her Barbie's and Ken's. Then there's her older sister, who's in college and wants to move in with her boyfriend. Then there's her school life. Laurn thinks it's so unfair and had no rights. She joins a course in law, and she and her class make a newspaper about the school. She also meets Zack, who is crazy, funny, nice, cute, sweet, and really turns Lauren on. Problem? The kids at school, who make fun of them. Then Bobby gets back in the picture. Hmm..I really liked this book. I usually do like these books, even if I whine and moan about them. This one is really good though. The way she talks about her troubles is believeable. And also the sex issue is treated just right- they don't act like they know everything, yet they don't hide from the topic. You can see it exists there, but they don't try to cover it up with code words. The bit where Zack and Lauren set a timer for making out was funny. They talk like some people I know talk- and this book is from 1980. Meaning, I wasn't even born. That alone is enough to impress me.I had a minor debate with myself if this book should have a sequal. I don't think that after all these yearsm Paula Danziger is gonna write one now, but still. I think a sequal would be cool, but since sequals destroy books often, who knows? You just have to enjoy the book for now, like it is..."},{"Title":"Can You Sue Your Parents For Malpractice? (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The publisher says this book is for \\"7 and up\\". Don't see that. I'm thinking 11 or 12 and beyond.That said, I'm not entirely sure where the appeal is here. I get it that the idea is for the reader to identify with the heroine's \\"teen angst\\", but everything is so mild there's not much there, there. There's also not a lot of insight and the character development is pretty predictable, so I'm not persuaded that a reader will get much from the book apart from the thrill of recognition. This book came out about 15 years ago and it was probably seen as pretty cutting edge back then. Now, it seems mild and unremarkable.That said, sometimes validation and the encouragement that you are not alone is what a teen reader needs and wants, and is enough. So, I sort of think of this as a \\"problem\\" novel, where the problems are pretty mild. And, I certainly think there is room for teen problem novels where the problems don't include vampires and werewolves."},{"Title":"Can You Sue Your Parents For Malpractice?

I think teenagers can really identify with the main character Lauren. She describes her life, her family life, her problems, etc. There are funny parts, but it's also sad sometimes. It's a good book for a teacher to read in class with pupils. There are many items you can talk about, like what happened to Lauren re. sex. Her boyfriend broke up with her because she didn't want to go all the way with him. Or about her family life; her parents quarrel a lot. Her father is very old-fashioned. Teenagers have to deal with these issues. What do they feel, or think and do?

This diary narrates a years effort by Che and his band and to survive in a truly hostile territory. There is no revolutionary doctrine here. The story is one of a daily struggle for food, water, shelter and security. As the months pass, the struggle becomes even more difficult as Che fails to win the support of the peasants and faces a more capable Bolivian military. Che's leadership in the face of mounting difficulties is extraordinary. Che remains focused on the big picture and the long term goal, even when they dont know when they will eat again. The diary shows Che as a true revolutionary and visionary, without resorting to propaganda. While Che's leadership is exemplary, his judgement is catastrophic. He is an expert on revolutionary doctrine, but in going to Bolivia he ignores his own advice. Bolivia is not fertile ground for insurrection. The people are not eager to hear his message. The terrain is extraordinarly difficult. He and his band are, in effect, on their own from the day they arrive. Finally, how could a man dependent on asthma medication hope to live for months or years in the wilds of rural Bolivia ? If Che harboed doubts about his decision, he kept them out of the diary."},{"Title":"The Bolivian Diary of Ernesto Che Guevara","review":"Che went to Bolivia because he (and the Cuban leadership) thought that the situation was ripe for revolution. It tells the story of how he built a cadre of fighters with dedicated youth who wanted to fight until freedom or die. He wrote this diary in the mountains, fighting the Bolivian army as well as hunger and asthma. Despite everything, he was always focused on the goal, not his own pain or suffering. He was constantly evaluating their situation, politically and militarily, and determining the next move.I first read Che's diary in the early 1970s because I wanted to learn more about him. At the time I thought it was interesting, but it didn't make much sense to me. This new edition is far superior to the Ramparts edition I read back then. The Pathfinder editors went to Cuba to collect photos and maps to make the diary come to life. This book includes accounts by surviving guerillas who fought with Che in Bolivia. There is a chronology and a glossary so you can understand who everyone was, where they came from, and what happened to them. If you want to read this famous book, make sure to read this edition!"},{"Title":"The Bolivian Diary of Ernesto Che Guevara","review":"These taciturn notes taken during the Bolivian guerilla campaign were clearly intended for Che's own use and not for publication. They reveal much more about the man and his motives than even the definitive Jon Lee Anderson biography. Whatever his possible ideological shortcomings, Che Guevara is shown to be insightful, intelligent, determined, dignified, disciplined, devoted, slightly detached and absolutely dedicated to the cause of peasant liberation from the oppressive military dictatorships governing Latin America and (unfortunately) serving the pecuniary and strategic interests of the United States as well as satisfying their own avarice. Additional commentary bracketing the very short diary is provided by fellow combatants. Newly translated and restored sections and a helpful chronology and comprehensive roster of participants define this edition.The apparently endless Bolivian expedition (actually, it was slightly less than a year, beginning March and effectively ending with Che's capture and execution following the Yuro Ravine battle on October 8, 1968) is reminiscent of the travels and travails in the Amazon of Spanish conquistadore, Lope de Aguirre in the middle 1500s. Aguirre, as depicted in Werner Herzog's \\"Aguirre, the Wrath of God\\" was in quest of El Dorado. As with Aguirre's plagued expedition, attrition of the very small force under Che's command (from drownings, battle wounds, nagging hunger and intermittent malnutrition, parasites and deaths) eventually cast a nearly surreal aspect on the revolutionary group. Of course, neither Aguirre nor Che found any sort of El Dorado: just misery and death. Che's succinct diary entries and brief comments from some of the 8 survivors, provide a brisk and effective antidote to any romance associated with rural guerilla life. The most complete supplemental information is from Inti Peredo's diary, written while on the run and in hiding in La Paz (he was later killed by the Bolivian military) confirm the generally favorable impressions of Che, both as a man and as a revolutionary. Peredo, along with other members of the guerilla contingent, suffered mightily. Therefore, if anything, one would expect his comments to be highly critical: far from it.The major shortcoming of the book is the failure of the editors to provide context. The diary notes reveal little (if anything) about Che's strategy and I was baffled by his tactics. Sometimes, the arduous wanderings through the Bolivian backwoods seemed counter-intuitive from both a military and political perspective. Apparently, very little interaction with the peasantry occurred and that which did often seemed to go awry. Thwarted assumptions regarding the revolutionary potential of the benighted peasants fail to douse Che's boundless faith in the \\"anti-Imperialist\\" class. Betrayals by the Bolivian Communist Party and captured guerillas fail to damp Che's spirit. Really, its hard to believe.\\"The Bolivian Diary\\" can be considered a \\"stand alone\\" book, but it is best read in conjunction with Anderson's biography and, most especially, Che's lucid and well-written \\"The African Dream\\" (the Congolese campaign). As Peredo reports, \\"People often join a guerilla force with little political education, motivated by epic exploits, heroic episodes, or simply by political-military intuition. This leads to a false idealization of the struggle and the life of a guerilla. Such a phenomenon is felt especially strongly among university students.\\" Given the ongoing adulation of Che, the \\"romantic revolutionary\\", apparently this is true. \\"Bolivian Diary\\" should be an effective antidote to at least that aspect of Che's legacy."},{"Title":"The Bolivian Diary of Ernesto Che Guevara","review":". .. . .What strikes me in this edition is Che's outstanding humanism. You don't kill or abuse your prisoners, because it dehumanizes you, teaches Che, who would be murdered without a trial after he was taken prisoner. The contrast in this excellent text between Che's modesty about his own difficulties and the testimony in the memoirs of other combatants of how Che suffered because of his asthma, how he pitched in doing all of the work is truly inspiring and illustrative of how you lead by example.

Dr. Grubb and Ms. McMann have crafted a basic, well-written book packed with information about syncope. This book is an information goldmine for anyone who has been to the hospital E.R. with a family member who has fainted. For those who have fainted, this book provides reassurance that there are things that can be done to mitigate the problem."},{"Title":"The Fainting Phenomenon: Understanding Why People Faint and What Can Be Done About It","review":"This book was an interesting read on the topic of orthostatic or autonomic problems and dysautonomia. It explained some of the mechanisms of these problems well and talked about some management strategies as well, although there is very little information on treatment in the book.The book title talks about fainting but there is also lots of information here for those of us that do not faint and instead have problems being upright and of near-syncope.The book starts off by talking about how often syncope or near-syncope problems are written off by ignorant doctors as psychological. This is of course a massive problem, and the author discusses it in a very compassionate and sensible way. Just because the cause of symptoms doesn't show up on basic physical exam or with basic blood tests, it does not mean it is psychosomatic - it may just indicate that more sophisticated testing is required.The author explains that psychological causes of syncope or near-syncope can easily be ruled out through tilt table testing and similar. Those without autonomic problems do not have the expected blood pressure or pulse changes during the test, and those who do have autonomic problems, do. Accusing patients of 'faking' just because you have not taken the time to educate yourself as a doctor, and to learn about how to properly test for these diseases is just not good enough! Misdiagnosing patients with POTS or NMH as having 'anxiety or panic issues' is also nowhere near good enough.These diseases don't have a 'sexy' reputation or very much media attention but they affect so many of us and desperately need to become more well known by our doctors.The information on what determines blood pressure, what causes and what worsens low blood volume and how adrenaline surges affect the body was useful as was the part which explained that half of POTS patients had a viral infection before onset, and that barbituates and opiates can cause orthostatic hypotension.Reading about ways to avoid fainting such as rocking backwards and forwards on your feet, or crouching so that the blood doesn't pool in your legs so severely was fascinating. Like many POTSers I had worked out these exact strategies by myself to stop from passing out while waiting in queues etc. through trial and error. I wish so much I had read anything useful about this condition when I was first ill! It is maddening that so many of us have to each work it all out from scratch by ourselves. Many of us can avoid fainting by moving backwards and forwards, crouching or fidgeting in this way, so long as we aren't upright for too long.The information on treatment is very brief. Low magnesium levels are mentioned as one cause of orthostatic problems yet the author doesn't even mention how essential proper magnesium levels are to everyone with any type of cardiac problem and how helpful magnesium can be in helping to mange the illness. Extra salt and water is recommended, but unrefined sea salt isn't specified, unfortunately.The book does make it clear that the drugs commonly prescribes to treat autonomic illnesses can cause real problems in some patients. For example, Midodrine should NOT be used to treat POTS where there is insufficient blood volume to maintain a healthy blood pressure (as in M.E.), beta blockers can cause fainting, as can calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors, beta blockers should NOT be used and may be harmful (possibly causing congestive heart failure) for those with orthostatic hypotension. Fludrocortisone can cause low magnesium and low potassium, and may increase the risk of congestive heart failure.Personally I would avoid all of these drugs. (I have tried Fludrocortisone and beta blockers with terrible results.) To me it makes a lot more sense to find and treat the causes of disease and of symptoms, rather than just forcing the body to do things it is too ill to do. Better to put some oil in your car if the 'no oil' light is flashing, rather than just smash the light with a hammer so you don't have to be reminded of the problem any more. That is of course just a personal opinion. Each to their own.Far better books on treating cardiac diseases, autonomic diseases, neurological diseases and others areThe Sinatra Solution: Metabolic CardiologyandDetoxify or Dieby Dr Sherry Rogers, plus books on diet such asPrimal Body, Primal Mind: Beyond the Paleo Diet for Total Health and a Longer LifeandMinding My Mitochondria 2nd Edition: How I overcame secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) and got out of my wheelchair.. Dr Sinatra refers to magnesium, ubiquinol (CoQ10), L carnitine and D ribose as the 'awesome foursome' of cardiac health. Vitamin C is also very important to cardiac health, along with enough of all the appropriate fats and oils. Dr Sherry Rogers looks at how to treat any disease by finding and dealing with the root cause. I have found both these very cutting-edge approaches as well as the books on diet immensely helpful. Again, just my opinion.This book tells readers that all those with the diagnosis of 'CFS' that have orthostatic problems, should be evaluated for them and if appropriate, given a more correct diagnosis. The author estimates at 20% the 'CFS' patient population that has orthostatic problems and says that a more correct diagnosis is important for these patients, as 'CFS' is untreatable and orthostatic problems may be able to be treated. These statements do not go even remotely far enough when it comes to describing the harm caused by a 'CFS' misdiagnosis, (and as 'CFS' is a wastebasket diagnosis, 'CFS' is always a misdiagnosis!) but are at least a very solid start for an author that is not an expert in this field. The book also gives an okay list of the neurological and other diseases which are most commonly misdiagnosed as 'CFS.'The book says that pre-syncope symptoms can last up to half a minute. I have felt like that for many hours each day for years, but I suppose one could say that is due more to low blood volume, and low blood pressure than actually being about to faint. It feels a lot like being on the verge of passing out though, and I wish it would only last a half minute!(I have severe POTS as part of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (a neurological disease similar to polio and MS caused by an enterovirus; the same family of virus which causes polio.) I have very low BP and high pulse (170 bpm +) with being upright too long or overexertion (among other issues). I'm 36 and housebound and 95% bedbound and have been so for around a decade. Because of this I am probably not a typical POTS patient? My POTS issues are part of M.E. My condition is now very very slowly improving, thankfully.)I'd have liked the author to make it clearer in the book that the advice to tell POTS patients to slowly increase their time upright each day is NOT only inappropriate for some of us, but also downright dangerous and may possibly lead to disease progression which may not be reversible. I'm very biased though as my disease is one of those where slowly increasing activity beyond the strict limits set by the disease has devastating consequences, I do realise that this may well not apply to lots of people that have POTS but do not have M.E. Having said that, I do not see a lot of graded activity and drug treatment success stories in the POTS/Dysautonomia chat group I am in either. I wonder what percentage of patients these things really work for? I am not sure it is as high as some claim.Overall the author does a good job simplifying the information in the book, and uses some clever analogies although some parts of the book were a bit unavoidably technical. This book is worth a read for doctors and anyone with any type of orthostatic problem.Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis"},{"Title":"The Fainting Phenomenon: Understanding Why People Faint and What Can Be Done About It","review":"The booklet is a good resource on fainting, its causes and treatments,including evaluation of the benefits and risks of the few medications available.

Characters are brilliantly developed including those that succomb...the author concluding that one victim of a grotesquely twisted neck had \\"suffered the greatest of indignities.\\" One minor distraction is the rare tendency to repeat. For example, the story takes place in the Fall so the adjective \\"autumnal\\" gets overworked as does the sound of leaves crunching underfoot.Otherwise, the writing is precise, scholarly and felicitous.

It is a wonderous book for the seeker, the Sufi (seeking the path of the heart), to reconnect with how loving God, the Friend, the Beloved really is and how much he cares for us in our long journeys away (devolving) and returning (evolving) back to himI find myself returning to her book over and over again, when I have questions about the nature of the soul, about how easy it is to become entrapped in materiality and how to move towards the way of the Christ.For many, this book may seem arcane or obtuse, filled as it is with a history of humanity's journey based on a mystic/seer named Edgar Cayce, who died almost 60 years ago. However, for those of us who came to the Christ precisely because of how he was 're'-presented in the Cayce readings, Kathy Callahan's account of our Origins & Destiny is a touchstone, a wellspring of joy and insight for me to use, in conjunction with other Scripture and practice, as a means of focus, of alignment, so we too can both 'remember and return' to who we were and, more importantly, who we will be, after experiencing and overcoming the earth.Kathy Callahan's book is especially powerful for me for several other reasons as well. She offers a role into the Christ that is truly 'Cosmic' in origin, providing a richness and opportunity for appreciation as to how He truly is 'The Way' for all souls, beyond any religions desire to bind His role to their participants insistence on how His reality MUST be. This is especially appropriate for those who insist that THEIR reality, their beliefs ARE the correct ones and brings to mind Rumi's admonition that 'once we have arrived back home, all arguments as to the various roads there become meaningless'. Kathy's descriptions of the 'larger' view of the soul allow us to transcend our petty differences, that are so prevalent at this level of awareness and provide us an opportunity to see that we are indeed, ALL of God's children and it is totally up to US, to begin to see that 'the Light', is indeed 'Our collective and individual Light' that must be reattuned to, not via power, but via His way, the way of Love.Next, although she doesn't explicity address same, Kathy offers some very insightful into the problems inherent in promiscious sexuality and how souls experience tremendous problems when their focus is on experiencing the 'pleasures of the flesh' and the entrappment/addiction resulting from their desires. Although it is almost taboo to even discuss the possibilities of universal laws in today's culture, Cayce's description of becoming so engrossed in the flesh, that we become lost to our true nature, that of beings of light, of souls. Instead, we risk becoming entrapped in the 'thought forms' of our own creation. Both excessive Promisciousness and homosexuality, may be seen from this perspective as an result of the devolution process, and for those who are 'enraptured' in seeking the physical pleasures, risks losing his/her soul.Although Kathy Callahan's book does not explicitly deal with these issues, they are having increasing social and political impact today. She does point out, from Cayce's perspective, the dangers against ANY excessive sexuality, however directed. She also makes strong note of God's over-riding love for us, a love so committed that he refuses to coerce our free will, even when we have become entrapped in the earth. Instead, he sent His Son, to show us the way home.For those who seek a 'deeper path' than offered in what is contained in much of modern scripture and the nominative modern Christian paradigm, I heartily recommend Dr. Callahan's book as a ready reference for our return. As a therapist, I have discovered that ALL problems presented by client's are ultimately spiritual.

There is a Christian flavour throughout the book with many quotes from the New Testamente. This would have to be taken with a grain of salt, especially after having read Burton Mack's excellent book The Lost Gospel: The Book of Q and Christian Origins, where he raises serious and valid questions to the historicalness of the New Testament.For any student of the 4'th way I would recommend reading this series of books, but be prepared that it takes more stamina to read as it to me has a more theoretical flavour than Ouspensky's book mentioned above."},{"Title":"Gnosis Book Three, the Esoteric Cycle: Study and Commentaries on the Esoteric Tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy","review":"I bought this book for a friend who really wanted it.

I learned more from the tangents than I did about direct, transcendent C Influences (The importance of zero and that Demiurge means craftsman). And the 4th Way stuff I did happen to encounter eschewed the micro-cosmic individual struggle type of Work which, I believe, most students require. Instead, Mouravieff gives us his heavy handed approach to a global government, some kind of one human, one vote deal. Basically, a benevolent, democratic, and conscious New World Order.Theorizing is one thing, and Gurdjieff, Ouspensky, Nicoll, and other 4th Way Masters gave precious little time, space, and energy to imagining a specific human civilization of the future. That's probably a good thing, because Book III goes overboard with announcing a potential age of the Holy Spirit forged by our children, guided by Fourth Way teaching, and influenced by the third absolute eternal galaxy of the seventh universe, according to the Mesa-Octave of B flat (see figure 111).Lots of biblical passages and explanations of biblical passages. Mouravieff refers back to his previous books quite a bit. That's good if the original point pertains to the Work. Not so good if it's an excuse to come at the 4th Way from the backside of the Sly Man's not-very-shortcut. Oh, and there's some superfluous yammering about the 5th Way being the union of perfect romantic love between two students of the Work... or whatever.Fortunately, it's not all useless. I underlined some interesting bits such as, \\"Thus the phenomenal world accessible to us is only part of the whole. The remainder is hidden from us because of our total incapacity to imagine it.\\" (Very Lovecraftian!!!) Or that external contemplation simultaneously accompanied by introspection is necessary for Self-Remembering. Nothing earth-shattering, but it keeps certain things at the forefront of one's mind.Ultimately, this is not at all essential for the seeker of esoteric wisdom. For those who really liked Books I and II, number III is barely worth reading. I assumed (blindly hoped, really) that the Esoteric Cycle would culminate in a revelation of practical Fourth Way gems glittering with such strange angles that my conception of the Work might be forever altered! Nope.

It is a more complete version of the Fourth Way as taught by Gurdjieff, however far from a complete transmission of facts about the world and past and present events.Although there are two great faults with this expose - Mouravieffs lean towards religious gloss and his relationship to the Synargist Movement.For a more complete study of the esoteric past and present a sugestion for further study for seekers of truths is:The Secret History of the World and how to get out alive - Laura Knight-Jakczyk"},{"Title":"Wesley Country: A Pictorial History Based On John Wesley's Journal","review":"This is an excellent book for its intended purpose, the coffee table.

Reading Hennessee's well-researched and balanced account of Betty's life and times, allowed me to reconnect with a special time and era to all women (at least white, middle class women!) It is fascinating to know Betty with all her contradictions exposed; her feelings of being marginalized and excluded, her need for recognition and acknowledgement ( especially from men), and inability to connect with her own spirituality and aging. Equally amazing is the fact that Betty's Feminine Mystique took feminism mainstream, but failed to acknowledge patriarchy as the root cause of the unspoken dissatisfaction and yearning of American women. Also of interest are accounts of &quot;behind the scenes&quot; maneuvers at key events in the Feminist Movement, highlighing the rivalry between Friedan, Gloria Steinem, and others. One can only hope that both women and men are learning new ways of being and can move to behaviors embracing a partnership model rather than a dominator model as we approach the new millenium."},{"Title":"Betty Friedan: Her Life","review":"This is a disappointing biography of the Second Wave feminist pioneer, Betty Friedan. Its author spends so much time making insulting and belittling remarks about Friedan's behavior, clothing, relationships, lifestyle, etc., that the reader begins to wonder if it is a deliberate and underhanded attempt to discredit the feminist leader. The biographer apparently spent a great deal of time interviewing all of Friedan's past acquaintances, trying to cull out unpleasantries and dirty laundry. Everything negative that happens in Friedan's lifetime is blamed on personal shortcomings of Friedan. This is not a credible biography. Instead, I would suggest reading Friedan's own recent memoir of her life, _Life So Far_. Anyone who has read any of Friedan's books (_Feminine Mystique_, _It Changed My Life_, _Fountain of Age_) and been impressed with this great woman's strong voice for women's rights, and her extraordinarily powerful messages, will have difficulty with the negativity that mars this second rate book.

The ageless keepers of the G.R.A.I.L influence major world events and world leaders from early in recorded history, from the Russian revolution, to the rise of Hitler and beyond. McLaughlin writes with an easy authority. And the plot moves quickly and decisively. Frankly, I thought the relationships in DA VINCI CODE were its weakest element. In G.R.A.I.L., enduring friendships hold the book together.

No.I've been reading \\"The Joy of Knitting\\" a chapter at a time and really enjoying it. The book consists of twelve chapters.

While this book isn't a total guide to knitting, that's not a drawback. There are plenty of other all-inclusive how-to books (Vogue's Guide to Knitting, Knitting Without Tears, and Knitting in Plain English are my three basic reference works)and there's always your friendly local knitting shop for hands-on assistance. Really, The Joy of Knitting fills another niche: it provides some basic instruction, a few simple projects to give you a push to get started, and quite of bit of information and encouragement. I've been knitting off and on for a number of years, but would classify myself as a beginner (more enthusiasm than skill). This book got me going again - it reminded me of why I began knitting in the first place and why I enjoy it. I knit for my own pleasure (for the joy of creating something); I knit for the pleasure of those I love (thinking of them while I'm working on the project and reveling in their amazement over the finished piece); I knit to feel a part of history (following in the footsteps of my mother and grandmothers); and I knit because I'm part of a larger community of (mostly) women around the world who knit for all these reasons and more. The Joy of Knitting brought this all home to me and rekindled my interest in this wonderful form of self-expression. Get a copy for yourself (and your child?) and see how easy and pleasurable knitting can be. Give a copy to someone you love. Who knows: your thanks just might be a hand-knitted Mobius scarf!"},{"Title":"The Joy Of Knitting: Texture, Color, Design, And The Global Knitting Circle","review":"The Joy of Knitting is well-written and interesting, but repetitive if you have read Elizabeth Zimmerman's books or The Social History of Knitting. Many of the techniques are clearly EZ's (i-cord, for example) but not as clearly credited to her.For the beginning knitter, this would be one of the best possible books you could choose, providing a mix of history, technique, and inspiration.If you have a shelf full of books, or have knitted for decades, this might not be your best choice.Either way, I wish her lovely shop were in my neighborhood!"},{"Title":"The Joy Of Knitting: Texture, Color, Design, And The Global Knitting Circle","review":"Novice and experienced knitters alike should immediately add \\"The Joy of Knitting\\" to their bookshelves! \\"Joy\\" is not a pattern book, although it does contain patterns at the end of each chapter, but rather a compilation of observations (many humorous), anecdotes, advice and tips on nearly every subject that a knitter needs to know: different fibers, use of color in knitting, knitting gifts for others, how to begin designing your own patterns, a brief history of knitting, and more. Lisa Myers, in addition to being a savvy businesswoman (she owns Rosie's Yarn Cellar, a wonderful knitting shop in Philadelphia)is a darn good writer, too. Her explanation of the seductive qualities of yarn-buying will make anyone with a yarn stash chuckle knowingly, and the book is full of similarly pithy observations. Her excellent advice about the technical aspects of knitting, interspersed throughout, makes me wish I had read this book many years ago - I would have saved myself much ripping out and angst over various unsuccessful projects! It's a rare pleasure to read a book by someone who is as knowledgeable and enthusiastic about knitting, and who so intelligently and steadfastly demonstrates why knitting is both an art AND a craft."},{"Title":"The Joy Of Knitting: Texture, Color, Design, And The Global Knitting Circle","review":"This book is a great resource for those of us interested in the history of knitting, the feel of knitting, the type of fibers used, and much more information.

It isn't a travelogue -- you won't stay long in one location or learn too many of the details -- but you will get the bird's eye view. She deals with charity knitting, a big area for many knitters. She deals with specialty techniques such as instarsia in a simple cotton bag. She deals with knitting in the modern age with patterns for things such as a palm pilot cover and information on web sites and knitting mailing lists.If you are a beginner or intermediate knitter, buy this book, read it to learn what you can this go round and put it aside. Take it out in a year or so and read it again. As you progress as a knitter, you will find more to learn and gleen from this book. You won't get tired of it any time soon."},{"Title":"The Joy Of Knitting: Texture, Color, Design, And The Global Knitting Circle","review":"This was an enjoyable book to read. It's not a pattern book, or an instruction book, but a book about different areas of knitting, such as: history, fiber, color, texture, knitting gifts, knitting in the world around us, etc. It is not exhaustive in any area, but gives great tips and inspiration. I could have skipped the chapter titled A Feminist History of Knitting, since I'm not a feminist, and don't plan on becoming one. Just a history would have been nice. But the chapter explaining how to modify patterns to fit you, or the yarn and needles you want to use, is very good. I need to read that one again.There is a pattern included at the end of each chapter, some easy-some not. They are a nice assortment. The patterns are for: I-cord, Mobius Scarf, Pillow(knit in log cabin squares), baby blanket, bias knit scarf, intarsia bag, watch cap, socks, beret and mitten set, palm pilot cover, multi-cultural mittens, and watch cap for preemies.Overall, an informative book to add to your collection."},{"Title":"The Joy Of Knitting: Texture, Color, Design, And The Global Knitting Circle","review":"If you can sit down and READ the directions and figure out how to do a pattern instead of seeing picture, this book will be helpful for you.

It starts out with Legato mudering some fools who dared to defy him, as usual. Then, Vash vs. Rai Dei the Blade, the best fight so far, followed up with some real conflict between Vash and Wolfwood.The only flaw is that the volume ends with an unbearable cliff-hanger that will make you shout a string of expletives.On a side note, that throw-away character at the beginning with the boomerang, was used completely differently in the anime series, as some bounty-hunter after Vash in the first episode. Weird."},{"Title":"Trigun Maximum, Vol. 2: Death Blue (Trigun Maximum Graphic Novels)","review":"If you're looking to buy this book, I'm assuming that you have already read the great first run of Trigun (Vol. 1 & 2) and the first book of the re-launch title, Trigun Maximum.

We watch Vash and Wolfwood at odds as they voice their different philosophies, and we witness the return of Legato as we've never seen him before. This volume gives fans more of what they want out of Trigun: great humor, heavy melodrama, chaotic action, and a spaghetti-western style that can't be beat.NOTE: This is a five star book, but because it actually \\"ends\\" in the middle of a fight I'm knocking a star off.

It changed my life. It validated what I thought I was seeing: the sometimes covert emotional abuse and contempt that men heap upon women, even when they think they love women.It's a long, thick book full of stories written by women about their lives with men.You are not alone.For some reason, maybe because the information in books like this is still so shocking, the feminist revolution has sort of stalled. Women have made a lot of progress in the working world: we can go into any profession and be very successful in almost any field, provided that we don't let marriage and children hold us back.Note that the two recent female appointees to the Supreme Court are unmarried, childless women, while the majority of the men on the court are not.

Sayers,Penguin Classics, 1957 (first translation, 1937). 206 pp.There seems little point in giving a work of world literaturea rating of stars as to whether it is better or lesser thansome other work of world literature, even of the same genre.The rating for this review is based on this particularedition and translation.The excellent qualities of this Penguin edition includethe \\"Introduction.\\" Sayers discusses this \\"earliest,the most famous, and the greatest of those Old Frenchepics which are called Songs of Deeds.\\" Her \\"Introduction\\"is divided into the highly enlightening subsections titled:The Poem; The Feudal Picture; Vassalage; Tokens; Chivalry;The Rules of Battle; Nurture and Companionage; Horses andSwords; and The Verse and the Translation. She says thepoem as we have it \\"would appear to have achieved itsfinal shape towards the end of the eleventh century.\\" Butthe events described in the epic took place in 778, and\\"the anonymous poet describes in detail the betrayal andslaughter by Saracens of the rearguard of Charlemagne'sarmy under Roland -- at Rencevaux -- and Charlemagne'sbitter revenge.\\"Perhaps most interesting in the \\"Introduction\\" are Ms.Sayers' character studies. She sees that in Charlemagne,\\"beneath this larger-than-life-size figure, we discernanother: the portrait of the ideal earthly sovereign --just, prudent, magnanimous, and devout.\\" She goesfurther and posits that in the way he is describedin this epic he even seems like an early medieval versionof a \\"constitutional\\" monarch. \\"Beneath all this againis the personal character of Charlemagne -- his statelybearing, his courtesy, his valour and strength, his deepreligious feeling, his friendship for Naimon, his warmaffection for his nephew and the Peers.... He ridesand fights among his barons as the greatest baron ofthem all.\\"Roland, on the other hand, in Ms. Sayers' view, has acharacter which is \\"simplicity itself.\\" \\"Rash, arrogant,generous, outspoken to a fault, loyal, affectionate,and single-minded, he has all the qualities that endeara captain to his men and a romantic hero to his audience.He has no subtlety at all; other men's minds are a closedbook to him.\\" This particular view of Roland makes himsound a little like a faithful pooch rather than achivalrous knight; and perhaps strains a bit of invectiveat Romantics in believing that they prefer no subtletyin their heroes.The final aspect which Ms. Sayers stresses is the \\"essentialChristianity of the poem.\\" \\"It is not merely Christian insubject; it is Christian to its very bones.\\" *** \\"And itis a Christianity as naive and uncomplicated as might befound at any time in the simplest village church.\\" However,it is a Christianity which has already made the concessionto the idea of \\"just wars\\" -- and killing for \\"the rightreasons.\\" Augustine and Constantine take precedence overJesus.This is a very readable translation and Ms. Sayers, whoreceived a degree in medieval literature from theSomerville College, University of Oxford, in 1915, doesit great credit with a readable, engrossing translation.Here is the section on the death of Roland himself (actuallyit takes him 3 full stanzas to die; 174, 175, and 176,even though it seems he has fully expired in the first --):Now Roland feels death press upon him hard;It is creeping down from his head to his heart.Under a pine-tree he hastens him apart,There stretches him face down on the green grass,And lays beneath him his sword and Oliphant [his horn].He's turned his head to where the Paynims are,And this he doth for the French and for Charles,Since fain is he that they should say, brave heart,That he has died a conqueror at the last.He beats his breast full many a time and fast,Gives, with his glove, his sins into God's charge.[174]-------------------- Robert Kilgore."},{"Title":"THE SONG OF ROLAND.","review":"This is \\"The Song Of Roland,\\" as Dorothy Sayers remarks in the introduction to this fine translation, is 'the earliest, the most famous, and the greatest of those Old French epics which are called Songs of Seeds.'This book, written around the end of the eleventh century, and recalling an actual disaster in 778 A.D., the anonymous poet describes in detail the betrayal and slaughter by Saracens the rearguard of Charlemagne's army under ROLAND at Rencevaux and Charlemagne's bitter revenge. Nowhere in literature is the medievel Code of Chivalry more perfectly expressed than in this masterly and exciting poem.This text includes an extensive introduction to the Eurpoean Medieval world and provides explanations on civil and military costume.\\"When Thierry feels the blade bite through his flesh,And sees the blood upon the grass run red,Then he lets drive a blow at Pinabel.Down to the nasal he cleaves the bright steel helm,Shears through the brain and spills it from his head,Wrenches the blade out and shakes it from it dead.With that great stroke he wins and makes an end.The Franks all cry: \\"God's might is manifest!\\"Yes!!!! Buy this book! You will not be disappointed.Five stars. Without equal."},{"Title":"THE SONG OF ROLAND.","review":"This translation of the Old French tale is highly entertaining, with flashes of poetic invention that enliven the medieval folderol of swords, steeds and deeds. The story concerns the betrayal of the brave but foolhardy Roland, his knightly companions and his army by the treacherous Ganelon. Sayers cleaves closely to the meter of the original Old French, which requires clever feats of circumlocution and diction. The translation has a charmingly archaic quality, in keeping with the ancient nature of the tale."},{"Title":"THE SONG OF ROLAND.","review":"The great French/Frank epic poem, the Song of Roland, stemmed out of an actual event. There really was a Roland--he was a nobleman of some kind. He and his party were ambushed and killed during Charlemagne's lifetime. But they were not fighting Saracen pagans. They were actually killed by a party of Basques. Also, Roland was not a major factor in this battle, but rather merely a participant.Somewhere along the line a legend sprang up, and it gradually evolved and developed into what is now this poem. The poem is entertaining to read, and is a great example of Frank thought and prejudice (in making the villains Saracens). In fact, the opposing sides in the battle are Christians and Pagans, typical enemies from the period in which this was written.This poem is epic in many respects, and is also tragic. Certainly Roland's flaw is his excessive overconfidence and pride (hubris), which prevent him from blowing his horn and petitioning aid for himself and his army. The battle sequences, which are very graphic, are reminiscent of The Iliad and the Aeneid, though this work does not measure up to either in greatness or epic grandeur. I have given the poem four stars in relation to similar works (such as The Iliad, the Aeneid, and the Odyssey). The poem is well-written and is an enjoyable read, but the poet was by no means as talented as the likes of Homer, Virgil, Dante, Milton, or the Beowulf poet. Still, this is one of history's great epic poems, and should be treated as such. Study of this poem is essential for anyone interested in the epic as a form of poetry."},{"Title":"THE SONG OF ROLAND.","review":"An utter epic that deserves to be read by anyone with an intrest in either literature or history.Although there is controversy over the exact historical accuracy of this classic poem, it is based around the Charlemagne's campaigns against the Muslims in Northern Spain, around the late eighth century.It reads like a Frankish iliad, real events draped in myth.The poem has it all: enthralling plot, colourful charcaters, perfect timing.....A gem!"},{"Title":"THE SONG OF ROLAND.","review":"I chose this version of the Roland over a later, clod-hopping translation I'd been bumping along with. What made that translation so awkward--besides the caesura that broke the flow of every line--was a complete lack of sympathy with the poem and the culture that produced it. From the way lines were rendered to the way the notes were written it was clear that the (Western) Medieval world was full of backward boneheads who just needed to put \\"Coexist\\" bumper stickers on rumps of their war horses.Yes, I know the surviving Old French manuscripts come complete with caesuras--Ms. Sayers told me so. But a good translator can take what is useful to their audience and leave the rest. That's exactly what Sayers does here. Rendering lines written a thousand years ago in accordance with an aesthetic long since forgotten in an idiom no one speaks is no mean feat. And Sayers does it with few wobbles or missteps.But what really makes this book purchase-worthy is Sayers' basic empathy with the material. Rather than do the obvious thing and roll her eyes at the irony of two deeply religious peoples hacking and hewing away at each other, Sayers takes you into that world and helps you understand it. Her introduction combines scholarship with a real enthusiasm for the subject. Her verse is fluid and conveys more than a little of what I imagine to be the poem's original drama. Like her contemporary C. S. Lewis, Sayers is known only for her fiction these days. But like Lewis, her academic work (including her version of the Divine Comedy, in terza rima no less) more than rewards inspection."},{"Title":"THE SONG OF ROLAND.","review":"A private feud gets in the way of a brave soldier's loyalty to his king. An epic battle between good and evil threatens the very order of things. Heroes are made and lost in a clash that sees tens of thousands of warriors slaughtered, their blood flowing like a river. The Song of Roland is perhaps the most famous French epic poem and a priceless piece of literature. This fantastic translation preserves the poetry and rhythm of the original piece, so the language doesn't get in the way. While you're reading, the intensely visual descriptions (you'll get queasy reading about the big battle) and detailed characters will pull you into the world of Charlemagne, and you can't ask for much more than that. Set aside some time for this one, you'll find it hard to tear yourself away."},{"Title":"THE SONG OF ROLAND.","review":"The Song of Roland (Penguin Classics)by Anonymous and translated by Dorothy Sayers tells an exciting story. While Charlemagne and his army were leaving Spain, his rearguard was attacked by Basques and destroyed. Two hundred years later this incident had been substantially changed into an epic story of the battle of the Christians versus the Muslims in Spain and the heroic exploits of Roland, the Emperor's nephew.Dorothy Sayers is best known for her detective novels about Lord Peter Wimsey. This work, published shortly after her death in 1957, gave her a chance to revisit her Oxford studies in Old French and produce a translation of this epic poem. Her introduction to \\"The Song of Roland\\" is wonderful! It is scholarly, interesting, and fun to read. For example, in her discussion of the conventions of this kind of poem, she notes that the last step is \\"the Victor's Boast.\\" She writes: Having killed your enemy, you encourage yourself and your men by hurling insults at his dead body. This custom is not altogether in accordance with English notions of sportsmanship...\\"Unfortunately, Sayers chose to confine her translation to the same complicated meter scheme of the original Old French poem, necessitating the use of alternate names for the main characters and many archaic words. While this preserves the rhyme scheme and rhythms of the original, it makes for a difficult translation that is not much fun to read. You get lines like:His great furred gown of marten he flings backAnd stands before them in his silk bliaut clad.Or:Where is your sword that Hauteclaire is y-clept,With its gold hilts and pummel crystal-gemmed?If you yclept your own bliaut, then you'll enjoy this translation! Otherwise, do yourself a favor - read Sayer's excellent introduction and choose another, less constrained, translation of this exciting poem."},{"Title":"THE SONG OF ROLAND.","review":"I'm teaching a literature class to guys 13-15 years old.

Really the product of four different authors, it is uneven but generally fascinating. The theory that 9-11 was a defeat for the US above all at the level of the spectacle is quite stimulating. I loved their critique of the peak-oil paranoia of the US left, but the explanation they offer for the war in Iraq--that capital again needs primitive accumulation--founders on the central question any explanation of that war should answer--why did Germany and France fail to support it, particularly given that the US had made clear that this was an important action to greenlight? The chapter on support for Israel is useful in avoiding Jewish-lobby hysteria, but is ultimately too optimistic in its conviction that Israel's status as the 'democracy of the Middle East' has faded. It hasn't all that much (at least in the US), and furthermore, Israel now has a status as a sort of Rambo heroically fighting 'terrorists'. Their comment that political Islam seems to epitomize the politics of Hardt and Negri's 'multitude' better than anything else is well-taken, although their claim that the global justice movement (which they of course champion) does not, like the Islamists, use the internet much is bizarre and wrongheaded. But ultimately, they fail to follow Marx in seeking to descend into the hidden abode of production. These days, that would be China. Understanding the recentering of the world economy in East Asia transforms our understanding of US empire-building, in ways that would require a book to clarify. But if Marxian theorists aren't going to clarify the significance of shifts in the world economy, who will? Nevertheless, don't let this deter you from grappling with the ideas here, which operate on a much higher level than most of the discussion on the American left."},{"Title":"Afflicted Powers: Capital and Spectacle in a New Age of War","review":"Modest effort at situating leftist thinking in wake of 9/11 and Soviet collapse. Work appears aimed at select audience familiar with postmodern concepts such as \\"spectacle\\" and \\"doubling\\". Readers unfamiliar with such esoterica should be wary since book makes little effort to clarify these and other key analytic ideas. Individual chapters range from excellent neo-accumulationist \\"Blood for Oil\\" to dubiously psychoanalytic \\"Future of an Illusion\\" concerning Israel-USA dependency. A key claim: that spectacle such as the symbolically loaded 9/11 has exposed empire's Achilles heel is an arguable claim at best, given wave of jingoism ay home and widespread sympathy abroad. Even so, the idea is worthy and deserves follow-up.There's some good background here, particularly to Islamic fundamentalism, while the accumulationist argument is both timely and provocative. Nonetheless, the work leaves too many points either obscure or underdeveloped, particularly those on Islam, modernity and terror. My impression is that the slender volume doen't quite succeed as either lengthy pamphlet or abbreviated book. Thus overall results are in basic accord with the authors' modest aims."},{"Title":"Afflicted Powers: Capital and Spectacle in a New Age of War","review":"An intensely thought provoking, well researched analysis that boldly highlights the imperial elements of the U.S.A."},{"Title":"Afflicted Powers: Capital and Spectacle in a New Age of War","review":"Usually cornucopianism (ie, there is no real imminent danger of \\"peak oil,\\" there is no energy crisis, etc.) is housed on the right; Peter Huber, Daniel Yergin, etc.: \\"free market\\" economists and engineers who are afraid that a coherent energy policy will mean government intervention, regulation, rationing.

And whether they are used in this way or not, those who use them ought to be aware of their meanings.This book does not make any strong points. And it also tosses words around a little too freely.There is plenty that could be written about Western society. Obviously, like all societies, ours has some problems. And one ought to ask questions about whether we are too worshipful of consumer goods. As well as whether our existence and happiness are too dependent on the overuse of non-renewable resources. If that were true, it could be a serious flaw in the way we live. After all, in the long run, which humans will dominate this planet? Almost surely, it will be folks who will be relatively happy living on far fewer resources than we Westerners do now.On the other hand, the world of the far future is very unlikely to be dominated by those with the attitudes of some present critics of the West who favor nihilism, destruction, and arbitrary and reactionary opposition to human rights. One of this book's big failings is that it does not dwell on these problems with the revolutionary Islamic opposition to Western society.The authors say that Israel has a \\"grotesque legally enshrined apartheid.\\" That's a good example of just tossing words around without regard to their meanings. Arabs live in Israel. Israel is practically a bantustan in the middle of a vast Arab Empire. Inverting the situation by calling Israel an apartheid state is simply a perverse misuse of words. Of course, the authors do not stop there. They dismiss Israeli self-defence out of hand, calling it \\"state violence.\\" And they refer to \\"an increasingly extreme version of the Zionist project.\\" That's a preposterous choice of words. Zionism is simply Jewish nationalism. It is based on universal human rights, and on the fact that if all humans are to have human rights, Jews (by virtue of being humans) must have human rights. That is not extreme. Of course, if Jews were greedy and laid claim to far more land than the share they could purchase if the entire planet were up for sale, one would indeed be able to refer to that as \\"extreme.\\" And my point is that the Jews have not been greedy at all. The argument about land is whether the more than 5 million Jews of Israel are to be permitted to live on 8000, 9000, 10,000 or 11,000 square miles. Israel is land-poor. The Arabs are the ones with 5,500,000 square miles, not the Jews.I think that getting rid of Israel would help no one. I think it would be an error to do as the authors suggest and have the United States join the fight against human rights in the Levant. And I think the authors' total mischaracterization of Israel casts further doubt on the scholarship of their entire work."},{"Title":"Before and After Christmas: Activities for Advent and Ephiphany","review":"I am a former art teacher with an M.

The content is broken into daily sections. With the exception of December 25th, these are not dated, but rather numbered, so that readers may skip around if they choose. Each \\"day\\" includes a Bible passage (one to three verses, all quoted in the New International Version), a reading and an activity.The readings cover a multitude of topics associated with Christmas: legends, traditions, signs and symbols, historical accounts and international customs. The author crosses denominational boundaries by providing stories from Protestant, Orthodox and Catholic tradition.The activities are always related to the reading. These range from crafts and recipes to songs and service projects. Each activity encourages family interaction. It also prompts readers to internalize the story with personal application.David LaRochelle provided the illustrations. Simple watercolors embellish stories and offer diagrams for various activities. As a bonus the book includes two punch-out ornaments that readers may hang on their tree or in a window.What I Like: This is a great book packed with information and ideas!

I like the inclusion of Scripture with each \\"day.\\" The author includes fascinating, lesser-known stories. I like that she makes clear distinctions between traditions, legends and biblical facts.

It has stories, activities, and crafts."},{"Title":"Psychiatric Dictionary","review":"As with the prior editions of Campbell's psychiatric dictionary, this version is comprehensive and thorough.

I hated to see it end because I know I will have a long wait for #9. &quot;Loyalty in Death&quot; will be out this November. I CAN'T WAIT. It won't be soon enough for me. I have really enjoyed every book of this series. If I could have given all of them a 10* rating, I would have. Ms. Robb, you are a GREAT, GREAT writer. Thank you for the fabulous reading I have done."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"I have all the death series, I just love them, I also reread them periodically. I eagerly await each book. When I could not get this book in the stores,I signed up for the waiting list at my public library.I waited for two months, then i finally got the call to pick it up. When I started to read it is was missing some crucial pages, the ones telling about the murder of the policewoman and how eve was accused, it also repeated some pages. How disapointing. But I intend to buy the book for my collection. I read every thing by nora roberts, she is my favorite author of all time. C an't wait for the next death book. When?"},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"It was my luck to find the &quot;In Death&quot; series while surfing my beloved Amazon. I purchased all eight books and started to &quot;devour&quot; them upon receiving. My! They are certainly delicious! The one thing that bothers me all the time is what should Eve and Roarke look like (Jamie Lee Curtis ? and ?) I love all the characters, good guys as well as the bad guys (they are bad for some understandable reasons). And don't worry, I trust Trueheart will have his re-appearance in next books just as Charles Monroe did. Look forward to the &quot;Loyalty&quot; and hopefully many many more to come."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"The combonation of Love and Mystery is what makes the &quot;DEATH&quot; series so captivating.. Thanks J.D.!!! Can't wait for the next!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"Whether you are Nora Roberts or J.D. Robb, it doesn't matter. I read the Ceremony of Death and I wasn't able to put down the book until I finished it. Now I am hooked. I got all the Death books except for the Loyalty in Death. Can't wait for it to come out of the press."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"The only author's I've read that had better action, suspence, and plot development in the last year was Connelly's 'The Poet' and Steiger's 'Alien Rapture.' In fact the great character development and thrilling action reminded me of Steiger's work and the police procedure reminded me of Connelly's work. Highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"while she solves yet another mystery. The In Death series is a delight. The eight novels and one novella allows the reader to learn about Eve and Roarke's past and watch their characters develop in the midst of Eve's job, standing for the dead. Whether she writes as Nora Roberts, or as JD Robb, this talented author is on my must-buy list!"},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"As a fan of Ms. Robb (Nora Roberts) for quite some time -- this is clearly her best Eve Dallas book yet! The characters remain true, yet with each book we get an opportunity to know them a little better. It is just like visiting old friends. The world she has created, and the people living in it is absolutely fascinating. Really -- no one does it better. This book will take you away, and make it hard for you to concentrate on anything else until you've plowed thru it! Then, you will be anxiously awaiting her next effort -- just as I am!!!"},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"Certainly on of the best of the Eve Dallas mysteries, though not for a newcomer to the series. Characters were introduced without any detail and numerous references wee made to previous stories. What happened to the wonderfully named Troy Trueheart? He vanished after a few chapters. I agree with other readers that the cover design is an improvement on the naked lady, of the earlier US editions, however that design is better than on the UK editions. They have a woman supposed to be Eve, wearing mini skirts and sun glasses! At least the person who commissioned the US covers gave the impression of having read the book. Finally, whilst the picture of life in the mid twenty first century is believable does Robb really think that there would have been virtually zero inflation between now and 2059. Prices are given either in credits (a good old sci-fi basic) or dollars, at prices and amounts that would be reasonable today!"},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"JD Robb's newest book is completely jaw-dropping! I have never been as hooked on a series as I am with these books, and each one just keeps getting better and better.

This book was a wonderful read, and I am waiting with bated breath for the next installment....hmmm....when will Eve have a baby???"},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"as usual, a nice easy to read book with romance and adventure.

Great mystery book, funny, keeps you guessing and has a little bit of romance."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"I enjoy all of the JD Robb books. Love the characters, especially Eve and Roark. I don't usually like things written in a futuristic time period but this author makes it seem believable."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"I'm sure this will be a great book. Everything Nora Roberts (J.D. Robb) writes is amazing."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"On February 27, 1999 I met J.D. Robb aka Nora Roberts at the bookstore owned by her husband Bruce. I am so glad I went because I got to get Conspiracy in Death a month early. I have already finished it and have been rereading my favorite parts again and again. I don't know how Nora does it but each book about Eve and Roarke just gets better and better. How is that possible? Conspiracy in Death takes away from Eve the thing Eve believes makes her the woman Roarke loves, her badge. Roarke proves to her that he loves her no matter what something we all knew but Eve is just starting to realize. Then seeing Eve fight to get her badge back and even occasionally fight with Roarke, make this book one of Nora's best ever. I, of course, will treasure mine always since it was personally autographed by J.D. Robb herself."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"I love all of the books in this series. I read the usual one chapter included in the latest book and was really looking forward to see how Dallas would deal with Bowers. I am really disappointed that Nancy O'Brien &quot;let the cat out of the bag&quot; so to speak. I would've rather much found out for myself."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"J. D. Robb's thrillers are tight, gripping, and futuristic stories, all of which should merit her an official Amazon reviewer who has more wit than to spill the plotline. As a reader, who has been eagerly anticipating the next segment in the continuing saga of Eve Dallas, I found it extremely tiresome, irritating, irksome, and annoying (add all the other unmentioned synonyms) that Amazon's reviewer, Nancy O'Brien, blabbed about what's, no doubt, a key line in Robb's plot. In so doing, the reviewer took a lot of the mystery out of Robb's mystery. There is a difference between an incomplete plot summary and a review -- Miss O'Brien's synopsis reads like a review, and her review mostly reads like a synopsis. Before she 'reviews' her next mystery, perhaps Miss O'Brien ought to learn to distinguish between the two."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"I love all the rest of the books she has done. This one looks like it is going to be a great read. I too am glad the naked woman on the cover is gone."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"Love the new covers. They got rid of the naked woman. Thank you"},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"I'm not usually so out of sync with the majority of reviews. I found that setting this story in the future didn't add much. The sex scenes made me laugh, definitely an unusual reaction! The protagonist is not sympathetic; the only way I know she's so great is the other characters keep saying it's so. The way Eve and Roark always know what the other is thinking, and know the right thing to say and do for each other is a bit unrealistic. The plot itself was rather obvious. The book is much longer than it needs to be. I got really tired of hearing that Eve wanted to hit someone every other page or so. The whole book was rather silly, a disappointment and a waste of time. Sorry to say."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"This is one of my favorite JD Robb books. The medical mystery is very intense and emotional. Enjoy"},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"This is one of my favorite series because it blends two of the genres I like most, fantasy / sci-fi and mystery. Nevertheless, I have found that in a couple of cases I feel that one of the books in the series is missing something. In this one the storyline was not particularly interesting to me, and I think that J.D. Robb did not progress as far as she could with the development of the different characters.Lieutenant Eve Dallas is summoned to a very unusual scene: a homeless man was murdered and his heart was removed with surgical precision. The killers, because the medical examiner determines it has to be more than one, used high quality tools and have to be experts in the surgical field. This creates a real problem for Eve, because it is hard to figure out a motive. Man-made organs are fully perfected and even though rich people prefer human organs, these have to be in prime condition and, needless to say, the ones from the victim weren't.Besides having to deal with finding the killers, Eve is faced with an uncooperative and outright confrontational female officer that will take part of Eve's energy away from the case and drive her close to desperation and doom. Also, when her investigation leads her to the Drake Center of Medicine, Eve realizes that she is very close to two of the members of the board: Dr. Charlotte Mira, her psychologist, and Roarke, her billionaire husband.J.D. Robb has a very special way of presenting what I interpret as her vision of a better future through some of the features of the world in which the series develops in the year 2059. For example, firearms are banned, there are licensed companions who can carry their business in privacy without getting in trouble with the law, and the Drake Center is named after the man who discovered the anticancer vaccine.As I mentioned, this is not one of the best books in the series, and it made me feel as if Robb was in some kind of schedule to release another novel for a certain date and had to go with the first idea that came to her mind. Maybe my slight disappointment is partly my fault, because I have been expecting five-star books in every time I start an Eve Dallas' mystery. This one falls a little short of the mark; but there is no way around it, those who have been following the series have to read it and hope that the next novel will get better."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"I limed the idea of the book but the author got lost in way too many details about the main character and her billionair husband. in my opinion their relationship was not the story."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"Conspiracy in Death. Another Winner! Eve Dallas has to solve a series of murders. The murders are perpetrated on the homeless and prostitutes. In each murder the bodies are found missing vital internal organs. Eve's career, and her entire self is placed in jeopardy. An irrational, bitter cop (Bowers) really hates Eve and messes up the case. This book goes further into Eve's past and you even see a soft side to her you hadn't seen before in the series. I really enjoy this series and it is truly amazing how J.D. Robb keeps these books getting better. Each one beats the last and they start out 'Naked in Death &quot;with a winner!"},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"In this latest installment of the saga of Lt. Eve Dallas, a homicide detective, is confronted by a series of baffling murders -- someone is killing the &quot;dregs of society,&quot; the homeless, prostitutes: people who the killer or killers think won't be missed. In each case, the bodies are found missing vital internal organs. The case is further complicated by a cop named Bowers who has an intense and irrational hatred for her. This book continues to reveal pieces of Eve's past. I hope that in subsequent installments we'll find out about her family. One immensely satisfying part of the story is Eve's relationship with her husband, the gorgeous, enigmatic, and passionate billionaire she first suspected of murder. I love the role reversal in their marriage, and how their love not only smooths down her rougher edges, but transforms him. I'm was grateful to see the redesigned cover. It's less exploitive and more interesting. However, the author and her readers are not well-served by sloppy proofreading. This is an ongoing problem which I hope the publisher will take steps to correct. New readers: please read the books in order from beginning to the current ones. You will be DELIGHTED!!"},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"Just like the other seven, I hated to put the book down. J.D. Robb writes a story that grabs you at the beginning and you can't let go. I came across a review of Rapture in Death and Naked in Death on Amazon and decided to buy the whole series this summer. While reading one story, it was nice to know that I had more to read, but now I am at the end and I am going through withdrawal. Can't wait for my copy of Loyalty in Death to arrive. I love the characters of Eve Dallas and Rourke and the subcharacters (especially Peabody and Mavis). You get so involved with them - like you know them. Great work Ms. Robb (Roberts), I hope you have a lot more of these stories planned."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"It's a New Year, 2059 in New York City, and it starts of with murder. Eve is called to the homicide of a homeless man, and finds his heart cut out with extremely precise surgical precision. Upon securing the scene she has a run in with a street officer, Bowers. As Bowers stirs up a firestorm of trouble for Eve, vagrants and prostitutes keep winding up dead, and missing organs. It's Eve's toughest battle yet. She is up against a serial killer, her job is on the line, and so is her life.This has been the BEST book of the \\"In Death\\" series so far. Eve equates her badge with her life, and when her badge is in jeopardy, she feels everything is taken away from her. In this book, we are allowed deep inside Eve's mind and heart. The people she has come to care for step up and show how much they truly love her. Eve's struggle is heart breaking. Roarke's struggle as he watches his wife fight for everything she believes in is equally as wrenching. I was in tears for most of this book.CONSPIRACY IN DEATH is a fabulous book. Out of 5 stars, I would give it 10! I dare you to read this one without a box of tissues nearby.JBogue...Specializing in paranormal romance and fiction."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"The fantastic \\"...in Death\\" series continues in this latest book Conspiracy in Death. Eve Dallas has to solve a series of murders. The murders are perpetrated on the homeless and prostitutes. In each murder the bodies are found missing vital internal organs. A cop named Bowers, who has an intense and irrational hatred for Eve, further complicates the case.The book also reveals more of Eve's past. The steamy relationship between Eve and millionaire Roarke continues to dazzle the reader with Roarke's unending passion and love for Eve. Eve seems not able to understand why this man is so in love with her, which only adds to the readers enjoyment.If you haven't read the other books in the series do. Start with the first one, Naked and Death, and read them all, they're all great."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"I noticed that most people love this book and this series. It seems that when there is a negative or lukewarm review, it is from someone who read this book as the first of the \\"...in Death\\" series. That may be the problem. I definitely recommend reading in these books in order, to understand the backgrounds of the characters and see their continuing development.I haven't been so hooked on a series since the Honor Harrington series in Science Fiction and the 87th Precinct in Mysteries. I do agree that the futuristic aspect is minimal, just enough to justify the toys that Rourke and the villains use.Everyone is entitled to their personal opinions, but mine is this is mag, absolute frigid!!"},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"J.D. Robb's &quot;Conspiracy in Death&quot; is brilliant. The writing is first rate, and the story is skilfully rendered and emotionally charged. This book absorbed me completely, right from the start, and I cried and laughed along with the characters.Lieutenant Eve Dallas of the NYPSD, the hard-boiled and emotionally troubled heroine, will win readers' hearts with her determination and compassion. Her husband Roarke, the dashing billionaire, is every woman's dream come true. The relationship between husband and wife has developed and grown throughout the series, and it has been an incredibly rewarding experience for me to get to know them. Eve and Roarke have an unlimited passion and tenderness for each other that will warm readers' hearts.In this eighth instalment, a killer is hunting New York's most helpless in the cold January of 2059, as a sidewalk sleeper is found dead with a perfect fist-sized hole where his heart once was. Lieutenant Dallas is determined to stand for the dead, no matter who they were, and she knows that she's looking for a killer with a cold and calculating mind and sophisticated medical training. However, a bitter and unbalanced fellow officer with a grudge is getting in Eve's way, and is starting to cause serious trouble for her. As Eve pursues her investigation, she suddenly finds her job on the line. Now Eve is caught between a fight for her career and a fight to catch a killer and bring him to justice!This novel mixes elements of mystery, romance, science-fiction, and police procedure (among others) seamlessly. Robb has created a compelling and action-packed tale that will keep you turning pages well into the night. The characters' triumphs and losses are palpable and the mystery is well thought out and exciting. I most definitely recommend this book, so buy it today!"},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"In this series, each story is as interesting as the last. Eve and Roarke's relationship progressively develops but they still maintain their individuality which is quite humorous at times and never boring. What really made this story of conspiracy in the medical/political world of hotshots work for me is the supporting cast of characters - Roarke, Feeney, Peabody, McNabb, Louise, Mira, Mavis, Whitney, Tibble - they all work together to make Eve Dallas a believable and heartwarming heroine and achieve the effect of a fascinating supporting cast to the storyline. The mystery involved in this story is based on a shady character with superior surgical skills playing God with people's lives, including Eve's!I particularly found Feeney's father figure role interesting and would love to see that developed further in future storylines.Thank you, Nora, for the great stories; you never seem to run out of ideas. Keep up the great work! I am waiting for a movie (or TV series) to come out based on Eve Dallas and company."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"J.D. Robb does a wonderful job with this series. Being a woman in law enforcement I enjoy the fact that Ms.Robb is very accurate with the law enforcement aspect. I also like the way that she shows how the job does for the most part interfere alot with the personal life. Great Job Ms. Robb keep it up. I can't wait for the next book to come out."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"Conspiracy in Death is the eight installment in J.D. Robb's very popular and entertaining mystery-romance In Death series. The adventures of Detective Lt. Eve Dallas of the NYPSD and her ridiculously rich and handsome, Irish billionaire husband Roarke continues to grow and this time the latest murder case to come across Eve's desk threatens not just Eve's life but also Eve's spirit and will.The story starts off with winter still at its height and the body of a vagrant found with his heart missing. Even with just a cursory look at the murder, Eve realizes that the wounds and technique used to remove said heart would take surgical skills that the usual low-level criminal would not have. This gives her the necessary clue to follow which would lead her to the highest levels of the medical community. To complicate matters is the badgering and incomprehensible attitude and harrassment of a beat cop first at the scene who seem to have held a grudge against Eve's successes both as an officer of the law and in her personal life.All these factors make Eve's job that much harder and things really threaten her will and spirit when those culpable of the murders manipulate things behind the scenes and make her a suspect in another murder. This new situation threatens to give her reputation as a police officer a black mark and that is something Eve cannot deal with. With the help of Roarke, Peabody, Feeney, McNabb and Mavis (even Summerset helps in his own particular way), Eve soon finds a way to work through all the distractions and gets back to pursuing those whose god-complexes made them think they're above the law.Consipracy in Death is a great addition to the In Death series. It showed Eve at her lowest and most vulnerable. For once her tough exterior is softened with situations out of her control and she must accept help from Roarke and those close to her when in the past she would never do such a thing. This story made Eve more human instead of just the superwoman, kickass cop she seem to be most of the time. A great eight book in the series and I can't wait for the next."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"I find the In Death series books an entertaining read. Conspiracy in Death has Eve putting together the pieces of a murder that eventually spirals out to span the globe. The twist comes when another New York City cop attempts to destroy Eve's reputation and discredit both her and Roarke. When that cop is murdered, Eve ultimately loses her badge and weapon during an investigation that names her as the prime suspect. J.D. Robb expertly spins the plot around the existing cast of characters while adding in Officer Trueheart and IAB Detective Webster to the cast. Another great suspense read."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"Love all J. D. Robb books keep you guessing all the time. Can't put the book down once you read the first chapter."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"Nora Roberts is a phenomenal talent. I purchase anything she writes as soon as it is available whatever name she uses"},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"This is one of those rare series that just keeps getting better and better. Just when you think you couldn't love Eve, Peabody or Roarke anymore you are proved wrong by the next installment. I loved every minute of this read and think it is one of my favorites so far in the series!"},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"JD Robb does it again!! I love that this book takes Eve back to Chicago...the last place she remembers being with her father. We get to see her struggle with what life would be without her badge and that Roarke is by her side no matter what."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"This is an awesome book as is the whole series. JD Robb is an amazing author! Would recommend to anyone I know."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"Conspiracy in Death was one of the least favourite for me out of the in death series till now. I felt like it dragged and dragged, and some parts were boring and unnecessarily too detailed. So this one took me longer to finish because I felt more inclined to put it down when it got too boring. In general this novel is ok, but not as good as the previous ones. Nevertheless, I will give the next one in the series a try..."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"I have been reading all of JD Robbs series.... and have enjoyed the future setting and the main characters. This book however had a more complicated list of characters than the others, but failed to deliver any surprises in the end. It was good, but not as good as the others."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"This series is more character-, less plot-driven than many of its kind. This eighth book felt a bit more so, not that the pace isn't driving or the story is in any way dull. It was also less gory than its predecessor, Vengeance in Death, and some of the others (not that the others are unbearable, but I did appreciate the break). It's tougher, emotionally, as we see Eve's identity ripped away and she falls apart. Of course Roarke is there for her--more wonderful than ever--with a full complement of remedies :>). Peabody, Feeney, and Mira lend support, with a couple of sweet cameo appearances of Mavis, and some others.I like that the series' setting is futuristic enough to make it interesting without dominating the story. I also enjoy watching the characters and their relationships grow and develop from book to book. While each of the stories does stand alone, if you don't read them in order, you'll miss that pleasure, and since it's really all about the characters, you might be disappointed in the mystery/police procedural plot as well. This book, in particular, wouldn't be the best place to start, that would be the first one, \\"Naked in Death.\\""},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"This is probably my favorite \\"In Death\\" book, and I have read them all (expect the newest one - rereading before I read it). Unlike some of the others, I felt she actually invested real time in thinking through her plot and developing her characters here, rather than just going off of a formula for how each character acts/thinks, as she seems to in some of the other books. Beyond that, the story was more interesting than some of her other In Death books, both the crime behind it and Eve's personal problems in the novel.That being said, this book does suffer from many of the same problems as the others in the series; in this particular case it's pretty obvious early on who the killers are, and the side plot regarding Eve's problems only partially makes up for that. Likewise, despite the fact that she does seem to put more effort in to not sticking to a formula regarding how her characters act and think, they are still a bit predictable - while this is much better than in some of the other novels, it is not entirely absent. The sex scenes, as always, are repetitive and boring - at this point I honestly skip over them.As with all of these novels, you're not going to find highbrow literature here - these novels are strictly \\"guilty pleasures\\" or what I call \\"throw-aways\\" (although I myself have read them more than once now, but they're my favorite guilty pleasure). I give this one 5 stars only in relation to the rest of the series in that it minimizes some of the flaws of the series. I enjoy the mysteries and I like and identify with many of the characters, so I continue reading. If you enjoy \\"easy\\" mysteries and characters that you can watch grow and change over time, this series is for you. If you want something intellectually stimulating, it probably isn't. Good summer beach or vacation read, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"I have been into the &quot;in Death&quot; series since its inception and have enjoyed reading all the books (some more than others). Conspiracy in Death is one of the best of the series. I felt that the last few books had been slowly backsliding, a writer too complacent in her writing, too caught up in all her other stories (under other psuedonames). With Consppiracy in Death, we are once again put back on the path of good writing and a good story.Eve and Roarke are a dynamic couple, with a lot of support from great secondary characters. I suppose that would be my only criticism of this story, not enough time with all our &quot;friends&quot;. Though I like having the story focus on Eve and Roarke (with some very steamy scenes) we have so many secondary characters who get put on the back burner that I wish weren't. One very important part of this story is that Eve's friends are there for her when she needs them, yet not too much time is actually spent with these characters. If you hadn't read her previous stories you would be completely lost. That is why I only gave this 4 stars and not five. She also introduces a new character (a rookie cop) who I liked, but never really saw again after the first few scenes. And Peabody...are we ever going to see her with someone (besides her current LC boyfriend)???"},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"This was my first book for the &quot;In Death&quot; series. .....though I have been intimately familiar with Nora Roberts since her first Special Edition Silhouette. This book has EVERYTHING that I love about popular fiction. Danger, suspense, mystery and PASSIONATE love. To have them all in one place is spoiling. The detail fascinates. The language, slang, props... which she creates in this &quot;future world&quot; make this a richly textured read. Of course the characters I LOVE the most. Each has its own consistent POV. I immediately went to my used book store to get the back issues. I have swallowed them as well.My absolute favorite part is the relationship between Eve and Roarke. It is up front and in-your-face. Their vulnerabilites are shown in many delicious ways. The best part, though, is the acceptance AND the acknowledgement that is not always easy to accept another....no matter the understanding.....no matter the love.Looking forward to getting to finish them all. AND waiting desperately anxious for the next book."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"8th in the Eve Dallas and Roarke series is the best yet! (And, I can't wait for the next one -- the taste at the back isn't enough.) J.D. Robb's (aka Nora Roberts) use of current situations to reveal layers of Eve's past are extremely well done. I want to know this woman for real!!! The pitting of Eve and her &quot;standing for the dead&quot; against the &quot;surgical serial killer&quot; is well-plotted and skillfully revealed. BUT, what keeps me coming back over and over (after reading her new adventure I always go back and savor the good parts in her previous books) is the relationship between Eve and Roarke. I now wish to give Ms. Robb the highest praise I can think of for this genre -- not since Peter O'Donnell put pen to paper and created Modesty Blaise and Willie Garvin has there been such a dynamic pairing -- AND this time we get romance!!!"},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"I do not know how JD Robb aka Nora Roberts does it!!

This is a great one that builds Eve and Roarke's relationship through a trying time for her - personally and professionally. They just seem to get better, those two. The story is fast, scary, sexy and fun - can't wait for the next one.I'm a cross-over reader from the science fiction and mystery genres - this satisfies two cravings in one book. Not to mention the fringe benefit of a lot of steam between Eve and Roarke."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"It is my personal opinion that this is the best of the In Death series to date.

And his name is Roarke."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but the interaction between Eve and Roarke just keeps getting better.

Ms Robb has a superior talent. I am glad she decided to share this talent with the rest of the world. I hope she continues in this matter."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"I'm just blown away by this entire series. It's amazing the way J.D. Robb (aka Nora Roberts) cranks out a new novel in the series every six months and yet they remain consistently well written. This book is one of my favorites in the series.In the course of investigating a homicide, Eve's career -- and therefore her entire sense of self -- is placed in jeopardy. Luckily, she's got Roarke. In this book, Eve's character becomes even more developed (you've got to admire her tenacity and her emerging soft side) and her relationship with Roarke is strengthened. Even the secondary characters are interesting and you're left wanting to learn more about them. Typically, Robb indulges her readers by slowly revealing glimpses into these &quot;minor&quot; characters in subsequent novels.Even if you're not a Nora Roberts fan, you should give this series a chance. My husband would never read a novel by a romance author but I gave him &quot;Naked in Death&quot; (the first book in the series) and he's hooked. We're reading the books at the same time and can't read them quickly enough."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"Nora Roberts writing as JD Robb has again given us superb characterizations from Eve to Roarke to Somerset to Peabody (love the Shebody reference). Her writing is so good and so natural that the terms chemi heads, sleepers, LC's are becoming second nature. She's created a world that seems totally believable. I almost hate to come back to earth when the book is over."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"I absolutely adore this series. Nora Roberts writing as J.D. Robb is fantastic. I believe that the author has developed the characters extremely well, and I find myself laughing at Eve or Peabody's reactions to the situations that they face. For those who like sci-fi/horror/fantasy, try Laurell K. Hamilton's, Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series. Both heroines are have indomitable wills, and the books will have you laughing."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"I just finished reading this last night and I fall more in-love with the characters with each book. I wish there was a Roarke out there for each of us! When is her next book, Loyalty in Death coming out? I'm already anticipating it. It would be fun to see Eve seriously contemplate motherhood and perhaps see more of her past lovers. We see a lot of Roarke's but where are Eve's? It would be even more fun to see him get jealous--perhaps just once--as we've seen in Eve. I just love this series. J.D.Robb has become my favorite author and I own every book in the series and can't wait to add more to the collection!"},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"My wife got me hooked on this series and I have read it beginning with the first book, Naked In Death.

I cried when Dallas lost her badge (temporarily, thank goodness.) It was so heart-breaking. Can't wait for \\"Imitation in Death\\" to be published! The stories get better and better!! Yahoo JD Robb (aka Nora Roberts)!!"},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"The killer has struck deep into the very soul of the citizens of 2059 New York. The brilliant surgical removal of the victim's heart terrorizes everyone. The police department assigns the investigation to Lieutenant Eve Dallas. Other individuals are murdered with an organ removed as if a professional medical practitioner performed the precise surgery, which is where Eve begins her inquiries.Instead of progressing towards uncovering the identity of the culprit, Eve becomes the focus of an internal investigation. In her mind, Eve feels she has done nothing except irritate some individuals with connections in high places. As she tries to save her tottering career, Eve feels strongly that ethically she must continue to work towards stopping a serial killer.J.D. Robb's futuristic police procedural series is one of the more highly regarded by sub-genre fans. Her latest entry, CONSPIRACY IN DEATH, is one of the better tales because the awesome author provides much insight into Eve's acrimonious past within one of the collections' better story lines. As usual, Eve's spouse Roarke adds much mystery, excitement, and romance to the book. However, this time, Ms. Robb uses Eve's past as part of a subplot that brilliantly blends into a terrific tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"I recommend the In Death series for 1 main reason: the relationship between Eve Dallas and Roarke. I'm a hopeless romantic. Although, I'll admit there are some things that make me role my eyes, such as: 1. The sci-fi element only because she has mass-space travel &amp; colonization, human droids, flying vehicles, etc. and the books are only set about 50 years from now. I don't see that as a realistic possibility. 2. There's a not-so-subtle liberal slant to her stories, such as a national gun ban, legalized prostitution, etc.(And Conservative politician or their supporters are the villains in more than one book in this series, including Conspiracy in Death.)The relationship between the hero and heroine though are the selling point for me. And in Conspiracy, Eve is forced to face her worst fear ... being without her badge, which for her equals her identity. It's a powerful struggle and makes this book worth reading. The rest, I can overlook. It is fiction after all! :)"},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"In this the 8th book of the In Death Series, Lt. Eve Dallas is thrown into the middle of medical world where the only rule is you never betray your own. In this book, Eve is not the primary investigator on the scene but she soon takes over for an incompetent cop who's out for blood ..... her blood. As Eve battles to find the killer she must also fight to save her own career against another cop. Will she be able to find the killer and save her career? Or will she find the killer? And lose the only the thing that's helped to define who and what she really is? A cop."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"I agree with most of the other J.D. Robb readers-she just keeps getting better. This book is revealing more details as to what happend to Eve when she was a little girl. Since I am an animal lover I just love &quot;Galahad&quot; the big fat happy cat. Summerset still dislikes Eve, but as time passes I think he is really starting to respect her and care for her eventhough she is a cop. I don't think Eve is cold as has been suggested by some other readers. She just has never been cared for or loved by a man before the way Roarke does. This book just like her other books in the series are a great read and I recommed this series. But I would suggest for any new reader of J.D. Robb to start reading this series with the first book. I love the way J.D. Robb continues to expand on the old characters and keeps adding new and interesting ones like officer Trueheart and Lt. Webster. PLEASE J.D. ROBB DON'T STOP WRITING THIS SERIES- ITS WONDERFUL!"},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"In this 8th book in the In Death series J.D. Robb doesn't disappoint her fans! I fell right into this book as it takes place only a few weeks after the previous book. & It keeps me involved in the story line. I recommend you to give this series a try."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"Another great story from the usual characters. These books are so easy to read, interesting, fast paced and with enough wit to keep it light."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"It all begins with a harmless vagrant found one morning with his heart cut out--surgically, with great precision and skill. When Eve finds out the vagrant not only isn't the first victim, but is one of many, she picks up the pace and soon finds herself the target of a handful of attacks. A troubled policewoman with a grudge wants Eve's badge and will stop at nothing to have it. A powerful senator wants the case closed. A deadly military droid threatens Eve and her family. And when Eve loses her badge, her carefully held-together toughness threatens to crumble as she's dropped into the fragmented, brutal memories of her childhood.The bad guys are smart, but there are a few things they didn't count on, however. Eve won't give up, badge or no badge, and Roarke's resources give her a lot to draw on. And her replacement, Feeney, is every bit as dogged an opponent as she is, particularly with Peabody and McNab racing to help him.If you aren't as much into Eve's personal story as you are the detective side of things, this won't be your favorite book of the series. If you want to see more bits and pieces of her childhood brought out, however, this is definitely the right book for that. As usual it stretches belief to have Roarke always tied up in the financials and to have some part of the case or cases be personal to Eve (in this case the uniform with a long-time grudge), but hey, the formula works, so it's hard to complain. The idea of a bad guy with a god complex and a fatal flaw of arrogance is a little overused, but again, it suits Roberts's formula well and is used appropriately.As usual, I should note that these books are for adults only (explicit and highly athletic sex included)."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"Another great book.

When the threats become personal and Eve is forced to hand over her weapon and her badge, her personal life takes a turn for the worse.This is a very emotional Eve & Roarke read, and highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"J.D. Robb's &quot;in death&quot; series just keeps getting better and better. From the first time we meet Eve Dallas and Roarke, we are transfixed by the way their characters seem to keep evolving from one story to the next. I also like the fact that even the secondary characters seem to have some development, and are not just re-introduced in each novel. I loved this book especially because it showed just how much being a police officer means to Eve, and how far everyone in her life will go to help her in her time of need. I know I'm being impatient, but I really want some resolution to the burning question of Eve's paternity, and where her mother went to. Great job on yet another book J.D. Robb!"},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"J.D. Robb! One exciting writer.. this series is great and every book is better than the last one. Power, Fame , Money &amp; the Medical Field is the pivot for this latest set of murders. So powerful is this baddie, Eve is fighting for her career as well as the lives of innocent victims. New cast members have been added, &amp; I hope to see them in the future, as we have Peabody ,McNab &amp; Monroe. Eve &amp; Roarke's life together is growing &amp; maturing, but still exciting, They still take time to romp.... lovely steamy romps! Such witty sparing."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"Just like the other seven, I hated to put the book down. J.D. Robb writes a story that grabs you at the beginning and you can't let go. I came across a review of Rapture in Death and Naked in Death on Amazon and decided to buy the whole series this summer. While reading one story, it was nice to know that I had more to read, but now I am at the end and I am going through withdrawal. Can't wait for my copy of Loyalty in Death to arrive. I love the characters of Eve Dallas and Rourke and the subcharacters (especially Peabody and Mavis). You get so involved with them - like you know them. Great work Ms. Robb (Roberts), I hope you have a lot more of these stories planned."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"NORA ROBERTS WRITING AS J.D.ROBB HAS BEEN LIKE A BLAST OF FRESH AIR FOR ME.I LOOK FORWARD TO ALL OF HER BOOKS ,BUT I CAN HARDLY WAIT FOR THE &quot;IN DEATH&quot; BOOKS TO COME OUT. HIGHLY RECOMEND-YOU WOUNT BE ABLE TO PUT THEM DOWN."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"I've been absolutely impressed with this series since it's inception. When you become completely involved with and care about the characters you know the author has done their job. Some people have mentioned the idea of Eve having a baby. I personally feel this would really alter the feel of these books. I think it would be more in &quot;character&quot; for her and Rourke to rescue other damaged children from the horror that they grew up around. I could just hear some smart mouthed minature Eve or Rourke giving them trouble right now. Kudos Ms. Roberts - keep it up."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"Someone is killing the homeless of New York, in the year 2058, and removing their body parts! As Lieutenant Eve Dallas unravels the mystery behind who is killing them and why (affectionately known as the \\"sidewalk sleeper murders\\"), she is forced to face an adversary who will stop at nothing, including framing her for murder, to get her thrown off the case. Torn between a love for the job, a pursuit for the truth, and fighting to keep the one thing that she REALLY loves, besides Roarke, her badge, Eve is stripped of everything, and for the first time in the series, we see Eve really vulnerable and hurting (even too sad to spare with Summerset, who we all know she has a love/hate relationship with). With her true friends support, Eve continues her journey in discovering the truth, no matter what the consequences. And we all learn how really important her careeer and badge are.If you love the \\"in death\\" series, you will love this book as well. You even get an opportunity to see Dr. Mira, Feeney, McNab, Peabody, Baxter, Webster (old lover of Eve's), and Commander Whitney. And I finally find out how Trueheart and Dr. Louise's characters are introduced into the \\"in death\\" series. [I must admit that I have not read the series in order, so finding out these things is always helpful]. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"I was wrong. Ok, I've admitted it. I always thought science fiction or futuristic type novels weren't my cup of tea. While reading Conspiracy in Death I realized I couldn't have been more wrong - I love this futuristic series!A homeless man is murdered and the case is assigned to Eve Dallas, since it's not a random act of violence. This man, Snooks, died when his heart was surgically removed by what appeared to be a very skilled surgeon. When Dallas digs a bit further, she discovers that this crime is connected to another committed in New York City where an aged LC (licensed companion) died as the result of her liver being removed. After even more digging, Dallas discovers a case in Chicago and one abroad that were all similar.These were not the result of black market organ sales since all of the victims were within a few months of dying. In order for Eve Dallas to find the murderer she had to figure out why these victims were chosen. The closer she got to that answer, the more nervous very influential politicians and doctors became.When she got too close to the truth, the villain had to put a stop to her investigation. The best way to get Dallas off the case was to have her suspended from the police department. This was a simple procedure since there was a conflict between the patrol officer who discovered Snook's body and Dallas. When that patrolwoman was brutally murdered suspicion fell on Dallas. Stripped of her badge and weapon, the very items that have been the heart and sole of her during her adult life, she has to deal with not only the idea of not being a police detective, but also with trying to solve this crime having her hands tied.The main plot was interesting but the villain was predictable and no surprise. There was excellent character development and as usual J.D. Robb (AKA Nora Roberts) draws the reader into the suspense to the point of not being able to put down the book. What makes this book above average and falling into the excellent range is the fantastic subplot of Eve Dallas being stripped of her identity as a policewoman and how she must deal with the various facets of that. At times, it was more intense and more exciting that the main plot.This is definitely one to read, as all of the \\"In Death\\" series books have been. Start with the first book when reading because J.D. Robb always has a couple of instances where she reflects on previous happenings. Or you can start with the first book just because it's the beginning of an excellent adventure!"},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"I'm reviewing this with the benefit of hindsight. Having read many books in the series since, I look at this one as a precursor to a later book, in which cop death is a very prominent aspect of the plot.This book merely prepares Eve for what she must face later on. It seems to me that is the purpose of the IN DEATH series. To watch more than just the EVOLUTION of Eve. More, to watch her GROWTH. While she might not grow that much in this one, per se, the seeds are planeted... and you have an EXCELLENT story to enjoy. You're introduced to many more details about characters that are still quite young to readers.I do agree that you have to read these stories in order, however. I inadvertently picked up a story out of order, not realizing it at the time, and didn't really follow it until I'd read the ones immediately before it. Going back, I realized that there's a reason this is a series. It must be read in sequence or you miss something."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"j.d. robb's newest addition to her on going &quot;in death&quot; series was fanstastic. I thought the way she is starting to show a more emotional side to eve is great. the way eve's emotions were portrayed when she lost her badge and how she had to turn more so to roarke for support was a great progression of a character who originally just saw herself as a cop and nothing else. I can't wait for the next book loyalty, that's the one thing i can't stand about the &quot;in death&quot; series is waiting for the next one to come out."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"Many fans of Nora Roberts may not realize that her &quot;Death&quot; series of gritty, futuristic murder mysteries is Ms. Roberts at her very best. I've read just about all of her books, and I think that the relationship between Eve and Rourke is not only the most complex, but also the most satisfying and fun to watch. The sub-characters are also entertaining and compliment the main characters in ways that only make them all more interesting. Watching gutsy Eve grow emotionally in her personal life is both touching and inspirational. This reader can't wait to see what obstacles she will have to overcome in the next &quot;Loyalty&quot; book. (Can't be too soon.) Nora Robert's strength as a writer has always been her characters. You believe them. You love to watch them. You wish you could meet them. In this series, it's particularly satisfying that the murder mystery stories are compelling, realistically well written and not as easy to figure out as some books in her romance/thriller line. (Although I've never read a Nora Roberts book I haven't enjoyed.) Thanks for another impossible-to-put-down book, and PLEASE, KEEP THIS SERIES COMING!"},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"Hi, I live in Bulgaria. It's a small country in southeast Europe.

Robb/Nora Roberts gives a satisfyingread. But more than that, Conspiracy marks the beginning of an upwards climb in the series. In Conspiracy, followed by Loyalty In Death and Witness In Death, Robb gives the characters we know and love new depth, making us, if at all possible, love them more. In addition, Robb begins to break away from what was threatening to become a formulaic plot, that of a mentally disturbed person who kills because he or she enjoys killing. She begins to give her villains motives other than insanity, and keeps the series from becoming an endless repeat of the same plot, predictable and stale. Conspiracy, Loyalty, and Witness are new ground, and I hope the trend continues with Judgement and the next books."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"GOT VERY LUCKLY WAS ABLE TO READ THE WHOLE SERIES IN ORDER FROM NAKED IN DEATH TO CONSPIRACY IN DEATH.

I'm in the midst of re-reading the series, and I really didn't want to re-read this one. Not because it's bad, but because it's so emotionally intense. But I'm a bit anal, so skipping it wasn't an option. To blunt the impact, I started out reading a chapter at a time, then switching to another book for a while. That lasted until about 1/3 of the way through the book, then I couldn't put it down.For those who haven't read the series, or who haven't re-read them often enough to be able to identify them from the titles, Conspiracy in Death has homicide lieutenant Eve Dallas investigating murders that involve the precise surgical removal of diseased organs. She collides with a disgruntled \\"problem child\\" cop who's intent on making Eve's life miserable. When that cop is brutally murdered, Eve's a suspect, and as such, has to turn in her badge.Particularly on a re-read, I cringed at Eve's every interaction with Bowers, the disgruntled cop. Eve was her usual abrasive self, made moreso by both Bowers's complaints and the roadblocks being thrown up by the local medical community, who don't want to believe one of their own could be responsible. But while part of me is screaming at Eve to try to defuse the situation, another part is cheering, because her actions are utterly true to her character, and she couldn't behave any differently and still be the same character. She's since (in later books) grown and changed to the point where she'd have reacted differently, I think, but at this point in the series, it's who she was.The loss of her badge, to someone whose entire identity has been wrapped up in it, is very well done, as are the effects of her slowly-widening circle of people she cares about and who care about her, and that's the core of the story--how she's broken down, and builds herself back up with a little help from her husband Roarke and her friends. For that, I forgive the idea that a cop at a murder scene can tell at a glance that a heart or liver is missing from a body.Other memorable bits include the introductions of officer Troy Trueheart and Dr. Louise Dimatto, and Internal Affairs lieutenant Don Webster, and Eve's reaction to discovering that Roarke had opened bank accounts for her when they married.Conspiracy in Death is the 9th story (8th full-length book--there was a novella just before this one) in the series, and while you could no doubt enjoy the mystery without having read the previous books, I strongly suggest reading the series in order, to get the full impact. Unlike some mystery series with static detectives, the characters in the In Death series grow and change throughout the series, and you'll miss that by skipping around."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"I can't get enough of the J D Robb Death Series and this book was another good one...I finished this one faster than I could get the next book. I read some later books and had to stop and go back and start from the beginning and its been fun following along with the development of the characters. I am glad that Susan Erickson continues the reading of the cd books."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"How do you find a murderer who takes a persons heart? Begin by looking at their skills of removal, of course.Eve is doing her best to determine who is killing the homeless and removing their vital organs, however, it's the skill with which they are removed that leaves her with the most questions. These people have been given anesthetic and are clamped as if this was a surgery, yet it's done in the filthiest of places and the 'patients' are left to die.Upon arriving to her first crime scene Eve is met with another cop who detests her. Never has she felt such malice from a fellow officer. Why? What's worse the officer seems out to get her and causes so much trouble that Eve's very life - her badge - is on the line."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"This is the first book in this series that I have read. I always have been a bit reluctant because I wasn't sure how I would like a mystery set in the future. I'm glad I finally took the plunge. Eve Dallas is an excellent lead character--a woman who doesn't take any stuff from anyone. While this is the first book I have read in the series, I can't think of a moment when I felt I was lost because I was missing something I would have learned by reading the earlier entries. Setting the book a half century in the future also was not a problem. I was really surprised by how little technology had progressed in fifty years. There was more sex than I was expecting, but I was glad to see a book where married people still show a great passion for one another. The plot was revolves around a series of murders where street people meet their deaths when key organs are removed, despite how unhealthy those organs were.

I found this book to be slow and I really did not care about the characters. The language bothered me and Eve Dallas just did not come across well in this book. I did not find this book interesting and for an 8 hour drive I fought to finish it. Nora is too good for this kind of writing. Read her Irish trilogy a much better choice."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"I'll preface this by saying that the futuristic murder mystery is not my usual genre. I found myself desperate for a book with nothing else around -- so I dove into Conspiracy in Death. The &quot;future&quot; setting was gritty, dark, cold and impersonal. The interactions between characters were abrupt and simplistic. Things did not always tie together logically. And, at times, I was almost embarrassed to be reading the book. However, I did read the book. In fact, I galloped through it. It gave me the same sense of complete &quot;escape&quot; that I get from an occasional soap opera or people magazine. I look forward to having a few more of the &quot;in Death&quot; series on hand for the Summer. This book was not a great work of literature ... but it did provide much needed and appreciated entertainment."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"Initially, I enjoyed the series, but after the 4th or 5th book they started reading like assembly line stories. (Deadline is near, better crank out another story.) I was hoping that Eve's feminine characteristics would develop once she didn't have to be so tough and on her own."},{"Title":"Conspiracy in Death","review":"Let me qualify the proceeding by saying this is the first (and will probably be the last) book of the \\"In Death\\" series I've read. I assume there has been a good reason in the past for this series to be set in the future but there certainly isn't for this installment. The future setting adds nothing at all to the story. At the same token it doesn't really detract either so I'll just let it slide.The story just isn't that interesting. There are no remarkable revelations of evidence and for the most part, you know the basics of the why's/who's of the crime and your just waiting for the \\"official\\" data to come in. I've read alot of police procedurals in my time and this is definately one of the least interesting plots I've come across.I find the protagonist to be thoroughly unlikable. Eve Dallas is completely butch. Ms. Roberts has confused strength of character and toughness with masculinity. So much so that female police officers are actually addressed as \\"Sir.\\" I don't think a paragraph goes by where Eve Dallas doesn't want to punch someone. Many other writers have written female detectives as tough without stripping them completely of their femininity.The dialogue is melodramatic and cliche - and not in a charming Raymond Chandler sort of way. The author attempts to impart to the reader how great her characters are by having the other characters tell them how great they are. It's a classic case of \\"telling\\" and not \\"showing.\\" - a big characterization no-no.This is one of the few detective stories where my interest in finding out the details of the murders actually decreased as more evidence mounted. This book is awful - I would suggest Michael Connelly (especially The Poet) instead. I can't think of a single writer I wouldn't recommend over Roberts. Very surprised at the reviews here at Amazon."},{"Title":"The western intellectual tradition: From Leonardo to Hegel (Harper colophon books)","review":"Despite its forbidding title, The Western Intellectual Tradition is a readable overview of Western thought from the fifteenth to the nineteenth centuries. Bronowski and Mazlish's book is an entertaining way to refresh your memory about that Western Civilization course you were forced to take in freshman year.The authors make the ideas come alive by providing a thumbnail biography of each thinker, placing him (and I do mean 'him') squarely in the political and social context of his times. This can cast an entirely different light on a writer's work. For example, Rousseau, who created a philosophy based on a belief in the natural goodness of man, not only sired five children out of wedlock, but sent each of them off to a foundling hospital!Bringing all these thinkers together in one volume highlights timelines that may have gone unnoticed. I had never thought about the fact that Shakespeare and Galileo were contemporaries. And how did England change within 50 years from a nation of baudy Elizabethans to one of strict Puritans?One warning: The text is laden with footnotes. A few provide interesting background on the disputes over the ideas described, but most simply give references and can be skipped by the general reader."},{"Title":"The western intellectual tradition: From Leonardo to Hegel (Harper colophon books)","review":"I would highly recommend this book to people with an interest in the development of modern thought.

However I did enjoy reading this book. I liked it because it made sense to me. I could follow the logic of how European society progressed from having the church dominate a person's view of the universe, to one in which an individual's own thoughts are just as important and as powerful as any others. It was like reading about someone growing up and realizing they don't need a parent around to tell them what is right and what is wrong. I read this book as a story about the beginning of an individual's freedom to investigate and discuss the world from any perspective without the fear of being judged as right or wrong."},{"Title":"The western intellectual tradition: From Leonardo to Hegel (Harper colophon books)","review":"Fascinating book, I am reading it for a college course but have already recommended this book to many friends.

I finally had to buy a new copy of it a couple of years ago, my old one totally tattered and falling apart. This book puts into context many, many movements and the political and economic forces that caused them. A really important book for those who wish a deeper and broader understanding of our cultural history."},{"Title":"The western intellectual tradition: From Leonardo to Hegel (Harper colophon books)","review":"This is one of those survey books, in the style of the learned, impartial treatise by the wise man. But here, we have Bronowski the wise but biased man. He says evolution is true, and that as time goes by, we understand it better and better. By contrast, he's got a problem with John Calvin, to the point of qualifying as something of a \\"Calvinphobe.\\" We'll get back to that; but first, as a survey text, this is popular at the college level.Bronowski here was intends to tie it all up, or integrate a Western world view: History, politics, science, achievement, and freedom. Bronowski delivers on this assignment, and convincingly argues that the matrix of the modern Western world can be boiled down and studied. Bernard Lewis of Princeton would agree, and Lewis has contributed to this subject by looking at how much of the Islamic world, by contrast to the \\"West\\" (anyplace controlled by Europeans), has hankered after the money and the technology of the West, but has rejected \\"Westernization.\\" Consequently, says Lewis, non-Westerners are left with modern versions of non-Western societies, and their people still want to leave to express themselves elsewhere.Bronowski can explain why. He has it down to two main ideas (by the time you hit his conclusion after almost 500 pages). First: The Renaissance launched the idea of developing your human personality, which means realizing the \\"potential of many gifts\\" and \\"fulfill[ing] these gifts in the development of their own lives\\" (Hardcover, p. 499) insofar as these are \\"special gifts with which a man is endowed.\\" (Id., logical reference to the Apostle Paul in Romans 12 omitted by Bronowski, but what the heck); and second: \\"the idea of freedom\\" (Hardcover again, p. 500). Since \\"human fulfillment is unattainable without freedom...these two main ideas are linked,\\" says Bronowski (somehow missing Paul's letter to the Galatians, articulating this about 15 centuries prior to the Renaissance, but like I said, we all have our point of view).Bronowski applies his two points in the first 400 or so pages: how human fulfillment and freedom have inspired and produced the scientific and technical progress, which in turn has produced leisure time unimaginable to all but a few rulers in earlier eras of history. Now the Islamic world will point out that this thesis conveniently starts 500 years after the glories and achievements of the Muslims were already firmly established. And we can also see how these same two impulses were released and also channeled by Christianity, 600 years before Mohammed. But isn't it a great thing to be free to express all of this in our own free time? And free to dispute it, in creative, progressive societies in which opposition is legalized, to achieve what Bronowski calls \\"this balance between power and dissent\\" which \\"is the heart of Western civilization.\\" (p. 501). The conflict of dissenting ideas overtaking established ones, and fulfilling some thinker's potential contribution to our machinery, art, navigation, or hey, maybe legal administration-is how \\"history is made.\\" People putting their stamp on ideas. Idea driven people stamping out automobiles; or compressing information to travel through glass fibers."},{"Title":"Greek Myths for Young Children","review":"Does your child look at you blankly when you mention \\"Pandora's Box\\"? Do they think that \\"Hercules\\" is a Disney-originated character? Even the most stubborn young reader will get a kick out of this comic book version of some of the Greek myths, and you will too when you read the hilarious little speech boxes of the cartoon drawings.This book introduces the following myths in a very basic bare-bones format, but without sparing the gory bits:Pandora's Box - starring Prometheus, Zeus, Epimetheus and PandoraArion and the Dolphins - starring Periander and Arion, with a cast of a couple dozen extras and some dolphinsOrpheus and Eurydice - otherwise known as \\"Don't Look Back\\", featuring Orpheus and Eurydice of course, plus Charon, Cerberus, Pluto and PersephoneThe Twelve tasks of Heracles (also known as Hercules) - this story also has Hera, Eurystheus, some Amazons, and a lot of beasts and monsters. Some animals were reportedly injured during the making of this story.Daedalus and Icarus - also with Athene and King MinosPerseus and the Gorgon's Head - Acrisius, Danae, Perseus, Dictys, Polydectes, Athene, Hermes, plus the all-girl groups of Gorgons, Grey Ones and Ocean Nymphs.Theseus and the Minotaur - King Minos, Theseus, Aegeus, Ariadne, and a Minotaur in a labyrinthArachne versus Athene - A weave-off to end all weave-offsIllustrated in vivid color and injected with humor, this book may not have all the myths, but will be enough to develop your child's interest in mythology. You can also make a note to try the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series (young adult fiction), which also introduces Greek mythology.Amanda Richards, July 2, 2006"},{"Title":"Greek Myths for Young Children","review":"When I first saw this book, before giving it to my son, I didn't think he would care for the format of it. Boy, was I wrong. I guess 5 year old boys have different tastes than their moms. We had to read this every night for months! Some of the comic strips are kind of gross, but of course, he loved that too. If your child is interested in Hercules, he or she will probably LOVE learning about all the other heroes (and villains) in Greek mythology. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Greek Myths for Young Children","review":"My daughter is 10, and loves this book. Her Grandmother gave it to her when she was about 5. She reads it with her Grandmother whenever possible. I notice it has helped with her reading a great deal. She will \\"act\\" out the characters while they read and gets very into the stories. Her favorite is Pandora's Box. The stories are a great educational tool, she is learning lessons and doesn't even realize it. She will ask questions and want to know more about different subjects brought up in the stories.I recommend this book highly!"},{"Title":"Greek Myths for Young Children","review":"This book was very funny.

I read the stories and my daughter (age six) chimes in with the text in the word bubbles of the accompanying cartoons. They ask lots of questions and they have strong favorites. I love that the language is sophisticated enough never to be cloying to adults, and the selection of myths is great. My kids have no idea they're learning the underpinnings of western civilization but I am sure they will benefit in the future from the things they are learning from this book now."},{"Title":"Greek Myths for Young Children","review":"I have a daughter who is turning 5 in two months and I wanted to introduce her to some classical stories that eventually she will resist learning about when she is in high school so I decided to pick this book up. I've been very happy with my purchase. she constantly insists that we read the Greek Myths. Its full of wonderful stories and the comic-book style art is great. When I read her the stories, I can see her mind really brewing up the imagery of whats happening. All in all its a wonderful historical matter prepared in a way so that four+ year olds can start to understand and enjoy.The only \\"heads up\\" is that most Greek Myths have a tragic ending so be ready to change the ending of these stories from \\"they died\\" to \\"they got real sick, but will return from the hospital soon!\\". Sometimes I give her the sugar coated ending and other times I will give her the death ending."},{"Title":"Greek Myths for Young Children","review":"Reason for Reading: All my readers should know by now that mythology is a favourite subject of mine, especially Greek. Plus I had also read Williams' first Shakespeare book ages ago when it first came out so knew what to expect.An absolutely beautiful oversized book, graphically designed to be aesthetically pleasing. The author/illustrator often takes a week per single page to design the gorgeous artwork. Each page is rimmed in a thematic border pertinent to that part of the story. The book includes 8 common Greek myths (though one was new to me, or at least far back in my memory banks) and sets them up in comic strip fashion rather than more common comic book/graphic novel format. Each page flows in lines of the comic strip with a written narrative underneath each strip and within the frames bubbles are used to emphasize the story and generally add silly humour to the character's reactions to what is going on around them.While the stories are brief, they tend to stick to the major details of the original myths, the basic plot lines are there and the important themes are kept in play. The violence is there though only shown with a drip of blood here and there and obviously dead bodies; this may be an issue with some parents. I found it all in good taste at this level as long as your goal is not to hide death and violence. The story that may have been new to me as I didn't really recall it was \\"Arion and the Dolphin\\". The others are very popular: Pandora, Orpheus/Eurydice, Heracles 12 Tasks, Daedalus/Icarus, Medusa, the Minotaur and finally the story of Arachne.A great read, thoroughly hilarious, but keeps the original themes of the myths themselves. Wonderful art and a great way to introduce children to the myths, exciting reading for older reluctant readers and a fun way for adult classicists to see the tales told in a new light."},{"Title":"Greek Myths for Young Children","review":"Most art historians describe the Greek gods and goddesses as the super heros of their time. Each had its own image easily recognized on ancient pottery and sculpture. In this comic book presentation of the stories of the Greek gods children can enjoy the stories in a current format with which they are familiar. The stories are well presented in amusing ways. My 3 and 4 year old granddaughters think this book is great. The stories are not too long nor are they complicated. Highly recommend for children of young through adult ages. A fabulous intro to the myths."},{"Title":"Greek Myths for Young Children","review":"I was very excited to introduce Greek mythology to my 6 year old.

My kids liked the comic book illustrations and the funny quips that are added throughout the myths."},{"Title":"Greek Myths for Young Children","review":"Greek myths are great stories. I've always enjoyed Greek myths. I first became interested in them as a kid when I saw CLASH OF THE TITAN on cable and JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS on a local tv station one Saturday afternoon. There's a lot of action and adventure in the Greek myths and usually there's a moral. Kids nowadays have a lot of other opportunities before them for entertainment, such as the Internet, video games, iTunes, etc. than I did as a kid. Still, Greek myths are powerful stories and ones that even young children can and will enjoy.GREEK MYTHS FOR YOUNG CHILDEN is a book that was illustrated and retold by Marcia Williams. Williams spent over a year illustrated the book and it shows; every page is full of playful, yet intricate designs and illustrations. The stories are told in a panel format similar to a comic strip or comic book. Many of the pages are very detailed and a child can have fun playing games with the pictures. For instance, the last page of the \\"Pandora's Box\\" tale has a picture of all these ugly, frightening things (such as a flying Jack-O-Lantern) coming out of the box. However, hope is also in the box and it's a bit of a challenge to locate and find hope amidst all the terrible things surrounding it.The stories in the book include: \\"Pandora's Box\\", \\"Arion and the Dolphins\\", \\"Orpheus and Eurydice\\", \\"The Twelve Tasks of Heracles\\", \\"Daedalus and Icarus\\", \\"Perseus and the Gorgon's Head\\", \\"Theseus and the Minotaur\\", and \\"Arachne Versus Athena\\". The book is written as a way to introduce Greek mythology to children, but adults can enjoy reading through the book and learn things, too. For example, I taught Greek mythology to high school students and I had never heard of the myth of Arion and the Dolphins until reading this book. Overall, this is a great book for kids. Besides the stories, there are all kinds of visual games kids can play with the pictures. It's a book that children will enjoy and one that adults probably won't mind reading to their kids."},{"Title":"Greek Myths for Young Children","review":"I LIKED THIS BOOK - I ORDERED IT FOR MY SEVEN YEAR OLD AND READ IT TO HIM.

I couldn't put the book down...as a purely mystery story it is good, but there are better. As a character study, more typical of her generation than many might admit, Belle seems to me typical of the great majority of the wave of Jewish immigration preceeding and immediately after the first World War who threw aside their European traditions..she wanted to become an American and lead a normal life, even if, in her case, this included becoming an amateur detective. Gabriel Appleman"},{"Title":"Death and blintzes","review":"Dorothy &amp; Sidney Rosen's &quot;Death &amp; Blintzes&quot; is a loving and very entertaining look at a specific place and time: West Boston, 1936, where somewhat-Americanized Jewish immigrants nervously explore a great new world. Sometimes it's the best of everything--great &quot;nosherai&quot; and fabulous movie stars--and sometimes it's a little frightening, as when a worker can lose a non-Union job through no fault of her own. Garment worker/detective Belle Appleman is a 36-year-old widow who enjoys her world but treats it with appropriate caution. When a fellow factory worker is killed, who but Belle would have the chutzpah to &quot;help&quot; the Boston Police Department find the murderer? This book is soft-boiled in the best sense of the word, although sex and violence are both treated in a matter-of-fact way. The novel's strength is in its honesty to a time and place which may well be forgotten by the time the next generation of American Jews comes of age."},{"Title":"150 Favorite Crochet Designs (Dover Knitting, Crochet, Tatting, Lace)","review":"I learned to crochet about 30 years ago, but when I started again about 10 years ago it was hard to find the old patterns.

It's a fantastic resource for delicate and drop-dead gorgeous crochet projects like vanity sets, bedspreads, dinner sets, edging and insets. I prefer these older patterns because they really take the skill of crocheting to it's highest and most artistic level.However, if you are used to following \\"symbols\\" instead of written instructions, this might be difficult for you.

The charted &quot;Eagle and Motto&quot; runner with its' patriotic E PLURIBUS UNUM detail could be the basis for a great 4th of July afghan done in 4ply yarn. Pick out a motif from one of the bedspread patterns and do it up in yarn. Tack it to a tired old pillow for some instant decor pick-me-up.

The designs are all fine thread crochet. Around 35-40 of them are filet, and these are the nicest filet I've ever seen. The most beautiful are the edgings and the floral designs. Many of the patterns are for larger items, such as table cloths or bedspreads, but all of these (excepting the filet)are made up of a smaller motif repeated many times. This enables the crocheter to choose a design and make whatever they want from it; one could use a tablecloth design for a bedspread, or a bedspread for a runner. The directions are as clear as any I have found,and the results are just spectacular. Yes, the pictures are in black and white, but as it is all white crochet on a dark backround, it is not very important.

It is such a relief to find a crochet book that isn't geared towards young, inexperienced crocheters or grandmothers with the worst tacky taste in the world. This book is anything but tacky; the designs are elegant, beautiful, delicate (thank goodness!), and many of them are expansive--if you want to do a large table runner, tablecloth, or pair of curtains, you can find those designs in here along with doilies and motifs. I made the beautiful rose motif tablecloth--it took me quite some time, but my ex-boyfriend's mother loved it and it is an excellent testament to the design of the piece that he and I broke up rather badly and she still has the tablecloth on display. Only thing I struggled with was crocheting in double crochet stitches as instructed instead of converting to trebles, as the beginning of the book instructs you to--the first piece I made ended up rather wide and fat.Incomparable value for the money and the results are works of art."},{"Title":"150 Favorite Crochet Designs (Dover Knitting, Crochet, Tatting, Lace)","review":"very nice book, with a lot of different items, many assembled from smaller patches. i absolutely love the runner with the peacocks on the front"},{"Title":"150 Favorite Crochet Designs (Dover Knitting, Crochet, Tatting, Lace)","review":"Love this book.

This book is very old-fashioned - from the patterns right down to the print. I dare to say, even boring. The designs are (as mentioned) from decades ago, so if you're looking for young, fun designs you won't get it here. The pictures are in black and white and the print is old, typewriter style. Out of the claimed 150 designs (I didn't check to see if there are really 150), only about 5 really interested me. Even my 67 year old mother remarked that none of the designs 'jumped out at her'. On the positive side though, the book is easy to follow with charts and abbreviation guides, crochet hook conversions and 17 basic crochet stitches. I will recommend the book for a beginner who wants simple designs, but for a seasoned pro who has done it all, something newer and more challenging is needed - unless of course you lost all your mother's old books and want one with old favorites for your home library :)"},{"Title":"Unprejudiced Palate, The","review":"I first read this book 40 years ago in college, happily soaking up its gentle and appreciative attitude toward life, as well as an early dose of cultural relativism. I learned soup-making from Professor Pellegrini, and gratitude, and something about what's important in life. I've often repeated his stories--the one about how to serve polenta to the family when you only have one sardine to go with it, the one about the crowd of boys on market days choosing which horse to follow, the one about how as a young man he horrified a girlfriend and her parents by following his own ideas about food. The professor's recipes--e.g., for soup--are more than a list of steps; they show the reader how to _approach_ soup. Once you know how to approach it, you can invent freely within the framework provided. Although it's the soup I remember the most, he talks about preparing many kinds of food, growing fruits and vegetables, and living life in a life-preserving and life-affirming manner. In many ways, the Professor was way ahead of his time, and as I grow older and relearn from experience some of the things about life that I first learned from him, I enjoy yet again the daring of the 12-year-old who came to this country alone from Italy, ate ham and eggs across the country, became an English professor, and put so much wisdom into this small book. It's a joy to see the book being reprinted and made available to a whole new generation of readers and cooks."},{"Title":"Unprejudiced Palate, The","review":"It's hard to believe this book was written and published in the '50s, when watery pot roast and martinis were America's idea of fodder for dinner parties. I loved Pellegrini's story about searching for olive oil in a friend's medicine cabinet, so he could dress a chicken--no one used olive oil for cooking then! You can skip every fancy book out now on Tuscan cuisine, trattoria cooking, etc. once you have this book, because it has the best recipes for risotto, rabbit, chicken, polenta, greens, cardoons, and more importantly, it makes an argument for eating well but in moderation -- a more sensible way to keep weight down without spoiling one's enjoyment of food. GARDENERS should also read this book, or his book, THE FOOD LOVER'S GARDEN. He writes just as lovingly about working in his garden as he does about cooking the foods he grows in it. Forget expensive organic produce at your local grocery and follow his instructions for a home garden to eat from, especially if you live in a mild climate like Prof. Pellegrini did (Seattle, WA)."},{"Title":"Unprejudiced Palate, The","review":"This is one of the best books of its kind ever written.Originally composed nearly 60 years ago, it reads as if it'd been submitted to the publisher only recently. His culinary opinions are spot on, and his writing style is wonderful. One of my all time favorites."},{"Title":"Unprejudiced Palate, The","review":"It's intimidating to weigh in here with a less than stellar review (if three stars qualify as less-than-stellar) when the likes of Jacques P&eacute;pin, Daniel Bouloud, and Mark Kurlansky have heaped unreserved praise upon the book. I've searched, and there doesn't exist anywhere on the web a review that could be interpreted as slightly critical. Everybody loves Pellegrini, and everybody loves this book.Pellegrini has a great voice. He is at his best when he writes about his experience as a poor immigrant coming to America and running smack into the Horn of Plenty. He was not impressed by the skyscrapers, the cars and the trains, the magnificent metropolis, but by \\"the food stalls; the huge displays of pastries and confections, the mountains of fish, flesh, and fowl; the crowded cafes, where the aristocrats sat beside the drayman in overalls, gulping coffee drawn from huge urns and soberly eating ham and eggs.\\" This voice finds resonance in most people, after all, what is an American if not an immigrant? He recounts snippets of his childhood in Italy, his hatred of pilchard (a kind of sardine), and a hillarious story told in one-up-manship about a childhood where one gets to bat at a pilchard hung on a string with his polenta. One infers that the hated fish is such a costly thing you couldn't eat it outright but only dab at it for flavor over several days.In other essays Pellegrini gives his opinion on what should be grown in the home veggie patch, what should be kept in the pantry, how to dress up a salad, how to keep meats simple. 60 years ago when America was hip-deep in the great Casserole Bake-Off, such advice would have been refreshing and vanguard. Today, where I could find a Wild Oats, a Whole Foods, a Dean & Delucca, AND a bakery run by an authentic Frenchman in one square mile in Kansas City (no lie), it seems trite and dated.Elsewhere in the book, the quaint voice, quaint like an old uncle who goes to the Moose Lodge and wears a bow tie, becomes annoyingly judgemental. He writes as if he was the first immigrant to come to America, the rest of us have been here forever clutching in our greasy paw a hotdog in one and a can of cream of mushroom soup in the other. The hotdog claims provenance from Wien and Frankfurt. In its authentic incarnation, it is immigrant food, and who can say it's inferior to anything else cooked up in the Old Country? On page 100, he ridicules Americans from turning away from organ meat, and then launches into a smug sermon about how his father used to make this killer omelet with chicken intestine! He chides Americans for being wasteful in their land of plenty, so wasteful that they don't eat chicken intestine. I want to find a person that would willingly eat chicken intestine instead of chicken breast, given the choice. Not everyone has fond memories of their dad making intestine omelet and basking in the glow of the family table eating said intestine omelet, which makes for fondness of intestine omelets. One, maybe two generations later, no immigrant child will ever chose chicken intestine over chicken breast, because intestines were cooked and eaten as a necessity by people who couldn't afford to be wasteful. It doesn't actually taste good, otherwise Charlie Trotter and Thomas Keller would be serving it in their restaurants next to the veal sweetbreads and truffled foie gras.There is a section where Pellegrini advocates giving a teaspoon of rum in the milk of children as young as three, and wine to 5 months old babies, to teach \\"temperance.\\" No doubt the author firmly believes in this. It is a howler. He gives some wine to his little daughter after some minor fall so that \\"she forgets her pain.\\" But then he observes that the accident rate seem to increase. She also prefers to dunk her toast into his coffee, where he dispenses rum without the measuring aid of a spoon. He also tells you to \\"avoid the bony steaks, such as T-bone and porterhouse.\\" Wait. What?As much as Pellegrini is right about American propensity for wastefulness, and our limited palate, and our preference for large birds like chicken and duck over teeny little sparrows and larks, a large part of this book is dated, and has little practical value for a modern cook. I still recommend it, though. Here is an author with a unique and entertaining voice, who pronounced 60 years ago some principles of food and life that are being embraced today. Read it with a cellar of salt, and judge for yourself."},{"Title":"Unprejudiced Palate, The","review":"I knew Angelo Pellegrini when i was a kid, and was frequently at the house for dinner, wandering in the garden, hanging out on the grape arbor covered patio, and helping to make wine...Even as a young girl, I found him fascinating, and to reconnect with him by reading The Unprejudiced Palate has been a great joy...Sure he advocates wine and rum for children, but Angelo's spirit lives on this in this wonderful book. Read it for the stories and the spirit...Read it for a unique perspective on American culture, read it because it will bring you joy and make you laugh...It made me remember how gregarious he was, how he and his family could sit in a restaurant, laughing and having the best time ever, not worried that they were too loud or boisterous...Can't we all just live like that?"},{"Title":"Unprejudiced Palate, The","review":"I picked it up based on the reviews from others.

Angelo Pellegrini's book is both a cookbook and a gustatory memoir. It reminded me of many foods that I have not had since I was a child growing up in southern Spain, including rabbit, and odd cuts of meat, impossible to find at the local market. This book is a must for anyone interested in basic cooking, able to find and use wonderful ingredients with minimum fuss. It is also a lesson in taking advantage of the bounty available in the US and using it to full advantage. It is a great read, funny and intelligent"},{"Title":"Unprejudiced Palate, The","review":"This is a great read.

However, I draw the line at putting rum in my 3 year old's coffee. I draw the line at the coffee! but booze? Very dated in a somewhat weird way, unlike the rest of the book which is timeless. Except for that chapter I am a believer."},{"Title":"L a Lore","review":"Los Angeles, like New York, is a city that people either love or hate, but nobody thinks it's boring. That is, unless your only exposure to it is reading the traditional travel guide with its listing of Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Disneyland and Universal Studios.Stephen Brook breaks out of that mold. An English writer who came to L.A. in the early Nineties, he proceeded to criss-cross the city, visiting virtually every major neighborhood, from Pasadena to Watts, from Beverly Hills to Long Beach. Not only did he bring an Englishman's fresh eye to the city, but he somehow arranged introductions to some of the most interesting people in it. In reading the book, one gathers that his open mind resulted in their opening their minds and hearts to him. He is simply a nice person, which comes through in his writing.The writing is succinct. Each of the 32 chapters consists of approximately 10 to 12 pages discussing a different aspect of the city (His breakfast with Carver Mead at Caltech, in Chapter 20 is alone worth the price of the book).Brook's forte is architecture. Los Angeles arguably has the finest architecture in America, and Brook provides addresses, the name of the architect, and a brief description of each building, yet somehow avoids sounding like a cataloguer. He is also strong in describing the various museums throughout the city, many of which I was not aware of.At the same time, he is equally at home discussing the political, educational and gang situation in the city.All in all, a fine book."},{"Title":"Hoochie Mama","review":"After reading the back cover of the book and learning that Hoochie Mama featured a black female detective, I was hoping that at the very least the book would be as good as some of the old 1970s blaxploitation classics featuring Pam Grier and Tamara Dobson. I thought that maybe M Gantry would be the next Sheba Shayne or Cleopatra Jones, however, she turned out to be so much more. Rather than telling a simplistic story about a two dimensional heroine defined by sex and violence, Preston Allen presents us with a multifaceted jewel in M Gantry who is continuing her development under extreme pressure. M Gantry wrestles with issues concerning sex and sexuality while hot on the trail of a serial killer leaving half-smoked Camels butts at the scene of each crime.Preston Allen has created a masterful mystery and thriller novel with compelling characters. His words take you by the hand and lead you into very uncomfortable places -- the minds of psychos which inhabit the pages of his Freudian nightmare. Allen uses the pages of his mystery to provide us with social commentary about hoochie mamas and sadistic fathers. He demonstrates how there can be chaos in the midst of order and makes us understand that religion in the hands of psychos can be deadly. We are left to ponder why one would kiss the dead and what prevents some people from enjoying a deep sleep.I could not believe that I was reading such a wonderfully crafted murder mystery by an unknown black writer. This is the kind of book one expects from Thomas Harris (author of The Silence Of The Lambs) or James Patterson (author of Along Came A Spider). Who is this Preston L. Allen?!? He has given us a chilling psychological suspense thriller that should become a best selling novel. When this book is made into a movie (they would be crazy if they did not make it into a movie), I think that both Pam Grier and Tamara Dobson should be given a part. However, I wonder who Mr. Allen will suggest for the role of M Gantry?"},{"Title":"Hoochie Mama","review":"... Then I ordered this book and read it in one night. He did it again, I kept repeating. This boy did it again. He gets into a woman's head like no male author I know. Better than Omar Tyree, EJD, and even ELH. I'm serious. I could not believe it. And this was a detective story, the kind I don't usually read. The truth is, I was not really interested in who killed who, I was like getting into Detective M Gantry, her sister, her father, her terrible childhood, and her lesbian affair with Shoneeka. HOT STUFF! That was off the chain as the young folk say. I was like, no, he did not go there! But he did. You finish a book like this, and the characters stay in your head for weeks. Months. That's how you know you've read a good book. When you read a book like this and Between Lovers by EJD, you get proud of our male writers today. They are expanding. They are brave. They are really looking at deeper issues. I love this book, HOOCHIE MAMA, and I still don't know who killed who. He promised me that he is working on the sequel to Nadine's Husaband, which he begun in Brown Sugar and the sequel to Hoochie Mama. I can't wait."},{"Title":"Hoochie Mama","review":"I did not expect fathers to play such an important role in a murder mystery entitled Hoochie Mama. Preston Allen sets the stage for his morality tale by asking the deeply troubling religious question: \\"How can the father tell us don't kill when there's all that killing in the Bible?\\" He then proceeds to present us with a lot of killing by deeply disturbed characters in need of a true father. In a wonderfully crafted murder mystery, Allen places a beautiful female detective, M Gantry, in the midst of an investigation involving at least \\"three little psychos.\\"Some of his psychos are possessed with demons and hear voices from a father figure. While his characters strangely quote Bible verses, we learn about child abuse, child neglect and child abandonment. Allen presents us with a surprisingly layered commentary on the social problems of absentee fathers and whorish mothers. One distrubed character points out that his mother sat in church on Sunday mornings, but had many different male lovers at night. He stated that the father saw all of her whoring through him because \\"He has no eyes but our eyes, no hands but our hands . . . .\\"When a father does show up in Allen's novel, we see sadistic abuse, which often results in murder, as psychos state that they \\"must do the will of the father.\\" One psycho sums up Allen's social commentary on fathers by stating: \\"If you're going to take the time to have children, then take the time to raise them.\\"Several self-righteous cops judge Allen's heroine as a loose woman based on her appearance despite her virgin qualities. This voluptuous, blond haired, chocolate beauty is the object of their lust but they dare not approach this karate kicking, gun carrying, top notch, homicide detective. It is through M Gantry that the murders of this chilling mystery are solved, and it is through M's father, Roscoe, that we get a glimpse of how a true father is there for his children. Ladies you will fall in love with M Gantry, however, you should get a copy of this novel for your men. This is a novel that any father who is a lover of murder mysteries should not miss."},{"Title":"Hoochie Mama","review":"When I went looking for a new book a few months ago, I knew I wanted something a little different, something exciting and unique. From the title, it was obvious this was going to be a bit of an unconventional book, so I bought it.Hoochie Mama follows the life of a female detective who appears to be wild with flourescent nails and lipstick, yet she isn't afraid to be &quot;one of the guys.&quot;The mystery itself is absolutely excellent. For a day I took this book everywhere, I just couldn't stop reading it. The thrill is top notch and the ending is both surprising, yet it all ties in well to the clues.The thing that struck me most about the book was the obvious talent of the author to take on a female lead character and express her every hope, fear or wish so completely. Her strength and determination are inspiring, her personality is lovable yet harsh at the appropriate times. It's a true credit to Mr. Allen's profession as an author that he's so willing to take on such a risk, while the well-known male authors of our time tend to only write about male characters.This book is a work of intense suspense, supreme fiction and gets in some remarkable looks at life. You can't NOT read this book!"},{"Title":"Hoochie Mama","review":"Looking for a good mystery? How about one with a black, beautiful, bold, sexy, smart Miami police detective named M. Gantry? There are lots of mysteries set in South Florida, but Preston Allen knows how to tell a story and keep you impatient to turn the page to find out what happens next.In the great tradition of Ross McDonald and Raymond Chandler, Hoochie Mama delves deep into the dark corners of family.This young author should be encouraged. His stories grab you by the short hairs until you cry for mercy. Mercy! Please, Mr. Allen, send us more M.

It is so good to be able to read a well written book, without the usual spelling mistakes, inconsistencies in the characters or plot and the use of the wrong word or spelling.Johana Smith, Author of \\"A Basketful of Rhymes\\", \\"101 Pet Peeves and More\\" and \\"Spiritual Warrior - Paris-\\""},{"Title":"Hoochie Mama","review":"I loved the main character and how she perservered against issues of gender and race in carrying out her duties as a homicide detective.

I thought it was some kind of sexy ghetto girl fluff, plus I had read Allen's sex story in Brown Sugar. Boy was I surprised. Preston L. Allen can write anything. This is a very good book! I read it in one night. I couldn't put it down. I am going to tell all of my friends about it.I grew up in Miami, so I know all of the places that Allen put the scenes in. The book tripped me out with the great style of writing and the ending. Surprised me again. I thought I knew who the killer was but I was wrong. And then ending makes sense when I go back and think about it. This looks like a book about serial killers, but it is really a book about how families need a father figure or the children (the boys especially) will grow up to be pretty bad guys.Read this book. You will fall in love with M Gantry. I guarantee it."},{"Title":"Hoochie Mama","review":"Expertly crafted, thoroughly enjoyable, a page turner. Allen is a writer in top form. Murder is M Gantry's business. You kill them; she tracks you down. But it isn't so easy when the killer may just be the troubled teenaged son of the man she loves. The danger, intrigue, and mystery are as good as can be in a book, to be honest, that I bought because of the sex; you know, Allen won me last year with his very touching erotic story in that collection Brown Sugar by Carol Taylor that all the brothas and sistas thoroughly enjoyed."},{"Title":"Hoochie Mama","review":"I am still trying to figure this book out. I tried to read it as a page turner, but was dismayed by how much nuance was escaping me. This book is not a genre filler to be read in airports or while waiting in a doctor's office. This book does not wow the reader with a clever plot twist, compelling hooks, sex scenes, references to popular culture, or contrivances of any sort. Allen takes no short cuts in writing this book. He does not trade style, substance, and mood for slick/comfy stereotypes to ease our reading. This book wows us with honest innovation on every line, a freshness that is both welcome and daunting. M Gantry is not a stereotype of anything you have read about, she the lesbian, not lesbian cop, with the horrid hair, wastrel sister, and linear brain. \\"The things are not coming together in a straight line,\\" she repeats throughout the book. Is this a metaphor for her dubious sexuality? She wishes her life could come together in a straight line, but how can it with the dead mother, ineffectual father, lesbian dreams, villainous boyfriend, and sinister new partner who, she discovers, is the cop who had sexually assaulted her when she was a minor and he was working the beat in her neighborhood. M Gantry is deliciously complex, and so the case she attempts to solve is subordinate to the reader's need to solve her. We read this so-called thriller to unravel the mystery of our protagonist. We read this book, not as a pager-turner, but as a literature of revelation and reflection. This is a good read. We turn these pages slow."},{"Title":"Hoochie Mama","review":"When looking at M Gantry, the first thought that comes to mind is &quot;hoochie mama&quot;, with her hair cut short like a boys and dyed blonde, but a hoochie mama she is not.

If a difficult case needs solving, she is the detective for the job.There is a serial killer on the loose in Miami and who better to put on the case than M?

M Gantry and her team were assigned the case until brass pulled her from it.With the unofficial direction from M, they proceed to work the case. Suddenly pieces are placed together and M wonders whether they should.I understand the author Preston L.

I've never read anything like it. Allen avoids all of the cliches in creating M Gantry, the hoochie mama cop, who must struggle with her own issues before she can solve the crime. The writing is top-notch, and the story is original. I was reminded of the movie Pulp Fiction when the pyschotic Light Sleeper and dangerously demented David got together for their little chat in the car, a great scene. The only problem with the book is that Allen could have developed three minor characters a little more fully: Sadie, the Captain, and Tyrone. As it is, he leaves us with a taste, and we have to fill in the blanks. Maybe it's a question of style, and this book sure does have style. I'm glad my wife made me read it.

I was completely fooled by the end, because I thought I knew who the killer was. I was so wrong. Mr. Allen has a very unique style that makes you want to read on. The story is real dark and surprising like Silence of the Lambs was, but in the ghetto. He has so much insight into his characters, male and female, and he always reveals the truth about them, good or bad. I was very sad about M Gantry's childhood with her sister. He is not just telling a good story, he makes you completely fall in love with M Gantry, the virgin detective, who is the best female action hero I've read about ever.I kept seeing this as a movie.

He is a new voice, and judging by his talent. he will be around a long time. He did not just write a good book, he is trying to set a new standard. I am talking about the power of his words not just to tell a story, but to move people. It bothered me at first, he called it Hoochie Mama to make a point, and now I get it. He is not exploiting us, he is celebrating us. He is not picking at the way black women talk and dress, he is saying we can talk and dress this way and still be the best at what we do, be police officers too and all that. He is saying don't judge our outside. He is saying we're not stupid and frivilous, we rule our destiny and yours. I used to live in Opa-Locka so I like how he interweved all of the history so smooth into it without even making it boring. I didn't know all that stuff about the city I was born in. This book is off the chain. When it ended, I said I get it, I get it. And I went out and bought the book Brown Sugar that he is in. That story is good, too, but of a different style. And I said who is this Prestn L. Allen that I never heard of before? This boy can write anything. I read some other stuff that he did online and I said, I am so proud of this black writer. he can really write, and not just relationship stuff. What a thrill to finally get a talented black writer who writes something that is good to read and good for us. the title kind of threw me for a while, but I get it now.

I have nothing but good things to say about the book, which I saw pieces of before it was even published.The book was interesting and brilliant. What I have always loved about Mr. Allen is that he is one of the few male authors who is not afraid to take risks with his female characters, which he seems to do in all of his short stories I have read, including the one in Brown Sugar. He makes them strong without being &quot;female dogs,&quot; if you know what I mean. He allows them to show moments of weakness without seeming frail and dependent on men. Detective M Gantry in the novel works with mostly male officers, and she &quot;hangs&quot; with the boys without losing or exploiting her feminine side. When she shows emotion, she never becomes weak, except briefly near the end, but I think he was trying to make a point there because it does not last long. He works real hard to make her real.You will love the flashback scenes with her friend Shoneka. I think those scenes prove my point about Mr. Allen's skill at keeping it all balanced."},{"Title":"Hoochie Mama","review":"This one is as good as his other book Bounce, but in a different way. This one is a whole book. Complete. We see what the writer Preston Allen can do with 300 pages. He is spellbinding in his description of scenes. Murder is his passion, and the solving of it. I did not see the end coming. I see the writer of Bounce in this book, too, in subtle ways, my friend. The little bit of kinky sex in the video scene, hot, hot, hot, the deep, deep, deep lesbian scene that explains M Gantry's childhood and her true feelings, and Dake the pervert is dangerous, but sexy in a manly kind of way: he likes his women old fashioned, subservient, and tied up.

M.Gantry is a fasinating character, she can fight, she's smart, and she's got a great body, that's my kind of woman. I look forward to reading a sequal to this book. Who's Preston L.

It is a mystery story about a police coverup of corruption, and it is a book about bad fathers, who don't take care of their sons and then blame everybody else when they turn to a life of crime. It's not the kind of book I usually read, especially with a title like that, but it is not demeaning to women in anyway, at least I don't think so. My girlfriend might say different when she reviews it. This is a great book, and Preston Allen is a new voice."},{"Title":"Hoochie Mama","review":"Hoochie Mama is a novel about M Gantry, the hoochie mama detective, a natural loner who nevertheless bonds with her male counterparts to solve a perplexing case.

Instead, this book is more sublime. From the very first scene with David and Dake to the bloody climax, the writer makes the characters so much fun to read about. I love how the connections between them evolve as the book progresses. Some of the language is a bit stereotypical, but the writer makes up for that with plot originality and an undercurrent of kinkiness, humor, and dark cynicism."},{"Title":"Hoochie Mama","review":"Great story = interesting plot twists + confused detective + bad guys + good guys who may be bad + sex + crazy mayor + another plot twist + did I say clever plot."},{"Title":"Hoochie Mama","review":"He uses a deceptively simple style that allows for an almost clinical examination of characters and issues, like Ernest Hemingway or Raymond Carver is writing a mystery/thriller.

By the time the story spins to its heady conclusion, you will be cheering both style and content.

This was my first full length story that he wrote. The story starts off, to me, a bit slowly. But by the end the action is fast, furious and at times quite unexpected. Homicide detective M Gantry is an interesting person with an excellent crime solving mind. She won't accept the false leads that are placed in her path. It seems as though the Opa-Locka and Metro Miami Police Departments are chock full of bad guys trying to cover up for each other for past misdeeds. No one is too powerful to escape her dogged investigative determination. The author has a bit of an unusual tendency to intersperse important clues thruout the book. So you need to pay close attention as you read or you'll miss important things. All in all, quite interesting though a bit different than the typical murder mystery."},{"Title":"Hoochie Mama","review":"This story is . . . very different. I read it after reading his erotica in his novel BOUNCE and BROWN SUGAR. I thought it was going to be an erotic thriller . . . instead I got a mystery thriller like none I have ever read before.

My favorite part is when the writer takes us back to M Gantry's childhood. I like that M's sister is named Sady Gantry, so that we end up with the S and M sisters. Wait till you see how that works itself out in the book. Pretty kinky stuff for detective fiction. I kept seeing the sisters as Venus and Serena Williams, but that's just me. If the book has a weakness, it is in the treatment of Dake Evans, whose character is not as layered as every other main character in the novel."},{"Title":"Hoochie Mama","review":"Excellent!

Gantry, who solves a murder involving some of the quirkiest characters in fiction.What I love about this book is the relationship between the characters and how Allen is able to describe complex emotions between father and son without descending into banality.Allen further extends his abilities by writing about an area of Miami that remains underused by many writers.His scope/knowledge of the history and landscape of Miami is impressive and left me wanting more from this writer who certainly has a sure career in fiction writing ahead of him.God's Speed!"},{"Title":"Hoochie Mama","review":"I loved this book. Mr. Allen is a wonderful writer. My only complaint, and I told him so, was that I was left wishing for more development and background on M. I expressed to him my hope that perhaps she could be a serial character.Growing up in Miami and traveling through the neighborhoods he portrayed in the book, I could literally picture the scenes unfolding in my mind.I was fortunate to have Mr. Allen as my professor a few years back. His love of the written word is infectious, and he was a joy from whom to learn.W. :)"},{"Title":"Hoochie Mama","review":"A serial killer is on the loose in Miami, and homicide detective M Gantry is hot on the trail. M is one of the top detectives in the department, and has a reputation for being dedicated to her job. From her unusual name to her short blond haircut, she is an interesting woman. Add to that her voluptuous body, and the minute people look at her they think this woman is a hoochie mama, little do they know she is not what she appears to be.In addition to her work on the serial murder case, M is involved in a very serious romantic relationship with a top city official. While she is strong and takes nothing from her fellow police officers, she seems to be under the control of her lover. While M feels that he is wonderful for her, but he seems to bring memories of her dark and horrible past.Preston Allen's novel, Hoochie Mama, allows you to experience a serial murder investigation through the eyes of the detective working the case. As a reader you also experience the turmoil that M feels in her daily life, and you see how she tries to balance her emotions and do her job at the same time. This book was very interesting, but at times it went off in so many different directions that I was not quite sure what was going on. However, I did enjoy the suspense and surprises, and look forward to reading more of the author's work.Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks"},{"Title":"Hoochie Mama","review":"I met the author's mother at the clinic and she said you have to read this book my son wrote. She was a nice, black lady, so I said okay. I bought it, waited a couple days for it to arrive, and I'm glad I did. I read the book, twice, and I only sort of understand why he called it Hoochie Mama. Perhaps it has something to do with our misperception of each other, as M is pisperceived by her male co workers. She is judged to be something that she is not based on soley her appearance, dyed hair, odd colored lipstick, flashy nails, buttocks that nicely fill out a pair of pants. The problem with this is that Allen, who is clearly an excellent writer, is carefully restrained in his depiction of his heroine; in no way is he over the top in the way he dresses M or in the way he has M behave. Thus, we the reader consider those in the world of the book to be \\"stupid\\" and/or \\"mean and bigoted\\" to refer to her as something she clearly is not based on such shallow evidence. Furthermore, it has occured to me, from what I see as a member of a slightly older generation, that many of the younger set, dress as M does. In fact, she dresses quite tamely compared to what I see on TV these young kids doing today.The good parts of the book are many. I love that M is a complex character, who is not one of these superhero types we get so often in this genre. M is strong, but she turns weak in the knees for the pervert Dake. She is smart, but she is overshadowed by her sister's super intellect. She is extremely feminine, but almost, almost, almost fell in love with a woman--maybe she was in love. The way Allen handled it, the scene was so steamy he had me feeling one way about it one day, and then feeling another way about it the next. I love her love-sick sidekicks, Lambert and Sosa. Lambert is quite a character. I am going to miss him. Finally, the villains, all of the villains are top notch and again interestingly complex. I am praying for a sequel, but only if Allen can repeat or improve upon the beauty and skill and layering of this first book. I hope he is not a one hit wonder, or the writer who creates a great first book and then only writes one dimensional comic book derivatives of it after that--in other words, he shot his entire load of creativity in the first book. But this one is good and Allen may be the real thing.I guess what I am saying is that I loved the book, I read it twice, but I am going to subtract one star for a title that might keep some readers away from a wonderful reading experience with an exciting, talented new voice."},{"Title":"Diseases of workers (History of medicine series)","review":"This is a beautiful book, a real collector's edition.

The book was originally written in Latin, and this book retains the original text, with the English translation on the facing page.Ramazzini was the first to suggest that many diseases could be linked to a patient's work, and for this reason, he is known as the Father of Occupational Medicine. Despite the fact that many of the occupations discussed in the text are from the 18th century, such as Apothecaries and Fullers, his observations are surprisingly up to date. It is particularly interesting to read his comments on stone cutters, in which he notes the effects of the dust on the lungs. In perhaps a sign of his times, he includes a category for Jews.

This book is about the relational aspect of Being. That right there is what is remarkable. Fr. Clarke shows us how the revelation of the Trinity actually helps us understand ourselves more fully. If God relates to (within) himself through this combination of relationality (being relational in nature) and substantiality (being a substance, a thisness), then, upon further inspection of what it means that we share in that Being, we see that we too find our most authentic mode of existing by living in this tension between being ourselves (a stand alone substance) and being defined by how we relate to others. Practically speaking, I think it's good for people to recognize that their existence, for its fulfillment, requires that they develop both aspects of themselves. As a child grows up, they have to successfully progress through increasingly complex relations with others. They start with their parents, then their friends, then their boyfriends/girlfriends, then their spouses. And in each stage, they go out to others and then come back to themselves a little bit different each time. You've met people who close themselves off to these relations. They close in on themselves. And they fail to live an authentically human existence. I think it's a book that's encouragement and reassurance for people who are committed to being as fully human as possible. It shows them that God himself is not far removed from their quest when they see that He too is relational in nature (Father, Son and Holy Spirit)."},{"Title":"Person and Being (Aquinas Lecture)","review":"I was a graduate student in philosophy at Marquette University when Fr.

I attended many lectures as a graduate student and remember only a few, this being one. Fr. Clarke spoke rather softly and you could hear a pin drop in the hall in which the talk was delivered. He was short, and smiled alot. The day after this lecture he came and spoke to the required course on St. Thomas Aquinas which I was in. I remember that talk very well also. He came in and said \\"I could talk about three topics today, I'll tell you the three topics and then as a class you decide what you want me to talk on.\\" He then gave a unscripted hour and a half long talk on how Aquinas viewed human beings as the highest of material entities, and the lowest of spiritual creatures. I still remember that talk as well. This book is an excellent contemporary discussion of the Thomistic notion of what a human is, presented by one of the best living Thomists.

If I had listened to him in 1958/9, I would have saved myself much grief, lapsing from the Church for 35 years ..and, who knows what else?

It's a masterful little gem.Clarke brings St Thomas's work right up to date by incorporating the insights of personalist philosophers into St Thomas's metaphysics. Thus, Clarke demonstrates that the human person is not just a substance but a relational substance. The relational aspect of being is not accidental to being but is a primordial constituent thereof. \\"To be fully is to be substance- in- relation\\" (page 14).Listen to what Norris says about the Trinity (page 11 and 15):\\"For what the doctrine of the Trinity means is that the very inner nature of the Supreme Being itself - is an ecstatic process (beyond time and change) of self communicating love: the Father, un originated possessor of the infinite fullness of the divine nature, communicates ecstatically his entire divine nature to the Second Person, the Son or the Word, in an act of loving self knowledge, so that the only distinction between them is the distinction of two complementary but opposed relations, Giver and Receiver. Then both together, in a single act of mutual love, pour forth the same divine essence again in all its fullness to their love image, the Holy Spirit, the third Person.\\"\\"Within the divine being, the relations and procession between the three Persons are not accidental but constitutive of the very nature of the divine substance. Substantiality and relationality are here equally primordial and necessary dimensions of being itself at its highest intensity\\".Thus, as we are made in the image of God, our very being is relational. But, we are also substance, namely substance in relation. If we were merely constituted by our relationality, we would have nothing to communicate.Norris brings out another important insight, namely that the Word shows us that receptivity is itself a positive aspect of perfection of being (page 20). This has important implications for the understanding of the masculine and feminine dimensions of human personality (page 21).Norris goes on to examine St Thomas's work on the characteristics of persons, namely i) Personal Being as Self-possessing; ii) Personal Being as Self- communicative and relational and iii) Personal Being as self-transcending. Norris is very insightful - what is it about giving that we receive, why to find ourselves, do we need to lose ourselves, why do we need communion to be self affirmed? We are rooted in ourselves but we are also ecstatically transcendent communal beings.And Norris notes that in out life journey, our self knowledge never reaches completion, wryly observing that even post 70 years of age, there are surprises (page 46). And again, Norris notes the relational aspects of being; \\"Everywhere our growth and development, positive and negative, are mediated by relations, - though, not we insist, simply reducible to them. (page 67). \\"In a word, the final goal and perfection of the whole universe is, literally, the communion between persons...\\" (page 80). \\"To be: is to be in communion\\" (page 82). \\"It is of great importance, then, for a healthy personal development to find some appropriate way of expressing to somebody all the significant levels of being and personality within us, concluding the deepest and most intimate. Paradoxically, it seems that what we don't share, we tend to lose hold of, what we don't give away we can't hold on to (page 92). \\"Why it must be that way that self-possession must keep pace with self expression is one of the deep mysteries of being (page 93). \\"Thus the Christian revelation of the Trinity is not abstruse doctrine for theologians alone but has a unique illuminate power as to the meaning of being...

It is extraordinary that there should ever have been university lectures of such outstanding quality. It is doubtful that we have anything to approach it today. As merely a book, \\"Three Philosophical Poets\\" is a masterpiece of style and interpretation. The three philosophical poets of the title are Lucretius, Dante, and Goethe, each of whom represents the three main sources of the major speculative systems of Western philosophy. Lucretius, the materialist, is the poet of naturalism; Dante, the Christian and Platonist, is the poet of supernaturalism; and Goethe, the romanticist, is the poet of experience and idealism.What gives this book its special excellence is Santayana's ability to describe each of the traditions with sympathetic understanding. Although a materialist himself, Santayana does not use the book do advance any specific philosophical agenda. He does not try to score points against the speculative traditions he dislikes (e.g. romanticism, idealism), nor does he make any effort to trump the materialism that he favored or the Catholicism he admired. Instead, he seeks to uncover the special motivations and passions that lead to each tradition, showing how even the most dubious philosophical ideas have a sort of plausibility when one understands how intensely human they are. For example, the supernaturalism of Dante is ultimately an expression of the idea that things are to be understood by their uses or purposes. This, in the final analysis, is what unites Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle with the Christian tradition. The Greek naturalists, on the other hand, had a totally different view. \\"Nothing arises in the body in order that we may use it,\\" insisted Lucretius, \\"but what arises brings forth its use.\\" Here we have a discarding of final causes typical not merely of naturalism, but of modern science as well.There is no better introduction to materialism-naturalism, platonism-Christianity, and romanticism-idealism. Santayana clears up scores of misconceptions which have developed regarding these traditions and shows that no philosophical vision can be entirely just to the totality of human life if it does not take into consideration at least some of the insights peculiar to each of these traditions. It does not speak well for our culture that this beautifully written work should have been allowed to fall out of print."},{"Title":"The Little Princesses: The Story of the Queen's Childhood by her Nanny, Marion Crawford","review":"This was the very FIRST book to present Royalty as human beings --and as such, it truly got its authoress, (to use the contemporary term), into much trouble with the English Royal family, whom she worked for in the capacity of Governess to the two Royal Princesses, Pss. Elizabeth and Pss. Margaret Rose, from the 1930s until they were grown young women -- and in Pss. Elizabeth's case, married.This is the GENUINE article -- a first-person reminisence, theREAL story of what went on behind the palace walls in the 1930s, 1940s, and early 1950s. It is great reading for royal-watchers, as one can almost feel oneself actually there, a \\"fly on the wall\\" as it were, to these auspicious royal happenings. And seeing the royal personages themselves, through Ms. Crawford's eyes: the dilligent and almost too-dutiful Pss. Elizabeth, the rather diffident, but still very brave Duke of York who became George VI, the artistic, rebellious, and elfin Pss. Margaret, the warm, friendly, yet very, very Royal Queen Elizabeth, the King's Consort, and the extremely regal, yet still very humanQueen Mary.I got this book out of the school library when I was in college....but was so excited to have found it, that I just skimmed it. However, I have recently bought a copy, and am forcing myself to read it all the way through! So far I am only up to the Abdication of King Edward VIII -- but I realize this is a true turning point, and am loathe to go futher, though I know I must. Never, (believe it or not), was there ever such a reluctant couple to mount the throne of England as GeorgeVI and Elizabeth -- the responsibilites, and separation from their children, were great burdens to them. The \\"fairy-tale\\" existance they had as the very private Duke and Duchess of York was no more.....Later on, of course, WWII intruded even more into the Royal lives, changing royal routine even more.....forever.It is interesting to see, even in the professed \\"simplicity\\" of the Princesses pre-war, (and post-war), lives, that little luxuries were taken for granted, even so. As a small child, Princess Elizabeth plays with imaginary ponies before going to bed, later graduating to toy ponies, and stil later, to real horses. Large grounds, many servants, and many homes complete the picture.....and even though Ms. Crawford does give some middle-class amazement at some of the priviledges, others are just taken as natural for her royal employers. I find myself wondering how the Princesses would have reacted, had they suddenly found themselves, \\"Twilight-Zone\\"-like, waking up to suddenly find themselves, instead, as Ruby and Margaret McDonald -- the Princesses' real-life sister-maids. (Probably,the Dutiful Elizabeth would have taken it as a matter of course....but the independent and talented Margaret Rose would have definitely rebelled!)Still, this is truly a book to cherish and delight in...especially if one wishes, secretly or not so secretly, to imagine oneself one (or both) of the Royal Sisters. There aremany royal secrets in this book too -- such as Queen Mary'srecommended \\"royal pick-me-up receipie\\", and the fact that the secret of the perfectly coiffed hairdos of the royal ladies, even after hours in a car, lay in the fact that the Royal cars were, in fact, hermetically sealed!I can understand why the Royal Family were so upset that this book -- which doesn't critize them, but merely shows all their human strengths, and some of their all-too-human weaknesses. Royals are supposed to be 100% perfet. This book shows them to be 100% Human. Secrets are shared. And -- contrary to Baghot'sadmonition -- light is, indeed, shed on the magic.In the end, however, Ms. Crawford, (who had married just beforePrincess Elizabeth herself did), left all of her papers anddiaries, etc. to her royal employers -- the very ones she had once been so close to, but who had cut her off, completely, from their lives, once \\"The Little Princesses\\" was published. It is a sad thing for curious commoners, such as myself -- for no matter how many authors write about the Royal Family of England, none, I feel, will have as intimacy with their royal material as Miss Crawford did. (With the possible exception of Paul Burrell, and Stephen Birmingham, valets to Princess Diana and the pre-married Prince Charles, respectively.) For English -- and perhaps other royals -- now reqire a signed statement from their possible servants, before employment, not to disclose anything of their employment in future books. This is another reason why \\"The Little Princesses\\" is such a true classic: the reality of the book was recorded without any constraint or even thought of constraint.This alone makes the \\"fairy-tale become reality\\" sense of this book even more genuine -- and to royal-watchers, even more precious.So this book -- and the others written by Marion Crawford -- are the true and genuine articlesw -- 24-karat gold, amongst all the other books on the royals, no matter how well written, or how engrossing.\\"The Little Princesses\\" is thus not only a wonderful, involving, exciting, and easily-read book.... It is a piece of history, in and of itself."},{"Title":"The Little Princesses: The Story of the Queen's Childhood by her Nanny, Marion Crawford","review":"A lovely portrait of royalty as it used to be, painted in the words of a woman who devoted years of her life to royalty's service. \\"Crawfie,\\" as a very young Princess Elizabeth nicknamed her new governess, had no idea when she accepted the post that she would be staying for more than a short time. She'd come to help the Duke and Duchess of York begin their little girls' education, after which Miss Crawford fully intended to take up the classroom teaching career of which she had always dreamed. She wasn't planning on growing to love Elizabeth and Margaret as she did. Nor had she any clue that one of her charges would someday sit on England's throne.The interlude Miss Crawford planned to spend with the Yorks lasted until after Princess Elizabeth's marriage. As a member of their household, she experienced history first hand when the abdication of King Edward VIII - otherwise known as \\"Uncle David\\" - forced her employers to give up their private, comfortable, family-centered life. She kept their daughters out of harm's way during the frightening war years that soon followed; and after the war's end, helped the family that by now considered her indispensible in guiding its \\"little princesses\\" from adolescence into womanhood.Charming, but in no way saccharine, this recently re-released book provides invaluable insight into the character of the woman who has reigned for more than half a century as Queen Elizabeth II.

I cannot understand why the Royals thought it was disrespectful to write this and cut Nanny Crawford off for the rest of her life. I wonder what the real reason was?"},{"Title":"The Little Princesses: The Story of the Queen's Childhood by her Nanny, Marion Crawford","review":"The final 15 pages of this book were difficult. I had been reading slower and slower, because I didn't want it to end, but I finally set aside 20 minutes and did my duty, just as Princess Elizabeth would do. As with Zeno's arrow, one can delay a finish only so long without rationing sentences ridiculously.Marion Crawford met the Duchess of York (known to us as the Queen Mother) in 1932, when Elizabeth, the future queen, was around age 6. \\"Crawfie\\" served as the governess for both Elizabeth and her sister Margaret for 16 years, until the birth of Elizabeth's first child. Crawfie herself had married a few months before Elizabeth did, but she delayed for some time her retirement from service to the royal family. Supposedly it was Crawford's new husband (who had boorishly suggested investments to the royal family) who encouraged her to sell her memoirs to an American magazine publisher that clearly couldn't care less about the fallout, a publisher that quite probably edited the book liberally to make it more \\"interesting.\\" Is this where the smug insider tone creeps in? One wonders if egoistic claims to closeness were original to Marion Crawford's manuscript, or if the publisher added them to lend a sense of legitimacy to the project.What a dilemma for the reader such as myself, enjoying this inside peek at royal life, because it came at such a personal cost to Marion Crawford. She was handsomely paid for her personal memories, but after the book was published, the royal family was furious, and none of them spoke to her again. Crawford, who had studied to be a child psychologist, had devoted herself to the young princesses, and then was disowned after her own child-bearing years were past. Still, she was not a family friend, but part of the paid staff (which her husband apparently convinced her to forget), yet as their governess/teacher, she seems to consider herself more central to the girls' lives than even their personal nannies. But Elizabeth learned much from her mother that is outside the confidence of staff, no matter how close or devoted; Crawford herself notes the reserve that kept Elizabeth from confiding details of her long delayed engagement to Philip until it was certain.Still, as a stand-alone work, the book is charming, full of the details of a warm family, yet with candid personal observations (e.g.,\\"Princess Juliana looked handsome too, although she is one of the people the camera is not kind to,\\" adding that \\"she does not dress to advantage.\\") In retrospect, the content of the book was not the problem for the royal family; rather, it was the compromising of royal privacy - of which they have so little, as the book shows. When you see how far it went subsequently, with the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, one begins to understand the reserve of the royal family and their attempts to ensure (at least through censure) the sanctity of the inner circle.Possibly my favorite passage was a rare bit of preachiness of Crawfie's part: \\"There is nothing in the world so attractive as gentleness and good manners. I have often thought that the young people who copy the Princesses' hats and frocks, and shoes, and ways of dressing, would do well also to copy the beautiful manners of the Princesses. To me, gentleness and lovely manners are far more important that clothes. For good manners are a charm that never goes out of fashion, and requires no capital outlay.\\"Would that Crawfie had learned a similar lesson about royal discretion!"},{"Title":"The Little Princesses: The Story of the Queen's Childhood by her Nanny, Marion Crawford","review":"and loved it. Back then I was reading mysteries and biographies, still am! An added benefit of it was reading about all the walking Ms. Crawford did, which made me want to do the same.If the Royal family ever would publish some of her diaries, which she bequeathed to them upon her death, they would find that a lot of copies would sell! Just a suggestion, Mum."},{"Title":"The Little Princesses: The Story of the Queen's Childhood by her Nanny, Marion Crawford","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. Crawfie (as she is nicknamed by the princesses) uses a chronological framework to look inside the royal family. She shares about their daily routines and relationships within the extened family. It starts around the time Elizabeth is 8 or so and goes through her teen years. It gave me a better understanding of Queen Elizabeth than I had from only seeing Helen Mirren in The Queen (2006). It's not the kind of book you'd read to a child who loves princesses. It is written from one adult to another, but a young teen on up would probably enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Little Princesses: The Story of the Queen's Childhood by her Nanny, Marion Crawford","review":"I read about this book awhile ago, but the only copies were extremely high in price. Recently, I checked again and there was some prices I could afford. This book has captured my attention even before I had a copy. The story of Princess Elizabeth's and Princess Margaret's early childhood, and on up to Princess Elizabeth's marriage is fascinating to read about. 'Crawfie,' the author was ostracised for writing this book, but I think it did the monarchy a world of good. The average person can see what sweet, little, normal girl's the princesses were, and how Elizabeth was such a good candidate for Queen. I highly recommend this book to anyone, not just those interested in the British Monarchy."},{"Title":"The Little Princesses: The Story of the Queen's Childhood by her Nanny, Marion Crawford","review":"I read The Little Princesses and found the entire memoir quite charming. It brought new understanding about Elizabeth's formative years. It also let me see Princess Margaret, of whom I knew little, as a kind of forerunner to Princess Diana in the eye of the royals.I say that Crawford sacrified herself twice: once for the years she put her needs on back-burner to care for and educate the princesses, and again for the ostracism that followed when she wrote the book. She died at age 78 a childless lonely widow in a nursing home. She could have remained a lifelong resident in Nottingham Cottage (where William and Kate later lived) and doubtless would have been a welcome guest as Queen Elizabeth's children and grandchildren grew. She gave that up for the money. Her loss, our gain...."},{"Title":"The Little Princesses: The Story of the Queen's Childhood by her Nanny, Marion Crawford","review":"This is a very interesting story. It is sad that the author was completely cut off by the Royal family after publishing this book. The details of the Abdication of Edward VIII and succession of King George VI from the point of view of their household nanny alone make this a book worth reading."},{"Title":"The Little Princesses: The Story of the Queen's Childhood by her Nanny, Marion Crawford","review":"I am a big aficionado of Engllish / European royalty. This book is great if you want to get more information not from the approved source but from the person 'outside-the-royal-circles'. The language is 'very proper', you will not find any calumnies and that what is great about this book: no cheap sensationalism."},{"Title":"The Little Princesses: The Story of the Queen's Childhood by her Nanny, Marion Crawford","review":"Written by Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret's governess, this 1950 memoir is surprisingly intimate and an excellent read. \`Crawfie,' as she was called, worked for the royal family for seventeen years and was the girls' teacher, playmate, role model, and confidant.She describes everything from the interior of the royals' homes and the girls' study habits and hobbies to the hardships of War and Elizabeth's courtship and wedding. She paints a picture of an exceptionally loving family who devoted their lives to their country. There are many personal letters to Crawford from Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, and the princesses. Though she writes with great respect and admiration for the royal family, the book must have been a horrible shock and unforgivable betrayal of their trust; after the book's publication, they never spoke to her again.The book is entirely positive toward the royals and without a hint of malice, but one does wonder why she chose to reveal their very private lives in this manner."},{"Title":"The Little Princesses: The Story of the Queen's Childhood by her Nanny, Marion Crawford","review":"Loved reading this book. Its sad but understandable that'Crawfie' was frozen out by Royals after this book was published. Even though the content shows the Royals in a good light generally they had to protect themselves from the flood gates opening and more staff selling their stories/experiences. Maybe Crawfie was mislead or naive when approached for accounts of her time with the Princesses but it appears she was given no forgiveness before she died."},{"Title":"The Little Princesses: The Story of the Queen's Childhood by her Nanny, Marion Crawford","review":"The Little Princesses was written by Marion Crawford who was the nanny to Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret for seventeen years and whom Elizabeth called \\"Crawfie\\" and it stuck. First written in 1950, the language used is a bit more formal than what the current biography reader might be used to, but the book is charming and gives a portrait of royalty that seems like what royalty should be. More importantly the book provides insight into the woman, Elizabeth, that would become the current queen of England.Elizabeth's parents, the Duke and Duchess, enjoyed their quiet lives and thought the Duke's brother Edward would rule until he died. When Edward abdicated, the couple was thrust into the job of King and Queen and relied upon Crawfie to provide their girls with stability, education, and protocol as befitted a royal.If you enjoy history, much of the book is written around the effects of World War II on the family. Crawford, after writing the book, was banished from the royal family (their unwritten code of not speaking about the family). However, the seventeen years spent in their service is a fascinating look at history through the eyes of the woman who raised the future Queen. The book does not contain scandalous stories, but rather touching ones from the everyday life of the royals."},{"Title":"The Little Princesses: The Story of the Queen's Childhood by her Nanny, Marion Crawford","review":"For fans of the British royal family, this book is a must-read. While it may be a trifle dated and decidedly unsensational, the book holds a unique place in the now vast array of books about the royals because it was the first to break the rules and reveal details of life behind the gilded doors of Buckingham Palace. \\"Crawfie,\\" who cared for Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret for 17 years, was completely cut off by the royal family after the book was published, but the book itself lives on as a kind of time capsule of royal life before the press declared open season on the royal family."},{"Title":"The Little Princesses: The Story of the Queen's Childhood by her Nanny, Marion Crawford","review":"Truly, this book is a national treasure and even the Queen should cherish it (apprently, she does not). After reading it, I have new-found respect for Elizabeth II and her family. No where else would you find such wonderful detail of the lovely lives these little girls led. Its also very revealing to see another side of the abdication of her uncle, King Edward VIII. I couldn't put it down and was left wanting more!"},{"Title":"The Little Princesses: The Story of the Queen's Childhood by her Nanny, Marion Crawford","review":"If you're fascinated by royalty, you need to read this classic book about the present Queen of England, Elizabeth II, and her late sister, Princess Margaret. Yes, it's an old book--but it's extremely well written, and everyone I know who's read it has been enchanted by it. Besides the intimate glimpses of the Windsors, it tells you a great deal about everyday life in Britain during World War II. The royal family suffered the same wartime privations that everyone else did. If you enjoyed &quot;The 1940's House&quot; series on PBS, you'll love this book. Incidentally, &quot;The Little Princesses&quot; was ghostwritten, and Marion Crawford was a governess, not a nanny."},{"Title":"The Little Princesses: The Story of the Queen's Childhood by her Nanny, Marion Crawford","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this gem. First published in 1950, it is the story of Marion Crawford, who was the nanny to Queen Elizabeth II and her sister Princess Margaret. It begins in 1932 when Marion, called Crawfie by Princess Elizabeth, joined the royal household of the, then, Duke and Duchess of York. Crawfie was 24, and came to be the princesses' teacher. She stayed with the royal family until the time of Prince Charles' birth in 1948.The story is tender and revealing. The Duke and Duchess relished their quiet family life. Being the second son, the sensitive Duke never imagined the path his life would take when his brother abdicated the throne. Plunged into the roles of King and Queen, the royals relied on Crawfie to help raise their daughters while maintaining their family life as best they could.Crawfie's affection for the family, but especially for Princess Elizabeth, or Lilibet as she is referred to, is strong. And, it is apparent that the affection they have for her is equally as strong. She shares details of their daily lives and provides an insight into the life of royalty that is fascinating. A significant portion of the story is told from the WW2 viewpoint and how the struggles and rationing affected the royal family. We also see the changes in Princess Elizabeth as she comes to accept her role as future queen. Her courtship and marriage to Prince Phillip are chronicled as well.The class system has never left England. Even today. I have no understanding nor respect of \\"royalty\\". That of being important simply because of a person's birth, nor the devotion and loyalty that people show them, especially since they're mainly figureheads. Crawfie nearly gave up her chance for marriage, simply to serve the King and Queen. I don't get it. I never will. I don't share the public's fascination with royalty nor celebrity for that matter.The story, however, is an entertaining one. It's a tender, touching account of the childhood of Britain's current queen by the woman who, perhaps, understood her best."},{"Title":"The Little Princesses: The Story of the Queen's Childhood by her Nanny, Marion Crawford","review":"I bought this book for a friend's daughter. I had it read to me by a teacher when I was in fifth grade and always remembered it....the book arrived in excellent condition...It just seemed to me to take a long time to arrive. I know my friend's daughter will enjoy the read."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Went into the Closet","review":"I have read most of The Cat Who series and enjoy the cats and the fun concept.

Some of them I have read over and over but this was not a favorite."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Went into the Closet","review":"I am an avid audio book listener. Granted, I'm spoiled by George Guidall's excellent reading of the vast majority of Braun's &quot;Cat Who&quot; series. But Van Patten is a sad failure. Apparently Dove's editorial staff feared correcting him. He pronounces everything wrong: &quot;Klingen-shone&quot; instead of &quot;Klingen-shane,&quot; for instance. He pronounces Nick and Laurie's last name &quot;BAMba.&quot; The first syllable rhymes with &quot;Tom,&quot; not &quot;Pam.&quot; Twice he calls Euphonia Gage &quot;Euphoria.&quot; He says Qwill will do his one-man Pickax history show for the Senior Care Faculty! He misread &quot;Facility,&quot; and no one stopped the tape for another take. He inflects all wrong!

This book is cute with Koko and Yum Yum dragging clues and stuff (stale cigars and old shoelaces)out of everywhere.(&quot;This is the only closet in the house that's locked, and it drives him bughouse. All the closets are filled with junk, and Koko spends his spare time digging for buried treasure.&quot;) What a great place for cats to play! I love when Koko says &quot;Yow!&quot; I also have a very smart and curious (beyond belief) cat and Koko reminds me of him! Lilian Jackson Braun captures the complete essence of cats... such as when Qwill tells the cats to get out ... &quot;They left the room but not immediately. First, they thought about it, then scratched an ear and licked a paw, then thought about it some more, then sauntered out.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Cat Who Went into the Closet","review":"I first got hooked on cat who books when I went to the library. I haven't read them in order but enjoy them as separate books in themselves. This is also the case with this book.

I like her writing because her books have variation to them. In most mysteries, all the main character ever does is sit and think, &quot;Who did it? Who did it? Who did it? Who did it?&quot; After a while, this becomes monotonous. Lilian Jackson Braun's characters actually get out and do something while trying to figure out the mystery. Being a cat lover, I thought the cats were a nice, refreshing touch."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Went into the Closet","review":"This is a double murder mystery, with lots of secrets.

This s why I'm thrilled I have them as Kindle Editions.This is light reading. Not for everyone.

It seemed to me like someone else had written the book. I have enjoyed all the other books tremendously, but this one just left me hanging with a lot of unanswered questions."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Went into the Closet","review":"The book I read was called \\"The Cat Who Went Into The Closet\\", by Lillian Jackson Braun.This book was very boring. I think it is boring because when some of the characters are having a conversation, they get sidetracked and forget the topic and point of having the conversation. I also, think it is dumb that the main character's cats are so important; they are always meowing. Who cares? Maybe they are just hungry, you don't have to go all suspicious. The whole book they are bringing things out of places, but they never lead to a clue of any sort.The book is about Qwilleran's, friend's grandmother who commits suicide. Many people are tempted to find out why. Did people owe her money? Did she owe them money? Nobody knows for sure. There is also another case in the story, it's about a girl named Nancy; her dad has disappeared right when it's harvesting time for his potato crop. So, there are two mysteries going on in this story, that in another reason why this book is boring!I did not really fancy this book so maybe kids my age won't enjoy it, but who knows, maybe they will! People who have read her other books may be eager to read this book. The unusual title may also hook them into reading this; if not the title, I bet the summary and the reviews will get them. They got me."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Went into the Closet","review":"I think this was my favorite \\"The Cat Who..\\" so far. It is late autumn in Pickax.

Qwill has just written a play about a fire long ago in Pickax and begins giving performances.The town receives word that Mrs. Gage who had sold out and moved to Florida, had committed suicide. Qwill and Koko do not feel all is right with that scenario.Along the way, Qwill meets a young, beautiful, dog sled racer who had a big part in this mystery. The story takes place over my three favorite holidays; Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas.

Somehow the narrator's voice sounds like Jim Qwilleran's would if he was a real person. The only problem is that it's not always easy to tell when we've reached the end of a disc, but then that's true of virtually all audio discs."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Went into the Closet","review":"Jim Qwilleran, the main human character in this series, just can't seem to stay in one place for any length of time. In this entry he has moved from his perfectly good refurbished barn to the Gage mansion on Goodwinter Boulevard. It is probably important to note however that his lady friend Polly Duncan lives in the carriage house behind the Gage mansion.Almost immediately Koko starts rummaging in the closets and keeps appearing with things relating to the mansion's last resident, 88 year-old Euphonia Gage who has moved to Florida. It isn't long until news arrives that Mrs. Gage has committed suicide but Qwilleran simply can't accept that the lively old lady would have done such a thing. When Euphonia's will is read Qwilleran gets even more suspicious and begins his own little investigation of the retirement community where the deceased lived. During his investigation Qwilleran calls Mrs. Gage's Florida next door neighbor Celia Robinson and soon she is working hand in hand with the former investigative reporter. Once the case is solved, Celia sends Qwilleran some holiday food and after tasting her delicious food he is immediately taken with the image of Mrs. Robinson cooking full time for he and his cats. This story by the way is set in November and December and Christmas and Thanksgiving are featured prominently.As Qwilleran ponders what he suspects about the retirement community another mystery rears it's head when a local potato farmer disappears. Oddly enough, the farmer's late wife had worked for Mrs. Gage for forty years and since his wife's death he had been able to purchase a lot of expensive farm equipment. Someone suggests to Qwilleran that it was probably life insurance money but Pickax City's most eligible bachelor isn't so sure about that. Then, just as things get really engrossing, a mysterious buyer starts buying up all of the houses on Goodwinter Boulevard and Moose County is hit with the biggest blizzard on record. Everyone including Polly tried to warn Qwilleran about \\"The Big One\\" but he wouldn't listen and he ends up trapped at home eating cold canned soup and stale doughnuts.This is another excellent entry in this series and once again the people of Moose County along with Koko and Yum Yum take center stage. The mystery is a little more prominent in this book than in some of it's predecessors but it is still the whimsical setting that makes these books so much fun. Qwilleran strays from the clues that Koko has left on occasion but the ever demanding cat always manages to put his human back on the right trail. Unfortunately, even the wonderful cats can't save their curmudgeon of a human from a stint as Santa in the local Christmas parade and the portrait Mrs. Braun paints of Qwilleran in a suit that is too tight attempting to climb a ladder as stitches tear left and right is hilarious. This is yet another winner from Lilian Jackson Braun."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Went into the Closet","review":"Here's what I liked: two mysteries going on concurrently, both of which have Qwill's mustache a-twitching; a new setting, a mansion with lots of closets to keep the cats occupied; Junior, one of my favorite Pickax residents, has a major role; Qwill as Santa.Here's what I didn't like: Polly is still a snooze, and I really could NOT care less about the nuts and bolts of putting on one of Qwill's corny \\"radio broadcasts.\\" I hope that someday soon the residents of this small town get cable so that they, and we, won't be subjected to that distracting nonsense another moment."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Went into the Closet","review":"Jim Qwilleran, wealthy bachelor and newspaper columnist, has again changed residence, this time into the Gage mansion which just happens to be located next to his lady friend's carriage house. Living in a small town like Pickax (pop. 3000) in remote Moose County (400 miles north of everywhere) it pays to be discrete.Soon after settling in though Qwill's Siamese cats begin to unearth 'treasures' left behind by the former occupant, the eccentric 88 year-old Euphonia Gage who has recently moved to Florida. Qwill's enjoyment of his new quarters is disrupted by news of her suicide. Something about it seems wrong to Qwill but he has trouble focusing on the problem due to other concerns, a worried daughter seeking her missing father, a one-man stage show, and an upcoming wedding not to mention the usual Moose County activities. In the end though Qwill and the cats sort out all the mysteries, even unearthing yet another deep-dark Goodwinter family secret.This is another Moose County mystery complete with many of the familiar characters and marking the first appearance of Celia Robinson. This is a must for those who are fans of the series and would be enjoyable by anyone who likes the 'cozy' genre of mystery. For anyone who is seeking a more traditional mystery it would be one of the more acceptable of this series."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Went into the Closet","review":"I have read every one of the books in this series- more than once, and I never tire of Qwill or the cats. This book had me laughing out loud at Qwill as Santa Claus! For sheer &quot;pleaseure&quot;reading, one can not do better than this series or this book. I do advise reading them in order. You get a better feel for Qwill and the life he had before becoming so rich. They never fail to entertain."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Went into the Closet","review":"This is the 15th book in the series. I've read them in order and they get better every time. In this one, Qwilleran (and his cats) are looking into two deaths, one of which took place far away in Florida. Of course by the end everything is solved. With some mysteries you can figure out what happened early on but this keeps you guessing and you're solving it right along with Qwill. (Sometimes I pay more attention to Koko's clues than he does, though!) Good light mystery reading for those of us who DON'T like thrills and chills."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Went into the Closet","review":"Ms. Braun has done it again.

Her cat stories make driving on long trips a real treat for my whole family."},{"Title":"Lilith-The First Eve: Historical and Psychological Aspects of the Dark Feminine","review":"This book isn't a book about Adam and Eve or popular myths. This book conatains every possible identity of the dark goddess. Prior to reading this book, I thought I knew a great deal about Lilitu, but after reading just chapters, I realized there was more to her than what appears. It provides cultural differences, names, myths, and many other aspects. Siegmund Hurwitz is an educated man who puts other writers to shame. I reccomend this book to anyone who really wants to know about the goddess."},{"Title":"Lilith-The First Eve: Historical and Psychological Aspects of the Dark Feminine","review":"Although I do have a degree in history, my major interest in this book was as an occultist. When I first got the book, the dryness of the language really turned me off. It felt a bit ponderous. Additionally, the author's unasked for review of Kultov's \\"the Book of Lilith\\" seemed to be building up of one's self through the tearing down of another. Upon taking a leadership position within the Temple of Lylyth, I felt I had better review some more history. I had paid for the book, so I figured I may as well read it. I actually got into it, and even quoted a few pages to the Temple's mailing list. The second part is the book's saving grace, as it talks about the psychological aspect of Lilith in modern Jewish people as manifested through dreams. They are quite symbolic, and give a deep, if confusing, look into the minds of other people.I would recommend this book for the serious student of Lilith over and above any other, due to the fact that it clearly contextualizes Lilith both as a historical and modern phenomenon within the culture that created her. This book is also not feminist, and the images of Lilith that come from out of the minds of men may have more meaning and impact on a male reader than a feminist pro-Lilith description."},{"Title":"Lilith-The First Eve: Historical and Psychological Aspects of the Dark Feminine","review":"I had more expectations for this book. The author quickly lost my respect as he spent much of his effort criticizing Barbara Koltuv's book on Lilith. His dry writing did not keep my attention for long. He did have some good points and info.If the myth of Lilith is your interest it's worth reading."},{"Title":"Lilith-The First Eve: Historical and Psychological Aspects of the Dark Feminine","review":"Loved it. Definitely one of the best academic treatments of Lilith out there. HOWEVER, I will tell you that there are a number of instances in this book where I feel that Hurwitz is trying to make direct literary comparisons and/or character associations to Lilith without sufficient evidence. I'm not saying he is wrong in ALL of these comparisons, but I do think that there are times when he doesn't sufficiently support his claims.All in all...an excellent piece of work.I definitely recommend it!"},{"Title":"Lilith-The First Eve: Historical and Psychological Aspects of the Dark Feminine","review":"This is the most \\"heady\\" book I've read on the subject of Lilith.

It was written at a time of heightened awareness of the importance of science education in the U.S. when the Russians beat us into space with Sputnik and also with Yuri Gagarin, the first man into space. Today with the Russians now emerging capitalists and the U.S. having won the Cold War, it's hard to imagine the anxiety and fear that those events inspired over here, along with the related concern that the Russians were also leading us in science and math education. And in fact, they were and oddly enough in some ways still do.This amazing series came out of that climate. With beautiful photo essays and extremely well written text by top science and nature writers there was nothing like it for the young reader at the time. It was also a time when companies like Time and Life were still powerhouses in the publishing industry and had the resources to undertake large projects like this. This volume by Arthur Beiser, a geology professor who could write for a lay audience, was one of my favorites. Although written before plate tectonics became accepted, it's still a fine introduction to many aspects of geology, including structural geology and landforms, the internal structure of the earth, historical geology, basic rocks and minerals, marine geology, vulcanology, and other topics. Although intended for younger readers at the time, don't let that mislead you as it assumes a level of scientific literacy that no longer exists these days even among adults in the U.S. anymore, as another reviewer here already observed."},{"Title":"Earth","review":"The Earth is one of twenty-five volumes in the Life Nature Library. Published by Time-Life books in the 1960s, this series portrays the many aspects of the natural world. Though obviously dated (it was written before the coining of the term plate tectonics), The Earth is still a good, basic introduction to geology. Topics covered include the Earth in space, internal structure of the Earth, the atmosphere, earthquakes, erosion, fossils, types of rocks, geologic history, and the future of the Earth. The book also describes theories which attempt to explain natural climate change. I did like this book, but at times I felt as if I was reading one of my geology textbooks from college. Nevertheless, The Earth is an ideal book for one who desires a basic introduction to the many facets of our fascinating planet."},{"Title":"Unnatural Horizons: Paradox and Contradiction in Landscape Architecture","review":"Allen Weiss brilliantly illuminates five centuries of landscape architecture with Unnatural Horizons. This incredible work explores the relations between garden aesthetics and the metaphysical realm. Weiss situates himself at the symbolic matrix of landscape perspective -the place where poetics and science, natural beauty and art, politics and philosophy collide. The writing is excellent and flow of language exquisite. Unnatural Horizons is a tremendous work which provokes and endears. Highly recommended! A wonderful companion piece to his classic work -Mirrors of Infinity."},{"Title":"Unnatural Horizons: Paradox and Contradiction in Landscape Architecture","review":"Professor Weiss has mastered new levels of obfuscation with his absurd and excruciating academic prose. And he wins the 1998 Academic Clich&eacute; Award for wanton overuse of the word &quot;paradigm.&quot; There may well be some impressive erudition behind all this pedantic hoo-ha, God knows he quotes everyone from the Renaissance forward, unfortunately the reader has to confront an almost impenetrable barrier of garbled literary theory presented here as scholarly thinking.E.g., a random quotation from the text: &quot;Consideration of cuisine holds surprising revelations for the history of landscape architecture...Provocative as this statement might be, this assimilation of cuisine to architecture nevertheless only confuses the issue, obfuscating the material specificity of cuisine and delaying its aesthetic liberation.&quot;As one of the reviewers on the back cover of the book says, this book is &quot;almost hallucinatory.&quot;"},{"Title":"Whitsun Weddings & Less Deceived (Master Guide)","review":"My introduction to Philip Larkin and his collection of verse,' The Whitsun Weddings' I owe to my friend David Evennett, one-time Member of Parliament for Erith and Crayford. Back when I was researcher for a Member of Parliament, I had an avocation as a poet. David discovered this, and recommended Larkin as a poetic voice worthy of attention. (His researcher acted surprised, blurting out loud much to our amusement, 'And here I always took you for a Philistine!') I have been grateful ever since, as I frequently return to this slim volume of verse for inspiration and reflection.'Whitsun Weddings' includes 32 poems. A small book first published in 1964, it has proven so popular (something rare in poetry circles) that it has been reprinted four times during the 1970s, four times during the 1980s, and continues to be reprinted periodically up to the present day.John Betjeman, one-time poet laureate of England, once commented of Larkin that 'this tenderly observant poet writes clearly, rhythmically, and thoughtfully about what all of us can understand.' This is the key to Larkin's verse -- accessibility. There are no obvious poetical devices that overpower the meaning or the language; there are no forced schemes, however brilliantly executed, that impose themselves on the reader. The gentle rhythms carry the reader like a slow-moving train on a well-cushioned track.The poem 'Mr. Bleaney' is the one David first drew attention to when I brought in the small book a few days after his recommendation.But if he stood and watched the frigid windTousling the clouds, lay on the fusty bedTelling himself that this was home, and grinned,And shivered, without shaking off the dreadThat how we live measures our own nature,And at his age having no more to showThan one hired box should make him pretty sureHe warranted no better, I don't know.These words resonate with me at different times in my life, as they did with David. There is a desire to make someone of oneself, to have something to show for one's life. In the development of Mr. Bleaney's life, and his successor in the rented room, one can take stock and reappraise one's own life. What is the value, and how is it calculated?Larkin's poetry frequently turns to the matter of religion and spirituality, without getting overly fussy or remote. In the poem Water, Larkin gives a very brief description of a spirit-freeing and pluralistic yet communal experience.Larkin addresses the issues of age and youth, of love and loneliness, of despair and hope, all within the space of these 32 wonderful poems. The poem 'Wild Oats' incorporates all of these themes in one compact, bittersweet tale of life. Who could fail to wonder at the matter-of-fact and poignant description of the man who couldn't commit to one woman, having met only briefly her more beautiful friend, and seven years later is still unable to forget? The poem \`A Study of Reading Habits' likewise, dealing with dreams conjured up through reading during youth gone the way of reality in middle age, ending with a too-familiar sour-grapes feeling, \`Books are a load of crap'.Of course, I mustn't neglect the title piece, 'The Whitsun Weddings'. Perfectly capturing mood and manner of weddings, the routine and the cycle of life, Larkin in fact uses the image of travelling by rail as a subtle motif for the journey through life, the Whitsun Weddings being a stop through which many (a dozen couples in this poem) proceed on their way to lives that will be lived out in \`London spread out like the sun / Its postal districts packed like squares of wheat.'Larkin's final word in this collection is a very worthy word -- one that will preach, in the words of a cleric friend of mine -- and one that brings to very sweet encapsulation his image of the Arundel Tomb, carefully and tenderly drawn for us in words, evoking images of when it was first created to how it is perceived today in its state of weathered testimony of the couple buried together:Their final blazon, and to proveOur almost-instinct almost true:What will survive of us is love.This particular volume pairs the 'Whitsun Weddings' with his earlier work, 'The Less Deceived', first published in 1955. This work was the one that established Larkin as an 'up-and-coming voice' in English poetry. He was part of 'The Movement' (which also included writers such as Kingsley Amis and Thom Gunn), which avoided sentimentality that was more typical of Romantic poetry. Emotion and wordcraft are still strongly present, but imagery is more grounded and real, less flowery and impressionistic.There are connections here, and not just stylistically. Larkin's poem 'Toads' (reflections on working life) in the earlier work is connected to 'Toads Revisited' in the later 'Whitsun Weddings'. Touches such as these keep the ideas going across time."},{"Title":"Whitsun Weddings & Less Deceived (Master Guide)","review":"I thought I was purchasing a book by Philip Larkin. Instead this is a \\"guide\\" to two books by Larkin. Yes, had I looked a little closer I might have noticed this book is by Andrew Swarbrick. However, Larkin's name is printed prominently while the actual author's name is in small print below. The one review (by a \\"Top 10 Reviewer\\") was written by someone with many reviews, but probably hasn't read this particular book. He goes on about how wonderful Larkin is and never mentions that THIS BOOK is not Larkin's poetry or how Swarbrick reviews and explains Larkin's poetry. Then the lone reviewer gives it a 5 star rating. Based on this, I eagerly purchased the book only to be sorely disappointed. The title made it seem like this is a compilation of Larkin's poetry and the review swayed me to making the purchase. A poetry guide without access to the actual poems is pretty useless. I am going to see if my local library has a copy of Larkin's books. Sadly, not much of Larkin's poetry is available on Kindle.

The language is flowery and vague, and the author spends most of her time simply praising the composer or the work as \\"wonderful\\", \\"influential\\", \\"brilliant\\", and all kinds of other useless adjectives. I've spent hours reading this book only to begin a test that asks for an essay on Brahms and realize how painfully little I actually know about him.

I like classical music but my knowledge of it is sporadic at best, so this book seemed like a good starting point to build up some more structured knowledge, and to be introduced to music previously unknown to me.While quite informative, I was disappointed by the book. The writing is really rather dry, and failed to convey any enthusiasm about music. This, I think, is a crucial lack. Music is intended to animate, not to bore. I expected to be inspired, and get lots of ideas about what music to explore, but sadly I wasn't. Has it not been shown over and over that one can write academically sound works without presenting the material in a clear but emotionless manner?There are also some strange omissions in the book. For instance, Bach's Goldberg Variations are mentioned, but why they are called this is not in the text. Finally, I have the distinct feeling the book also sometimes presents information of questionable accuracy as true. Composer's lives tend to spark many legends which, though amusing, are usually completely false. The story that Rameau was such a nag that he reproached the priest who came to his deathbed for poor chanting is presented as true, but I would guess that it has the status of an emblematic anecdote, not historical fact.If anyone knows of a book which gives a slightly more inspiring history of western music, please let me know!"},{"Title":"Concise History of Western Music, Second Edition","review":"This book was not much help to me when trying to learn about music of the classical and romantic era.

Eco is undoubtedly one of the most literate and broadly knowledgable writers alive.This being said, &quot;The Island of the Day Before&quot; does not present a compelling plot or likeable protagonist, as his other two novels have. Roberto rather reminded me of an admixture of Dickens' Pip and Goethe's Young Werther, and I had difficulty caring too much whether or not he met his objectives.However, the other aspects of the novel were completely engrossing - Eco's research into the longitude problem, the wealth of mythology surrounding the International Date Line, the views held from the trenches of feudal conflict - Eco is still clearly able to see life through the proper historical lens. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Eco has refined his ability to be playful with his writings - dedicating an entire chapter to myths and legends surrounding the dove, for instance. I eagerly look forward to Eco's next work."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"I am a great fan of Umberto Eco, but I found &quot;Island of the Day Before&quot; to be a huge disappointment. Perhaps my expectations were just too high, after reading &quot;Foucault's Pendulum&quot; (a masterful work, in my opinion) and &quot;Name of the Rose&quot; (my wonderful introduction to Eco). Although &quot;Island of the Day Before&quot; has some interesting portions, it seems to lack cohesiveness in the novel form, and what little plot there is seems to drag on incessantly. Perhaps it would have been better told in an essay format (or as a series of short stories)? I thoroughly enjoyed the other Umberto Eco novels that I've read (&quot;Foucault's Pendulum&quot; and &quot;Name of the Rose&quot;), and I've liked reading some of his non-fictional works in semiotics/philosophy ... but, for me, &quot;Island of the Day Before&quot; was a great disappointment. I'm so glad that this wasn't my first exposure to Eco ... I would probably have never wanted to read his other wonderful novels."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"With &quot;The Island of the Day Before,&quot; Eco almost redeems himself for &quot;Foucault's Pendulum.&quot; This time around, Eco seems more intent on playing narrative games than blundering through a morass of Templar intrigues. As Roberto wanders through the mysterious ship, he wanders through past episodes of his life. We follow him through chambers filled with exotic flora and fauna and from his childhood home, to a city under siege, to the courts of Paris where an encounter with the Cardinal Mazarin sets him on his fateful voyage.While &quot;Island is not nearly as enjoyable as &quot;Name of the Rose,&quot; it far surpasses &quot;Foucault's Pendulum,&quot; interesting for its attempt to re-create the medieval mindset (an endeavor of which Eco seems incredibly fond) and for Eco's ability to veer from Roberto's past to present while interspersing bits of the medieval weltanschauung."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"As always, Eco does a great job of walking the reader down the rosy path of dead-ends, near-misses, and finally, enlightenment. Things are never as they seem. At first I thought that some of the tales (for example, wounding animals to tell time!) were far-fetched. However, as usual, Eco tells these tales with a purpose, and indeed, ladens them with truth.The story weaves in and out of thoughts, times and events, in such a way to make one understand the Baroque period, as well as the human mind. This is not just a tale about how to find longitude, or how to put together poetry, or how to love, or of the Baroque period, but all of these things woven into a fine tapestry of tale.For all who have appreciated Eco in _The Name of the Rose_ or _Foucault's Pendulum_, you will find this tale equally intriguing and fulfilling."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"Obviously, I'm quite different from the others who have reviewed this before me. However, I will concede that for perhaps 2/3 of this novel, I was fully confused as to exactly what was going on, & what Professor Eco was trying to say.I got it, very near the end of the book, & when it hit me, it was basically an epiphany. At that point, I broke down in tears, & realized I was on the verge of finishing a true masterpiece.I've read The Name of the Rose, Baudolino, Foucault's Pendulum, & Island of the Day Before, & consider myself a confirmed \\"fan\\" of Eco's. I actually prefer Baudolino to any of the others, but Island of the Day Before was quite profoundly moving, & my life is the better for having read it."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"This is a tough book to criticize. I really wanted to like this book. I really wanted to understand the point of the book and the first, second, and third order themes in it. I wanted to put together the puzzle that was in front of me and decipher the hidden symbolism to find the \\"real\\" story hidden within. Bah, I couldn't find any of that. It was very difficult to pull the information out of this story and very difficult to get through.As for getting through it, after a few hundred pages I was used to his writing style and was able to skim over the half-page paragraphs that consist of nothing but adjectives about a trivial portion of the story. As another reviewer put it: \\"He spends too much time discussing something too small\\". I raced to get through it, not because it kept me on the edge of my seat, but because I wanted it over and done with. Much like the main character, I wanted my exile in that story to end! Unfortunately even the ending was very unsatisfying. If I didn't know any better I would say that Eco got bored with the story and his character and gave up as well. As it wrapped up, the story did seem to mount a comeback with a twist on the horizon but then even that fell flat. The fictitious story within a fictitious story was too much and seemed contrived. It seemed like Eco tossed his protagonist into a state where he, Eco, could pontificate on anything he desired and, on that day of writing, just went ape-nuts on his keyboard.Anyway, it was a tough read and I think that most people who gave this four or more stars enjoy having an \\"Eco\\" book on their book shelf so they look like they know something. I bet most of them don't understand the book any more than I do. I notice that most positive reviews are beefed up with some useless book-jacket summary and follows that up with a serious author-love fest and do NOT go into any of the meanings of the story that they so liberally claim to understand.So, I'm giving this story two stars. It would've gotten one star but the concept was good, the execution was bad.&lt;SPOILER WARNING>Here's what I would've changed:1. If Ferrante is in fact real, he should've been confronted with him at the end.2. If Ferrante is in fact an alter ego of Roberto, it should've been proven to him at the end that his internally constructed character did in fact exist and caused this misery. Something like seeing the body of Lilia wash ashore.3. I understand that the author wants us to understand things in a relative sense to what Roberto knew, however, there should've been some twist to the fact the he believes it to be the island of the day before. He teases us with him getting off the boat and possibly rescuing Lilia. That type of ending may have redeemed the languishing pages that came before it.4. Actually pony up and write an ending. Roberto basically floats out to sea to die. Boo! Any interesting character would've made an attempt at getting to the island. Screw the coral and the rock fish (which he aggravated in the first place) and get land.5. The concept was interesting, and enough happens that leads us to believe that Roberto believes the island to exist in the day before, but the character does nothing to reinforce or take advantage of that nor does he disprove it. To Roberto it becomes a fact that is never exploited so it's validity is irrelevant.6. Another irrelevant point is that he's on a ship. This is arguably the biggest advertisement of the book. He's the first man to be marooned on a deserted ship. Ok, cool concept, but irrelevant because he cannot operate the ship, the ship doesn't move, the ship doesn't become disabled and require his care, etc. The ship is equivalent to a strip of land set a hew hundred yards out to sea with a bunch of stuff on it that can sustain him.7. If this story is about someone slowly going crazy through loneliness and self recrimination the history of Roberto is irrelevant. Anyone stuck on a boat like that, given enough time, has a pretty good chance of punching out like he did. The path he chose to get there was unique but uninteresting.8. Roberto doesn't grow at all while he's on the boat. He was a nave bumpkin when he arrived at Casale and he was a nave bumpkin when he was on the boat listening to the arrogant priest. He never figured anything out on his own and believed everything all the other noobs told him.9. Ok, so the priest dies. Cool. I didn't like him anyway. But there should've been some closure. When Roberto when down under the water he should've found the body. Pulling up the coral skull, if it was some metaphor, didn't have the impact.Anyway, this story had potential but he got lost in his \\"I'm smarter than you\\" ramblings about nonsense. The character development was thrown at the reader through the story within a story which, at least to me, is a lazy device. Basically the author gives away the responsibility of explaining the characters actions and motivations and lets the character themselves explain it which allows all sorts of nonsense to be justifiable. I never really understood the point of the story or what was solved at the end. The character just meanders along and then dies while along the way he gets caught up in some peripheral activities that really don't concern him and he does nothing to try to control any of it.Well, those are my thoughts on the book. If anyone of the \\"5 star\\" reviewers cares to comment, please do. However, dispel the haze that surrounds this book. Add in some useful criticism or commentary that explains the book. Don't give me fan-boy comments on how I need to get a dictionary. Explain the symbolism and the subtle parts of the plot that I seem to have missed. Put your money where your mouth is;)"},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"I read this book on recommendation of a respected friend, and had a keen interest in exploring the works of the well-regarded Umberto Eco. My surprise and disappointment in muddling through this book only deepened the further I got into the novel. As passionate reader and scholar of literature (and an accused &quot;book snob&quot;), I enjoy challenging books with gorgeous prose, philosophical themes and symbolism. However, I believe that these devices must rely upon, or at least accompany some semblance of a plot. I have to disagree with previous reviewers: &quot;Plot&quot; is not a superflous element of a novel!If one wishes to purely engorge themselves in symbolism, philosophy, and aesthetic qualities, I would recommend some Yeats poetry, or a trip to an museum of fine art-- rather than spend hours trudging through such a novel as this. Interesting ideas, and beautiful writing, to be sure, but in my opinion not worth the effort. I literally had difficulty remaining conscious while reading this book (and that was before cocktail hour!).Want a thought-provoking, challenging book that also tells a fine story? Try Brothers Karamozov, Anna Karenina, Lolita, or anything by Faulkner. If you prefer those type of books, The Island of the Day Before will likely be a misuse of your time."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"I've got friends who swear by this guy and from their descriptions I got the impression that he was one of those writers who made complicated plots just for the sake of being complicated, dressed it up with erudite language and swirled it all together into a fairly challenging mix. Now, being that I can cite Pynchon and Gaddis as some of my favorite writers, I figured, oh what the heck? Well, after getting this book for fairly cheap, I just gave it a shot and finished it even quicker than I thought and enjoyed it more than I thought I would. The plot itself seems fairly simple, guy gets shipwrecked on a ship, writers letters that reveal much about his early life, interacts with a priest stowed away with him, debates all this Philosophical. Needless to say, some of the philosophy can be hard to follow, and I can't even blame the translator for that because he seems to capture most of the inherent poetry in Eco's language, he may not have many &quot;read out loud&quot; passages like Pynchon does but he's certainly more poetic than a lot of what's out there. The historical aspect is interesting, he doesn't really shed anymore light on the time than other writers and his characters don't seem to be more than mouthpieces for the sometimes witty arguments (my favorite remains when Roberto and the priest debate whether the earth revolves around the sun or the other way around) that pepper the book. Of course my complaints would be that not much really happens and so readers not used to almost nonexistent plot devlopement might be turned off, as I said before the characters are a bit flat and frankly maybe I'm too dense but I really can't see the point of what Eco is getting at. He doesn't seem to be parodying historical novels (like John Barth did with the Sot-Weed Factor) and he doesn't seem to be mocking the times and, well, like I said, maybe I'm just too dense. Oh well. It's a more accessible novel than his other works and readers wanting to see what he's all about might want to start here just to get a taste of what he's capable of.

It revolves around a marooned man (marooned on a ship--while looking at an unreachable island) who confuses his own imaginings with reality--and confuses us a bit along with him. It seems to me that Eco took every little sophist philosophical musing he ever had and tucked it somewhere in this book. Clever wordplay, clever ideas--marooned on a ship, e.g. Christ trapped on the Island and waiting to be freed, e.g., all are thrown in as if in a blender. In the end we're left with a bloated dead body of a book. Unfortunate, if better edited and with 150 pages taken out, it might have been great."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"This book is by far the most terrible of all of Eco's productions yet. The book is flooded, no grotesquely bursting with tangents and the usual philosophical rubbish. The reminisces of Roberto's childhood are entertaining and even the time on the ship, but few, if any readers I venture, will have patience for his constant philosophical bickering over first the Meridian and then irrelevantly the meridian line. Roberto's twin Ferrante as an alternate fantasy might be amusing except that it overall detracts from a part of the book that should be reaching its climax. I do not deny that even after 400 pages of this anthole after one chapter I could want to put it down and pick up something more interesting and more thought provoking!"},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"I bought this book because I was so impressed with Name of the Rose, with its fascinating account of medieval times. With &quot;The Island..&quot; I thought I'd be for a 17th Century treat, but I was mistaken. Eloquent writing and poetic description are great when they're accompanied with a STORY (read anything by Peter Matthiessen and you'll see what I mean). But this book bogged down after 50 pages and deteriorated into an irritating maze of self-indulgent language games and esoteria. Unlike some other reviewers here, I don't believe that one should have to be familiar with an author's scholarly interests to access his writing, as if it was some secret code. Obviously, Eco is brilliant, but I want a story, not a wandering display of &quot;here's what I know.&quot;"},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"I hold few books in as high esteem and reverence as \\"The Island of the Day Before\\". The subtle brilliance and thought provoking allegorical quality of every turn and phrase makes one feel as though one were dreaming, rather than reading through this book.If one can challenge one's own perception of what it means to be human and alive, one is ready to take on the challenge of this tome.This book feels as though written from the perspective of a higher dimensional being looking at human reasoning and perception as humans look at egyption hieroglyphics.Eco's books can be likened to carving dense mahogany to Stephen King's balsa wood."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"I have read three other books by Eco and enjoyed them all. This one left me flat. I got halfway through and had to give up out of boredom. It is a narrative that seeks to personify the way people in the 1500s thought. That's all well and good if you are a historian of science, but if you are looking for a novel, this is a bad one. It's more like a ridiculously long essay. Again, I'm sure the science is fascinating, but this is not a novel."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"I found the premise of this book to be very intriguing! It made me very interested in the philosophical idea of the antipodes and the search for understanding longitude. In fact, if you have read Dava Sovel's \\"Longitude,\\" many of the absurd methods Eco discusses in this book for possibilities to find longitude were actually mentioned in Sovel's book as being real. The race for longitude could be comparable to the race to harness nuclear energy.Roberto's vivid imagination and his ability to make imagination reality is machinery that is used again in Baldolino, with better success. Like I said the premise of the book was great, and could have lead to a great book, but the ending was certainly lacking. By the end it did not have the momentum to go anywhere and therefore fizzled out into monotony. It is missing the great mystery that fueled The Name of the Rose through its last pages.This book took me at least two years of periodic reading and it was by pure will to complete the book that I did finish it. And when I did, I felt that I had wasted my time. Stick to The Name of the Rose and Bauldolino instead."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"This book is very unique. It is my first Eco book, but I know that I will read others. Eco is an amazing author, with encyclopedic knowledge and a ready wit. Throughout the book, there are many memorable passages and one-liners.The plot is sufficiently engaging to make it hard to put down. One of the most interesting aspects of this work are the tangents that provide interesting insight into the political, social, philosophical, and scientific/alchemical mindset of that era, as well as a few interesting historical narratives included along the way. The extensive use of a very broad vocabulary (which I can only assume is the translator's excellent version of an equally astounding vocabulary in Italian) and phrases in several other languages throughout the work challenged and fascinated me, aspiring etymologist and polyglot that I am.My only disappointment was the breakdown of meaningful thought within the dreams of Roberto at the end (otherwise it would certainly be 5 stars), though the afterword was refreshingly clever.Overall, this book is certainly worth reading. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"I would rather read a calculus text book.I will never forget _The Island of the Day Before_ because I will continue to periodically have nightmares about reading it.I'm in therapy now. The doctor says that in a few more years, I'll be as well-adjusted as I was before I read this...piece of literature."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"Oops. Umberto Eco did it again.After causing me to spend some days trying to unravel the plots in his novel and doing research in order to have an idea of the setting,he scored one more victory at getting me hooked. The Island of the Day Before constitutes for me, a lover of history and linguistics; a devout and inquisitive Catholic,another jewel in Eco's legacy as a writer and scholar. I guess that my purpose in reading Eco comes from an urge to enter the mentality of men and women (although I don't remember femenine characters in his work) in different epochs in history. Both looking at the circumstances surrounding young Robert de la Grive and observing his interpretation of his past and present are enough to engage a reader like me, no matter how many times one has to stop in order to trace connections with what one has read.Finally, I found it most placid spending a few lines on the subject of metaphorical language---Grive, a very young man working for Mazarin in the 1640s i"},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"just another masterpiece from Eco. It's a match to Foucault pendulum by its depth and complexity (compare to enjoyable light Name of the Rose and Baudolino.) I don't understand one's point that it's not the best Eco's novel - so what? It still IS orders better than millions of other books."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"This is an entertaining story which is more accessible than &quot;Foucault's Pendulum&quot;, for example. Some of it was very funny and even touching. I've read the reviews below, the main criticism which I would agree with is that towards the end the story suffers from lack of focus.But if you think about what passes for &quot;literature&quot; in the mass market, Eco's work is so far above the mean that I have to give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"Many reviewers of The Island of the Day Before seem to fault the volume for many features which, were they familiar with the literature from which it is derived, they would find to be its greatest assets. Just one example is Eco's wonderful description of the Deluge which cannot be appreciated without having read Ovid. As with all of Eco's works a healthy interest in philosophy and semiotics is really required to follow the entire work. (DeGriva's mandering about the ship for instance can be viewed as a metaphor for the abductive line of reasoning, something Eco deals with extensively in his scholarly works.) This volume is demanding, as others have noted, and we seem to live in a world where we don't expect books to make demands of us, so for many readers this book may be too complex. However, if one is truly interested in learning the topics which interest the polymath Eco this volume is a treasure trove for what you learn along the way. If one wants only familiar words and a simple plot, do not read Eco--you will probably miss the point."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"The meaning behind the name of this book struck me about a quarter of the way through. Sometimes I forget titles while I read and just enjoy the contents. But this had so much significance to what the book was actually about, it stayed with me. Imagine; even if only 'imagined', the ability to swim to an island within your sight, and arrive in the prior day. Not too shabby, compared with most titles I see, and the meanings behind them.But a clever title is not all to be found with this Umberto Eco novel. Theology; existentialism; lost language; and even one of my favorite words (discovered first while performing in 'The Pirates of Penzance); escutcheon.Others criticize Eco on his meandering thoughts and ideas; on his half-truths/half-fictions; his playful use of alternate reality; and his obvious disregard for probability. I say 'what the heck are you reading Eco for, then?'It took me four years of owning this book to read it. Prior to this, I could not do it. But now, with Name of the Rose and Baudolino under my belt, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, devouring it from cover to cover, and opening my mind to all that Eco has to offer...Roberto, the 'hero' of the story, finds himself stranded on board the Daphne, a boat anchored just offshore an unreachable island. Without wind, without crew, and without a know-how of swimming, Roberto explores his new 'prison', having survived a shipwreck of the vessel Amaryllis.Finding that he is indeed NOT alone on the boat, Roberto prepares to flush out the intruder and face him down. But what Roberto discovers is not quite what he set out to find.The novel flows back and forth in time, as well as in and out of 'reality' as Roberto weaves a tale of his childhood and the invention of his dark twin Ferrante, who dogs him throughout his life, to the discovery of his lady-love, Lilia; to his induction as a spy for Cardinal Richelieu; to his arrival on the Daphne, and the education he receives there in mapping the latitudes and longitudes of the planet.Like the other 2 Eco novels I have read, there is so much to be gleaned from the pages of this book...whether you enjoy the mingling of fact and fiction or not, for an avid reader like myself, willing to open my mind to flights of fancy...the challenge to your thought processes cannot be beat.A wonderful read....and worth the wait to be able to accomplish it."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"Roberto della Griva, the protagonist of The Island of the Day Before, was born in 1614, a member of one of the minor noble families of northern Italy, vassals of the Marquis of Monferrato.While still a young child, Roberto manages to convince himself that he has an evil brother, Ferrante, kept secret by his family, to whom he ascribes all his bad actions. Ferrante serves to explain Roberto's bad luck, for everything bad that happens to Roberto is Ferrante's fault and Roberto must therefore go through life being punished for Ferrante's misdeeds.At the age of sixteen, Roberto's father is killed at the Siege of Casale, the fortress guarding the frontier between Italy and France. Roberto manages to return to Italy long enough to arrange a yearly income for himself before travelling to France.Roberto arrives in Paris in the early 1640s, at the moment of the transition of power between Cardinal Richelieu and Cardinal Mazarin. Having an interest in astronomy and philosophy, Roberto frequents the scientific salons and we learn much about the early 17th century. During the course of his visits, Roberto falls in love with one the great ladies of Paris and mistakenly believes that she returns his love. He begins writing her a series of leters that eventually fall into the hands of the narrator and form the basis of the book.Ferrante intervenes, however, in the guise of Cardinal Mazarin and Roberto's carefree life in Paris comes to an end. France is engaged in a race with England to find the answer to the problem of longitude, and Mazarin blackmails Roberto into booking passage on the Dutch vessel, the Amaryllis, bound for the South Seas. When the ship sinks during a storm, Roberto, for once, forsaken by Ferrante and enjoying good luck instead of bad, is the sole survivor.Roberto eventually washes up on the Daphne, another deserted Dutch ship that was also sailing in the interests of science. Anchored off an island in the South Pacific, the Daphne is located on what Roberto comes to believe is the Prime Meridian. He thus believes that when he sits on the deck of the ship on the west side, and gazes at the island on the east side, he is truly looking at the day before.Roberto soon learns that the Daphne is not quite as deserted as it had seemed when he encounters the Jesuit priest, Father Caspar Wanderdrossel.Father Wanderdrossel has also been seeking the mystery of longitude in hopes that the answer will reveal to him the source of the Great Flood. Besides engaging in a series of lengthy discussions with Wanderdrossel, Roberto also spends his time aboard the Daphne writing memoirs and love letters.Despite the fact that the island to the east is inhabited by cannibals and neither Roberto nor Wanderdrossel can swim, they decide they must reach the shore. Wanderdrossel devises a strange invention that would seem to permit him to walk to the island over the ocean floor, but when Roberto lowers him over the side, Wanderdrossel is never seen again.Alone, Roberto occupies himself with his writings which now deal almost exclusively with his alter ego, Ferrante. Roberto eventually comes up with a fitting end for Ferrante and soon after, he, himself drowns, leaving behind only his letters and memoirs.The Island of the Day Before seems to have no point and, in fact, it does not. But this is only part of the book's beauty. Eco uses the book to give us a grand tour of the 17th century while the characters search for cohesion and meaning that just isn't there.This isn't always bad. In The Name of the Rose, Eco played out the same theme while giving us a discourse on late medieval ecclesiastical politics, but he also entertained us brilliantly with a Sherlock Holmes parody.For some people, part of this novel's problem no doubt lies in the time period in which it is set. In the 17th century, no one expected life to make much sense. People lived according to signs and symbols. Their prose and politics were complex and obscure. While a few, such as Descartes, searched for answers, most simply accepted what was imposed.Eco might argue that his novel only parodies life, which, ultimately, has no point. And, who knows, he could be right. But The Island of the Day Before is not real life. It is a book and Eco is a master writer. As beautiful as it is, the journey from beginning to end should have been larger than life and a lot more fun."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"Roberto della Griva, son of minor Italian gentry, sets off with his father to defend a besieged city during the Thirty Year's War. After his father's valiant death, he eschews a return home for the experiences of French society. It is here, within the soirees, that Roberto hones his philosophical skills and eventually finds himself manipulated by his imaginary brother, Ferrante, into a sea voyage to the other side of the world.Cardinal Richelieu's successor charges Roberto with the task of discerning the secrets of longitude while embarked upon an English vessel. In a storm, the vessel is lost and Roberto, lashed to a door, days later is cast upon an abandoned ship anchored near an uncharted island in the Pacific.From here, Eco takes the reader on a philosophical, metaphysical, and mystical trip that is not nearly as entertaining as his preceding narrative. Roberto wrestles the mysteries of time, space, heaven and hell, and authors a romance in which he wins the hand of his true love from the cold and calculating grasp of his imaginary brother.It is all a bit much. Several pages are devoted to the self-awareness of stone. Though the book has some fascinating stretches, in the end, Eco's endeavor for abstract slays the rythym a good novel needs. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it, but I would not recommend it as a &quot;must&quot; read."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"Let me start by saying that I consider Umberto Eco the finest writer of this century.His mastery of words, his elegaic visions translated into prose, his character depth like bottomless wells, his intricate plotlines and signposts of erudite information... above all his love of symbology in conjunction with his love of words woven into his overwhelming ability to create riveting storylines endears his writing to me so that rumours of a new \\"Eco\\" makes me almost breathless.That said, let me explain the sort of readership who will enjoy this cartwheeling extravaganza of hope, loneliness, isolation, history, intellectualism and richness of detail.1. You will need a larger vocabulary than that necessary for the reading of \\"Harry Potter\\", or you will willingly embrace the opportunity to increase your word-store by keeping a dictionary nearby. By doing this, you will be following in the great tradition endorsed by Tolkien and Samuel Johnson.2. You will need to enjoy a storyline that is anything but straightforward. In this novel in particular, Umberto Eco takes many streams of narrative, delves also into the purely descriptive, and weaves it all into a story that is not limited by the linear.3. You will need to find beautifully phrased writing and well-coloured choice of words intoxicating and delicious.4. You will need not to be put off by a storyline that moves between different time periods in the life of the main character.5. You will need to be ready for something that is more demanding than genre fiction.6. You will need an explorative excitement in fiction.If you feel the above points could describe you, take the plunge into the wild and star-canopied oceans stirred up by the ferris wheels of imagination. The story, as much as I can describe it briefly, concerns a young man who, semi-conscious, washes up near a ship-wreck some little distance off an island. What led to his being there, the story of the ship itself, the young man's past, the elements of history that paint a part of his history too, considerations of meaning, solitide, companionship, swordsmanship, sieges, elegance, naive eagerness, the meaning of a dove flame-orange in colour, the meaning of this island \\"of the day before\\", courage, foolishness, wisdom, speculations and wonders are like clusters in the great galaxy of Umberto Eco's writing. It's vivid, exciting, rich with the sort of descriptiveness that tumbles hastily, one word or phrase chasing another in an endless dance of cataclysmic wonder.This novel was so immensely satisfying for me that I sighed as though replete after a banquet when I finished it. I find the images created by the words coming to my mind often. Some reviewers have said it's not one of Umberto Eco's best novels; I disagree. It was delight after delight after delight.For those willing to drown and be reborn within the delicious writing of this work... enjoy!"},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"IotDB is the weakest of Eco's three novels--but that is like saying Luke is the weakest of the Gospels. IotDB is a great read, but when held up to either Name of the Rose or Foucault's Pendulum, it pales in comparison.Why? Well, for two reasons. One, IotDB is actually two books, the first could be called &quot;the Education of Roberto della Griva&quot; while the second would be titled &quot;the Island of the Day Before&quot;; and the two books are so disparate in tone and style that it is disconcerting to read. Two, unlike his other books, Eco has a tendency in this one to say too little about too much and too much about too little; he seems unable to find a healthy balance between the two, and he'll either ramble on about one thing for an inordinate amount of time, or ramble over a whole lot of things in a very quick amount of time.That being said, it is still an excellent book, and if you have not read Eco before, it is a great one to cut your teeth on. The traditionally tough Umberto Eco opening is considerably longer in IotDB, so you will be better prepared for the other books. Also, once you get past the opening, the book is a breeze and is lot easier to read than the other two.A note for anything Eco: if you read something, and you don't understand it, keep going; either it is important and will be fully explained later, or it is unimportant and isn't explained later--in which case you need not worry about it."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"Although Umberto Eco began wonderfully with &quot;The Name of the Rose,&quot; &quot;The Island of the Day Before&quot; is truly his crowning achievement. There are few books where the prose so perfectly transcends the plot that the end result is the purified, refined pleasure of reading beautifully crafted writing. I found my self reading and rereading passages of no importance simply because the play of language was so immaculate. If you are looking for the mystery and excitement of &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; and &quot;Foucault's Pendulum,&quot; look elsewhere, but if you want to read an example of the finest fiction this century has to offer, this book is as good as it gets."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"The meanderings of Eco in this book are as dull as the main character. Literary devices used, like a strong interrupting narrative voice that pops up randomly, just seems heavy-handed and insincere. Having just finished his _Foucault's Pendulum_, I was very let down and had to speed-read the last chapters just to get through it without admitting I blew 20 bucks. We know you are brilliant and knowledgeable, Mr. Eco--you don't have to prove it--just tell us a good story."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"OK, this book has gotten a very wide range of mixed reviews. Basically, the deal seems to be this - after \\"The Name of the Rose\\" and \\"Foucalt's Pendulum,\\" one might have thought of Eco as the writer with the trademark combination of erudition, history, intellectual theory and popular narration.However, this book is none of that - it is a very strange blend of some of these features, but in a different way that ends up being unappreciated by many.There is no essential plot to the book. It is about Roberto, a young nobleman who becomes cast away on an abandonned ship. What follows is a wide array of the memories of his life thus far, his quirky thoughts and happening on the ship, as well as the reasons why he is on the ship. The result feels like 5 or 6 books stuck together - which is interesting but hard to read. Thus, the first book might be entitled \\"The Anatomy of Rennaisance Sieges\\", the second \\"Paris as an Intellectual Flowerbed\\", the third \\"The Hunt for Longitude as a Means of Conquering the World\\", the fourth \\"A Jesuit Perspective of Metaphysics\\" and the fifth \\"The Yearning for the Orange Dove\\". All of these describe each of the implicit sections of the book, but don't do it justice.As can be seen from the titles, the book parades you through the various intellectual milestones of the Rennaisance, from theology to metaphysics to astronomy and the history of science. If you are interested in any of these, the book is a worthwhile read. Also, despite the style being deliberately obscure, I felt Eco's signature playful manner of rearranging ideas shine through.Also, unlike previous books, we have a more traditional protagonist - and I enjoyed identifying and getting to like Roberto in his idealism, slightly-misguided intellectualism and quirky worldview. All of this is characterised by his desire for the Orange Dove (towards the end of the book), where I found emotional overtones that are rare in Eco.On the down side, it is definitely hard to read - at times it seems like it's completely deliberate and that's annoying. The highly fragmented nature doesn't help either. If you do read it, it helps if you're a fast reader and can take a short time to do it in - otherwise you'll end up like me, with flashes of insight from each day of reading, but because of the struggle, it becomes a long chain of flashes that are hard to connect together.I liked it but I can see why many didn't. This is the book for you if you don't mind:1)putting aside prior perceptions of Eco2)a deliberately hard read and3)fragmented ideas (where it's more up to the reader to make sense of it all)"},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"To put it simply, this book is fabulous. It is beautifully crafted, elegantly written, and, as an added bonus, even wonderfully translated. All of Eco's books are remarkable, and each has its own specific merits; this book stands out most for its poetic quality. In a Borges short story there is a line about a noun consisting of the rising sun and the cry of a bird, and Eco has brilliantly suceeded at capturing that particular &quot;noun.&quot; All language and images and philosophy, this book is a delight to read and re-read."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"This was a book I needed for a class, it was much less expensive here and the quality was wonderful."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"It is a bit tedious to read. It reminds me a great deal of the first chapter in Turn of the Screw. You are getting the story 3rd hand."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"It's difficult to see only a three and a half-star rating for such an intriguing novel. Eco captures the spirit of Dumas and Raspe and, once again, plunges into history with a vengeance showing the reader why it's essential to understand where we've come from and how it affects where we're headed. The novel is as compulsive today as it was the year it was published and I suspect will prove itself through time to be an essential late twentieth-century read."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"It took two attempts to finish this novel, but, emboldened by \\"Baudolino\\" I determined to set out again. Being marooned on a marooned ship with Roberto della Griva and Father Caspar Wanderdrossel, whether experienced as heaven or hell, is still worth the adventure, even if the adventure consists solely of the twists and turns of baroque philosophy. I think of it as a comedy of the history of science, but that only reveals the limits of my mental reference material. Which is why I append this: [...]. If you can't get through that, don't try visiting the Island of the Day Before. You'll never get there."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"Okay. Finished another Eco book. Unsatisfied, again. Brilliant and beautiful writer that takes you in circle after circle after circle after circle until you arrive finally at - nowhere. I did not find it difficult to read as many reviewers have mentioned (except sometimes the broken and halting German/English that the Jesuit spoke) nor did I find problems in the translation from the original Italian. Eco writes masterfully. As I've mentioned in a previous Eco review, if you have hours upon hours to spend simply to be taken away into a world of words and ideas without any expectation of \\"resolution\\" then Eco is the writer for you. I understand \\"The Name of the Rose\\" is good but I can't imagine offering myself up to Eco again. I'd probably find more gain simply browsing a thesaurus as a thesaurus provides more \\"closure\\" to its tale. After 1,200 pages, I am cured of Eco."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"Island of the Day Before is my favorite Umberto Eco book. I couldn't put it down. I thought it was much better than The Name of the Rose."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"The Island of the Day Before is an extraordinarily complex and linguistically rich novel that bears eloquent testimony to Umberto's Eco's literary brilliance, and makes clear some of his limitations as a novelist. Much as his other novels that I've read, The Name of the Rose and The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana, The Island of the Day Before investigates at length and in endless detail the scope and boundaries of human reason, with special emphasis on reason's most powerful and infinitely flexible tool, language.Each of Eco's novels can be construed as an exploration and affirmation of the judgment that reality, as we understand it, is constituted of a complex and expanding edifice of linguistically constructed social conventions. The universe exists for us only insofar as we have concepts -- words and their limitless combinations -- with which to fashion and fathom it. The ineffable, that which cannot be captured in language, is inevitably so vague and amorphous as to be meaningless.Moreover, insofar as those among us use different linguistic symbols to betoken the same thing, whatever it may be, it will have different -- perhaps starkly different! -- meanings for each. Each of us may be located in the same physical space, but if we understand it with concepts that have different meanings we will find ourselves in different social places, unable to communicate with those around us, just as they are unable to communicate with each other.Some of the very best of The Island of the Day Before occurs early on, when the protagonist, Roberto, son of a member of the minor nobility in Italy, is introduced to Seventeenth Century warfare in a conflict over contested territory between France and Spain. Fighting on the side of the French, and under the able tutelage of his father, Roberto, through chance events misconstrued as instances of heroism, is promoted to the dining table of the senior officers. Though most are cynical and irreverent, the officers, nevertheless, are keenly aware of the need to dress fashionably and a bit ostentatiously, in the manner of prideful warriors for whom persuasive displays of status and bravery are at least as important as the outcome of any conflict. A battle hardened veteran, moreover, is one who is adept at making suitably honorific displays in deference to high ranking members of the enemy as he disposes of them with a blade through the heart or a musket ball to the head.The thickly ironic confluence of the fashionably honorific with the demands of lethal force is sometimes hilarious. In fact, much of the first two hundred pages of The Island of the Day Before gives us Eco at his most witty and humorous, simply portraying the nonsensical but taken-for-granted reality of the social organization of events of the most grave and consequential kinds.Having established through happenstance his status as a heroic gentleman of the world of warfare, Roberto, still in his late teens, moves to Paris where he seeks to adopt the genteel sophistication of a man of the intellectual world, frequenting salons where literature, philosophy, natural science, the nature of love, and a broad range of other topics are discussed in a brightly colored competitive environment before Lilia, a beautiful and cultured lady of leisure who serves as host and unofficial moderator. Though keeping a low profile, Roberto falls in love with Lilia. Just as he becomes sufficiently familiar with the iconoclastic substance and seditiously witty mode of discourse that prevails in the salon and he begins to make his mark, Roberto is arrested by agents of Cardinal Richelieu's heir apparent, and given a task that is dangerous but promises great wealth and glory.The rest of the novel is filled with adventures, misadventures, learned debates on the nature of God's design of the universe, and seemingly interminable monologues. fantasies, and hallucinations about life, the nature of space and time, the heresies of Galileo, the location of the prime meridian, epistemological rectitude ... the list is endless.Lost, unfortunately, is most of the humor that made the beginning of the novel so charming. Roberto, now a lone castaway, tries to exercise a perverse sort of will to power, writing a romance involving Lilia and his Doppelganger, Ferrante, as an implausible means of re-inserting himself into the world he left behind and the love he has lost.Eco retains his concern with the nature of truth, the power and perversity of language, and the socially created nature of the universe, even for a hermit living alone thousands of miles from any sort of civilization.As with Eco's other novels, the issues he addresses are timely and of fundamental importance. Sadly, however, the author seems to have become intoxicated with his own internal thesaurus and turns what could have been a really fine three hundred fifty page book into a five hundred thirteen page struggle. If his point is that language is inexhaustible and can be turned to the advantage of the most gifted sophist or lunatic, thus making any sort of established and durable truth perhaps impossible to find, he has made it many times over. In the process, he turned a wonderfully readable novel into an insufferable challenge for those of us committed to finishing it."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"Briefly--while Eco plays a number of games that might be called post-modern--e.g., juggling issues of identity--he does bring to life European notions about spiritual and scientific matters in the 17th century--and we get some surprises. For those curious about the intellectual setting that helped shape events during the 1600s and later, this is a lively supplement to a formal history. Those with little interest in Christian theology may find themselves tiring of the protagonist's intellectual jousting with a Jesuit; but those segments can be skipped.."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"With a small spoiler of what's to come in the book - witnessing reality and life fade away around Roberto della Griva was both unexpected and thrilling. Seldom have I read a book that builds up to its end with such an understated crescendo. For many days, my thoughts went back to this book and pondered it. Eco's best in my opinion."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"Marooned on a supposedly deserted ship within sight of an island photophobic nobleman Roberto della Griva must surive, and for a man to survive he must tell stories. So he writes a series of letters to his love from which this story is constructed by a 20th-century scholar some time later. Interesting as this sounds it soon gets bogged down in an ever-present sense of irony.Don't get me wrong: I love irony as a story-telling device and use it myself in my poor attempts at fiction, but I think Eco should have kept about half the irony found in this book to himself. It is too much of a good thing, and the book drowns in it. At some point or other Eco ridicules practically every character he creates. Even those who generally hold his views do not remain unscathed, like the knight Saint-Savin, who is a secularist and humanist but who seems to believes coffee can cure pretty much anything. I can just imagine Eco snickering to himself behind his typewriter (though I'm not sure if he wrote it in longhand or on a PC in real-life - this is addressed to nitpickers). Even the final words of the book, an afterword where the author tells where he got the letters that inspired this book, have several ironic notes, which is good that it is the end, because by that time I've had enough of that. Ultimately this will alienate many readers, such as myself, though some might regard this element differently.Otherwise this is a fascinating, haunting and formidable book, like the other books by Eco I've read. It covers a wide range of subjects, including my favourites: The Powder of Sympathy and the Longitude Pronlem. ISLAND OF THE DAY BEFORE is not as good as FOUCAULT'S PENDULUM or as devestating as THE NAME OF THE ROSE but it's not so boring or unreadable as some people claim it to be.PS: If you want to read more on the Longitude Problem, there is an excellent non-fiction book by Dava Sobel on the subject, named LONGITUDE."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"What happens at the point in the world where you can have one foot in yesterday and one foot in today? This is the story of such an adventure to reach such an island. It's thought provoking. The main character (who cannot swim) ends up alone on a boat overlooking this island as he ponders, halucinates, and dreams of the wonderdul things that will transpire when he finally reaches the &quot;island of the day before&quot;. Although, wordy, this book is worth the read."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"Eco's &quot;The Name of The Rose&quot; was a dense but excellent multilayered novel of medieval thought, history and politics cleverly organized by a plot aimed more at revealing the mindset of a changing period than telling a 'story' per se. &quot;Foucault's Pendulum&quot; attempted, less successfully, to do the same thing. With this novel Eco appears to have concluded that history is interesting enough not to require more than the most casual of plots to introduce; he's wrong. We've seen most of these ideas before, especially the thinly-disguised mean-spirited anti-clericalism that fuels the novel's 'wit'. Eco desperately needs the discipline of working in the short-story format!"},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"What an appalling bore this book was. 500 pages of a guy on his own slowly losing his mind interspersed with stories about imaginary brothers, what it feels like to be a stone (15 pages, the historical significance of doves in Greek and Roman mythology and wondering endlessly about whether such and such a girl thinks the hero is nice. The lead protagonist is as wet as dishwater. And there is absolutely no pay back from this book. If you want to know about telling the time at sea then read Longitude and give this book a miss. I don't have anything against Mr Eco per se - I have read and enjoyed his books before but this is the most boring history book I have ever read. and the fact that it is dressed up as fiction doesn't do it any favours."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"The description intrigued me. I was confused 1/4 way through the book hoping that it was just slow and would pick up soon. Half way through the book I was thoroughly bored. Every time some interesting character or plot twist would start to speed up the story it would abruptly change to a long drawn out explanation of some tangent of an idea. While the central theme of the book consisted of methods used to determine the longitude of the Earth, the story surrounding it is so overblown with non-essential side stories that the reader becomes lost and reading becomes a chore. I was 3/4 through before I was tempted to set it aside but then a promise of real drama is hinted at for the main character. Even that was long and drawn out and so anti-climatic that the only emotion I felt at the end of the book was pure frustration that I had wasted so much time hoping it would get better. I am SO glad that I got this from a promotion and did not spend money on it!"},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"I loved &quot;Name of the Rose&quot; and &quot;Foucault's Pendulum,&quot; but this one left me cold.

I am normally a slow reader but instead of considering it a bad point; I, in fact, treasure my good luck. I was lost in Eco's world for some time. READ IT"},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"It's a wonderful book for readers who enjoy talking about philosophy, astronomy or history. It will make you ask yourself things like &quot;Does the vacuum exist?&quot; or &quot;What is time?&quot; Well, maybe not. In that case, you will probably dislike it. Definitely not an action book, but delightful and full of poetry and mistery."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"Perhaps the first thing that strikes me about the work is how in the world did Weaver translate this. Authors like Eco revel in dishing out philosophy, scientific thought and literary theory in between which a story unfolds. As a result, Eco would make good movies but his books take work. In &quot;Island of the Day Before&quot; Eco's plot is typically interwoven with the hypothecating, erudite thought, magnificent scientific gadgets and exotic historical touches. He's a brilliant thinker but I don't think anyone should read it for its &quot;action-adventure&quot; even though such elements are there. Read it as a challenge. Writers, like Eco and Victor Hugo, tell great stories but you have to suffer through/revel in their opinions on much else."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"The hero, Roberto, moves through medieval times in a world of chaos, strange actions, and shifting values. Roberto, a dutiful son who his father finds wanting, begins the story on their lowly farm in Italy, moves to a seige of competing fiefdoms in a nearby town, then to the salons of Paris, where he is soon over his head with nationalistic intrigues and compelled to go on a round the world ocean voyage as a semi-spy (!).Roberto is an unwilling participant (or barely willing!) in his adventures, which take on a mystical quality suggestive of the religious approach to science and knowledge of the times. Roberto is not by any stretch in charge of his life. A hero he is not! The book suffers from unfamiliar words (presumably from the setting of the book), but the meaning is usually clear. The author moves the action along at a good pace, (even though the action is often circular and meaningless, very similar to true life).A good book for a light read. Keep the dictionary handy, but don't worry about using it unless you're a real student of Eco."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"This is probably not for newbies to Eco. I found that the story line gets a little challenging (lost) when compared to his prior novels.But if the reader is somewhat familiar with Eco's ideas in the areas of semiology, philosophy, reading and the art/craft of writing, it is a great read, tackling the &quot;perceptions&quot; of both Roberto and the reader.I am very pleased to see it arrive in paperback!Perhaps Eco's audience is larger than one would suspect! (g)"},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"The Island of the Day Before is basically one half a science fiction novel written from the point of view of society several hundred years ago and one half timeless romance.The story takes place during a time period when new methods to calculate longitude were becoming increasingly important with the increase in exploration of the new world. The narrator of this book spends much of the novel exploring then current theories of how to calculate longitude, some of which are now easy to laugh at (such as the use of sympathetic wounds on dogs), although all the theories may have seemed logical at the time.The most interesting misunderstanding in this novel, however, is regarding the international dateline. The narrator of the novel is stranded on a ship wrecked off the coast of an island through which the international dateline passes. Passages in which the narrator describes how he wound up in such a position alternate with passages in which he describes his attempts to reach the island in the belief that if he passes through the date line that he will travel back in time a day and, e.g., be able to save the life of his companion who drowned the day before. However, while this misunderstanding is humourous, Eco's portrayal of the narrator's desire and need for his theory to be true is rather poignant. Unfortunately, the science can get a bit thick at times and I did find it a bit difficult to wade through some of the longer discourses on astronomy, but it was still worthwhile to make the effort.Making the effort worthwhile is a back story that reads like a cross between Dumas and Poe, filled with strong romance and intrigue. Amongst the plot elements are dopplegangers, conspiracies, and such characters as Cardinal Richleu. As with most Eco novels, it is helpful if the reader is actually interested in history. However Eco is talented enough at bringing historical periods to life that even the most casual historian will be interested.Ultimately, I did not find this book as intellectually stimulating as Foucault's Pendulum, but it was more emotionally powerful. I very much look forward to Eco's next novel."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"After being entertained by The Name of the Rose and absolutely blown away by Foucault's Pendulum, I had very high hopes for this novel. Unfortunately, although the intelligence and cleverness still come through, the narrative is just not that interesting this time around. Most of Eco's work can be read and re-read, and still remain delightful. I struggled to get through this one just once. Here's hoping for better next time."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"TIotDB seems to be equal parts Proust (for its themes of memory and sexual jealousy), Dava Sobel (for its interest in the riddle of longitude), and Cervantes (for its dreaming, roaming madman) spliced with excerpts from a philosophical dictionary.Some of Eco's musings are superb, such as his single paragraph on infinity measured in human terms, ones we can try to imagine. But the plot is thin, and whereas the first half of the book has characters equal to the task of expounding Eco's ideas, in the second half much pretence as to plot is just given up and it becomes a monologue. We are left with much more of a show of knowledge than an education, if that is to be the redeeming feature of this book, and while there are appropriate classical references to Ovid and Virgil, much of the rest seems to be name-dropping.Some of the writing, to be honest, is clumsy, especially where effect is sought by repetition. Sections were left untranslated, presumably for a reason, but I'm afraid I just can't read the Italian, or Latin, or whatever it was. That just left me frustrated.I'm not sure why it takes Roberto 358 pages to decide to TRY to build a raft. Duh...This book is, surely, a parody. If Eco is not taking a few swipes at Proust et al, though, he must be taking a swipe, well, at his own profession. That is the only way to read this book, as though it is sprinkled with gems, and Eco can write, when he's in the mood, I cannot shrug the feeling that there is some kind of linguistic game being played here in a kind of postmodernist jest. If postmodernism leaves you as cold as it leaves me, read the book as a parody of linguistics, or the academy in general, or something. It might help."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"&quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; is excellent, I've read and re-read it. &quot;Foucault's Pendulum&quot; is pretentious but still readable. &quot;The Island of the Day Before&quot; is pretentious and boring. Incredibly boring. Skip it and read &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; again."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"I really did finish this yesterday, and have got to admit right away, I am a big fan of Eco's, while at the same time I understand the difficulty some people have with his writing. Being a professor of \\"semiotics\\" (the use of symbolism, esp. w/ words), he incorporates that into his style, so very often while you're following along on a linear storyline, very quickly it devolves into something like reading poetry, or maybe a description of medieval cosmology (a favorite topic of Eco's), or delving into some philosophical conundrum.Nonetheless, if you give it a go and just let it take you along, very soon thoughts and images start pouring into your mind that really do take you into \\"other worlds.\\" And I think this is the strength of Eco's writing, especially in this particularly fractured fairy-tale of an historical novel. On another level, he sure gets you thinking about things while he's entertaining you with the story (how does it feel to be a stone? what evidence is there for a personal deity, if any? what is the nature of true valor? why the different concepts of hell?) -- good stuff, no matter how you cut it.Oh, and I forgot... the basic premise of what is time? It just so happens that my son is in Afghanistan with the Marines, and we're e-messaging and I ask him what time it was... he tells me its 10:30 p.m., but it's the night BEFORE -- he hasn't yet started my day. Well this throws me for a loop that I'm still having trouble wrapping my head around. He's living my yesterday; I'm living his tomorrow.Finally, that whole question of longitude (intimately tied with time, the revolution of the earth, the prime meridian, sailing east-west, etc.)... I used to teach a survey techniques class years ago, and I always started with the concept of longitude, because I found out rather quickly that very few students (college-age, mind you) understood it at all. Before I could cover the basics of Mercator, etc., I had to get them to understand the difference between latitude and longitude (and no, they are NOT equal imaginary lines slicing through the earth), and why it was such a difficult problem for early sailing explorers. Although he tried, I'm not sure Eco did such a good job of explaining the difference either, but at least he made clear the medieval ideas surrounding the problem at the time.I highly recommend the book, but it's not necessarily a smooth ride... or let's say it's not necessarily a direct route. But I guarantee you'll come out the other end symbol-ized."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"While I'm no stranger to sophisticated literature and off-beat novels, the highfalutin concepts and boring storyline diversions in this book were even too much for me. The intriguing plot summary tricked me into thinking it would be a good read. I liberally skimmed the last 200 pages or so -- something I rarely do -- just to be over and done with it. Furthermore, it's a rather disappointing ending for such a looooong buildup. One good thing about it though, it's better than Nytol if you have trouble sleeping."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"Eco's novel begins as a clever tale of a lovelorn young man who survives a shipwreck only to wash up on another deserted ship, separated from a nearby island only by his inability to swim. Left to his own reflective solitude and his author's ample literary skills, he confronts a host of philosophical issues, which serve to introduce scores of references that range from the biblical to the literary to the historical and beyond. It is on these frequent day-trips from the main path of the story that the author loses his way. Does each of his allusions relate in some manner to one or more of his countless themes? Probably, though the most studious of historians would need a trusty encyclopedia and a lengthy stint of isolated research in order to prove it. But mere relationship between a point of Eco's novel and an obscure historical reference is not always enough to justify its inclusion. Taken individually, these sometimes lengthy asides are most often interesting and informative; as a group, they are overkill, and endlessly divert the reader from an otherwise charming and well crafted allegory. As they increasingly become distractions, they serve only as reminder of the author's impressive body of knowledge, while obfuscating the themes of the novel. Other critics are correct to observe that great works of literature require effort and thought on the part of the reader. However, difficult reading should not immediately be equated with great literature, and while Eco's tome no doubt provides endless challenges, it sacrifices its original center to indulge in its own margins"},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"It seems to me Eco's \\"The island of the day before\\" is a classic example of love it or hate it. Those who love it do so because of the beautiful prose, the interesting philosophical implications and discussions, and the unusual frame of mind of the characters. Those who hate it do so because of the difference between \\"The island of the day before\\" and Eco's other fiction books, \\"The name of the rose\\", \\"Foucault's pendulum\\" and \\"Baudolino\\". \\"The island...\\" seems more like an essay.The book begins telling how Roberto della Grive became stranded in a deserted ship on the other side of the world, and what his mission there was. Two thirds of the story are a description of Roberto's early life, a war, his passage through Paris, a platonic love affair and a conversation with Cardinal Mazarino. The final third tells how Roberto, alone in the ship with the unreachable island across the 180 meridian in front of him, slowly looses his mental faculties, creating a new, imaginary life for himself and disussing with no one about the size of the universe and thinking if the moon is inhabited or not.This book is a combination of historical fiction with philosophy class. But I think Eco would not be my favourite teacher. Sometimes he simply tires the reader with endless discussions about uninteresting topics. However, there's no denying \\"The island of the day before\\" is, for the most part, a good book, extremely well written and very beautiful. But it was not entirely for my taste, and I think Eco's other fictional books are better than this one.Grade 8.1/10"},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"I've expected The Island of the Day Before to be as stimulating as F.Pendullum and The Name of the Rose and I can see Eco has overmastered even his own linguistically brilliant self with his new novel. The Island.. is a feast of words, poetically served burst of stunningly original imagination. Again I found myself playing an imaginary intelectual battle with the autor (much superior in knowledge to my poor self of course) by trying to fully undestand each and every challenging passage by rereading some paragraphs over and over again. Some people complain the story of this book is too this but story itself is the least important of elements here. This book is about carefully selected words, about historical learning, poetry and world-wiews of the days long gone. As such, The Island.. is a stunning masterpiece with no equal in current literature."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"I found this to be the best read from Eco ever.

Foucault's Pendulum proved to be one of the most enjoyable reads I've encountered over the last two decades. Yes, it was full of recondite musings and had one of the most convoluted plots in literature, but Eco kept it moving apace, his mind (and this reader's admittedly short attention-span) never flagging.The Island of the Day Before, on the other hand, left me feeling marooned, lost at sea. If that were Eco's purpose, some sort of analagous experience, he succeeded hands-down. I felt like a shipmate of Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, adrift on a stagnant ocean, with nary a puff of wind to set us in motion. It was almost as if Eco had poured so much of himself into writing &quot;Pendulum&quot; that he was intellectually and artistically spent when it came to writing this one. I find his discourses on Semiotics more entertaining than is this dead sea scroll.

The use of a lot ofhistorical facts (which I don't really know if they are true ornot) and the mention of ancient books aren't enough to createthat feeling of &quot;necessity&quot; to know what is going to happen next.After finishing it I had the sensation that the two last hundredpages were very similar to many Evangelion chapters in whichShinji Ikari tries to find the meaning of life.Evangelion is a japanese anime, and this review stands for thespanish version of the book."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"Umberto Eco has woven a tale of wonder and dread.

Certainly people will go on praising Eco (as they should), but TIDB remains a flacid exercise in overplotting. Eco has become a sort of literary Andy Warhol - selling his name more than his work. In trying to achieve a Kafkaesque \\"portrait of an instant\\", Eco merely puts on display what was better left as a study or exercise to be burned after his demise.The Island of the Day Before lacks virtually all of the elements that make a story worth reading. Indeed, Eco's inversion of the rules of good fiction is the main attraction for his works. But in The Island of the Day Before, the reader must trudge through all of Eco's autoerotic complexity solely for the sake of that complexity. Following is a parody of the sort of nonsense that permeates this book:\\"Robert opened the door to the cabin, and was confronted with the object of his dread. From the planked ceiling hung a hemp rope, knotted every three inches with an inverted half-stitch, each pinned through by a tortoiseshell ladypoker scented with ambergris. At the end of the rope, approximately four feet from the floor, and thus fourteen hands from a point bisecting a line drawn between Robert's right elbow and the cleft of his chin, was a metal hoop. The rope was fastened to the metal hoop with an overwrapping style, which Robert immediately recognized as the \\"Bosun's Burgher\\" favoured by the Patagonian fishermen. The metal ring was welded to a torus, and the center of the torus circumscribed a small teak box with a brass hasp and seven lotus shaped inlays. Each of the inlays contained a tiny portrait of one of the seven sybils standing on one of the seven hills of Rome, but only five of the sybils were depicted with their hands upraised. The other two sybils hand their hands clasped behind their backs. The first of the sybils with upraised hands was holding a rod, which twisted along its own length, with radial spikes of hexagonal cross section, each of which was terminated by an inverted cusp which was in turn pierced by a crescent. The ends of the crescents spiralled back in upon themselves, but they alternated, with some facing right and some facing left, and still others, in a trick of the artist's skill, facing directly toward the viewer's navel, no matter where one stood...\\""},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"I am a huge fan of Eco: The Name of the Rose, Foucault's Pendulum, Baudolino in particular.

However these alone do not make great writing.If I am honest I'd have to say that this is fairly badly written. It is barely coherent in places and, at the end, I am not entirely sure what the point of the novel was. Unless the point was to peer inside the mindset of a provincial Italian from a few centuries ago. However is that kind of subject matter worth an entire novel?As noted much of the fanfare seems to surround Eco's evident knowledge base, but this has not been put to good use in this attempt. The character seems very cartoonish at times, and the style of writing (jumping from past to present amongst other things) is clunky.If this were not attached to a great name I reckon we'd see many more negative comments and, indeed, it is so bad I doubt it would have been considered worthy of publishing."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"The first chapter was interesting.

Lurid and comic, it depicts the 17th century as is, and implies that baisically, the human race back then was the same as it is now, yet refreshinly new and stunningly original.In the marvelous book &quot;The world According To Garp&quot; it was said that the good writer writes something with leap of imagination, keeps all the charachter alive, especially those who die, and has a very good technique of writing.Eco and Weaver have accomplished all that, in a book which proved that the Literature world has a not stopped growing, changing, and climbing to higher altitudes.I have not not written a word about the plot, which hasn't been written on the cover of the book, for I will certainly spoil the thrill and once in a life-time experience of reading this novel.ENJOY!!!!"},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"A slim historical fact awkwardly dressed in a mildly-interesting stor"},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"I have simply loved every other novel by Umberto Eco I've read.

Franco-Spanish war, writing love letters to his obscure object of desire that he never delivers, then he's on some French ship trying to discover the secret of longitude, and something about a dog and sympathetic magic, then he's on some other ship full of weird clocks and plants and birds and aqua vitae and some unseen Other, who turns out to be a post-plague priest, all mixed up with an X-Files-type modus mysterium operandi that promises much but delivers little. &quot;But what's it ABOUT!?&quot; she asked again. After 300 pages and several weeks of labor, I conceded that I did not know. &quot;So why are you reading it?&quot; she asked.I realized that the only reason I had continued so long was because Eco has a reputation as a good author. I abandoned my efforts, and I would warn similarly unvigilant readers to beware: This book is a plot-free caricature of a good Eco novel. (cf. the previous reviewer's comment that &quot;the prose so perfectly transcends the plot&quot;). But I did not find the prose particularly good: some adolescent turns of phrases that rapidly become repetitive, long Latin neologisms looking like chapter titles, some cleverness (&quot;Aristotelean telescope&quot;) strewn amidst strings of impressively large words, and an awkward grammar filled with meaningless places and hard-to-remember names. If you haven't read this one, don't bother. Stick to &quot;Foucault's Pendulum&quot; (or perhaps some very good sci-fi; Fred Hoyle, for example), something that rewards your reading time with interest and not a studied boredom."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"I guess I have a different attitude to Umberto Eco than most Amazon readers, because I thought this book was superb--not quite as good as \\"The Name of the Rose,\\" but better than either \\"Baudolino\\" or \\"Foucault's Pendulum.\\" Parts of this book are simply wonderful, both when Eco is flashing back to Roberto's former life as well as when he's describing Roberto's life on the marooned ship. As usual, Eco tends to go off on plenty of philosophical, religious and scientific tangents. Some of these are delightful, some a tad irrelevant, depending on your individual proclivities--but as a reader, you can easily choose to skim through those that don't interest you, while paying more attention to the ones that catch your eye.The one thing that disappointed me a bit was the ending. Mainly, I was a victim of my own expectations--one of the earlier reviews led me to believe that there was some great revelation to be found at the end of the book. There is, I suppose, but not on the scale that I was expecting.If you've only read \\"The Name of the Rose,\\" you might find this book slightly perplexing; but if you're read other books by Eco, and enjoyed them, I can't imagine that you won't like this one. It's classic Eco, and in my opinion it's his most successful novel after \\"The Name of the Rose.\\""},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"Umberto Eco's a fantastic writer but for some reason he decided to write a book that takes place entirely just off the shore of a deserted island, with a castaway who's physical isolation is a metaphor for his relational detachment. I'll start by describing the problems with this novel and then conclude with the gems.The worst part is having the main character stranded and unmotivated just off the shore of this fabulous island. As a reader, I'm dying to get off the boat and onto the island! But the main character is happy to sit on the boat and just fantasize--it's more than a little frustrating.Another troublesome part is the very creative Latin-based words that the author--or perhaps the translator--uses. I'm an active reader and, as such, keep a list of any new words that I find in a novel. I actually reference the list, look them up, and then read again in context. During my reading of Island, I often found twenty such words per chapter. Some of these are archaic words from the middle ages (e.g. 'arquebuses' meaning heavy matchlock guns) while others seem to be creative constructions from Latin that do not appear in my collegiate dictionary. People with an unabridged dictionary (if these words are even in the unabridged dictionary) may not mind, but for me it was annoying to find many words, and thus important phrases, left undecyphered.Okay, now we're getting to the better parts of this novel. First, the characters are multi-dimensional, complex, funny and often somewhat contradictory: i.e., they seem real. You are drawn into a colorul, chaotic medieval world of intrigue, philosophy, romance and power politics. The characters are unforgettable, as are the crazy theories espoused in that time period...which get considerable play in the novel.Finally, the best part is the mental creation, on the part of the main character, of an identical twin brother who becomes resonsible for every misadventure and misfortune of the main character. He becomes so convinced of the other's existence that it starts to affect his destiny. This ongoing theme is likened to the new, at the time, Paris-spawned talk of 'unconscious concepts' that steer a man and thwart his otherwise conscious life. For the main character, this imaginary brother symbolizes the unconscious concepts and shows--even today--how often we have only ourselves to blame for our most tenacious problems.Overall, the writing makes reading the book a delight. Still, I give it only three stars because: a) Eco should know better than to write a novel where so much time is spent stranded alone on a boat with a more-than-a-little depressed main character, b) certain vocabulary choices--esp. the invented, dictionary-thwarting, Latin-based words--detract from the author's effort to reach even the seasoned reader, c) the ending leaves me feeling that Eco just stopped writing, rather than neatly ending this multi-threaded novel by tying a suitable bow. If you can stomach these aspects, perhaps by reading quickly, you'll yet enjoy the colorful characters and artful writing."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"This book was wonderful! Eco is a genius; he is a marvelous medievalist, wonderfully knowledgable in historical, philosophical, and theological matters of all kinds, and a brilliant novelist. The only reason I can see for a person to dislike this book (or any others that Eco has written) would be a short attention span or absolute ignorance of history and philosophy. These books are not for those who read Michael Crichton or Danielle Steele -- they are for readers who desire complicated characters, philosophy, beautiful imagery and a sense of a certain time and place over pointless action. I am rather disgusted with reviews that condemn this book for its supposed lack of &quot;plot.&quot; Literature is not merely about action and events, and it is sad that many people have missed the point. I would decidedly recommend this book to those who have even a minimal degree of intelligence. It is brilliant."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"After reading The Name of the Rose and Foucault's Pendulum, I could barely wait to get my hands on The Island of the Day Before. However, I was sadly disappointed. Having read other books by Eco, many of the philosophical meanderings contained in the text were not unexpected. But unlike his previous works, many of the long-winded descriptions of philosophy, scientific thought and theology in this text felt out of place. Rather than contributing to the plot, as they did in Eco's previous novels, they simply served to slow down the pace of the novel and leave the reader trying to remember what the book was about in the first place."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"I *love* Umberto Eco. Not just his popular works, but his articles. Here's a guy who loves writing, and he knows how to show it. He's erudite, but usually he can use his erudition to write entertaining yarns, even when writing short stories (his \\"pastiches\\") or scholarly articles.Here we have, though, a novel that would have fared better as a monography or a collection of articles. The ideas become the main characters of the work, but a novel is supposed to be entertaining, and a novel where the characters exist only as vehicles to express certain ideas becomes a chore to read--unless one is truly fascinated by the ideas per se.What Eco seems to be trying, though, is not to examine medieval ideas from our point of view, but to get into the head of the main character and see the world through the eyes of a person who lived in those times. Needless to say, all these ideas happen to be tied in with theological considerations that are, for the most part (and thankfully) not too relevant to the modern linguist, and perhaps not even to the modern medievalist.All in all, it's a book worthy of a careful read, but it fails where \\"The Name of the Rose\\" and \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\" delivered: it's just not entertaining. Get it from your local library.PS: The translation is excellent. I'd dare to say the English version is as good as the Italian original."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"THE NAME OF THE ROSE - In the 14th century, while Europe is in the midst of apocalyptic fanaticism and superstition, an English monk investigates a series of grisly murders in an Italian monastery.FOUCAULT'S PENDULUM - Three editors try to con a bunch of gullible occultists by coming up with a wild and ambitious conspiracy theory, until they start taking it too seriously and odd people start following their trail (or is it all in their heads?)BAUDOLINO - During the sack of Constantinople in 1204, an unreliable narrator recounts a fantastical tale in which he is present at major events of Frederick Barbarossa's reign and eventually travels east, seeking the mythological Kingdom of Prester John.THE ISLAND OF THE DAY BEFORE - um....well.....it's a 500-page description of a ship.Maybe that's an exaggeration, but Eco seems to have completely disregarded that time-honored literary device we've all come to know and love: a plot. Instead, we get endless digressions on Aristotelian classifications, love letters, the Void, the symbolism of a dove, infinite worlds, Roberto's imaginary evil twin brother, various attempts at determining longitude, etc etc etc. This is why many have questioned whether this book can even be called a \\"novel.\\" Maybe you will like this kind of thing, I don't know. But don't say I didn't warn you.I loved the other Eco books I've read, but this one was a real chore."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"\\"This was his forest, where he went as unhappy lovers go into forests; here was his invented nature ...\\" (106).Like most people, I fell in love with Umberto Eco's writings after the beautifully stimulating medieval novel, the Name of the Rose. Foucalt's Pendulum only added to my esteem with its esoteric, occult labyrinths of secret wisdom, Templar knights, conspiracies, detective-religious mystery, computers, philosophy and psychology. What next; where could the aging, but burgeoning author of novels possible go from there? The Island of the Day Before. It's a semiotic island-jungle; and good luck!I'm still not quite sure how to reckon with this one: Is it really a \\"novel\\" at all? Some reviewers & Eco fans find it to be exotically, inter-galatic; others, simply a dry, humorless mess - one of Eco's least attractive novels (although it appears from a quick glance of reviews that the same split has occurred twice more with Baudolino & Queen Loana). I guess I'm in the middle on this one, slightly leaning towards giving Eco the benefit of the doubt. Although I read it a few months ago (too often with a glass of wine in hand) I still haven't come to terms with it; partially because having read a few, generally insipidly pedantic, but informative, essays from Rocco Capozzi's \\"Reading Eco\\" (1997) I learned a little bit more about semiotics, confirming my original thoughts while reading the Island of the Day Before that the book is a palimpsest; there are several layers - often to be reckoned with simultaneously - and the book must be re-read.Ostensibly there's a story there. It's taken from the journal (each of Eco's previous novels derrive from mysterious manuscripts) of a 17th century Italian noble named Roberto who fights in the 30 Years War, ends up in Paris, hob-nobs with other noblemen, as well as the Cardinals Richlieu and Mazzarin and winds up shipwrecked on a ship at the international date-line. In fact, the whole story/stories is/are really his creations and/or Eco's wanderings in time.There's lot's of interesting 17th century marginallia, characters, ideas, thoughts, art, and so on. Eco captures the spirit of the age, as far as I can tell, with his use of technologies & ventures of the day such as the search for longitude, medicines (although, I'm not sure about the wounding of the dog episodes), diving bells, telescopes, weapons, and so forth. He also incorporates an amazing amount of material from the literature of the period, expressing philosophy, poetry and science through various characters. On the flip side, Eco doesn't really capture 17th century speech patterns, in my opinion. Maybe I'm off here and people in the 17th century did speak like this, but the language sometimes comes across as pretty modern to me; I hear Eco more than his characters. It's as though he can't keep himself out of the novel. But maybe I'm on to something that's intended. I guess I'm becoming an Eco-apologist! The love story is somewhat romantic, but what captivated me more-so were insightful lines like: \\"Love makes us the enemy of ourselves\\" (117), or \\"Presence takes the edge off hunger, and distance sharpens it\\" (124). What would be really, really helpful would be a \\"key\\" in the vein of Haft & White's \\"The Key to the Name of the Rose\\" (1997) - there's plenty of potential here for Eco scholars.Anyway, let me warn the masses here. The VERY heavy, covert doses of semiotics (signs & symbols) as well as overt verbosity (have a dictionary nearby, preferably the OED!) threaten to get in the way of the story and is going to be off-putting to most readers looking for a \\"good story\\" to delve into. You won't make it through. That said, if you're even remotely interested in semiotics, philosophy, the 17th century, or the post-modern novel, you'll find a gold mine here. And, as a bonus, you'll probably get (or at least appreciate) the symbolism of the mysterious orange dove. Something to let seep into your soul...This is a book I simultaneously liked and disliked many times in the reading it. This is why 3-stars seems appropriate and honest here: the book was not always enjoyable to read, took some work, and came across as pedantic & even narcissistic at times. Eco's name, afterall, is larger than the title and that bugs. But Eco has a scholarly reputation which pre-dates his novel writing by decades, and whose ever met a PhD without an eco, I mean \\"EGO\\" :-) Overtime, I've found the book to be thought-provoking and rewarding in varying ways. I'm still trying to figure out how exactly, but I am glad I finished it. At the very least it was a unique adventure into the 17th century.Eco will be read many, many years hence and will probably go down as one of the greats of our times. I'm looking forward to Baudolino and other Eco works.\\"...he made the wounded city into the Land of his personal unsated Tenderness, an island of his solitude\\" (124)."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"...I can say that with near certainty. His professional field is the esoteric world of semiotics, or basically the science and philosophy of symbols - the same sort of thing that Dan Brown called \\"symbology\\" in his pathetic novels. That being said, it's easy to see in Eco's writing an intense affection for mystery, for illusion, for double and treble meanings, for duplicity, for hairpin turn endings. \\"The Island...\\" tells two stories, one of a young man's meandering life through the pitfalls of a Renaissance existence, and the other the surreal set piece of a man, suddenly awakening on a stranded ship, with a strange island in the distance. He doesn't know how he got there, where he is, or how to get home. Either of these tales might make really entertaining novellas, but these two odd birds are joined at the hip by making the main character the same man. And to confuse us more, we segue back and forth between the stories, keeping us always off balance slightly. About two thirds of the way through, it simply became more work than it was worth to hang on to this heeling ship of a novel, but I plowed ahead to the ending, eager for the release.If all this makes it sound like a wasted reading experience, I assure you it wasn't. Very few people can put you in the past quite as effectively as Eco (Patrick O'Brian can actually do it better) and I saw this world in such vivid color it nearly made me blink. I didn't have to invent faces or accents for the characters, they leapt off the page. Eco's writing is luxuriant, erudite, expansive - you will either learn a lot of new words or quit looking them up after a while - and I can't imagine a better read to really take you completely out of your present existence and plunk you down someplace entirely new and very strange, much like our protagonist found himself. It's just that, for all the sound and fury, not a lot seems to really happen, and at the end of the day I felt that I wanted something that wasn't there. Perfect vacation or travel-time reading."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"The Island of the Day Before is basically one half a science fiction novel written from the point of view of society several hundred years ago and one half timeless romance.The story takes place during a time period when new methods to calculate longitude were becoming increasingly important with the increase in exploration of the new world. The narrator of this book spends much of the novel exploring then current theories of how to calculate longitude, some of which are now easy to laugh at (such as the use of sympathetic wounds on dogs), although all the theories may have seemed logical at the time.The most interesting misunderstanding in this novel, however, is regarding the international dateline. The narrator of the novel is stranded on a ship wrecked off the coast of an island through which the international dateline passes. Passages in which the narrator describes how he wound up in such a position alternate with passages in which he describes his attempts to reach the island in the belief that if he passes through the date line that he will travel back in time a day and, e.g., be able to save the life of his companion who drowned the day before. However, while this misunderstanding is humourous, Eco's portrayal of the narrator's desire and need for his theory to be true is rather poignant. Unfortunately, the science can get a bit thick at times and I did find it a bit difficult to wade through some of the longer discourses on astronomy, but it was still worthwhile to make the effort.Making the effort worthwhile is a back story that reads like a cross between Dumas and Poe, filled with strong romance and intrigue. Amongst the plot elements are dopplegangers, conspiracies, and such characters as Cardinal Richleu. As with most Eco novels, it is helpful if the reader is actually interested in history. However Eco is talented enough at bringing historical periods to life that even the most casual historian will be interested.Ultimately, I did not find this book as intellectually stimulating as Foucault's Pendulum, but it was more emotionally powerful. I very much look forward to Eco's next novel."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"What I really like about Eco is the difficulty of reading coupled with the rewards at the end of the effort.

With that perspective, &quot;Island&quot; comes alive!"},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"I generally enjoy Eco's work. Name of the Rose was one of the best novels I've yet had the pleasure of reading. Focault's Pendulum was a little overdone, somewhat meandering, and ended poorly, but was nonetheless an extraordinary blend of the fanciful, the factual, and the metaphysical that left the reader uncertain where one ended and the others began. This book, to be frank, sucks. The parody carries the book for about 50 pages, the remainder is an exercise in boredom, meaningless (if occasionally amusing)ancillary tales, and a conclusion that is even more pointless than the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Island of the Day Before","review":"Yet another masterpiece from Eco.

The baroque mind elucidated and embodied. Stories within stories within stories, and all framed in the interpretation of an imaginary author from an unknown manuscript.

But for an extended meditation on life and thought, this is great stuff.

This text, more than any other text for the clinician, develops the reader's understanding for the Panjabi model of spinal function and thus the differences between the traditional strengthening model of rehabilitation and the vastly more evidence-based motor control/ motor re-education model demanded by the current literature.At a time when there remains tremendous confusion regarding the concept of spinal stability in healthy and pathologic populations, this text should be considered fundamental to any clinician's preparation for work with spinal populations.Richardson et al have done an excellent job of summarizing the research-based foundations for their segmental stabilization clinical model. The clinical approach has of course evolved somewhat since publication of this text; however, it remains a 'must read' for its clear delineation of the fact that LBP is problem of impaired motor control, not an impairment of strength. The implications for clinical practice here are tremendous.As an adjunct to the text, I would strongly encourage clincians to seek out the courses taught by Dr. Paul Hodges, co-author of this text, as a means to verify their interpretation of the clinical model."},{"Title":"The Sweet Life: Reflections on Home and Garden","review":"THE SWEET LIFE is a short book filled with somewhat profound thoughts Laura Stoddart compiled from famous and not-so-famous sources and beautiful illustrations she apparently drew.

But this book is a WASTE of your money!Filled with inaccurate information (like &quot;wine contains pro-antistatins&quot; Does he mean proanthocyanidins? Also, &quot;Take liquid acidophilus to increase your intake of fiber to 50 grams per day.&quot; Acidophilus contains NO fiber! Did anyone edit this book before publishing??) and misspellings (&quot;Benign prosthetic hypoplasia&quot; instead of the correct benign prostatic hyperplasia; &quot;propellus&quot;, which should be propolis, and many, oh so VERY many more), this book does more harm than good. Particularly as, since his name carries so much weight, people will go with his recommendations (like taking 100 mg of echinacea for immune support, or red clover for curcuminoids) over those of someone who may be less well known, but more intelligent.Dont buy this book.

At 14 I called him on the phone to ask him how to to become a Navy pilot. He realized I was a star-struck kid and was polite and encouraging. Now, 17 years later, I've been a Navy pilot for almost 10 years. I often think back to the days that I dreamed of flying and I have to say that \\"The Cutting Edge\\" was one of the biggest influences and motivations from my childhood. It was his photographs and the world that they depicted that gave me the motivation and pushed me forward through college and flight school and ultimately to earn my wings of gold. I lent my copy of the book to a friend 14 years ago (who is now an F-16 pilot), and I never got it back. So, I decided to buy another copy to show my wife (and hopefully someday my kids). I want to show my family what this book has meant to me throughout my life, and how you really can make your dreams come true if you take an image from a book, or whatever, and decide to make it come true. C.J., if you ever check this site, I just want to say Thank You. You helped me make my dreams come true and I can never fully express to you what that has meant to me. I'm finally in those skies you captured years ago. Thank You."},{"Title":"The Cutting Edge","review":"Like Navy Pilot said, I read this book when I was a kid and remember the vivid pictures depicting Navy life. I remember looking at the photos, which include a brief descriptive paragraph, and thinking \\"this is something I want to do\\". Military flying wasn't in the cards, but I'm currently a major airline pilot and attribute reaching my goals to this book. For anyone who has a love of aviation, or knows someone who is interested, this is a great book to light the fire.A quote I remember from the book, when he photographed the F-18, \\"There are those who fly the F-18, and those who wish they did!\\" I don't have personal experience, but after all these years that is a quote I remember.All in all, a great book, with great photographs, that will make a great addition to your library.I think I said \\"great\\" multiple times in this review. Need I say more?"},{"Title":"The Cutting Edge","review":"I, too, got this book as a kid when it was new from the PX at NAS Oceana.

He is at sea now, and I sent him this book because of how much he loves to fly. He wrote to tell me how much he likes the book and how he has shared it with his friends. It's a terrific book for someone who loves planes and flying."},{"Title":"The Cutting Edge","review":"This is an epic pictorial of the US Navy of the 1980's. \\"Edge\\" came out in the 1980's, in the wake of the popularity over \\"Top Gun\\", though it does less to cash in on the hype than generate its own. (Remember how in 1986, leather aviator jackets covered in patches like some old steamer trunk were all the rage?) With George Hall's \\"Top Gun\\", \\"Edge\\" occupied a spot on my bookshelf, but never sat unread very long. Heatley's camera picks up life aboard an aircraft carrier - mostly on deck. Though an F-14 pilot, Heatley also captures the adventures of those who fly \\"Helos\\", Hawkeye radar planes, Viking sub-hunters, Corsair strike fighters, Intruder bombers, tankers, and ELInt planes. \\"Edge\\" is mostly a picture book - with little emphasis on telling very detailed stories. Nevertheless, between thin blurbs from shipmates and Heatley's pictures, a very nuanced picture of carrier aviation comes across - F-14's going supersonic or dogfighting against each other; Sea-Knight helicopters bringing needed supplies; deck-crew managing millions of dollars worth of hardware on a pitching carrier deck; a mammoth warship is dwarfed by the vast seas in a great vista shot; stricken planes making emergency barricade landings; Soviet planes being intercepted near the carrier. (I doubt that the Tu-95 \\"Bear\\" has ever appeared so classically beautiful by Soviet photogs.) Mid-way through, Heatley goes to Miramar to capture the sights of legendary Top-Gun (since moved to Yuma) and also capture the (then) new F/A-18 which was just entering the fleet. Heatley gets some great shots of aggressor pilots and their planes - McDonnel Skyhawks and Northrop Tigers with Soviet-style paint jobs - but the results aren't as dramatic as those achieved on the carrier (maybe the rigors of naval aviation have a way of creating their own narrative.)Heatley's pictures are incredible - it's hard to believe that they're being taken while the guy is driving a $36 million plane (one of his shots appears as a mural in the bar scene in \\"Top Gun\\".)While the pictures are unforgettable, \\"Edge\\" excels in the uncommon and still unsurpassed sincerity that Heatley brings out of his crewmates. They're faithful to their roles as strike-fighter aviators or helo drivers, but aren't afraid to talk about their limits (we know that the Corsair doesn't come with the bells and whistles of an F-14, but its pilots appreciate being able to make all the decisions themselves; sub hunting isn't a fast-moving job, but Viking crewmen appreciate the thrill of the chase). If you want a more detailed story of Navy carrier aviation, I'd recommend George Hall's book - which has some great pictures to be sure, but nothing that can touch the visual splendor of \\"The Cutting Edge\\"."},{"Title":"The Cutting Edge","review":"As a long time airdale/sailor this is the only book of it the kind.

It's not an easy book to find so when the description states that it's in good condition, it would be expected to be received as such."},{"Title":"Manwatching A Field Guide to Human Behavior","review":"Again and again, Morris' writing displays itself as the work of a purely humanistic scientist. His style is excellent, his scientific method cannot be faulted. His observations are concise and thoughtful, well-worded and intelligent. However, I cannot agree with what seems to be his prevailing opinion - that man is purely an animal, sometimes better, more often worse than the other animals that he shares the planet with. Morris' stream of what he no doubt considers to be purely rational thought leans toward being offensive to persons of faith - persons who believe that humankind is a species that differs from his animal neighbours in a profound and fundamental way. He seems to have lumped Humankind in with the rest of the life on the planet, and while it is true that man is as much a part of this planet's life as any other life form, it is also true that man is a creature with an imagination that sets him apart from his animal neighbours. Humans possess souls that animals cannot fathom. This is the major shortcoming of Morris' research: that he has overlooked the imagination and emotional sentience of humankind. Man may be no better than an animal with regard to issues of savagery, war, and conflict resolution. But on the other hand, man has the capability to analyze his own actions and to distinguish between right and wrong. Mr. Morris would do well to turn his own analytical skills toward himself, if ever he should need proof of this."},{"Title":"Sacajawea,: A guide and interpreter of the Lewis & Clark expedition, with an account of the travels of Toussaint Charbonneau, and of Jean Baptiste, the expedition papoose","review":"Readers may enjoy knowing that the original publication of this intriguing book was 1932, and that Grace Hebard was a political economist and otherwise important figure in the development of the Universiy of Wyoming.

The city is rich in history and full of a number of buildings, monuments and historic areas. Through the years, the city has changed and developed around these landmarks. Washington D.C., Then and Now traces this development and change through pictures.The premise behind the book is to show the reader each area of the city as it appeared using archival photographs on one page, and comparing it to a recent picture of the same area, taken from approximately the same location, to demonstrate how the area has evolved.The author has organized the book by street name or area. The earliest known picture of the Capitol, taken in 1846, is the most famous picture (Only seven are known to exist). There is an interesting story about how the rare picture was obtained. You'll have to get the book to find out.Whether you have traveled to Wahington DC or are just interested in the pictoral history of our nation's capital, the book has a lot to offer. It also makes an excellent coffee table book for your guests to peruse."},{"Title":"Washington, D.C., Then and Now (Then & Now)","review":"Having seen a few other books showing historical photos of different cities' landmarks and their modern looks, I was interested to see what this book would offer. I was not disappointed, fiding the choice of subjects ranging form the famous to the obscure, painting a picture of a Washington long ago.With many of the more famous buildings in Washington having been built in the last 70 years, there aren't as many older structural pictures to hold up against a view of the current looks. This is often refelcted by what originally stood on the site, and then the facing page shows what is built on the site now. Obviously, there are pictures showing the White House, Capitol, and a few other notable buildings to examine for small changes, but the majority of the book features things the average visitor wouldn't normally notice.To people who have spent some time in this great city, they would greatly appreciate where the modern looks and everyday scenery has come from. To the average reader, this book would be an interesting coffee table book to entertain the curious."},{"Title":"Washington, D.C., Then and Now (Then & Now)","review":"This book is pretty good to see a historical comparison of Washington DC \\"then\\" vs. \\"now.\\" The most disappointing aspect here is that a lot of the current pictures seem to have been taken on the same overcast late fall/early winter day. Washington DC is one of the most beautiful cities in the world but a lot of the current pictures don't capture that. The historical pictures and overall comparisons are pretty good though and I would have rated this a \\"5\\" if they had done a better job capturing the city's beauty. A solid \\"4\\" none the less."},{"Title":"Washington, D.C., Then and Now (Then & Now)","review":"I've lived in DC for 11 years and was really hoping for a fun coffee-table book showing LIFE then and now. Instead, this book focuses on the big buildings, which pretty much all look exactly the same. \\"Look! It's the National Archives in 1926! And in 2000!\\" The difference? Color. And so on, page after page, same big impersonal building on the left (in black and white), exact same building on the right (in color). If anything, it's a testament to the consistency of stone and marble.To be fair, there are a handful of interesting (if standard) images: the swamps around the Lincoln Memorial, the early Capitol building, the White House with sheep, the old stone house at 17th & Constitution. But really, I've seen these before and they certainly aren't enough to justify the book.At least it's a nice looking, well printed book. I'll leave it on the coffee-table for now.

If you are not familiar with the concept, old photographs of particular street corners or buildings are contrasted with corresponding current images. The author displays his detailed knowledge of the area as he recounts stories that accompany each set of photos.Due to the consistency of some of the buildings in Washington, D. C., the main difference between pictures of a certain structure from 100+ years ago and today is only that one is black and white while the newer one is in color.

Although we eat vegetarian food 99 percent of the time, I actually welcomed a cookbook that combines meat and vegetarian recipes--it will make a great gift for some of the &quot;mixed&quot; couples in our life (carnivores/vegetarians). Besides, it's a snap to convert the meat recipes to vegetarian by simply leaving out the meat and/or substituting it with tofu, tempeh, bulgur or the like.But now to the good stuff: I can't emphasize enough how FANTASTIC the cheesecake recipe is in this cookbook! Until now, the New York cheesecake from a certain membership warehouse had been our yardstick for great cheesecake, but this recipe has it beat hands down. Fantastic flavor and texture. Other dessert standouts are the bread pudding recipes, which are delicious and healthy at the same time.As a main course, the Chickpeas in Eggplant-Tahini Sauce is a delicious dish and tastes like you put a lot more time into preparation than is actually the case. It's always a treat when you can put together something like this to wow guests. Another favorite is the Split Pea-Vegetable Soup with Mint Cream. I LOVE the counterpoint the mint cream makes with this hearty soup. And you just can't beat the convenience of a pressure cooker when it comes to making extremely flavorful meals in a short amount of time. We've converted a number of friends to pressure cookers, and they've never regretted it.

However, this book is for the bored, more advanced cook. Recipes are a little more time consuming, with ingredients that one does not always have in their cupboard. I find that I do not use this book as much as some others. If you are just learning to use the pressure cooker, I would not recommend this book.

I found Lorna Sass's recipes to have clearer instructions and a higher success rate.Since then, I have become addicted to &quot;Split Pea Soup with Smoked Turkey&quot;, page 91! The &quot;Smoked Turkey Risotto with Corn and Roasted Red Pepper&quot; on page 93 was also tasty, but it seemed like a lot of work to end up with what resembled an adult macaroni and cheese.I was grateful that Lorna Sass's book included a full repertoire of pressure cooker basics: various stocks, beans and rice, plus beef stew. Sass's chicken stock had the same list of ingredients as in &quot;Joy of Cooking&quot;, but the broth was more gelatinous due to the pressure cooker. That was a mixed blessing, because I had always enjoyed &quot;Joy of Cooking&quot;'s version as a chicken soup, using extra chicken pieces to thicken the broth, but adding back the chicken meat and the still recognizable vegetables to have a soup verging on stew. The pressure cooker version turned the vegetables to mush, but my husband was delighted that I added some egg noodles instead to the soup.All in all, the book combines basic and sexy recipes, with a high probability of success.

The minestrone soup is delicious and takes only 4 minutes! I'm happy the book includes a number of recipes for beans - as well as lots of vegetables. The chilies, both The Black Bean Chili With Squash and Corn and Turkey Chili, are family favorites. The lamb stew with white wine, prunes and apricots melts into a luscious sauce to accompany fork-tender lamb (in 16 minutes). Previous to buying this book, my favorite beef stew cooked for almost 3 hours in the oven. The Old-fashioned Beef Stew in The Pressured Cook takes 30 minutes and is so delicious.

Moreover, the dishes offer a nutritionally healthy alternative to prepackaged processed products and pre-prepared meals that are proliferating in the marketplace today.

Lorna Sass was touted to be the &quot;Mother of Pressure Cooking&quot;. Meanwhile, I have not been impressed with a majority of the recipes in her book. Complaints: She uses the weirdest ingredients that are probably available in NYC but not in the suburbs of Boston. Come on, what market DOESN'T stock fresh Swiss Chard? Well, Lorna ... almost no stores stock fresh Swiss Chard. The thing is that going to find all the exotic ingredients is contradictory to the concept of pressure cooking! It is supposed to be fast but if you spend days looking for weird ingredients that's not saving you any time. My other complaint is that that a lot of the recipes just aren't that good. I think she stretches the envelope too much in trying to do crazy stuff and it just doesn't turn out well. I tried the &quot;BBQ Chicken and Corn&quot; and the &quot;Lentils and Swiss Chard&quot;. They were both bland an unappealing.

I've been cooking from her \\"Ecological Kitchen\\" since it was published a couple years after I bought my pressure cooker but still didn't really know what to do with it. I enjoy Lorna's focus on ecology, health, culinary history . . . as well as gadgets. I'm more or less an everyday cook, who is more interested in putting dinner on the table than spending time in the kitchen. When I saw \\"The Pressured Cook\\" published, I began to use the pressure cooker to cook meat as well. These recipes can give my daily cooking a touch of sophistication, and they give me reasons to keep using the pressure cooker on a regular basis. Her dishes (and of course the exotic, hissing contraption they come out of) always impress guests, who will assume your command of the technology produced the delicious results.A Pressured OmnivoreSan Francisco, California"},{"Title":"The Pressured Cook : Over 75 One-Pot Meals In Minutes, Made In Today's 100% Safe Pressure Cookers","review":"Lorna Stass is the queen of pressure cooking.

Her recipes are not disappointing - she obviously is as interested in eating well as any of the people who love her books.

However, after skimming through and looking at many of the recipes, I did not want to try any of them. In addition, I did not want to have to figure out how to convert the recipes from this book that used older pressure cookers to my more modern one.

We asked her to stay over for dinner and, thanks to your delicious recipe, the dinner was ready in 7 minutes... Furthermore I could enjoy our friend's company rather than being at the stove adding broth and stirring.:)I must say that I didn't find any difference in the risotto cooked in the traditional way or under pressure .

I made several of these recipes. They were largely complicated, took a long time to put together, and required ingredients that I had to spend some time looking for at the store. To me, this defeats the purpose of a pressure cooker. For the time it took to make some of these, I might as well have done it in the oven or the stovetop. I am interested in fast, tasty meals from the pressure cooker, not gourmet pressure cooker recipes. If I want a gourmet meal, I know how to fix one the regular way. Unfortunately, the dishes, after all the effort, were very bland.

It was so good that even if there were only a couple of other good recipes in the book, I knew I had to own it.I rarely used my pressure cooker, and wasn't looking for an appliance specific cookbook, I simply wanted good food. After seven years, this is still my favorite cookbook. The fact that these dishes can be made so quickly is a bonus, but the proof of the recipes is that I am now considered to be a good cook!

In the book you see the Irish discriminating the English, the English discriminating the black. Inspite of this discrimination Lara's parents loved each other.Now reading this book is not simple.It is not Chaucer, or Shakespeare but the book has been written in poetry form.There is also a family tree diagram so that the reader could comprehend Lara's background."},{"Title":"Lara","review":"There are Laras and Taiwos and Ellens and Ediths everywhere. Young girls who hate their hair because it's not fashionable, old ladies who serve tea in fine China while their guests chatter and sip respectably, middle aged men who are torn between a home faraway and the land of their perceived dreams, young women cut off from their family for marrying the wrong skin. What makes this book so enjoyable is that inasmuch as the characters in the book are carefully crafted to live their own lives in their own worlds, they seem to resonate elsewhere and one feels one has bumped into them several times before. The lyrical, humourous and most accessible style makes it a book you want to return to - the voices become rhythms of feeling that penetrate through the skin to tickle and tease, and the thoughts dig into the flesh to provoke and prod - sometimes a giggle and sometimes a lurking tear."},{"Title":"Lara","review":"Bernardine Evaristo's Lara is a lyrical articulation of a grand millenial vision. Patiently crafted from shimmering shards of memory, it's a sweeping mosaic that refracts the histories of Nigeria, Britain and Brazil in a way that will forever color the way in which we understand the ways in which the past both illuminates and foreshadows the future."},{"Title":"Lara","review":"A friend gave me Lara for Christmas and at first I wasn't sure what to expect as it is a verse novel and I've never read one before. I was more than pleasantly surprised. Lara is a most astonishing book, full of surprises and inventiveness, and although I found it easy to read I also wanted to slow down and savour the writing. The characterisation is amazing, sometimes summing up the essence of a character in a few wonderfully poetic words. The beauty of the writing is breathtaking and it felt like I was in a dream being taken across centuries and continents. The story had depth and clarity, passion and wisdom and by the time I had finished it I wanted to go back and read it again, to savour every word again and experience the joy of reading it again. In fact I am now on to my third reading. The story also says much about the mixed-race experience and about mixed marriages. In fact miscegenation is at the core of the book - how a Nigerian and a white British woman marry and fare in a racially hostile London in the 50s, 60s and 70s and how one of their children Lara, comes to terms with her dual heritage. But the book has much to say to everyone and transcends boundaries of race and nationality. There are no stereotyped baddies or goodies, more, why people do the things they do, is explored Their are passages of description which are so vivid I was there, I could see it, smell it, touch it. There are moments in the book which are hysterically funny and I had to laugh out loud, and their are moments where the pain turned my stomach. I think this has to be one of the most significant books produced this century. The writer has the depth, clarity and vision expected of one of the century's great writers and I am sure we will be hearing a lot more about her."},{"Title":"The Collected Works of G.K. Chesterton: The Illustrated London News, 1911-1913","review":"Having just read GKC's essays from 1929-1931, I noticed quite a difference in these earlier works. Here, his insights are not quite as penetrating, his humor not quite as sharp. Still, Chesterton on a bad day is better than most social/political/spiritual commentators on a good day.Recurrent themes/subjects in this volume include:1. The anti-democratic tendencies of England which arise in part from an immoral concentration of wealth among the ruling class.2. England's immoral and irrational laws against the poor, and England's treatment of the poor in general.3. Feminism and the Suffrage movement.Also of interest are a couple essays reflecting on the disaster of the Titanic.All in all, worth reading, but I found the volumes covering the years just before and during WWI far more interesting."},{"Title":"False Pretenses (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"This is my first Catherine Coulter contemporary that I have read, I have all of her romances.

The plot was fast moving and kept you guessing &quot;who done it&quot; until it was revealed and then it was &quot;when will he strike for the kill&quot; that kept you reading till the end.

The first one was &quot;The Edge&quot; (which was very good.) I look forward to picking up another one of her books very soon. &quot;False Presences&quot; reminded me of some books written by Sidney Sheldon. That is probably what I liked most about it.Elizabeth is suddenly placed in a high profile court case with the dead of her husband and then because very rich after her aquittal. She must now make it in the world of business which she knows nothing about. Her husband's family is out to get her and ruin her. The family is run by the mother-in-law who believes Elizabeth has killed her son.There is lying and bethrayal,love and hate all the makings of a great book. What I most liked about the books was the friendship that developed with Elizabeth and her step-daughter,Catherine. Catherine started off in the book as a woman scorned and turned out to be a true friend.This books had wonderfully developed characters and constantly kept me changing my mind &quot;who did it.&quot;"},{"Title":"False Pretenses (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"You've read the synopsis, so I won't restate the story. I found this book to be fun and easy to read. It kept me guessing all along as to who the real killer was. For someone just breaking into the suspense novel genre, this was an easy way to do it.The metamorphosis of Elizabeth from a sensitive, caring artist to the hard-nosed business woman to the loving woman and friend was entertaining to watch. Some fun plot twists keep you interested and cheering for the characters. Despite their initial evil appearances, you find yourself wanting them to do well.I read the updated &quot;2000&quot; version and it was pretty good and mostly believable except for a few things that seemed a little unrealistic - like come on - would any of these people been without a cell phone in this day and age? Suspend your belief just slightly and it will definitely keep you hooked."},{"Title":"False Pretenses (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

I didn't care much for the hero, he seemed like a man taken from her historical novels and didn't fit well in contemporary settings...He was a jerk at the beginning, then instantly loved her, and I didn't sense the connection that CC was going for. She probably could have made Ro the hero and I would have received him better. What I was hoping most for was Adrian and Liz to get together, he sounded perfect!!! Overall, though, this was a book that kept me reading."},{"Title":"False Pretenses (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","review":"Although this was a fast read, too many of the characters were unappealing and associated loose ends were too neatly tied up with life changes that seemed forced. Also, any woman with a shred of self-respect would never have done an about-face and fallen into the arms of a man who spewed such initial cruel venom and vicious words at her.

Elizabeth Carleton is married to Timothy Carleton, a very rich man. He gets stabs with an ice pick and is killed. Elizabeth goes on trial for his murder but is proven innocent. Timothy's whole family is fighting a war to try and get Timothy's business and his money away from Elizabeth (the heir). This novel is mostly a family bickering session. Near the end of the novel Elizabeth trys to discover who killed Timothy, is it the mysterious person who testified on her behalf, her new lover, or a business associate?

I would recommend it for those who are interested in the history of noni, but when recommending it to customers, I would clarify a statement made at the end of the book regarding taking noni and medication together, rending both ineffective. The author does not make it clear whether that means not taking them together at the same moment, or discontinuing use of medications while drinking noni for a period of time. Scientists have recommended drinking noni 20 minutes before taking any medication or eating, without any adverse effects. So to avoid confusion, I would emphasize that no one should stop taking their prescription medications without their doctor's consent."},{"Title":"Noni: Aspirin of the Ancients","review":"NONI is a decidedly enchanting book of fact and herbal wisdom with a friendly folklore feel to it.

Essentially covering the history of money, finances and economics, he concisely boils down the subject matter making it easy to understand and delightful to read. From time to time he throws in his own political comments. Not quite light reading but definitely fun."},{"Title":"Age of Uncertainty","review":"John Kenneth Galbraith was nearing retirement when he spent three years preparing a television series on economics with the BBC. THE AGE OF UNCERTAINTY is the book prepared as a companion. Galbraith's book, MONEY: WHENCE IT CAME, WHERE IT WENT (1975) was also published while the television series was being prepared, and attempts to cover material that coincides with Chapter 6, The Rise and Fall of Money in THE AGE OF UNCERTAINTY. As America has become a financial empire second to none in the global economy, economics and politics seem to be joining to form a consensus similar to the situation in Paris in 1719. \`It is to that year that we owe the useful French word \\"millionaire.\\" ' (p. 172).People who are familiar with the kind of balance currently thought necessary for public television in the United States might be surprised at how negatively Galbraith is able to spin the lessons he finds at the end of previous prosperities, like \\"There was no way to go but down, and presently this became evident.\\" (p. 172). Galbraith also displays a tremendous amount of pleasure in pointing out contributions made by the Scotch economists, Adam Smith, David Dale, and Robert Owen who, \\"In time, the work day for children was reduced to ten and a half hours, and children under twelve were never employed. It's an indication of how things were elsewhere that this was considered lenient. Because of his compassion Owen was always in trouble with his partners. They would have much preferred a tough, down to earth manager who would get a day's work out of the little bastards.\\" (p. 30). John Law, son of an Edinburgh goldsmith, established the Banque Royale in Paris in 1716, taking \\"over the debts of the Regent and of the realm.\\" (p. 170). For a few years, everyone expected the bank's notes to be paid by silver and gold from \\"all the land north from the Gulf of Mexico to Minnesota and east from the Rockies to the Alleghenies.\\" (p. 172). The Mississippi Company had absolute title to the territory, sold stock, and \\"Government creditors who were paid off in the notes then rushed to buy stock in the Banque Royale or in the Mississippi Company. From the money so invested more could be lent to the government, yet more notes could go out and yet more stock could be sold. It was a complete closed-circle system for recycling worthless paper.\\" (p. 172). At the companies headquarters, \\"Those who got inside asked Law to sell them stock. Women investors, the histories tell, offered themselves as an added inducement. This must have been an unprecedented experience for someone from Scotland.\\" (p. 172).As a companion book, not everything it contains was shown on television, and Galbraith might be exceeding the good taste of his presumed television audience when he records in print, \\"But nothing could disguise the elementary fact that the Banque Royale could not pay, that the notes were now worthless. Law only narrowly escaped Paris with his life. Parisians got what pleasure they could from a song that recommended that the paper be put to the most vulgar possible use.\\" (p. 174).The Vietnam war appears a few times in this book, which was not published until Americans had been evacuated from Nam and Cambodia. After a picture of corpses and vultures in India, 1946, on page 128, an armed American is shown standing on the American embassy wall in Vietnam in 1975 as a dozen Vietnamese attempt to climb the wall by pulling themselves up on barbed wire that previously was strung over the heads of people on the sidewalk outside the embassy. Through the years when America entered the fight for free enterprise and freedom in Asia, and then television made it easy to see, Nam gets mentioned as a digression from purely economic considerations, for the benefit of a political system that, \\"In Vietnam we governed or sought to govern through Diem, Ky, and Thieu; they were not called princes, sultans or chiefs but freely chosen rulers.\\" (pp. 130-131). Further thoughts on Vietnam appear in Chapter 8, The Fatal Competition, which starts with Eisenhower warning about the military-industrial complex in 1961, and a high official of the Department of State telling Galbraith in 1974, \\"To understand this world you must know that the military establishments of the United States and the Soviet Union have united against the civilians of both countries.\\" (p. 227).I take particular interest in Nam because it served as a worst case test for what people were willing to think about American society in the years that created great uncertainty on a personal level. When Galbraith came back from India in October, 1962, \\"I went to the theater one evening with President and Mrs. Kennedy. . . . He told me, with much feeling, of the recklessness of the advice he had received during the crisis. The worst, he said, was from those who were afraid to be sensible.\\" (p. 248). \\"Kennedy sent me to Vietnam in the autumn of 1961. A report from Maxwell Taylor and Walt W. Rostow had urged greater involvement, including troops. (They would be disguised, rather imaginatively, as flood control workers.) Kennedy was distressed and guessed I might have a different view.\\" (p. 334). It is almost too much to ask an author to risk being remembered as a supporter of a poet-politician, but look:\\"Of all the men I've known in politics, Eugene McCarthy had the most subtle mind and by far the greatest sense of the music of words. He was, indeed, the first serious poet in the American political pantheon. In speaking for his nomination in Chicago, I said this might not yet be the age of John Milton but it was no longer the age of John Wayne or John Connally. . . . delegates sitting near, . . . jumped to their feet and proposed sexual violence on Connally.\\" (p. 335)."},{"Title":"Age of Uncertainty","review":"John Kenneth Galbraith (1908-2006) was a Canadian-American economist, who taught at Harvard University, served as U.S. Ambassador to India (1961-1963), and wrote a number of bestselling books, such asAmerican Capitalism,The Affluent Society (A Mentor Book),The New Industrial State (James Madison Library in American Politics),Economics & The Public Purpose,The Great Crash 1929, etc.This 1977 book is based on his 12-part 1977 BBC television series (which was shown on CBS in this country), which combined a history of economic theory, with abundant exposition of his own ideas. Chapters include The Prophets and Promise of Classical Capitalism; The Dissent of Karl Marx; Lenin and the Great Ungluing; The Rise and Fall of Money; The Big Corporation; The Metropolis, etc.He wrote in the Foreword, \\"the title 'The Age of Uncertainty' ... suggested the basic theme: we would contrast the great certainties in economic thought in the last century with the great uncertainty with which problems are faced in our time... a further theme emerged... The ruling ideas of the time are those by which people and governments are guided.\\"He observes that the possession of money \\"causes people to take a more favorable view of this world in comparison with the next... if you are either rich or a camel, you should, as a purely practical calculation, enjoy life now.\\" (Pg. 43) Concerning his own World War II work as deputy head of the Office of Price Administration, he admits that \\"Previously I had argued against a general ceiling on prices... now I argued for it with equal passion. Almost no one noticed this change of mind... In economics it is a far, far wiser thing to be right than to be consistent.\\" (Pg. 222)It's unfortunate that, unlike Milton Friedman's response to this series (Free To Choose: The Updated and Revised Television Series), this series is not available in video format. The book misses much of the \\"liveliness\\" of the original broadcast."},{"Title":"The Big Book of Self-Reliant Living: Advice and Information on Just About Everything You Need to Know to Live on Planet Earth","review":"I really do not know where to start with this book. I am a former executive that left that world behind 2 years ago. I am currently working towards more self-reliant living and ways to cut down on money that leaves my driveway. This book will tell you how to do everything from raising little farm animals, to prepping and planting a garden, selecting an appropriate water heater, positioning your new home to take advantage of shade in reducing costs for heating &amp; cooling, building a bench, construction techniques (large and small), home remedies (including making cleaning supplies), country cooking (with numerous recipes and substitutions), to selecting land. There is just too much in this book to cover everything. In every section it gives you the good and the bad. Unlike other books of this type, it does not contain radical, anti-anything, just hard facts, and common sense suggestions.Examples are: types of solar power, advantages/disadvantages of each, and their ROI (some of which are years [up to 25] to recoup the costs); raising sheep correctly, ensuring that you can rotate pastures to prevent diseases that I haven't heard of since I was in vet school; and, not raising turkeys where you will have animal A or B. Just good stuff!!I know that many people my age (mid-30s) are realizing that debt is too easy, and we need to take responsibility for ourselves. This book will give you the tools you need, the rest is up to you.I have purchased a dozen copies of this book so far, to give to people that really want to live self-reliantly, or that just want help in making informed decisions to become a little self-reliant. This book can be useful anywhere for most of it; however, unlike other books that contain information on gardening and small-scale farming, this book covers the southeastern US like a blanket in regards to winter grazing and feeding for animals, and planting times.I just cannot say enough about this book.

The title, \\"The Big Book of Self-Reliant Living\\" lead me to believe that it was a handbook for living off the land. However, when it arrived I was dismayed to find that the \\"health\\" section did not contain home remedies or herbal medicine, but 40 pages (40 pages!!) of lists of the nutritional value of foods. Who has time to count calories on a farm? Furthermore, the \\"health\\" section had oodles of detailed information on diagnosing a wide variety of cancers and chronic diseases. I found this to be frustratingly unhelpful information. The bizarre material can be perfectly illustrated by the bee-keeping page. It instructs the reader to buy factory made hives, and to have a bee-keeper bring you bees. Self-reliant my foot. So, in summary: if you are a hypochondriac who lives in a city and you want a book with tips on environment-friendly heating methods, instructions for removing stains from clothing, money saving ideas for the grocery store or a chart of toy dog breeds, then please contact me because I have the book for you!"},{"Title":"The Big Book of Self-Reliant Living: Advice and Information on Just About Everything You Need to Know to Live on Planet Earth","review":"The first thing I noticed about this book was the terribly small print.

And because of this, I concentrated mainly on sections of this book that are dedicated to home construction, masonry, brickwork, etc.I found a lot of usefull information about building a house. But I would not advise using this book as a \\"stand alone\\" guide for home construction. However I do highly recommend this book as a companion reference on the subject. I especially enjoyed the section on \\"before you build\\", which pointed out a lot of design details that I will incorporate in my own floor plan.I would have given the book 5 stars for overall content.

It is a compilation of publication from other sources, primarily the US government. As such the quality of each section varies greatly in age, usability, and legibility. Really, this book should come with a magnifying glass as several sections have been reduced in size to accommodate the format and are made functionally illegible.In short, if you are looking for a book to tell you how to become 'Self-Reliant', this book isn't going to help you much.

The book is therefore, thematically, a little disorganized, though it feels like it is intended for a person who wishes to get off the grid, practically and societally. Most of the contents look photocopied. Some sections are too complicated, some are too simple, and some are impracticable if the book is your only source of knowledge. The hodgepodge of styles, both visual and verbal, add to the sense of disorganization.It is not, as I had hoped, an instruction manual on how to be more independent and how to have a lesser effect on my environment.

Gee, thanks! When it's not that answer, it's something you know already (wash the wound, wrap with sterile bandage) there is NOTHING in this book beyond BASIC first aid. Also, much of the material was from the 1980s during the \\"AIDS\\" scare- if that makes sense. There are references to Epstein Barr syndrome (remember that?)too.What makes me FURIOUS is that the \\"authors\\" ripped off the entire content of this from FREE booklets given out by the government. No changes were made! The images, text, everything is as exactly as it is in the pamphlets- just copied and put in this book form.

Impossible to do with printed material- and gives away the author's laziness.The authors should be SUED by the government for merely copying FREE materials handed out, then just having it merely printed (and lazily at that!) then SELLING it to people for a profit. The content in this is so awful and done in such a hurried fashion, I can only surmise that deliberate theft was the author's original intent as nothing but copied content nor anything the authors contributed themselves is in this book. What a waste of money! I should have demanded a refund.There is not ONE chapter in here that will help you become \\"self reliant\\". Like I said, much of it is so outdated it's laughable.

Somehow I just use the AAA guides more often than the others even when they are all in my suitcase.Just like other AAA guides, this one is colorful, attractive, and fun to use. Here are some reasons why I think it is better than other guides:1) With lots of great photos, this guide gives you a really good idea of what things look like, which gives you a better idea of whether an attraction is one you want to see. This also makes the guide so attractive, that it is just fun to use!2) While not as comprehensive as some other guides, the AAA guides point out the best sights and attractions, which are the things you want to see anyway. In the case of Vancouver, where there is SO much to see, this really helps you narrow down your list!3) The spiral format makes the guide very easy to use as it lays flat or folds flat. (Nothing like trying to juggle an awkward guide while balancing a tote bag, carryon bag, and a purse! Ease of use counts!)4) The guides contain fun activities like suggested walking tours along with fun facts about locations that you won't find in other guides. For example, the guide mentions that the very first ambulance in Victoria (I think it was 1919?) had as its first patient someone who was run down by the ambulance! You won't get that kind of info anywhere else!

I always look forward to reading some of the new books that come out each year as spring training begins. I was intrigued by this book, having gone to the HOF last year with my daughter, so I was eager to read it. It is a great title but a rather pedestrian book. I found a couple of typos, which I think can be annoying when reading a book, but that is not my big problem with the book. A book like this, based on the iconic photo and the link to the classic Great Day in Harlem photo and story, should bring history to life. This book does not do it. Instead it wanders all over the place with stories that are available in other books. There is some information on how the HOF came to be, but the book never really grabs the reader. It might be that I was expecting too much from the book but I it just never seemed to flow as I would have expected. It is a great title but just not a great book. In baseball lingo, I would say this is not a strikeout, but probably not a hit either. Maybe a nice fielder's choice that advances a runner is the best way to describe the book."},{"Title":"A Great Day in Cooperstown: The Miraculous and Unlikely Beginning of the Baseball Hall of Fame","review":"The one thing I really liked about this book is that it explores a little known aspect of baseball history in an engaging and enjoyable sense. However the book, coming it at a little over 200 pages really is nothing more than a Cliff Notes version of the founding of the Hall of Fame. Short thrift is given to the controversy about siting baseball's origins in Cooperstown. Also, highlighted synopsis of the orignial inductees seems to be either a rehash of old stories for Babe Ruth and a too short summary of the lives of some of the other lesser known inductees such as Nap Lajorie and Grover Cleveland Alexander to name two.This is a fun, easy read. I do wish the author had spent more time and given us a clearer more complete picture of everything leading up to the opening of the BHOF and some of the fascinating stories behind it."},{"Title":"A Great Day in Cooperstown: The Miraculous and Unlikely Beginning of the Baseball Hall of Fame","review":"While perusing the shelves at my local library a while back, this book caught my eye due to the incredible picture on the front cover, perhaps the most famous in the history of baseball considering its inclusion of so many Hall of Famers at such an early date. Luckily for me, the book held up its end of the bargain.Author Jim Reisler does two basic things with this text:1. A brief history of each player in that famous photo, including the events of that inaugural day at Cooperstown.2. A more comprehensive history of how that day came to pass, looking at the history of how the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum came to be.I enjoyed both themes of the book equally. Though the history of the players was nothing that couldn't be found elsewhere, it is put together in a very refreshing, exciting format...the type of book you leisurely page through during the summertime on a swing overlooking the lake with a glass of iced tea. That kind of feel.The history of Cooperstown, however, was pretty much new material to me, and I've read a TON of baseball history literature.Overall, I consider this to be one of the better baseball history books I've read in quite awhile. It isn't bogged down with statistics and doesn't skew off tangent. Just a very tight read from cover to cover."},{"Title":"A Great Day in Cooperstown: The Miraculous and Unlikely Beginning of the Baseball Hall of Fame","review":"I enjoyed learning of the process that preceded the opening of the Hall of Fame.

Education must change in basic and crucial ways to equip young people ...to successfully survive and thrive in such an environment. Thus teachers must fundamentally revise their approach to learning and instruction.&quot; This is a provocative and potent statement, essentially saying K-12 education, as we know it, cannot equip young people to function successfully in the world they will inherit.A new instructional paradigm has emerged, one very much affected by recent cognitive and neuroscientific research. One in which skills such as problem solving and critical thinking as well as the ability to rapidly acquire, process, and apply new information, have become vital to success. Yet, as we all know too well, school reform in America today is primarily a matter of ratcheting up standards and then testing children to make certain they are measuring up. There is little time left to devote to the development of intellectual curiosity or any sense of 'meaningful' learning. The current 'teaching-to-the-test' hysteria deprives students of real mental challenge.Diane Ronis' principal contribution to this increasing instruction conflict is to make the implications from a growing body of research on learning readily available to teachers or parents. This is not an overly theoretical, dense, or hard-to-follow book. On the contrary, it simply examines the rationale behind inquiry and problem-based learning and explains why it is such an effective method for math and science instruction in today's 'e' world.After reading this book, many a reader, who struggled with his or her own math and/or science education may conclude it was not his or her own personal limitation that was the problem, but rather the ineptitude of the teaching approach. Those who loved their math education may still be aware that their curriculum was a &quot;mile wide and an inch deep.&quot; The somewhat perfunctory mental gymnastics they learned, were good at, and liked did not really expose the deeper essence of any major mathematical or scientific theory.The book, however, does contain some qualifying factors. To recast the entire mathematics and science curricula for problem based learning is much harder than just supplying a few sample tasks. Still this is a powerful beginning. I highly recommend &quot;PBL for Math and Science...&quot; for anyone, especially teachers, who want to make their instruction meaningful and relevant, or parents whose children aren't meeting success with their current mathematics or science education."},{"Title":"Problem-Based Learning for Math and Science: Integrating Inquiry and the Internet","review":"...with little or no content that you either already know or else could find very easily on the internet by doing a simple search for \\"problem-based learning\\"..."},{"Title":"Problem-Based Learning for Math and Science: Integrating Inquiry and the Internet","review":"This is a very user friendly book with ideas that can be incorporated into the classroom with ease.

His writings are very easy reading- hard to put down. Artful comparisons between Protestants and Catholics."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"Having been brought up a Catholic, and having had a catholic religious education for many years, let me say a few words in defense of this book. It should be read by catholics to see what the skeptical side has to say. Although I do not agree with everything the author has to say, he does make some good points. In one section of the book, he talks about divine tradition. In a catechism called 'My Catholic Faith' by Bishop Morrow in the lesson on divine tradition, it clearly states that divine tradition should be believed in as firmly as the bible, since both come from God. Divine tradition is the writings of the fathers and doctors of the catholic church. Now God is infallible, so divine tradition should be also. But Boettner writes that Augustine, a prolific church father, wrote a book of retractions to his writings later in life. Another Church doctor, Alphonsus Liguori, in his book, the means of salvation and perfection, wrote that if God willed all the angels to go to hell, they would willingly do so to follow the divine will. This is absurd since God cannot make a contradiction. If this were so I wouldnt blame the angels for becoming atheists. Boettners book is well written and shows some of the other inconsistencies in the church. However, he does throw the baby out with the bathwater. There are inconsistencies in the Catholic Church and in the intrests of truth, one would do well to read this book."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"After reading in-depth treatments on anti-Catholicism wherein this book never gets mentioned such as in Robert N. Bellah'sUncivil Religion: Interreligious Hostility in America(with the second section--pages 39-109--titled \\"Protestant-Catholic Tensions\\"), wherein this book is briefly but respectfully mentioned such as in Philip Jenkin'sThe New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice(page 44, states \\"respected Presbyterian scholar Lorraine Boettner published the first of many editions of a comprehensive polemic against the Catholic Church\\"), wherein this book gets credited as a conservative perspective such as inRevolution in Rome(page 19, \\"the truth is, Boettner notwithstanding, that both the spirit and the doctrine of Catholicism are changing\\"), one can conclude that un-biased scholars see this work as an important polemic worthy of attention and consideration.Now giving this work some attention: if the Catholic Church is truly changing in spirit and doctrine, it is certainly surprising and unexpected to find the Roman-Catholic Ignatus Press publishing the sort of scholarly myopic attacks on Boettner's book that exist inCatholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"Last year I began to study for myself the differences between the Protestant, Roman Catholic and other \\"Religions\\" claiming to be based on the Bible. This book was an excellent source of scholarly work complete with references. I have read and am concerned by other reviews written by seemingly Protestant imposters that seek to attack the book in an effort to keep the dark secrets of the Roman Catholic Church hidden.Also, as a quick note, previous reviews claim poor documentation and quotes in the book. This is an out and out fallacy. There are approximately 130 quoted authors and texts and I have yet to find one that was false or even controversial.I will admit that some of the things claimed to be believed and taught by the Catholic Church were hard to swallow. But after doing further research on my own including the Roman Catholic Catechism, Vatican II Council documents, etc., I found them all to be legitimate claims. I am afraid that either the people writing the negative reviews are either oblivious to the false and blasphemous teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, or they know them to be true and are trying to guard them from being exposed.This is a fantastic book and a Must Have for anyone truly seeking honest and straight forward knowledge about God's plan for man and for His True church-which does not fit with the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church.One reason that it is so cheap (as one of the negative reviewers mentioned) is because it seems to be written with exposing the truth in mind and not personal gratification or greed.I would like to close with this final statement. I have an older copy of the book, and wanted to order another copy for a friend. (I am not willing to give mine up :o) This book was first published in 1962, and the copy I have is dated 1987. At that time it was in its 26th Printing. This is a fantastic book. When I noticed the ratings, I attribute that to people buying the book thinking that it will support the Roman Catholic doctrine and not expose it for what it is. The Truth seems to sting those living in the dark."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"This is a great book that really uncovers much of the paganism and just plain made up traditions for which the Catholic church has become known. I was freed from a \\"pre-Vatican II\\" church some years ago. It was a group of Catholics and their very elderly priest who rejected the changes made after the Second Council. They practiced the old ways (which is what Lorraine's book mainly addresses). They kissed a box filled with \\"relics\\"...you would not believe how many churches have a piece of the cross that was used to crucify Christ! Sometimes they hosted the \\"pilgrim\\". this was a case with a statue of the Virgin Mary. It circulates and when your household has it you sit around it everyday and say certain prayers to Mary. For those who do not believe that Christ is re-crucified in the Eucharist, I site the following: \\"356. Why does Christ give us His own body and blood in the Holy Eucharist?Christ gives us His own body and blood in the Holy Eucharist: first, to be offered as a sacrifice commemorating and renewing for all time the sacrifice of the cross; second, to be received by the faithful in Holy Communion; third, to remain ever on our altars as the proof of His love for us, and to be worshipped by us.\\" and \\"357. What is the Mass?The Mass is the Sacrifice of the New Law in which Christ, through the ministry of the priest, offers Himself to God in an unbloody manner under the appearances of bread and wine.\\" These are taken from the Baltimore Catechism of the 50's. This is falsehood plain and simple. Christ offered himself once and for all...not continuously. Some might answer...but the Baltimore Catechism is not used anymore. That would mean that the church is not un-changed through history...but changes continuously to teach \\"new truths\\". Yet God is the same before, now, and forevermore. Christ offers the wine and the bread to all in the Bible. In the 1400's the Catholic church officially decided to keep the cup from the laity. This is in no way supported by Scripture where we are instructed to take both. I could go on and on. The teachings of the Catholic church MUST be compared to Scripture. Where they disagree...the Scripture must stand in authority. Even Paul said that if he or even the angels were to teach apart from the teachings of Christ they must be rejected."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"I grew up observing many catholic neighbors and classmates going thru the preposterous and ridiculous &quot;rituals&quot; and &quot;sacriments&quot; that were invented by the popes and &quot;councils,&quot; and are absolutely NOT IN THE BIBLE.Most of the reviewers are obviously roman catholicswho feel a &quot;need&quot; to &quot;protect&quot; themselves, but never point out ANYTHING that is &quot;untrue!&quot; They just &quot;SAY&quot; it is untrue!

His book, \\"Roman Catholicism\\", is spot on and accurate in its assessment of the man-made doctrines and traditions of the Roman Catholic institution. Having been taught, since childhood, the so-called traditions of Rome, it is refreshing to me that Boettner can still be read and perhaps even be used to help save some souls from the inventions of Romanism. His work will never be outdated. Don't let such reviews, like Garver's above nit-picking, discourage anyone from reading this book. Yes, Garver did fine an error with Boettner's citation of \\"Valencia 1229\\", but the mistake was in name only and not outcome. It should read \\"Toulouse 1229\\", which did restrict the use of the Bible. Regardless of the Albigensians, or what they believed, the so-called church and council had no right to place the Bible on a forbidden book list, which is the correct and accurate point Boettner outlines in his \\"Roman Catholicism\\". On the major issues Boettner is spot on and accurate. Take something major like the invention of the role of papal authority, or the Pope as the Universal Bishop over all of the church. Boettner perhaps doesn't list every single reason for discrediting this hoax invented by Rome, but let Pope Gregory the Great offer support where Boettner might be lacking, \\"Certainly Peter, the first of the apostles, himself of the holy and universal church, Paul, Andrew, John, what were they but heads of particular communities? And yet all were members under one Head [Jesus Christ]. Was it not the case, as your Fraternity knows, that the prelates of this Apostolic See, which by the providence of God I serve, had the honor offered them of being called Universal Bishop, by the venerable Council of Chalcedon. But not one of them has ever wished to be called by such a title, or seized upon this ill-advised name, lest if, in virtue of rank of Pontificate, he took to himself the glory of singularity, he might seem to have denied it to all his brethern.\\" (Epistle XVIII). The reader can get the whole truth by reading the teaching and letters of Pope Gregory the Great, but for now Boettner's work will stand the test of time, especially when measured as a complete work, and not against a minor mistake in name only and not a point of fact. May the Lord Jesus Christ bless all the readers of Boettner's \\"Roman Catholicism\\", which other than the Bible, the Roman Catholic will fine no better book to read. In fact, don't let the Pope or his puppets stop the reader from reading both at the same time!Gordon A.

However, I just couldn't let all these negative reviews go unchallenged. This is a great book! The bad reviews are primarily written by Catholics who have never read the book, but know of it through a very biased trashing of it by Karl Keating in his Catholicism and Fundamentalism. One reviewer I saw even referred to the author as a \\"her\\" ... any reader of the book would know that Lorraine Boettner is a man! This book is a great source of embarrasing information. You will learn how many Catholic doctrines are not only unbiblical, but also relatively recent concoctions. You will learn of many of the frauds that the Catholic Church has perpetrated on its unsuspecting followers - such as the house in Italy that they claimed was Mary's flown in from the Holy Land. The greed, the corruption, the bizarre practices - it's all here. Let's not forget the atrocities, such as the Inquisition and the war crimes in Croatia that the Catholic Church was so intimately involved with. Sadly, pointing out the truth about Catholicism has been termed \\"bashing\\" and is now politically incorrect. It has been getting harder and harder to find resources that tell it straight.

The CCC is cross referenced with the Holy Bible so one can read the Roman Catholic side of the argument.If in the end one still disagrees with the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, at least that person went to the source for accurate information.For a side trying to refute a theory or in this case religious denomination it is unethical as a scholar to present a presentation of your opposing theory in what can be proceed as an unbiased way.In short if one wants to learn about Roman Catholicism go to the source, in this case the Catechism of the Catholic Church. If one wishes to learn about Fundamentalism one can read any number of works by several educated Fundamentalist writers.This is a poor work.(Also a note should be made that not all Catholics who believe in Papal succession and the Mass are \\"Roman Catholics\\" or Latin Rite Catholics; there are over 20 liturgical rites in the Catholic Church.

Had he actually presented Catholic doctrine for discussion he could have made the claim to be intelectually honest. As it stands Boettner's book is for people who want to reinforce their own misconceptions of the Church to make themselves feel better."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"First off let me say that I have no ax to grind in reviewing this book because my family is Lutheran, and I married a Methodist girl, who is now Lutheran. The book was brought to my attention by my wife who has many Catholic friends who she said were very upset by this book. So I took it upon myself to objectively read the book to see for myself what all the controversy was all about.When I read Boettner's book (Yes I did read the entire book, all 466 pages of it) I found so many flaws, made up dates, councils that did NOT take place, and unsubstantiated claims just in the first few chapters, that I HAD to completely finish the book just to see for myself how much of a bigoted author this Loraine Boettner is, and WHY he would write such a book.In the end Boettner never tells the reader WHY he wrote this book, but if I were a Psychologist of a Psychiatrist I would come to the conclusion that here is a man (Boettner) who is extremely jealous of the Roman Catholic Church, and has such a visceral hatred of the Catholic Church that his religiously demented personality demanded that he put down in writing what was in his mind.When Boettner wrote this book it was published in 1962. Why he couldn't wait until the end of the 2nd Vatican Council (1962-1965) probably tells me that he had to put down in writing his pent up hatred before the Catholic Church, through the results of the conclave, changed any of his antagonisms. From what I have read about Vatican II it has changed the Catholic Church a lot, while still maintaining the core beliefs of the Catholic Church that go directly back to the time of Christ.Loraine Boettner did not die until January 1990, but he never wrote a direct rebuttal to this book. Which will lead you to ask WHY? The answer is simple: After the book was released it was clear that Boettner made a fool of himself, and to admit that he was wrong in his dates and other fantastic claims he would have been made to look like more of a fool.It was noted straight away that Boettner's book \`Roman Catholicism' was full of false information and unsubstantiated claims. At the time of it's publication Boettner was already an author who had four previous books published. And for him to admit in a follow up book that he was wrong, would have had him put on a \`Black List' of writers never to be published again, despite his Publisher being; The Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company. This publisher of Theological works is known for their theological bigotry, against any Church or organization that doesn't believe what they do, but especially against the Catholic Church. But it still does not answer the question why this book has been reprinted again, and who is responsible for the book being reprinted.In the introduction alone Boettner lists dates that are not accurate, not just by years or decades, but by CENTURIES! And he goes on to invent councils and conclaves that never happened. True, some of councils he lists did take place, but in referring to these councils and what was the major theological item that that council will be remembered for are totally inaccurate. To a theologically un-educated individual it seems that he is an impressive writer that took the time to investigate all he wrote is true and accurate, so naturally the reader assumes everything being written is true and correct.The one thing that got me to read Boettner's book in it's entirety is that in his introduction Boettner lists 44 items that he calls; \\"Some Roman Catholic Heresies and Inventions\\" and goes on to list the dates of their Adoptions over a period of 1650 years. To the un-educated individual this seems impressive, to start his book with such bravado. But with me Boettner was dealing with an individual who took the time to really investigate these \`Heresies and Inventions.' No matter what were Boettner's thoughts as he wrote these \`Heresies and Inventions' there were too many to hit the reader with at the very beginning of the book, and second they sounded too fantastic. In investigating these claims I found that every one of these 44 claims were not only un-substantiated, but downright fraudulent and full of half-truths.There is an old saying that says that a man who tells lies, like politician tend to do, simply hides the truth. A man who tells the truth, like a military officer when questioned by his superior, is an honorable individual. But a man who tells half-truths, like Boettner, has simply forgotten where and what the truth is.It didn't take me long in reading Loraine Boettner book to realize that he epitomizes the old axiom that was used so successfully by Adolph Hitler. Boettner's claims are so fantastic that like Hitler, Boettner is one that thinks, by his writing; \\"If you tell a big enough lie, People will believe it.\\"Boettner tries to give the impression to the reader that he is an academic, when all he is, is a frustrated bigoted writer who is so jealous, and so scared of the Catholic Church that he MUST tell lies that are big enough that people will believe him.Just to give an example of the wild claims that Boettner writes to try to make the reader believe he is an academic, are his claims that the Roman Catholic Church did nothing to help defeat the spread of communism throughout the world and that only the Protestant nations of the world were the only catalysts in fighting Communism. Boettner even goes on to name countries like the United States, Canada, The Netherlands and Spain having spearheaded the fight against the spread of Communism.This again sounds to the reader that Boettner did a good investigative job in naming what he claims are predominant Protestant countries that were leading the fight against Communism.However I'm one who believes that statistics don't lie and one only has to look at statistics to show that in Canada 42.6% of the population is Catholic, as opposed to Protestants representing only 23.3% of the population. In the Netherlands Roman Catholicism is the largest Christian denomination, larger than all the other Christian denominations put together. *In the United States Roman Catholicism has a membership of 74,455,877 million persons, far outdistancing the closest Protestant denomination of Baptists whose membership in July 2010 was recorded at 32,591,991 million individuals divided into 19 different Baptist sects, with the Southern Baptist Convention being the largest with a membership total of 16,228,438. *Then we have Spain, who was been a very strong and supportive member of NATO, where 94% of the population of over 40,500,000 million people profess Catholicism as their Religion. *Finally in the fight against Communism, lets look at Poland where 89.8% of the population of over 38,500,000 million people are Roman Catholic.*During the cold war the government of this Poland may have been communist, but it was the courageous fight of the people of Poland that started the domino effect that eventually toppled every country in Europe that were members of the Warsaw Pact and at one time had a Communist government loyal to Moscow.*Bottner's total ignorance of how the communist system of government works shows out here. In the Marxist-Leninist Communist system of government only 10% of the total adult population were allowed to become \`card-carrying' members of the party. Levin believed that the smaller the number of dedicated Communists that held the reigns of power would suffice to keep the country under the yoke of Communism.This is why we have countries like Poland, Hungry, East Germany, Bulgaria, Romania and Czechoslovakia, for example, where extremely small numbers of loyal Communists controlled the government while large segments of the population never belonged or supported the Communist system of government they had between 1945 and 1989.Hence you have seen uprisings starting in Czechoslovakia in 1948 against Communism, which ended when the President of Czechoslovakia was \`pushed' out the window of the upper floor of the Hradcany Castle by Communist agitators to take over the government of that formally \`free' country after World War II. Other uprisings against Communist rule were in Poznan, Poland in June of 1956, in Budapest, Hungary in late summer and early fall of 1956, and again in Czechoslovakia in 1968 only 2 months before the Olympic Games.Who can forget the look on the Czech athletes at the Olympic Games in Mexico City in the fall of 1968 when any Czech athlete was on the same stand to receive their medal with an athlete from the Soviet Union. Not only would they not shake the hand of the Soviet athlete, but actually walked off the stand if the Soviet athlete received the gold medal and the Soviet national anthem was played.All of these uprisings prior to 1989 resulted in the small minority of the people that formed the government of those countries having to call on the Soviet Union to send in tanks and the military from the Soviet Union to squash these uprisings.And this dynamic 'domino effect' was directly caused by the fall of the communist government in Poland, again a country whose population was made up of almost 90% Roman Catholics.The fall of the communist government of Poland was followed shortly afterward by the fall of the communist governments of Hungry, Czechoslovakia, and even the former communist state of the DDR, the Deutsche (German) Democratic Republic of East Germany, and eventually Russia herself in 1991.Do you remember that November of 1989 when the Berlin Wall came down?Even \\"Republics\\" in the old USSR split away from Moscow, leaving only the \\"Republic\\" of Russia on its own. Among the modern day countries that were created after the fall of communism in the former Soviet Union are: The Ukraine and Belarus, not to mention the formation of the three Baltic Countries that were all former \\"Republics\\" in the Soviet Union of: Estonia, Latvia, and finally Lithuania, who population is 79% Roman Catholic.**All these figures can be substantiated by referring to the \\"CIA World Factbook, 2011\\" which is available thru Amazon, or any reputable book retailer.I could spend page after page in listing all the unsubstantiated claims Boettner makes in his book, many of which are just downright lies written to make the reader believe what they are reading are the true facts.In the end I could say is that this book could be considered a \\"Hate\\" book written by someone who really does hate the Roman Catholic Church. I find it very interesting that the Roman Catholic Church itself ignores Boettner's book, and many of the other Anti-Catholic literature, and leaves it up to laity of the church to defend it from hate mongering writers like Loraine Boettner, and other virulent Anti-Catholic writers like Bob Jones and Jimmy Swaggart, because the church itself has better things to do than to answer all the Anti-Catholic Hate literature, and leaves these \`rebuttals' up to the laity of the Church through organizations like \\"Catholic Answers\\" based in El Cajon, California.Just consider that if this book had been written against the Jewish faith, the Anti-Defamation League would have had Boettner in court long ago, but the Roman Catholic Church would rather spread the word of Christ and let these hate writers burn themselves out as will be their eventual fate.One last observation in regards to Boettner's book is that I spent many, many years in Europe, and it is only in America that these books are published to any large degree. Which brings me to ask myself the question of; Why is it that only in America do hate filled Anti-Catholic fundamentalists write this trash.If I could give the book NO Stars at all I would, but Amazon requires I give a book a rating from 1 to 5 stars. Well here is a hate filled book that is full of lies and unsubstantiated claims that make the writer look about 2\\" tall.No matter how many times this book continues to be reprinted, it only shows that there are still more hate filled Anti-Catholic mongers out there trying to spread Loraine Boettner's bigoted views. This book should be pulled from the shelves of all reputable bookstores, and thrown into the trash.And don't forget that the author of this review comes from a family that is Lutheran!"},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"If one was being charitable they might call this book pathetically unscholarly and unresearched, written by a well meaning ignoramus.

Consequently this being True not only is The Bible inerrant, but also the Council of the Catholic Church which proclaimed it 'sacred and canonical'.

This story is such a great blow against the Catholic Church-why spoil it with the facts?\\"In my fact finding perusal at the library, I came across Karl Keating's book CATHOLICISM AND FUNDAMENTALISM. I suggest to all who are reading or have read Boettner's book to consider the sources Boettner uses, look up the facts and read Keating's book."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"I will fully admit to being a Roman Catholic myself and thus approach this book with an understandable bias. Since this book is the one from which many of my Protestant friends received theor view of the Catholic Church, either directly or indirectly, I thought I would read it to see, as it were, what the \\"other side\\" was saying.Clearly Boettner has done some serious research for this book. He cites from a multitude of sources in his vitriolic attack upon the Church. And therein lies the problem. According to Boettner, apparently, anything written by any Catholic over the 2,000 years of the Church is definative Catholic doctrine (as least so far as when he agrees with it). A catechism written by a priest is not a definative statement of Catholic Doctrine and can be, and indeed sometimes is, wrong. Should I damn all Protestant doctrine because Marting Luther wrote \\"The Jews and Their Lies\\" in which he advocated burning down synagogues and denying Jews the right to praise God or to use the Torah?Boettner takes great delight in setting up his own straw-men and then merrily knocking them down. Even when Boettner does quote from official Church documents, they are often quoted partially or out of context.I grant that there are some serious differences between Catholic theology and Protestant theology. A reasoned, scriptural and historical debate on such issues can go far in understanding where we agree and where we differ. (c.f. Norman Geisler's Roman Catholics and Evangelicals: Agreements and Differences). Books such as Boettner's, however, are the literary equivalent of some of the things I have seen written on bathroom walls, albeit with footnotes."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"An incredibly interesting expose' on what the Roman Catholic church teaches and believes. Dr. Boettner quotes priests, ex-priests, bishops, cardinals, popes, nuns and ex-nuns in this lengthy, but captivating piece of research. One of the most valuable insights that he brings to the table is the fact the the Catholic church in the United States is very different than the Catholic church in most other countries - mostly because the U.S. is dominanted by Protestants. He delves into non-Biblical traditions of Romanism and the oppressiveness that the political hierarchy brings to countries that are dominated by Catholicism. Every Christian should read this book. It gets five stars from me."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"Highly unscholarly. At least one major error on every page. Pick a page, any page. And the allegations can be easily refuted.

It is so funny and out of date that I can remember it by rote.&quot;If the United States were to become Roman Catholic, the result, undoutedly, would be the conquest of this nation and the rest of the world by Russian Communism&quot;.Don't get me wrong, I think the RC church is fatally flawed and unbiblical - but linking Commies and Catholics is not only unwarranted, but hysterical. Boettner does not help either Catholics or protestants with his deeply flawed polemic."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"First off let me say that I have no ax to grind in reviewing this book because my family is Lutheran, and I married a Methodist girl, who is now Lutheran. The book was brought to my attention by my wife who has many Catholic friends who she said were very upset by this book. So I took it upon myself to objectively read the book to see for myself what all the controversy was all about.When I read Boettner's book (Yes I did read the entire book, all 466 pages of it) I found so many flaws, made up dates, councils that did NOT take place, and unsubstantiated claims just in the first few chapters, that I HAD to completely finish the book just to see for myself how much of a bigoted author this Loraine Boettner is, and WHY he would write such a book.In the end Boettner never tells the reader WHY he wrote this book, but if I were a Psychologist of a Psychiatrist I would come to the conclusion that here is a man (Boettner) who is extremely jealous of the Roman Catholic Church, and has such a visceral hatred of the Catholic Church that his religiously demented personality demanded that he put down in writing what was in his mind.When Boettner wrote this book it was published in 1962. Why he couldn't wait until the end of the 2nd Vatican Council (1962-1965) probably tells me that he had to put down in writing his pent up hatred before the Catholic Church, through the results of the conclave, changed any of his antagonisms. From what I have read about Vatican II it has changed the Catholic Church a lot, while still maintaining the core beliefs of the Catholic Church that go directly back to the time of Christ.Loraine Boettner did not die until January 1990, but he never wrote a direct rebuttal to this book. Which will lead you to ask WHY? The answer is simple: After the book was released it was clear that Boettner made a fool of himself, and to admit that he was wrong in his dates and other fantastic claims he would have been made to look like more of a fool.It was noted straight away that Boettner's book \`Roman Catholicism' is full of false information and unsubstantiated claims. At the time of it's publication Boettner was already an author who had four previous books published. And for him to admit in a follow up book that he was wrong, would have had him put on a \`Black List' of writers never to be published again, despite his Publisher being; The Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company. This publisher of Theological works is known for their theological bigotry, against any Church or organization that doesn't believe what they do, but especially against the Catholic Church. But it still does not answer the question why this book has been reprinted again, and who is responsible for the book being reprinted.In the introduction alone Boettner lists dates that are not accurate, not just by years or decades, but by CENTURIES! And he goes on to invent councils and conclaves that never happened. True, some of councils he lists did take place, but in referring to these councils and what was the major theological item that that council will be remembered for are totally inaccurate. To a theologically un-educated individual it seems that he is an impressive writer that took the time to investigate all he wrote is true and accurate, so naturally the reader assumes everything being written is true and correct.The one thing that got me to read Boettner's book in it's entirety is that in his introduction Boettner lists 44 items that he calls; \\"Some Roman Catholic Heresies and Inventions\\" and goes on to list the dates of their Adoptions over a period of 1650 years. To the un-educated individual this seems impressive, to start his book with such bravado. But with me Boettner was dealing with an individual who took the time to really investigate these \`Heresies and Inventions.' No matter what were Boettner's thoughts as he wrote these \`Heresies and Inventions' there were too many to hit the reader with at the very beginning of the book, and second they sounded too fantastic. In investigating these claims I found that every one of these 44 claims were not only un-substantiated, downright fraudulent and full of half-truths.There is an old saying that says that a man who tells lies, like politician tend to do, simply hides the truth. A man who tells the truth, like a military officer when questioned by his superior, is an honorable individual. But a man who tells half-truths, like Boettner, has simply forgotten where and what the truth is.It didn't take me long in reading Loraine Boettner book to realize that he epitomizes the old axiom that was used so successfully by Adolph Hitler. Boettner's claims are so fantastic that like Hitler, Boettner is one that thinks, by his writing; \\"If you tell a big enough lie, People will believe it.\\"Boettner tries to give the reader that he is an academic, when all he is, is a frustrated bigoted writer who is so jealous, and so scared of the Catholic Church that he MUST tell lies that are big enough that people will believe him.Just to give an example of the wild claims that Boettner writes to try to make the reader believe he is an academic, are his claims that the Roman Catholic Church did nothing to help defeat the spread of communism throughout the world and that only the Protestant nations of the world were the only catalysts in fighting Communism. Boettner even goes on to name countries like the United States, Canada, The Netherlands and Spain having spearheaded the fight against the spread of Communism.This again sounds to the reader that Boettner did a good investigative job in naming what he claims are predominant Protestant countries that were leading the fight against Communism.However I'm one who believes that statistics don't lie and one only has to look at statistics to show that in Canada 42.6% of the population is Catholic, as opposed to Protestants representing only 23.3% of the population. In the Netherlands Roman Catholicism is the largest Christian denomination, larger than all the other Christian denominations put together. *In the United States Roman Catholicism has a membership of 74,455,877 million persons, far outdistancing the closest Protestant denomination of Baptists whose membership in July 2010 was recorded at 32,591,991 million individuals divided into 19 different Baptist sects, with the Southern Baptist Convention being the largest with a membership total of 16,228,438. *Then we have Spain, who was been a very strong and supportive member of NATO, where 94% of the population of over 40,500,000 million people profess Catholicism as their Religion. *Finally in the fight against Communism, lets look at Poland where 89.8% of the population of over 38,500,000 million people are Roman Catholic.*During the cold war the government of this Poland may have been communist, but it was the courageous fight of the people of Poland that started the domino effect that eventually toppled every country in Europe that were members of the Warsaw Pact and at one time had a Communist government loyal to Moscow.*Bottner's total ignorance of how the communist system of government works shows out here. In the Marxist-Leninist Communist system of government only 10% of the total adult population were allowed to become \`card-carrying' members of the party. Levin believed that the smaller the number of dedicated Communists that held the reigns of power would suffice to keep the country under the yoke of Communism.This is why we have countries like Poland, Hungry, East Germany, Bulgaria, Romania and Czechoslovakia, for example, where extremely small number of loyal Communists controlled the government while large segments of the population never belonged or supported the Communist system of government they had between 1945 and 1989.Hence you have seen uprisings starting in Czechoslovakia in 1948 against Communism, which ended when the President of Czechoslovakia was \`pushed' out the window of the upper floor of the Hradcany Castle by Communist agitators to take over the government of that formally \`free' country after World War II. Other uprisings against Communist rule were in Poznan, Poland in June of 1956, in Budapest, Hungary in late summer and early fall of 1956, and again in Czechoslovakia in 1968 only 2 months before the Olympic Games.Who can forget the look on the Czech athletes at the Olympic Games in Mexico City in the fall of 1968 when any Czech athlete was on the same stand to receive their medal with an athlete from the Soviet Union. Not only would they not shake the hand of the Soviet athlete, but actually walked off the stand if the Soviet athlete received the gold medal and the Soviet national anthem was played.All of these uprisings prior to 1989 resulted in the small minority of the people that formed the government of those countries having to call on the Soviet Union to send in tanks and the military from the Soviet Union to squash these uprisings.And this dynamic 'domino effect' was directly caused by the fall of the communist government in Poland, again a country whose population was made up of almost 90% Roman Catholics.The fall of the communist government of Poland was followed shortly afterward by the fall of the communist governments of Hungry, Czechoslovakia, and even the former communist state of the DDR, the Deutsche (German) Democratic Republic of East Germany, and eventually Russia herself in 1991.Do you remember that November of 1989 when the Berlin Wall came down?Even \\"Republics\\" in the old USSR split away from Moscow, leaving only the \\"Republic\\" of Russia on its own. Among the modern day countries that were created after the fall of communism in the former Soviet Union are: The Ukraine and Belarus, not to mention the formation of the three Baltic Countries that were all former \\"Republics\\" in the Soviet Union of: Estonia, Latvia, and finally Lithuania, who population is 79% Roman Catholic.**All these figures can be substantiated by referring to the \\"CIA World Factbook, 2011\\" which is available thru Amazon, or any reputable book retailer.I could spend page after page in listing all the unsubstantiated claims Boettner makes in his book, many of which are just downright lies written to make the reader believe what they are reading are the true facts.In the end I could say is that this book could be considered a \\"Hate\\" book written by someone who really does hate the Roman Catholic Church. I find it very interesting that the Roman Catholic Church itself ignores Boettner's book, and many of the other Anti-Catholic literature, and leaves it up to laity of the church to defend it from hate mongering writers like Loraine Boettner, and other virulent Anti-Catholic writers like Bob Jones and Jimmy Swaggart, because the church itself has better things to do than to answer all the Anti-Catholic Hate literature, and leaves these \`rebuttals' up to the laity of the Church through organizations like \\"Catholic Answers\\" based in El Cajon, California.Just consider that if this book had been written against the Jewish faith, the Anti-Defamation League would have had Boettner in court long ago, but the Roman Catholic Church would rather spread the word of Christ and let these hate writers burn themselves out as will be their eventual fate.One last observation in regards to Boettner's book is that I spent many, many years in Europe, and it is only in America that these books are published to any large degree. Which brings me to ask myself the question of; Why is it that only in America do hate filled Anti-Catholic fundamentalists write this trash.If I could give the book NO Stars at all I would, but Amazon requires I give a book a rating from 1 to 5 stars. Well here is a hate filled book that is full of lies and unsubstantiated claims that make the writer look about 2\\" tall.No matter how many times this book continues to be reprinted, it only shows that there are still more hate filled Anti-Catholic mongers out there trying to spread Loraine Boettner's bigoted views. This book should be pulled from the shelves of all reputable bookstores, and thrown into the trash.And don't forget that the author of this review comes from a family that is Lutheran!"},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"Unscholarly would be too nice a term for this book.

The CCC is cross referenced with the Holy Bible so one can read the Roman Catholic side of the argument.If in the end one still disagrees with the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, at least that person went to the source for accurate information.For a side trying to refute a theory or in this case religious denomination it is unethical as a scholar to present a presentation of your opposing theory in what can be proceed as an unbiased way.In short if one wants to learn about Roman Catholicism go to the source, in this case the Catechism of the Catholic Church. If one wishes to learn about Fundamentalism one can read any number of works by several educated Fundamentalist writers.This is a poor work.(Also a note should be made that not all Catholics who believe in Papal succession and the Mass are \\"Roman Catholics\\" or Latin Rite Catholics; there are over 20 liturgical rites in the Catholic Church.

Boettner's book is, however, also infamous. The book's infamy stems from its method of argumentation which combines various strategies: not only biblical exegesis, citation of Reformed creeds, quotations from Protestant authorities, and social analysis, but also innuendo, guilt by association, half-truths, and distortions of Roman Catholic teaching. Today, the book is also rather dated, failing to take account of the Second Vatican Council and other developments in 20th century Roman Catholic biblical and theological studies. For all its 450 pages, there is very little of continuing and helpful substance. It is, however, fun to read and bears witness to the polemics of an earlier era (one would wish!).I do not have the space here to give a complete analysis of Boettner's shortcomings, but will cite some representative examples. Moreover, I do not speak here as an apologist for the Roman Catholic church. I am, in fact, like Boettner, a Reformed Protestant, though also a philosophy professor at a Roman Catholic University. It does not seem to me, however, that the cause of Protestant Christianity is well-served by inaccurate portrayals of other traditions or criticisms that only attack straw men. I write this review, then, on behalf of truth.Boettner's first chapter combines various ends: defining Protestantism, attempting to associate Catholicism with communism, accusing Catholicism of developing various heresies and inventions, and painting a portrait of the supposedly sad state of Roman Catholic nations. Let's consider his discussion of the &quot;heresies&quot; and &quot;inventions&quot; which he implies are held to be part of the unchanging and infallible teachings of the Roman Catholic Church and thus are &quot;binding&quot; upon all Catholics (pages 7-10).In point of fact, very little of what he mentions would fall into that category. For instance, fasting on Fridays, the temporal power of popes, the withholding of the cup from the laity, and the use of Latin, have all changed since they were never a matter of Catholic &quot;doctrine&quot; per se. Moreover, Boettner distorts the implementation of many of these practices. For instance, the &quot;imposition&quot; of the Latin language by Gregory in AD 600 was done in order that the liturgy might be celebrated in the common language of the people (i.e., Latin), rather than in the Greek that was widely used up to that time. Likewise, while the discipline of celibacy was required for most priests since 1079, that is only true in the Latin rite of the Catholic Church. In the Eastern rite, married priests have always been permitted and are to this day. Nor was the Bible ever &quot;forbidden to laymen&quot; by a Council of Valencia in 1229. For one thing, there was no council in Valencia in 1229 since it was under Islamic control. A local council with local authority, however, was held in Toulouse that year and it did temporarily (and quite understandably) limit the use of the Bible by roving lay-preachers who were spreading the Albigensian heresy.As another example, we can consider Boettner's treatment of the mass in chapter eight. It is evident here that the book is quite dated, presupposing a eucharistic liturgy which hasn't been enacted (except rarely) in three decades (pages 169-171). Boettner's discussion of the Roman Catholic priesthood and the &quot;sacrifice of the mass&quot; gives little indication of any detailed knowledge about those doctrines, their histories, or their current status. For instance, he appears unware of centuries of debate among Roman Catholic theologians on whether the notion of the eucharistic &quot;sacrifice&quot; is to be taken in an &quot;oblationist&quot; or &quot;immolationist&quot; fashion. The &quot;oblationist&quot; view focuses more upon Christ's present priestly intercesssion before the Father. The &quot;immolationist&quot; view, on the other hand, focuses more upon Christ's presence upon the altar in a figure of death. While the latter view is certainly problematic for Protestants and the view against which we have traditionally objected, it is the former view (&quot;oblationism&quot;) which has gained ascendency in the 20th century and thus must be addressed today. And I know of no Roman Catholic theologian who would agree with Boettner's description that the mass is a &quot;re-crucifixion&quot; of Jesus and few who would even accept the language of the mass as a &quot;continuation&quot; of the sacrifice of Calvary (page 174). Unfortunately, Boettner's almost complete lack of bibliographical references to Catholic authorities makes it difficult to know from where he drew his information.I cite these few examples as representative of the ways in which Boettner's book falls short. As Protestants we certainly must maintain a faithful witness to Reformation truth, but that task is not advanced by careless scholarship, distortion of one's opponents, and slipshod argumentation. While there are some things of value in Boettner's classic book, I would advise those who are interested in understanding the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church to refer to offical documents (the catechism, councils, encyclicals) and their prominent interpreters among recent theologians."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"I read this book back in the early 90's when it was given to me by a fundamentalist co-worker. I was a lax Catholic at the time who sailed through 12 years of Catholic schooling without ever really delving deep into my faith. I read the book with interest, and an open mind, since I already began having some serious challenges with what my friend was teaching me about the \\"obvious contradictions\\" (as he saw them) between Biblical teachings and Catholic doctrine. I found many of Dr. Boettner's historical accusations so over the top, and distorted that I soon began to question his scholarship (not to mention his motives) on everything else.My curiosity was piqued and I began to devour every book I could find that would shed some light on how the early Christians read and understood scripture (starting with William A. Jurgens', \\"Faith of The Early Fathers\\") . It took the good Dr. Boettner to get me interested enough to finally begin searching for the truth - and it led me deeper into the Faith I was raised in. Thanks Dr. Boettner!"},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"\\"Divine tradition is the writings of the fathers and doctors of the catholic church. Now God is infallible, so divine tradition should be also. But Boettner writes that Augustine, a prolific church father, wrote a book of retractions to his writings later in life. Another Church doctor, Alphonsus Liguori, in his book, the means of salvation and perfection, wrote that if God willed all the angels to go to hell, they would willingly do so to follow the divine will. This is absurd since God cannot make a contradiction.\\"In response to this post and this book, all I can say is that people need to do a better job of understanding what it is they are trying to condemn. First, Boettner misleads the reader to believe that Augustine \\"comes to his senses later in life\\". Maybe the reader should, himself, read Augustine to find the TRUTH. Boettner also attempts to build up a Catholic strawman and then knock it down. He does it well (who couldn't). In fact, if this was actually what the Church taught, I would be objecting myself. Furthermore, he is dishonest, which is a cardinal sin for a \\"scholar\\".For starters, Catholic tradition is not the \\"writings of the fathers and doctors of the Catholic Church\\". The Church fathers bear witness to Apostolic Tradition, but they aren't in themselves \\"Tradition\\". Thus, a Church Father OR Doctor CAN err. Their writings are only accurate in as much as they agree with what the Church has always taught. This does not mean that our understanding cannot grow or expand. However, teachings cannot be contradicted (i.e. cold-blooded murder is never morally acceptable). The teaching on infallibility only extends to matters of faith and morals. And that only extends to the Magisterium. Thus, a Pope declaring that one Bible is better than another one is not a contradiction on infallibility. \\"Faith and Morals\\" simply put are articles of the faith that are necessary for our salvation along with moral teachings that guide our faith.Furthermore, the teaching on infallibility only states that the Holy Spirit will PREVENT the CHURCH from teaching error in these areas. It does not extend to INDIVIDUALS, except the Holy Father (in Ex Cathedra pronouncements). These rarely occur. Thus, both the author's accusations and all critics of Catholic (Apostolic) Tradition are unfounded. Remember, all you critics of Catholic Tradition, the words of St. Paul, \\"So then Brothers, stand firm and hold to the TRADITIONS we brought to you, whether by word of MOUTH or by LETTER\\" (2 Thess 2:15). Also, that the \\"CHURCH of the living God, (IS) the PILLAR and FOUNDATION of TRUTH\\" (1 Tim 3:15). Thus, Scripture (which is a part of Tradition itself, said St. Paul in 2 Thess 2:15) bears witness to the Church's teaching on Tradition. A teaching that was handed down by Christ and the Apostles in the once and for all, complete deposit of faith.To sum it up, let us see what the Church teaches about it's own beliefs on Tradition. \\"Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture, then, are bound closely together and communicate one with the other. For both of them, flowing out from the same divine well-spring, come together in some fashion to form one thing and move towards the same goal\\" (CCC, 80). \\"The Tradition here in question comes from the apostles and hands on what they received from Jesus' teaching and example and what they learned from the Holy Spirit. The first generation of Christians did not yet have a WRITTEN NEW TESTAMENT, and the New Testament itself demonstrates the process of living Traidition. Tradition is to be distinguished from the various THEOLOGICAL, DISCIPLINARY, LITURGICAL, or DEVOTIONAL traditions (little \\"t\\"), born in the local churches over time. These are the particular forms, adapted to different places and times, in which the great Tradition (Big \\"T\\") is expressed. In the light of Tradition, these traditions can be retained, modified or even abandoned under the guidance of the Church's magisterium\\" (CCC, 83). Thus, man-made traditions can be modified or abandoned, but Apostolic Tradition is objective truth revealed by God and cannot ever change. This is what the Church claims infallibility over. Don't take my word for it, do your research, and try reading something other than anti-Catholic sentiment if you ACTUALLY want to learn what the Catholic Church teaches."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"\\"Roman Catholicism\\" by Loraine Boettner is easily one of the worst pseudo-histories/studies of the Catholic faith ever written.Boettner most definitely did not do his homework, even when it may appear to the uninformed that he has.He was among the worst of the anti-Catholic bigots of the 20th century and like anyone with a hateful prejudice he swallowed hook, line and sinker every lame and groundless piece of nonsense he could scrape up concerning the Church and the faith instituted by Jesus Christ.He managed to get Church history, theology, doctrine, practices and beliefs wrong all at the same time. There is probably not a single page in this book that is not riddled with errors, but that is what one would expect from a misguided, misinformed and spiteful man with a terrible axe to grind against the Church of Jesus Christ.If you are interested in a much higher level of reading about the Catholic Church I would recommend \\"Triumph: The Power and Glory of the Catholic Church\\" by H.W. Crocker III for honest and accurate history, and for an explanation and discussion of Church doctrine, \\"Catholicism and Fundamentalism\\" by Karl Keating.Don't waste your time and money on Boettner. If this is the best that anti-Catholic bigots can do, they should hang their heads in shame."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"Lorriane Boettner has no clue as to what he is talking about. I was on the verge of leaving the Church and then I read his book. Looked up the facts and realized how off-base he is. If you want inaccuracy, distortion, illogic, and straw man arguments read this book. But if you want the Truth then ignore this books and read &quot;Catholicism and Fundamentalism&quot; by Karl Keating, &quot;Fundamentals of the Faith&quot; by Peter Kreeft, and &quot;Rome Sweet Home&quot; by Scott and Kimberly Hahn. I would give this no stars, but I can't."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"I am a Christian firmly entrenched in the same general branch of Protestantism as the author (Calvinism), and I own several of his books. I would say this has to be one of his worst. I doubt he intended to write a diatribe; I am willing to be charitable and give him the benefit of the doubt. But, when searching for words to describe his treatment of Roman Catholicism, &quot;charitable&quot; doesn't come to mind. I'm not an expert on RC doctrine, but my impression is that the book repeatedly falls into the grave error of taking an aberration of one segment of Roman Catholicism or at a particular point in time, and painting the whole church with that brush. The net result is that even though he may have had the best of intentions, the book verges on slander at times. This is a shame for various reasons. I think there is a strong case that can be formulated against the Roman Catholic church -- it is more in need of reform than ever -- so why knock down straw men? If one's book is full of grotesque caricatures, one's legitimate points will not get the hearing they deserve. On top of that, the book is sorely out of date. I think it merits two stars, but even then only with reservation. I don't recommend this book to anyone who doesn't have a strong theological background already. Then, if you are in a position where you need to do extensive research of Roman Catholicism (as a Protestant) or of Protestant critiques of Roman Catholicism, then this book should probably be just one of many that you read. Don't take anything in this book as authoritative without corroborating it elsewhere first! Let us all pray for God's working to protect all the churches from sin and error. We all have a lot of house-cleaning to do."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"Boettner's work has been on my shelf for some time, has been read more than once, and frankly it amazes me that the publishers will not update or edit the work. If it's such a wonderful seller, maybe they don't want to \\"mess with success\\".The work reads well and lacks some of the caustic tone seen in these reviews. It lacks sound references in an academic sense - i.e., footnotes, bibliographies to specific editions, etc., typical for the time but unacceptable today. The reason? Because some of Boettner's facts are just wrong. Look at \\"Some Roman Catholic Heresies and Inventions in the introduction. \\"Baptizing of bells\\" is presented so the reader thinks that bells are actually baptized, a simply unexcusable stretch of the facts in a book filled with such items.Boettner consistently uses religious terms that mean different things to Protestants and Roman Catholics. This is the root of much of the book's misleading statements and a cause of this controversy. As Christians (you potential reader) I suggest you refrain from this book and look elsewhere. There are many better books (on both sides of the controversy!) That this one sells is largely due to the nature of the audience that reads it, an audience afraid to have its assumptions challenged and afraid to undertake the difficult labor of validating this work. Don't take this short-cut. Get James White's \\"The Roman Catholic Controversy\\" or on the other side try Karl Keating's book. Both of these writers do a good job of presenting the case as Christians ought to do, and include academically rigorous footnotes, bibiographies, etc. Those are good values for the money.Pick a side, pick a better book. But don't pick this one. It is dramatically outdated and very often clearly incorrect regarding today's Roman Catholic church.By way of disclosure, I'm Protestant clergy with a theology training from the University of Cambridge."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],E={key:0},H={key:1};function D(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",M,[(e(!0),t(y,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",H,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",E,"See more"))],8,B)):p("",!0)])}const q=d(x,[["render",D],["__scopeId","data-v-61e3c3a2"]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/48.md","filePath":"quotes/48.md"}'),L={name:"quotes/48.md"},P=Object.assign(L,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(q)]))}});export{W as __pageData,P as default};
