What happens if you don't make it to your Number? Do you have a plan? The Number is no ordinary finance book it offers an intriguing and entertaining tour of weath gurus, life coaches, and financial advisers, and our hopes and fears for the future. The result is a provocative field guide to your psyche and finances and an urgently useful book for anyone over thirty. The often-avoided, anxiety-riddled discussion about financial planning for a secure and fulfilling future has been given a new starting point in The Number by Lee Eisenberg. The buzz of professionals and financial industry insiders everywhere, the Number represents the amount of money and resources people will need to enjoy the active life they desire, especially post-career. Backed by imaginative reporting and insights, Eisenberg urges people to assume control and responsibility for their standard of living, and take greater aim on their long-term aspirations. From Wall Street to Main Street USA, the Number means different things to different people. It is constantly fluctuating in people s minds and bank accounts. To some, the Number symbolizes freedom, validation of career success, the ticket to luxurious indulgences and spiritual exploration; to others, it represents the bewildering and nonsensical nightmare of an impoverished existence creeping up on them in their old age, a seemingly hopeless inevitability that they would rather simply ignore than confront. People are highly private and closed-mouthed when it comes to discussing their Numbers, or lack thereof, for fear they might either reveal too much or display ineptitude. In The Number, Eisenberg describes this secret anxiety as the  Last Taboo,  a conundrum snared in confusing financial lingo. He sorts through the fancy jargon and translates the Number into commonsense advice that resonates just as easily with the aging gods and goddesses of corporate boardrooms as it does with ordinary people who are beginning to realize that retirement is now just a couple of decades away. Believing that the Number is as much about self-worth as it is net worth, Eisenberg strives to help readers better understand and more efficiently manage all aspects of their life, money, and pursuit of happiness.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pVtMLGvMGPsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Lord Eternity (Zebra Regency Romance)","description":"When a serial killer targets the local brothels, Jocelyn Kingly, a champion for less fortunate women, soon discovers that the strange amulet in her possession holds the key to the murders as well as to the true nature of her friend vicar Amadeus Fallow and the man she loves, Lucien Valin.

The papacy was no more the church than the empire was feudalism. The church was Christendom and Christendom was the totality of European civilization. It was a way of life which had for its first purpose the worship of God and after that the civilization of man. Its members were the inhabitants of western Europe led and comforted by their parish priests, ruled and according to chance abused or protected by their lords and bishops, who together glimpsed only occasionally and from afar the passing might and splendor of emperors and popes.

In polar opposition, all reports from naturalistic (nonfeeding) field studies are of nonaggressive chimpanzees living peacefully on home ranges in fluid, open, nonhierarchical groups. This research has been largely ignored and downgraded by most of the scientific community. By utilizing the data from these studies, the author is able to construct a model of an egalitarian form of social organization, based on a role relationship of mutual dependence among many charismatic chimpanzees of both sexes and other more dependent members. This highly and necessarily positive mututal dependence system is characteristic of both undisturbed chimpanzees and humans who live or lived by the \\"immediate-return\\" foraging system.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=km6kzgEACAAJ&dq=The+Egalitarians+-+Human+and+Chimpanzee:+An+Anthropological+View+of+Social+Organization&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"And You Give Me a Pain, Elaine","description":"Thirteen-year-old Andrea feels left out when her parents pay more attention to her older sister, Elaine, a notorious trouble-maker.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oHJiOFIYDSUC&dq=And+You+Give+Me+a+Pain,+Elaine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Configuring and Tuning Databases on the Solaris Platform","description":"Covers key performance issues related to using leading databases on Sun servers for system administrators and database programmers.

The authors include some famous, and some not so famous, integral inequalities related to Riemann integration. Many of the problems for Lebesgue integration concern convergence theorems and the interchange of limits and integrals. The book closes with a section on Fourier series, with a concentration on Fourier coefficients of functions from particular classes and on basic theorems for convergence of Fourier series. The book is primarily geared toward students in analysis, as a study aid, for problem-solving seminars, or for tutorials. It is also an excellent resource for instructors who wish to incorporate problems into their lectures.

However varied their weapons, the soldiers of all these eras followed a commander who faced the same obstacles and demonstrated the strategic and tactical genius essential for victory. \\"All warfare is based on deception,\\" wrote Sun Tzu in The Art of War in 400 BCE.

He provides a clear explanation of the steps involved in the process of discernment as first outlined by St. Ignatius of Loyola. Through real-life stories and examples, Lonsdale carefully shows us how to sift through a variety of circumstances and options, as well as our feelings and thoughts about them. He explains how placing all this within a framework of prayer and consciousness of God gradually makes us aware of the harmonies and disharmonies between the mystery of Christ and out-own lives.

Ze moeten namelijk een verband vinden tussen deze moord en het mogelijke motief: een uitermate waardevol schilderij van Van Gogh. Een jonge vrouw, die in de noordelijke toren van het WTC is als deze door het eerste vliegtuig wordt doorboord, blijkt uiteindelijk als enige over de moed te beschikken om te strijden voor rechtvaardigheid en de moord op de oude vrouw te wreken. Van Anna Petrescu wordt aangenomen dat ze dood is, een status die ze gebruikt om Amerika te ontvluchten, om vervolgens achtervolgd te worden van Toronto tot Londen, tot Hong Kong, Tokio en Boekarest. Langzaam ontvouwt zich een netwerk van compleet verschillende personen die allemaal bereid zijn het ondenkbare te doen voor dat ene bijzondere schilderij. Het is echter pas bij Anna's terugkeer in New York dat de puzzel gelegd kan worden. Wat zit er toch achter de ogenschijnlijk onweerstaanbare aantrekkingskracht van Van Gogh's Zelfportret met verbonden oor? Want dat kunstwerk is het enige dat de vermoorde oude vrouw, een afgehakt oor, een advocaat met een maar   n cli?nt, een deal van 50 miljoen, een corrupte Olympi?r en een Engelse gravin met elkaar verbindt... Jeffrey Archer, in zijn twaalfde roman, strikt de lezer in een ingenieus web van onverwachte wendingen en spannende intriges, en laat deze pas op de laatste pagina weer gaan. Jeffrey Archer is een Britse auteur en voormalig politicus. Hij was vijf jaar lid van het Lagerhuis en zesentwintig jaar lid van het Hogerhuis. Archer debuteerde als schrijver in 1974 en heeft sindsdien meerdere internationale bestellers geschreven, waaronder 'Kane & Abel' en de 'Clifton-kronieken'. Naast thrillers schrijft hij korte verhalen en toneelstukken. In zijn autobiografische trilogie 'Gevangenisdagboeken' doet hij verslag van de celstraf die hij moest uitzitten na een veroordeling voor meineed. Jeffrey Archer is een van de meest succesvolle auteurs van het Verenigd Koninkrijk met meer dan 320 miljoen verkochte boeken wereldwijd. Archer is getrouwd, heeft twee zoons en drie kleinkinderen en woont afwisselend in Londen, Cambridge en op Mallorca.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iNgsEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Entropy in Relation to Incomplete Knowledge","description":"This book is about an important issue which has arisen within two of the branches of physical science - namely thermodynamics and statistical mechanics - where the notion of entropy plays an essential role. A number of scientists and information theorists have maintained that entropy is a subjective concept and is a measure of human ignorance. Such a view, if it is valid, would create some profound philosophical problems and would tend to undermine the objectivity of the scientific enterprise. Whilst the present volume is not a treatise on thermodynamics or statistical mechanics, all relevant steps in the building up of these disciplines are carefully scrutinised and it is concluded that the charge of subjectivity cannot be upheld. The widely adopted view that entropy is a measure of disorder, or of lack of information, is shown to be ambiguous, although it may be of use in certain contexts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JjxiQgAACAAJ&dq=Entropy+in+Relation+to+Incomplete+Knowledge&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sara Midda Baby Book","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gZYhAAAACAAJ&dq=Sara+Midda+Baby+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Significance of the Frontier in American History (Milestones of Thought)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cvt3PAAACAAJ&dq=The+Significance+of+the+Frontier+in+American+History+(Milestones+of+Thought)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Social Work Practice: A Radical Perspective","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wE1HAAAAMAAJ&dq=Social+Work+Practice:+A+Radical+Perspective&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Night Stalker (True Crime (St. Martin's Paperbacks))","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uUMUuAEACAAJ&dq=Night+Stalker+(True+Crime+(St.+Martin%27s+Paperbacks))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The conquest of the Philippines by the United States, 1898-1925,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8u5wAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+conquest+of+the+Philippines+by+the+United+States,+1898-1925,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reggae and Caribbean Music: Third Ear: The Essential Listening Companion","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4F4PAQAAMAAJ&dq=Reggae+and+Caribbean+Music:+Third+Ear:+The+Essential+Listening+Companion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strange Stories of Alaska and the Yukon","description":"From the Far North come startling accounts of the extraordinary and the unexplained: mammoths frozen whole in a glacier, a tropical valley deep in the Arctic.

In these pages you ll find early drafts of scenes and notes for characters that never appeared in the plays; discarded lines of dialogue and sonnets; never-before-seen journal entries; and much more. From the original notes for Hamlet (with a very different appearance by the ghost) and revealing early versions of the faeries of A Midsummer Night s Dream, to strange stage directions revised to remove references to a mysterious blue box, The Shakespeare Notebooks is an astonishing document that offers a unique insight into the mind of one of history s most respected and admired figures.

Although rarely associated with postwar suburbia, Orthodox Jews in metropolitan areas across the United States and Canada have successfully combined suburban lifestyles and the culture of consumerism with a strong sense of religious traditionalism and community cohesion. By their very existence in suburbia, argues Etan Diamond, Orthodox Jewish communities challenge dominant assumptions about society and religious culture in the twentieth century. Using the history of Orthodox Jewish suburbanization in Toronto, Diamond explores the different components of the North American suburban Orthodox Jewish community: sacred spaces, synagogues, schools, kosher homes, and social networks. In a larger sense, though, his book tells a story of how traditionalist religious communities have thrived in the most secular of environments. In so doing, it pushes our current understanding of cities and suburbs and their religious communities in new directions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ra_qCQAAQBAJ&dq=And+I+Will+Dwell+in+Their+Midst:+Orthodox+Jews+in+Suburbia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"HOW TO STUDY YOUR BIBLE","description":"Pastor Andy Deane's new book teaches you forty different step-by-step Bible study methods to help you discover, apply and enjoy God's Word.

It transforms what is viewed as an elusive, even ephemeral pursuit, not easily characterized by a precise skill set or inventory of responsibilities, into something definable and actionable, governed by a precise checklist of things designed to help guide work. The new version begins with a synthesis discussions the author has had with a wide range of advertising and marketing people about \\"what's wrong with advertising,\\" setting up the material to follow. It ends with a provocative question, \\"Is account management dead,\\" that the author counters in convincing fashion.

Klare alerted us to the role of resources in conflicts in the post-Cold War world. Now, in Blood and Oil, he concentrates on a single precious commodity, petroleum, while issuing a warning to the United States-its most powerful, and most dependent, global consumer. Since September 11th and the commencement of the \\"war on terror,\\" the world's attention has been focused on the relationship between U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East and the oceans of crude oil that lie beneath the region's soil. Klare traces oil's impact on international affairs since World War II, revealing its influence on the Truman, Eisenhower, Nixon, and Carter doctrines. He shows how America's own wells are drying up as our demand increases; by 2010, the United States will need to import 60 percent of its oil. And since most of this supply will have to come from chronically unstable, often violently anti-American zones-the Persian Gulf, the Caspian Sea, Latin America, and Africa-our dependency is bound to lead to recurrent military involvement. With clarity and urgency, Blood and Oil delineates the United States' predicament and cautions that it is time to change our energy policies, before we spend the next decades paying for oil with blood.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6uu8hHc8zI0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"International Management: Culture, Strategy, and Behavior with World Map","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BIvlzgEACAAJ&dq=International+Management:+Culture,+Strategy,+and+Behavior+with+World+Map&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories","description":"A collection of stories by Sandra Cisneros, the winner of the 2019 PEN/Nabokov Award for Achievement in International Literature.

Maurie D. McInnis explores the social, political, and material culture of the city to learn how--and at what human cost--Charleston came to be regarded as one of the most refined cities in antebellum America. While other cities embraced a culture of democracy and egalitarianism, wealthy Charlestonians cherished English notions of aristocracy and refinement, defending slavery as a social good and encouraging the growth of southern nationalism. Members of the city's merchant-planter class held tight to the belief that the clothes they wore, the manners they adopted, and the ways they designed house lots and laid out city streets helped secure their place in social hierarchies of class and race. This pursuit of refinement, McInnis demonstrates, was bound up with their determined efforts to control the city's African American majority. She then examines slave dress, mobility, work spaces, and leisure activities to understand how Charleston slaves negotiated their lives among the whites they served. The textures of lives lived in houses, yards, streets, and public spaces come into dramatic focus in this lavishly illustrated portrait of antebellum Charleston. McInnis's innovative history of the city combines the aspirations of its would-be nobility, the labors of the African slaves who built and tended the town, and the ambitions of its architects, painters, writers, and civic promoters.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=a8g3CwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Politics+of+Taste+in+Antebellum+Charleston&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mandie and the Cherokee Legend (Mandie, Book 2)","description":"A mysterious legend among the Cherokee people told of long-lost gold, hidden for centuries by an Indian chief.

Yet each succumbed to a fiscal crisis brought on by public debt and taxation and eventually fell into long-term economic decline. Now, public debt and taxation dominate the America policy agenda. Must the United States follow the same dismal pattern of fiscal crisis and economic decline? Mountains of Debt argues that it is not too late for the United States to change directions and suggests a comprehensive program for reform of American fiscal institutions that would reduce the deficit problem and at the same time reverse the long-term structural trends that are both the cause and the effect of the fiscal crisis today. Offering proposals for reducing the deficit, this new analysis could alter the current course of the United States economy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DTzVtKyjveYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the Sun","description":"Rarely has a book so packed with accurate and well researched factual information been so widely read and popularly acclaimed.

Maintaining the clear and accessible style of the previous edition, this book outlines the essential statistical methodsfor survey design and analysis, while also exploring techniques that have developed over the past decade. The Fourth Edition successfully guides the reader through the basic concepts and procedures that accompany real-world sample surveys, such as sampling designs, problems of missing data, statistical analysis of multistage sampling data, and nonresponse and poststratification adjustment procedures. Rather than employ a heavily mathematical approach, the authors present illustrative examples that demonstrate the rationale behind common steps in the sampling process, from creating effective surveys to analyzing collected data. Along with established methods, modern topics are treated through the book's new features, which include: A new chapter on telephone sampling, with coverage of declining response rates, the creation of \\"do not call\\" lists, and the growing use of cellular phones A new chapter on sample weighting that focuses on adjustments to weight for nonresponse, frame deficiencies, and the effects of estimator instability An updated discussion of sample survey data analysis that includes analytic procedures for estimation and hypothesis testing A new section on Chromy's widely used method of taking probability proportional to size samples with minimum replacement of primary sampling units An expanded index with references on the latest research in the field All of the book's examples and exercises can be easily worked out using various software packages including SAS, STATA, and SUDAAN, and an extensive FTP site contains additional data sets. With its comprehensive presentation and wealth of relevant examples, Sampling of Populations, Fourth Edition is an ideal book for courses on survey sampling at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It is also a valuable reference for practicing statisticians who would like to refresh their knowledge of sampling techniques.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XU9ZmLe5k1IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The women of the Arabs","description":"This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

Lectures were presented by free world leaders in the field of machine dynamics and optimization. Participants in the Institute were specialists from throughout NATO, many of whom presented contributed papers during the Institute and all of whom participated actively in discussions on technical aspects of the subject. The proceedings are organized into five parts, each addressing a technical aspect of the field of computational methods in dynamic analysis and design of mechanical systems. The introductory paper presented first in the text outlines some of the numerous technical considerations that must be given to organizing effective and efficient computational methods and computer codes to serve engineers in dynamic analysis and design of mechanical systems. Two substantially different approaches to the field are identified in this introduction and are given attention throughout the text. The first and most classical approach uses a minimal set of Lagrangian generalized coordinates to formulate equations of motion with a small number of constraints. The second method uses a maximal set of cartesian coordinates and leads to a large number of differential and algebraic constraint equations of rather simple form. These fundamentally different approaches and associated methods of symbolic computation, numerical integration, and use of computer graphics are addressed throughout the proceedings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mXK2oAEACAAJ&dq=Computer-Aided+Analysis+of+Mechanical+Systems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fait Accompli: A Historical Account of the 457th Bomb Group (H); The Fireball Outfit","description":"This end book of the Trilogy focuses on the many missions of the 457th Bomb Group.

These newspapers were divided between North and South, and also divided within the North and South. These divisions reflected and exacerbated the conflicts in political thought that caused the Civil War and the political and ideological battles within the Union and the Confederacy about how to pursue the war. In the North, dissenting voices alarmed the Lincoln administration to such a degree that draconian measures were taken to suppress dissenting newspapers and editors, while in the South, the Confederate government held to its fundamental belief in freedom of speech and was more tolerant of political attacks in the press. This volume consists of eighteen chapters on subjects including newspaper coverage of the rise of Lincoln, press reports on George Armstrong Custer, Confederate women war correspondents, Civil War photojournalists, newspaper coverage of the Emancipation Proclamation, and the suppression of the dissident press. This book tells the story of a divided press before and during the Civil War, discussing the roles played by newspapers in splitting the nation, newspaper coverage of the war, and the responses by the Union and Confederate administrations to press criticism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8q00DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women in African Economies: From Burning Sun to Boardroom","description":"Small businesses run by women are a vital part of the Ugandan economy.

It has been variously interpreted as a major theological treatise, an elevated philosophical exposition, or a guidebook to mystical experience. Liturgy of Liberation offers a fresh reading and commentary on the Upadesasahasri in terms of oral performance and sacramental practice, placing its sacred, scripted dialogues into conversation with the Apostle Paul and other witnesses from the Christian tradition. What results is not merely new appreciation for Shankara and his radical message of non-duality, but also a renewed sense of the scandal of the cross, the subversive power of the word, and the mystery of Christian discipleship. Beyond this, Liturgy of Liberation explores the potential of dialogue itself to disclose the intimate, liberating presence of God at the heart of creation and the core of every human being.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kIiStgAACAAJ&dq=Liturgy+of+Liberation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Caring for the Elderly in Japan and the US: Practices and Policies (Routledge Advances in Asia-Pacific Studies)","description":"In an era of changing demographics and values, this volume provides a cross-national and interdisciplinary perspective on the question of who cares for and about the elderly.

She lived most of her adult life in Houston, Texas, where she was born. The life story of this Chicana icon encompasses a 60-year singing career that began with the dawn of the recording industry in the 1920s and continued well into the 1980s, ceasing only after she suffered a devastating stroke. Her status as a working-class idol continues to this day, making her one of the most prominent and long-standing performers in the history of the recording industry and a champion of Chicana/o music. This bilingual edition presents Lydia Mendoza's historia in an interview between the artist and Yolanda Broyles-Gonz lez: first is the English translation, then the Spanish original, as told by Mendoza herself. Broyles-Gonz lez concludes the volume with an extended essay on the significance of Mendoza's career and her place in Tejana music and Chicana studies. Known as a lone artist and performer, Lydia Mendoza's voice and twelve-string guitar-playing figure prominently in her ability to both nurture and transmit the vast oral tradition of popular Mexican song with beauty and integrity. She sang the songs of the people across generations in the old tradition; all are indigenous to the Americas, and many of them to Texas. It is the music that emerged from the experiences of native peoples (on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border) within the colonial context of the nineteenth century. Mendoza's prominence and stature as a Chicana idol stems from her sustained presence and perpetual visibility within a complex network of social and cultural relations in the twentieth century. Along with being one of the earliest female recording and touring artists, she is loved as a voice of working-class sentimiento, sentiment and sentience, through song, which is one of the most cherished of Chicana/o cultural art forms. Through her vast repertoire and unmistakable interpretive skill in the shaping of songs she is a living embodiment of U.S.-Mexican culture and a participant in raza people's protracted struggles for survival.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1920qdpV8OkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The scavengers and critics of the Warren report;: The endless paradox","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_21AAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+scavengers+and+critics+of+the+Warren+report%3B:+The+endless+paradox&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE HANDBOOK OF SAILING.","description":"Sailing offers an enjoyable pastime for untold thousands of people worldwide--some of whom are experienced mariners with their own boats, while others are trying out the sport for the first time.

The author of this book draws attention to these, and presents his alternative hypothesis that larvae have been transferred from one taxon to another. In his previous book (Larvae and Evolution, 1992), the author used larval transfer to explain developmental anomalies in eight animal phyla. In the present book, he claims that the basic forms of all larvae and all embryos have been transferred from foreign taxa. This leads to a new, comprehensive theory on the origin of embryos and larvae, replacing the discredited 'recapitulation' theory of Haeckel (1866). Metamorphosis, previously unexplained, represents a change in taxon during development.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FNPoCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Back Street","description":"La Gina is a smart, Hurricane Katrina survivor who used her physical gifts to achieve material gain.

Why do so many African-Americans whether privileged or poor, urban or suburban, young or old live in a state of chronic anxiety, fear, and shame? Rock My Soul: Black People and Self-Esteem breaks through collective denial and dares to tell this truth that crippling low self-esteem has reached epidemic proportions in our lives and in our diverse communities. With visionary insight, hooks exposes the underlying reality that it has been difficult if not impossible for our nation to create a culture that promotes and sustains healthy self-esteem. Without self-esteem people begin to lose their sense of agency. They feel powerless. They feel they can only be victims. The need for self-esteem never goes away. But it is never too late for any of us to acquire the healthy self-esteem that is needed for a fulfilling life. hooks gets to the heart and soul of the African-American identity crisis, offering critical insight and hard-won wisdom about what it takes to heal the scars of the past, promote and maintain self-esteem, and lay down the roots for a grounded community with a prosperous future. She examines the way historical movements for racial uplift fail to sustain our quest for self-esteem. Moving beyond a discussion of race, she identifies diverse barriers keeping us from well-being: the trauma of abandonment, constant shaming, and the loss of personal integrity. In highlighting the role of desegregation, education, the absence of progressive parenting, spiritual crisis, or fundamental breakdowns in communication between black women and men, bell hooks identifies mental health as the new revolutionary frontier and provides guidance for healing within the black community.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TyJU2psZtEoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Getting Frankie Married -- And Afterwards, and Other Plays (Horton Foote Collected Works Volume III)","description":"A collection of six plays by Horton Foote.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SRtaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Getting+Frankie+Married+--+And+Afterwards,+and+Other+Plays+(Horton+Foote+Collected+Works+Volume+III)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-tung","description":"Comrade Mao Tse-tung is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our era. He has inherited, defended and developed Marxism-Leninism with genius, creatively and comprehensively, and has brought it to a higher and completely new stage. Mao Tse-tung's thought is Marxism-Leninism of the era in which imperialism is heading for total collapse and socialism is advancing to world-wide victory. It is a powerful ideological weapon for opposing imperialism and for opposing revisionism and dogmatism. Mao Tse-tung's thought is the guiding principle for all the work of the Party, the army and the country. Therefore, the most fundamental task in our Party's political and ideological work is at all times to hold high the great red banner of Mao Tse-tung's thought, to arm the minds of the people throughout the country with it and to persist in using it to command every field of activity. The broad masses of the workers, peasants and soldiers and the broad ranks of the revolutionary cadres and the intellectuals should really master Mao Tse-tung's thought; they should all study Chairman Mao's writings, follow his teachings, act according to his instructions and be his good fighters. In studying the works of Chairman Mao, one should have specific problems in mind, study and apply his works in a creative way, combine study with application, first study what must be urgently applied so as to get quick results, and strive hard to apply what one is studying. In order really to master Mao Tse-tung's thought, it is essential to study many of Chairman Mao's basic concepts over and over again, and it is best to memorize important statements and study and apply them repeatedly. The newspapers should regularly carry quotations from Chairman Mao relevant to current issues for readers to study and apply. The experience of the broad masses in their creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the last few years has proved that to study selected quotations from Chairman Mao with specific problems in mind is a good way to learn Mao Tse-tung's thought, a method conducive to quick results. We have compiled Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung in order to help the broad masses learn Mao Tse-tung's thought more effectively. In organizing their study, units should select passages that are relevant to the situation, their tasks, the current thinking of their personnel, and the state of their work. In our great motherland, a new era is emerging in which the workers, peasants and soldiers are grasping Marxism-Leninism, Mao Tse-tung's thought. Once Mao Tse-tung's thought is grasped by the broad masses, it becomes an inexhaustible source of strength and a spiritual atom bomb of infinite power. The large-scale publication of Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung is a vital measure for enabling the broad masses to grasp Mao Tse-tung's thought and for promoting the revolutionization of our people's thinking. It is our hope that all comrades will learn earnestly and diligently, bring about a new nation-wide high tide in the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works, and, under the great red banner of Mao Tse-tung's thought, strive to build our country into a great socialist state with modern agriculture, modern industry, modern science and culture and modern national defence","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=h53GLQAACAAJ&dq=Quotations+From+Chairman+Mao+Tse-tung&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chicken Soup For The Preteen Soul 1 (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Chicken Soup for the Soul (Pb))","description":"This first batch of Chicken Soup for Teens consists of 101 stories every teenager can relate to and learn from -- without feeling criticized or judged.

To paint the scenes, Bierstadt joined several journeys of the Westward Expansion. He was the leading painter of these scenes for the remainder of the 19th century. He became part of the Hudson River School in New York, an informal group of painters who started painting along this scenic river. Their style was based on carefully detailed paintings with romantic, almost glowing lighting, sometimes called \\"luminism\\". An important interpreter of the western landscape, Bierstadt, along with Thomas Moran, is also grouped with the Rocky Mountain School. Bierstadt's technical skill, earned through his study of European landscape, was crucial to his success as a painter of the American West. His exhibition pieces were brilliantly crafted images that glorified the American West as a land of promise. Bierstadt was a prolific artist, having completed over 500 paintings during his lifetime.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VdxYCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Year of the Comet","description":"On the clearest nights in the darkest places you can see as many as two thousand stars.

His struggles in the icy waters of the North Atlantic had shattered his constitution, and the awful things he had seen on that fateful night left him a haunted man. One observer said he had the look of someone \\"who had descended as distinctly into hell as any human being would care to acknowledge, and had risen again from the dead.\\" Nevertheless he tried to make sense of his experiences, and this book was published soon after his death. The first half is his own account of the sinking, and shows how he had to be both lucky and strong just to live through the night. In the second half he tells the individual stories of each of the Titanic's lifeboats, summarizing the bare facts and then providing dramatic survivor accounts, from personal interviews and from testimony given to the British and American inquiries into the disaster.

Shark: The Novel","description":"So it's kind of like a parlor game, then?... The question is apparently of Ancient Eastern extraction.... It seems to be a gut thing. The answer just feels right and then you come up with reasons.... Given a relatively level playing field -- i.e., water deep enough so that a Shark could maneuver proficiently, but shallow enough so that a Bear could stand and operate with its characteristic dexterity -- who would win in a fight between a Bear and a Shark? In this brilliant satire of our media-saturated culture, the sovereign nation of Las Vegas -- the entertainment capital of the world -- is host to Bear v. Shark II. After a disappointing loss in the first matchup between the land and the sea, the bear is back with a vengeance and out for blood. All of America is obsessed with the upcoming spectacle, so tickets are hard to come by. With an essay entitled \\"Bear v. Shark: A Reason to Live,\\" young Curtis Norman wins a national writing contest and four tickets to the event. The Normans load up their SUV and embark on a road trip to Vegas. As they head cross-country, the family is besieged by a dizzying barrage of voices: television and radio personalities, public service announcements, bear and shark pundits, Freudians, theologians, and self-published authors, in addition to the Bear v. Shark fanatics, cultists, and resisters they meet at roadside gas stations and restaurants. Overwhelmed by factoids, statistics, and ten-second debates, the Normans -- along with the rest of country -- can't seem to get their facts straight, much less figure out a way to actually communicate with one another. Sound bites and verbal tics predominate; misheard, misunderstood, and just plain mistaken information is absorbed, mangled, and regurgitated to hilarious effect; and the most inane subjects -- from the disappearance of Dutch culture to the Shakespearean bias toward the bear -- are vigorously and obsessively debated. These meaningless exchanges of misinformation leave Mr. Norman disenchanted, world-weary, and ambivalent about the impending show, but the family eventually makes it to Vegas for an apocalyptic and surprisingly emotional ending. Written in quick, commercial-like segments that mirror the media it satirizes, Chris Bachelder's debut is a fiercely funny, razor-sharp novel about the odd intersection of zealotry and trivia, about the barriers to human connection in a society that values entertainment above all else. Through a clever act of novelistic subterfuge, Bachelder makes us laugh at our penchant for absurd and useless information while drawing us into a dazzling spectacle of his own imagination.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=49Fzqd3XQWQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stone That Became A Mountain, The","description":"Beginning with the prophet Daniel's glowing imagery of the stone that grew into a mountain, Richard Bewes has come up with a colourful - and vital - presentation of the biggest thing there is; the kingdom that outlives and outlasts everything else in sight.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oY8JAAAACAAJ&dq=Stone+That+Became+A+Mountain,+The&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Winchester Book Signed","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=m2YUSQAACAAJ&dq=Winchester+Book+Signed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oldsmobile The First Seventy-Five Years","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dmu6oAEACAAJ&dq=Oldsmobile+The+First+Seventy-Five+Years&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Family Matters","description":"Nariman Vakeel is a seventy-nine-year-old Parsi widower beset by Parkinson's disease and haunted by memories of the past.

This ancient people had a famous reputation in Eurasian Late Antiquity. However, their history has often been evaluated as a footnote in the histories of the later Roman Empire and early Germanic peoples. Kim addresses this imbalance and challenges the commonly held assumption that the Huns were a savage people who contributed little to world history, examining striking geopolitical changes brought about by the Hunnic expansion over much of continental Eurasia and revealing the Huns' contribution to European, Iranian, Chinese and Indian civilization and statecraft. By examining Hunnic culture as a Eurasian whole, The Huns provides a full picture of their society which demonstrates that this was a complex group with a wide variety of ethnic and linguistic identities. Making available critical information from both primary and secondary sources regarding the Huns' Inner Asian origins, which would otherwise be largely unavailable to most English speaking students and Classical scholars, this is a crucial tool for those interested in the study of Eurasian Late Antiquity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mcf4CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","description":"For use in schools and libraries only.

Basque cooks are widely considered among the best in Europe, combining their love of fresh, simple ingredients with time-honored techniques. The joy of cooking and eating are central to Basque culture. In San Sebasti n and throughout the region, men belong to cooking clubs, dedicated to the preservation of their outstanding cultural and culinary heritage. Outside the cooking societies, simple family meals turn into feasts of mammoth proportions, and everywhere conversation invariably turns to good food and the pursuit of it. The Basque Kitchen, lusciously illustrated with photographs of the Basque region as well as its famous dishes, is the first major cookbook to explore Basque cooking on both sides of the border. Basque native Gerald Hirigoyen, named one of America s best chefs by Food & Wine magazine, celebrates the food and memories of his beloved homeland. He shares recipes for his favorite Basque specialties, from traditional renditions of Salt Cod \\"al Pil-Pil\\" and Pip rade to sumptuous soups, salads, meat, poultry, game, and of course, more seafood, all built on a bounty of fresh ingredients and carefully presented for the home cook.

Although obviously a central concern of linguistics, the semantic behaviour of words has been unduly neglected in the current literature, which has tended to emphasize sentential semantics and its relation to formal systems of logic. In this textbook D. A. Cruse establishes in a principled and disciplined way the descriptive and generalizable facts about lexical relations that any formal theory of semantics will have to encompass. Among the topics covered in depth are idiomaticity, lexical ambiguity, synonymy, hierarchical relations such as hyponymy and meronymy, and various types of oppositeness. Syntagmatic relations are also treated in some detail. The discussions are richly illustrated by examples drawn almost entirely from English. Although a familiarity with traditional grammar is assumed, readers with no technical linguistic background will find the exposition always accessible. All readers with an interest in semantics will find in this original text not only essential background but a stimulating new perspective on the field.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Br9CzwEACAAJ&dq=Lexical+Semantics+(Cambridge+Textbooks+in+Linguistics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Charleston correctly,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7JwAwFTIZh4C&dq=How+to+Charleston+correctly,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Twenty years' armistice, 1918-1938,","description":"Map on lining-papers. \\"References\\": p. 299-302.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=E4IBAAAAMAAJ&dq=Twenty+years%27+armistice,+1918-1938,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Revitalization: Improving Conditions in Distressed Inner-City Neighborhoods (Contemporary Urban Affairs)","description":"This book discusses the revitalization of decayed inner-city neighborhoods.

That the last major action of the war occurred in the South was no accident. The British regarded the South as their best chance of crushing the rebellion, and a southern strategy governed British military campaigning during the decisive years from 1778 to 1781. How that strategy failed in Georgia, the Carolinas, and Virginia is answered in this highly readable military history, which carries the reader from the early backcountry skirmishes to the climactic triumph at Yorktown. From Savannah to Yorktown sketches many of the colorful field commanders, discusses the weaponry and uniforms, and, above all, unfolds the battle events, strategy, and tactics. Well-illustrated with maps, portraits, battle scenes, and arms, this first comprehensive military history devoted to the American Revolution in the South will be welcomed by anyone interested in the southern battleground of freedom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gfSpYU0PG5oC&dq=From+Savannah+to+Yorktown:+The+American+Revolution+in+the+South&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Secret Lives of the Sushi Club","description":"A friendship turns sour when one of four women reveals the lives of her friends in her bestseller; however, a rafting trip to save their unraveling friendship becomes a test of physical and emotional endurance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=frTzvhYcynYC&dq=The+Secret+Lives+of+the+Sushi+Club&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Usborne Jigsaw World Atlas (Usborne Jigsaw Books)","description":"This delightful pack contains a 300-piece jigsaw of a beautifully illustrated world map for children to assemble, as well as a 32-page picture atlas of the world in which kids can see and discover each of the world's continents in more detail with its highly visual maps. * Beautifully illustrated jigsaw and richly detailed atlas makes a wonderful present.

When his high-spirited, often rebellious daughter, Charlotte, revealed a fondness for things theatrical, it was thought that the young actress would follow in his footsteps at the legendary Drury Lane, creating a brilliant career on the London stage. But this was not to be. And it was not that Charlotte lacked talent-she was gifted, particularly at comedy. Troublesome, however, was her habit of dressing in men's clothes-a preference first revealed onstage but adopted elsewhere after her disastrous marriage to an actor, who became the last man she ever loved. Kathryn Shevelow, an expert on the sophisticated world of eighteenth-century London (the setting for classics such as Tom Jones and Moll Flanders), re-creates Charlotte's downfall from the heights of London's theatrical world to its lascivious lows (the domain of fire-eaters, puppeteers, wastrels, gender-bending cross-dressers, wenches, and scandalous sorts of every variety) and her comeback as the author of one of the first autobiographies ever written by a woman. Beyond the appealingly unorthodox Charlotte, Shevelow masterfully recalls for us a historical era of extraordinary stylishness, artifice, character, interest, and intrigue.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UBtBloAqIuEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"12 Stories for Late at Night","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=foJizgEACAAJ&dq=12+Stories+for+Late+at+Night&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When Love Turns to Fear: Answers from an Abuse Survivor","description":"When Love Turns to Fear: Answers from an Abuse Survivor is designed to answer the wide-spread requests for a book written by someone who experienced abuse to provides insights, understanding, and solutions for abusive relationships.

Tot de wereld in mei 2011 opgelucht ademhaalde. Het brein achter 9/11 was uitgeschakeld. De interventie van de Amerikaanse commando's getuigde van een zelden geziene stoutmoedigheid en effici?ntie.

Every evening throngs of soldiers, sailors, and Marines strolled along the seawall, basking in the warm sun and soft Gulf breezes. It was paradise on earth. Small wonder that German U-boat commanders caught Americans totally unprepared for a Gulf attack. Between 1942 and 1943, twenty-four German submarines entered the Gulf of Mexico and attacked American and Allied ships, sinking fifty-six merchant ships and damaging fourteen more. Although responses were initially chaotic, Americans soon established a defense system that could cope with the threat.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PflmAAAAMAAJ&dq=Torpedoes+in+the+Gulf:+Galveston+and+the+U-Boats,+1942-1943&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No bed for Bacon","description":"Master Will Shakespeare and his struggles to finish his new play are at the center of this classic 1941 satire of Elizabethan England, said by many to be the inspiration behind the film  Shakespeare in Love.

Beginning with a study of contemporary constructions of the Self and meaning in the thought of New England clergyman Horace Bushnell, philosopher R. W. Emerson, and mesmerist J. P. F. Deleuze, the argument traces Hawthorne's involvement with these ideas and the process of his conversion to them, culminating in detailed analyses of the four major romances that show how deeply they are worked with speculations about the nature of the Self and its ambient reality.

The end result is a book that, while invaluable to specialist, is accessible and appealing to the non-specialist, and covers a vast spread of \\"Englishes\\" from Brummie, Cockney, Estuary, and RP in the UK to New York and New Orleans speech in the US and such other varieties as Indian English, Maori English, and West African Pidgin. A concluding chapter studies: the nature and power of large languages; such issues as gender and political correctness; the role, status, and nature of broken and fractured English; the worldwide English language teaching industry; and the issue of standardness, considered both locally and globally. This hugely comprehensive work provides a fascinating and novel survey of English as both a pre-eminent \\"standard\\" world language and a family of vigorously diverse regional varieties.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mU95QgAACAAJ&dq=The+Oxford+Guide+to+World+English&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arabian sands","description":"Arabian Sands is Wilfred Thesiger's record of his extraordinary journey through the parched \\"Empty Quarter\\" of Arabia.

Is this life worth caring about? How can we find a way between the deceit of fanatical belief and despair? In the view of Lancelot Law Whyte, the essential challenge to mankind today is an underlying nihilism promoting violence and frustrating sane policies on major social issues. Avoiding the seductive trap of utopianism, Whyte approaches this challenge by defining the terms of a potentially worldwide consensus of heart, mind, and will.In this volume, Whyte addresses the problems of despair and fanatical religious or political reactions that arise from despair. He begins with the basic problem of nihilism, or the tendency toward pessimism and self/other destruction that faces us at this point in human development. Rejecting all forms of religious sectarianism as separating God from the individual and people from each other, he discerns, as well, a fundamental disunity and incompleteness among the sciences that render them incapable of supplying a guide to social order. Whyte sees the universe as an arena of conflict between tendencies toward order and disorder with the former dominating and containing the latter. In place of science and traditional religion, Whyte draws upon what he sees as the unconscious tradition, a genius of the community, shared in degrees by all its members, that points mankind toward a better way of living.Whyte does not posit a state of perfection, nor does he suggest the end of human suffering. Instead he suggests that an integrated state of being, freed from the old mind-body dualism will be a new starting point in human evolution. Accessibly written and firmly rooted in science, philosophy, and history, The Universe of Experience will be of interest to sociologists, psychologists, and philosophers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fKs0DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rights of Man","description":"Thomas Paine was the first international revolutionary. His Common Sense (1776) was the most widely read pamphlet of the American Revolution; his Rights of Man (1791-2) was the most famous defence of the French Revolution and sent out a clarion call for revolution throughout the world. He paid the price for his principles: he was outlawed in Britain, narrowly escaped execution in France, and was villified as an atheist and a Jacobin on his return to America. Paine loathed the unnatural inequalities fostered by the hereditary and monarchical systems. He believed that government must be by and for the people and must limit itself to the protection of their natural rights. But he was not a libertarian: from a commitment to natural rights he generated one of the first blueprints for a welfare state, combining a liberal order of civil rights with egalitarian constraints. This collection brings together Paine's most powerful political writings from the American and French revolutions in the first fully annotated edition of these works.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lEMUAQAAIAAJ&dq=Rights+of+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secrets of Successful Negotiating for Women: From Landing a Big Account to Buying the Car of Your Dreams and Everything in Between","description":"The ultimate guide to negotiation for women.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=768QtAEACAAJ&dq=Secrets+of+Successful+Negotiating+for+Women:+From+Landing+a+Big+Account+to+Buying+the+Car+of+Your+Dreams+and+Everything+in+Between&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook of Research Methods in Industrial and Organizational Psychology","description":"Handbook of Research Methods in Industrial and Organizational Psychology is a comprehensive and contemporary treatment of research philosophies, approaches, tools, and techniques indigenous to industrial and organizational psychology.

Race in the Jury Box focuses on the racially unrepresentative jury as one of the remaining barriers to racial equality and a recurring source of controversy in American life. Because members of minority groups remain underrepresented on juries, various communities have tried race-conscious jury selection, termed \\"affirmative jury selection.\\" The authors argue that affirmative jury selection can insure fairness, verdict legitimization, and public confidence in the justice system. This book offers a critical analysis and systematic examination of possible applications of race-based jury selection, examining the public perception of these measures and their constitutionality. The authors make use of court cases, their own experiences as jury consultants, and jury research, as well as statistical surveys and analysis. The work concludes with the presentation of four strategies for affirmative jury selection.  Not only do the authors point out (and address) the lack of research concerning affirmative jury selection procedures, but they also unabashedly call for immediate consideration and necessity of reform.    Criminal Justice Review   Race in the Jury Box is an impressively argued book that should find a place on the bookshelf of anyone concerned with the American jury and with racial justice in America today. Fukurai and Krooth are among the most innovative and creative jury researchers today;   [they] not only advance new ideas, but also provide evidence that these ideas can work.

But the author considers these laws so central to all our lives that they needed a book of their own, and a more universal treatment, since anyone could benefit from applying any of these laws.

For most of us, life is often a humdrum course of the same-old and the nothing-new. We may dream about running away to exotic lands or retreating to distant monasteries, but the whirligig of life won't let us out of its clutches. Stairway of Surprise has become a new classic of anthroposophic spiritual practice. Dr. Michael Lipson re-visions Rudolf Steiner's six basic exercises to make them relevant to our lives today. With examples drawn from world literature and from his psychotherapy practice, Lipson shows how these exercises stretch from common events in daily life to the depths of spiritual experience. The path of meditation offered here is experiential from start to finish: not something to think only, but something to live. By practicing these exercises for a few minutes each day, we can discover the surprise in the universe, which is usually hidden from us by our stale, habitual attitudes. CONTENTS: Introduction I.

With the influential book Cybernetics, first published in 1948, Norbert Wiener laid the theoretical foundations for the multidisciplinary field of cybernetics, the study of controlling the flow of information in systems with feedback loops, be they biological, mechanical, cognitive, or social. At the core of Wiener's theory is the message (information), sent and responded to (feedback); the functionality of a machine, organism, or society depends on the quality of messages. Information corrupted by noise prevents homeostasis, or equilibrium. And yet Cybernetics is as philosophical as it is technical, with the first chapter devoted to Newtonian and Bergsonian time and the philosophical mixed with the technical throughout. This book brings the 1961 second edition back into print, with new forewords by Doug Hill and Sanjoy Mitter. Contemporary readers of Cybernetics will marvel at Wiener's prescience his warnings against  noise,  his disdain for  hucksters  and  gadget worshipers,  and his view of the mass media as the single greatest anti-homeostatic force in society. This edition of Cybernetics gives a new generation access to a classic text.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=p-mvDwAAQBAJ&dq=Cybernetics,+Second+Edition:+or+the+Control+and+Communication+in+the+Animal+and+the+Machine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peacock Pie a Book of Rhymes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PsU7AQAAIAAJ&dq=Peacock+Pie+a+Book+of+Rhymes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cheaper By the Dozen","description":"In this State Standards-aligned Literature Kit?, we divide the novel by chapters or sections and feature reading comprehension and vocabulary questions.

Business lessons distilled from the mind of a moonshiner include: Finding your purpose in business (and life). Setting goals, reaching goals then setting more goals. Founding a small business and growing it into a big company. Building a highly unique brand. Making money out of thin air (almost). Adam s ancestors were arrested in 1864 for tax evasion on a shipment of moonshine bound for Canada, resulting in the collapse of Chafee & Co. Distilling. Undaunted by their demise, the family opened the grand Chafee s Hotel in Middletown, Connecticut, at the dawn of the Roaring twenties, hosting an opulent and infamous speakeasy.

His understanding of life, of energy and of the universe is unparalleled by most western minds. He has an extensive background in nontraditional education by our American standards. Each time that we have had a conversation with him, he has shifted our perspectives in a variety of directions and expanded our minds to other ways of looking into our selves and looking into and at life and our surroundings. He is open and very genuine in his perspectives on a variety of subjects. He operates with and through consciousness or as he puts it, he works directly with the idea of the Creative Principle in a knowing sense. He says he does not separate himself from It like the majority of humanity and it is this idea alone that creates illness and inner disturbance with one's own self. If one desires to be whole then they must learn to operate in union with Higher Cause and not the lower as we do in this part of the world. His philosophy is this that if a person operates as one then there is no disturbance and one is able to view Cause with deep sincerity. Then truth is shown them in all things for, as one, there is no judgment of any event. It is our mental judgments that separate us from Cause and this we shouldn't do on any level within us. It is about the inner experience of life and not the outer. The inner is the truth and the outer is the illusion. The outer takes our true power of being away from us for we do not realize that we are the true temple of life and life is an honor.

The space is smaller, there s no grocery store 5 minutes away, you have fewer prepared foods and electric appliances, and food storage is much different. Despite cruising different oceans, we Jan and Carolyn--both faced the same challenges: eating well while having time to enjoy all the other great aspects of cruising. We love to snorkel, swim, kayak, explore and just sit and admire the view. We learned with the cookbooks we both had aboard, and wished for information that wasn't available--like when Jan ended up with a frozen chicken complete with head and feet and no instructions on how to cut it up. When we couldn't get foods such as sour cream, English muffins, spaghetti sauce or yogurt, we adapted recipes to make our own. Other times, we experimented with substituting ingredients--maybe the result wasn t identical, but it was still tasty. We ended up with over 150 substitutions and dozens of  make it yourself  options. As we traded recipes and knowledge with each other, we realized we were compiling information that became The Boat Galley Cookbook: 800+ recipes made from readily-obtainable ingredients with hand utensils, including numerous choices to suit every taste: not just one cake but 20, 16 ways to prepare fish, 10 regional barbeque sauces, and so on. Step-by-step directions to give even  non-cooks  the confidence they can turn out tasty meals without prepared foods. Detailed instructions on unfamiliar things like making yogurt and bread, grilling virtually every food imaginable, preparing and cooking freshly-caught fish and seafood, cutting up and boning meat, cooking in a Thermos and baking on the stove top, as well as lots of tips on how to do things more easily in a tiny, moving kitchen. All this in an easy-to-navigate format including side tabs on the Contents to help you find your way and extensive cross reference lists at the end of each chapter.

If you are looking for concrete information on the Kabbalah, or authoritative texts on that subject. The Qabalah is the Secret Doctrine of the Jews, handed down throughout the ages by the great teachers to their beloved disciples under the solemn vow of secrecy. In the Twelfth Century, however, the principal text-book of the Qabalah was written down by a very learned Rabbi named Moses de Leon. This book is known as the Zohar, and contains inexhaustible mines of occult knowledge. Priceless treasures of mystic lore are scattered in its volumes, awaiting discovery by the intelligent student. The language of the Zohar, however (the Hebrew Chaldaic), known to a very few scholars only, constitutes the main difficulty in the way of those desirous of studying the Qabalah. The learned assemblies of olden times, in which the great Masters of Israel held forth their doctrines, have been the original sources of the philosophy of these latter days. Modern Occultism, too, is derived from the same quarters, and should the pages of the Holy Qabalah be accessible some day to the English student, he will be astonished and delighted at the wealth of occult truth he will find in them. The books of the Qabalah are fountains of living waters and at a time of great spiritual need, as the present is, the strength and consolation offered us through its teachings are doubly welcome. The greater part of my life has been devoted to this study, and the teachings given out in my books are all based upon this ancient wisdom of the Rabbis ELIAS GEWURZ.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1h2YZwEACAAJ&dq=The+hidden+treasures+of+the+ancient+Qabalah&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heart of Darkness and Selected Short Fiction (Barnes & Noble Classics)","description":"Over the last few years, it has been impossible to ignore the steady resurgence of xenophobia. The European migrant crisis and immigration from Central America to the United States have placed Western advocates of globalization on the defensive, and a 'New Xenophobia' seems to have emerged out of nowhere. In this fascinating study, George Makari traces the history of xenophobia from its origins to the present day. Often perceived as an ancient word for a timeless problem, 'xenophobia' was in fact only coined a century ago, tied to heated and formative Western debates over nationalism, globalization, race and immigration. From Richard Wright to Sigmund Freud, Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, writers and thinkers have long grappled with this most dangerous of phobias. Drawing on their work, Makari demonstrates how we can better understand the problem that is so crucial to our troubled times.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=eiQ9EAAAQBAJ&dq=Heart+of+Darkness+and+Selected+Short+Fiction+(Barnes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Charlie's Great Adventure","description":"Charlie the cat and his friend Frisky become lost in the woods during a family camping trip.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ae3APQAACAAJ&dq=Charlie%27s+Great+Adventure&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Diversity Advantage: Multicultural Identity in the New World Economy","description":"Globalization is in retreat, but history tells us that this is but a temporary reversal. Globalization will return, but in what form? More cycles of boom and bust? Or can globalization be rebuilt on a more feasible and sustainable platform? These are the compelling questions that Michael Veseth tackles in this thoroughly revised and updated edition of his award-winning book. Veseth shows how pre-crash visions of globalization were based on three powerful myths: that global finance was a stable foundation for a global economy, that global markets homogenized and Americanized the world, and that globalization itself was irresistible-impossible to shape or oppose at any level from the grassroots on up. The world economic crisis has revealed globalization's Achilles heel: the fundamental instability of global financial markets and the unsettled foundation of economic globalization generally. This realization is a necessary first step, but it alone is not enough. We must rethink the rest of globalization's myths, Veseth persuasively argues, if we want to move beyond boom and bust to a sustainable global future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dH_hPhu7wZ0C&dq=The+Diversity+Advantage:+Multicultural+Identity+in+the+New+World+Economy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In America.","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UFtoAAAAcAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit: A Commentary Based on the Preface and Introduction","description":"Hegel's classic Phenomenology of Spirit is considered by many to be the most difficult text in all of philosophical literature. In interpreting the work, scholars have often used the Phenomenology to justify the ideology that has tempered their approach to it, whether existential, ontological, or, particularly, Marxist. Werner Marx deftly avoids this trap of misinterpretation by rendering lucid the objectives that Hegel delineates in the Preface and Introduction and using these to examine the whole of the Phenomenology. Marx considers selected materials from Hegel's text in order both to clarify Hegel's own view of it and to set the stage for an examination of post-Hegelian philosophy. The primary focus of Marx's book is on the account. Hegel gives of the phenomenological journey from natural consciousness to philosophical wisdom (or absolute knowledge, as Hegel calls it). In showing that Hegel's many statements concerning consciousness 'finding itself' or 'knowing itself' in its world can be understood as discovering the rationality of the conditioning world, Marx offers a solution to several sets of interrelated problems that have troubled students of Hegel. His book contains valuable analyses of the relation between Hegel's thought and that of Descartes and Kant as well as that of Karl Marx, and it also sheds considerable light on the question of the internal unity or coherence of the Phenomenology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KAp_1J2dWwcC&dq=Hegel%27s+Phenomenology+of+Spirit:+A+Commentary+Based+on+the+Preface+and+Introduction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From memory to history: Using oral sources in local historical research","description":"Non-Aboriginal material.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zZ1mAAAAMAAJ&dq=From+memory+to+history:+Using+oral+sources+in+local+historical+research&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Chimpanzees of Gombe","description":"The renowned British primatologist continues the  engrossing account  of her time among the chimpanzees of Gombe, Tanzania (Publishers Weekly).

Through self-understanding (and understanding client behavior), money managers will learn the keys to dealing with clients and to provide better financial performance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3Hayf_gOVI0C&dq=Investment+Euphoria+and+Money+Madness:+The+Inner+Workings+of+the+Psychology+of+Investing+-+for+Financial+Advisors+and+their+Clients&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"African Architecture: Evolution and Transformation","description":"From Egypt to Ethiopia, Botswana to Burundi, and Zimbabwe to Cameroon, this landmark book presents the first complete and definitive study of African architecture from antiquity to the present. Featuring hundreds of museum-quality photographs and drawings from archival and modern sources, the book offers architects, architectural and art historians, social scientists, and all those interested in world architecture with an ordinary account of the evolution, transformation, and development of architecture across the African continent. Elleh defines the indigenous, Islamic, and Western roots of African architecture, and goes on to examine how these roots influence the architecture of each region in Africa. The author evaluates historical, traditional, and contemporary architecture by examing the various cultural groups of North, Central, East, South, and Western Africa from ethnic, climatic, political, regional, economic, religious, and historical perspectives. In addition, a final chapter takes a revealing look at modern architecture, urbanism, and urbanization throughout Africa. At once a work of convincing scholarship and a beautifully illustrated tour of African architecture past and present, this is a pioneering book that brings a heretofore rarely examined body of work dramatically to life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_yHqAAAAMAAJ&dq=African+Architecture:+Evolution+and+Transformation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Why God's Word is All We Need (Today's Issues)","description":"The revised edition of A Theology for the Church retains its original structure, organized under these traditional theological categories: revelation, God, humanity, Christ, the Holy Spirit, salvation, the church, and last things.

Setting children's books in their historical context, the work reflects much about the history of English social life as well as providing an in-depth perspective on the genre - in the author's words 'a chronicle of the English people in their capacity of parents, guardians and educators of children'.

Written in December 1862 by Private Wright Vinson in Tennessee to his wife, Christiana, in Georgia, these lines go to the heart of why Scott Walker wrote this history of the Fifty-seventh Georgia Infantry, a unit of the famed Mercer s Brigade. All but a few members of the Fifty-seventh lived within a close radius of eighty miles from each other. More than just an account of their military engagements, this is a collective biography of a close-knit group. Relatives and neighbors served and died side by side in the Fifty-seventh, and Walker excels at showing how family ties, friendships, and other intimate dynamics played out in wartime settings. Humane but not sentimental, the history abounds in episodes of real feeling: a starving soldier s theft of a pie; another s open confession, in a letter to his wife, that he may desert; a slave s travails as a camp orderly. Drawing on memoirs and a trove of unpublished letters and diaries, Walker follows the soldiers of the Fifty-seventh as they push far into Unionist Kentucky, starve at the siege of Vicksburg, guard Union prisoners at the Andersonville stockade, defend Atlanta from Sherman, and more. Hardened fighters who would wish hell on an incompetent superior but break down at the sight of a dying Yankee, these are real people, as rarely seen in other Civil War histories.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=B7j21qTeN5UC&dq=Forgotten+Confederates:+An+Anthology+About+Black+Southerners,+Vol.+14+(Journal+of+Confederate+History+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Legends of the Mighty Sioux","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1l51AAAAMAAJ&dq=Legends+of+the+Mighty+Sioux&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Couple","description":"Financial problems exact a toll on any couple.

It considers the appropriation of this heritage in Augustine's On Christian Doctrine and the influence that important work had on Christian theology in the West. After describing how modern scholarship has tended to view rhetoric with deep suspicion, the book summarizes the retrieval of persuasive discourse in many academic disciplines and the influence of this movement on contemporary theologians such as David Tracy, David Cunningham, and Rebecca Chopp. In addition, What Is Rhetorical Theology? offers it own constructive proposal, that is, it argues that the theological task today may be described as rhetorical hermeneutics. With the help of literary critics such as Steven Mailloux and Jane Tompkins, the author develops a practical and \\"interested\\" approach to the interpretation of classical Christian texts, thereby allowing them to speak to our contemporary concerns. The book also presents an epistemological defense of the rhetorical approach to reading as a middle way between objectivism and relativism, a section that serves as a helpful introduction to current debates about postmodern thought. Finally, the book illustrates the rhetorical method by applying it to a doctrine of sin in the form of a constructive dialogue between critical theory and the Christian theological past. Don H. Compier is Associate Professor of Theology at the Church Divinity School of the Pacific and a member of the core doctoral faculty of the Graduate Theological Union.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cDSflFHHFVAC&dq=What+Is+Rhetorical+Theology%3F:+Textual+Practice+and+Public+Discourse&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miller's Anatomy of the Dog, 3e","description":"Featuring unparalleled full-color illustrations and detailed descriptions, Miller and Evan s Anatomy of the Dog, 5th Edition makes it easy to master the intricate details of canine morphology.

Fully annotated, this edition focuses attention upon Montesquieu's use of sources and his text as a whole, rather than upon those opening passages towards which critical energies have traditionally been devoted, and a select bibliography and chronology are provided for those coming to Montesquieu's work for the first time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=__F8xEX8uw8C&dq=Montesquieu:+The+Spirit+of+the+Laws+(Cambridge+Texts+in+the+History+of+Political+Thought)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The classical tradition: Greek and Roman influences on Western literature","description":"Originally published in 1949, Gilbert Highet's seminal The Classical Tradition is a herculean feat of comparative literature and a landmark publication in the history of classical reception. As Highet states in the opening lines of his Preface, this book outlines \\"the chief ways in which Greek and Latin influence has moulded the literatures of western Europe and America\\". With that simple statement, Highet takes his reader on a sweeping exploration of the history of western literature. To summarize what he covers is a near-impossible task. Discussions of Ovid and French literature of the Middle Ages and Chaucer's engagement with Virgil and Cicero lead, swiftly, into arguments of Christian versus \\"pagan\\" works in the Renaissance, Baroque imitations of Seneca, and the (re)birth of satire. Building momentum through Byron, Tennyson, and the rise of \\"art of art's sake\\", Highet, at last, arrives at his conclusion: the birth and establishment of modernism. Though his humanist style may appear out-of-date in today's postmodernist world, there is a value to ensuring this influential work reaches a new generation, and Highet's light touch and persuasive, engaging voice guarantee the book's usefulness for a contemporary audience. Indeed, the book is free of the jargon-filled style of literary criticism that plagues much of current scholarship. Accompanied by a new foreword by renown critic Harold Bloom, this reissue will enable new readers to appreciate the enormous legacy of classical literature in the canonical works of medieval, Renaissance, and modern Europe and America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=46DoCQAAQBAJ&dq=The+classical+tradition:+Greek+and+Roman+influences+on+Western+literature&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Green - Touchdown Edition (Dream Series)","description":"About the Book Children have imaginations.

Acclaimed journalist and NPR commentator Diane Roberts has many family secrets and she's ready to tell them. Like the time her cousin state Senator Luther Tucker wrapped his Caddy around a tree, allegedly with a jug of moonshine on the seat next to him. Or how cousin Susan Branford was given an African girl for her eighth birthday. Or the time when cousin Enid Broward was made the May Queen of 1907, even though her daddy the governor shocked the state by trying to drain the entire Everglades. Roberts' ancestors helped settle Florida, kill off its pesky Indians, enslave some of its inhabitants, clear its forests, lay its train tracks, and pave its roads, all the time weaving themselves into the very fabric of this dangling chad of a state. With a storyteller's talent for setting great scenes, Roberts lays out the sweeping history of eight geberations of Browards and Bradfords, Tuckers anf Robertses, even as she Forest Gumps them into situations with more historically familiar names. Whether it's the American court of Catherine de M dicis, the Tallahassee court of Katherine Harris, Henry Flagler's boardroom -- not to mention his bedroom -- or Jeb Bush's statehouse, you're likely to find a branch or a root of the Roberts family growing entangled nearby. Starting in the recent past with the botched presidential election of 2000, Roberts introduces the many sides of the debate, coincidentally peopled with cousins both kissing and close. She then goes back to Florida's first inhabitants, showing how this alluring peninsula many called a paradise played a role in the destiny of those who settled there. Following their colorful progress up to the present, she renders them all with a deep, familial affection. Florida has forced itself into the collective American unconscious with its messed-up elections, anthrax scares, shark attacks,boat lifts, snowbirds, and the Bush dynasty. While exposing the real people whom Carl Hiaasen and Elmore Leonard have been fictionalizing for years, Dream State ultimately reveals the cogs and wheels that make the state tick.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nuUSCQe0ArkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Internships and jobs in journalism: A guidebook for finding employment in the media","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yXycGwAACAAJ&dq=Internships+and+jobs+in+journalism:+A+guidebook+for+finding+employment+in+the+media&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Berlioz and the romantic century","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=x4efAAAAMAAJ&dq=Berlioz+and+the+romantic+century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On-Chip ESD Protection for Integrated Circuits: An IC Design Perspective (Kluwer International Series in Engineering and Computer Science, 663) (The ...

Douglas, \\"a religious people,\\" and his observation is continually borne out in every aspect of American public life. Religious ideals underlay the founding of the colonies and the firming of the new nation; the activities of churches have been closely interwined with politics in the abolition of slavery, the drive for women's suffrage, the prohibition of liquor,and the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The recent revival of arguments over the participation of relgious groups in politics points up the continuing controversey about the separation of church and state. In this study, A. James Reichley places religion and politics within a conceptual framework that considers the values in which both are rooted and examines, in light of that framework, the actual impact of religion and religious groups on American public life. He analyzes the underlying causes and issues involved, their contemporary impact, and their continuing evolution. Finally he discusses how the involvement of religious groups in politics can be carried on within the context of the separation of church and state without threat to civil liberties or seculat politicalization of religion.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jWMXUqV0UPsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alien Rites (Science Fiction Chronicle)","description":"Homicide cop David Silver and his Elaki partner hunt an arsonist/killer who exterminates humans and aliens alike Saigo City is caught in the grip of a savage murder spree by a perp who kills without compunction, then eliminates the evidence by torching the crime scenes.

The disease occurs when the same kind of tissue that lines the walls of the uterus grows outside the uterus in the pelvic cavity or some other area of the body, usually significantly affecting the woman's fertility and often causing pelvic pain. And as with any condition that affects fertility, the results are often emotional and psychological as well as physical. As someone who suffers from endometriosis, and who has connections to a wide network of healthcare professionals, Morris is the perfect person to guide sufferers through diagnosis, treatment and living well with the condition.

Written by Hitay ?zbay, one of the top researchers in robust control in the world, this book fills the gap between introductory feedback control texts and advanced robust control texts. Introduction to Feedback Control Theory covers basic concepts such as dynamical systems modeling, performance objectives, the Routh-Hurwitz test, root locus, Nyquist criterion, and lead-lag controllers. It introduces more advanced topics including Kharitanov's stability test, basic loopshaping, stability robustness, sensitivity minimization, time delay systems, H-infinity control, and parameterization of all stabilizing controllers for single input single output stable plants. This range of topics gives students insight into the key issues involved in designing a controller. Occupying and important place in the field of control theory, Introduction to Feedback Control Theory covers the basics of robust control and incorporates new techniques for time delay systems, as well as classical and modern control. Students can use this as a text for building a foundation of knowledge and as a reference for advanced information and up-to-date techniques","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NPSDDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Freedom's Law: The Moral Reading of the American Constitution","description":"Dworkin's important book is a collection of essays which discuss almost all of the great constitutional issues of the last two decades, including abortion, euthanasia, capital punishment, homosexuality, pornography, and free speech. Dworkin offers a consistently liberal view of the Constitution and argues that fidelity to it and to law demands that judges make moral judgments. He proposes that we all interpret the abstract language of the Constitution by reference to moral principles about political decency and justice. His 'moral reading' therefore brings political morality into the heart of constitutional law. The various chapters of this book were first published separately; now drawn together they provide the reader with a rich, full-length treatment of Dworkin's general theory of law.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yeUg-wglsK0C&dq=Freedom%27s+Law:+The+Moral+Reading+of+the+American+Constitution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Saddam Hussein (Chelsea House Library of Biography)","description":"Describes the life of the Iraqi president, his rise to power, and his orchestration of Iraqi troops during the Persian Gulf War.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Wj6cXLZFeBUC&dq=Saddam+Hussein+(Chelsea+House+Library+of+Biography)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Macroeconomics","description":"The study of macroeconomics can seem a daunting project. The field is complex and sometimes poorly defined and there are a variety of competing approaches. It is easy for the senior bachelor and starting master student to get lost in the forest of macroeconomics and the mathematics it uses extensively. Foundations of Modern Macroeconomics is a guide book for the interested and ambitious student. Non-partisan in its approach, it deals with all the major topics, summarising the important approaches and providing the reader with a coherent angle on all aspects of macroeconomic thought. Each chapter deals with a separate area of macroeconomics, and each contains a summary section of key points and a further reading list. Using nothing more than undergraduate mathematical skills, it takes the student from basic IS-LM style macro models to the state of the art literature on Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium, explaining the mathematical tricks used where they are first introduced. Fully updated and substantially revised, this third edition of Foundations of Modern Macroeconomics now includes brand new chapters covering highly topical subjects such as dynamic programming, competitive risk sharing equilibria and the New Keynesian DSGE approach.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=sEsrDwAAQBAJ&dq=Macroeconomics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Casino Moscow: A Tale of Greed and Adventure on Capitalism's Wildest Frontier","description":"After awakening from its long communist slumber, Russia in the 1990s was a place where everything and everyone was for sale, and fortunes could be made and lost overnight. Into this free-market maelstrom stepped rookie Wall Street Journal reporter Matthew Brzezinski, who was immediately pulled into the mad world of Russian capitalism -- where corrupt bankers and fast-talking American carpetbaggers presided over the biggest boom and bust in financial history. Brzezinski's adventures take him from the solid-gold bathroom fixtures of Moscow's elite, to the last stop on the Trans-Siberian railway, where poverty-stricken citizens must buy water by the pail from the local crime lord, and back to civilization, to stumble into a drunken birthday bash for an ultra-nationalist politico. It's an irreverent, lurid, and hilarious account of one man's tumultuous trek through a capitalist market gone haywire -- and a nation whose uncertain future is marked by boundless hope and foreboding despair.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gY8OfdUVip8C&dq=Casino+Moscow:+A+Tale+of+Greed+and+Adventure+on+Capitalism%27s+Wildest+Frontier&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"More Dumb, Dumber, Dumbest","description":"Gathers hundreds of true stories categorized under such headings as \\"dumb happens\\" and \\"lifestyles of the dumb and dumber\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TIkOAAAACAAJ&dq=More+Dumb,+Dumber,+Dumbest&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","description":"Why are we all so hostile?

Paul Preston is the world's foremost historian of Spain. This surging history recounts the struggles of the 1936 war in which more than 3,000 Americans took up arms. Tracking the emergence of Francisco Franco's brutal (and, ultimately, extraordinarily durable) fascist dictatorship, Preston assesses the ways in which the Spanish Civil War presaged the Second World War that ensued so rapidly after it. The attempted social revolution in Spain awakened progressive hopes during the Depression, but the conflict quickly escalated into a new and horrific form of warfare. As Preston shows, the unprecedented levels of brutality were burned into the American consciousness as never before by the revolutionary war reporting of Ernest Hemingway, John Dos Passos, Herbert Matthews, Vincent Sheean, Louis Fischer, and many others. Completely revised, including previously unseen material on Franco's treatment of women in wartime prisons, The Spanish Civil War is a classic work on this pivotal epoch in the twentieth century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=03rWfa5-GGkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Decline of American Power: The U.S. in a Chaotic World","description":"The internationally renowned theorist contends that the sun is setting on the American empire in this  lucid, informed, and insightful  account (The New York Times). The United States currently finds itself [a] superpower that lacks true power, a world leader nobody follows and few respect, and a nation drifting dangerously amidst a global chaos it cannot control. The United States in decline? Its admirers and detractors alike claim the opposite: America is now in a position of unprecedented global supremacy. But in fact, Immanuel Wallerstein argues, a more nuanced evaluation of recent history reveals that America has been fading as a global power since the end of the Vietnam War, and its response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11 looks certain to hasten that decline. In this provocative collection, the visionary originator of world-systems analysis and the most innovative social scientist of his generation turns a practiced analytical eye to the turbulent beginnings of the twenty-first century. Touching on globalization, Islam, racism, democracy, intellectuals, and the state of the left wing, Wallerstein upends conventional wisdom to produce a clear-eyed and troubling assessment of the crumbling international order.  [Wallerstein s thought] provides a new framework for the subject of European history . . . it is compelling, a new explanation, a new classification, indeed a revolutionary one, of received knowledge and current thought.

For those new to the works of Matthew Fox, and for those eager to learn his thoughts after his Vatican-ordered public silence, comes this introduction to creation spirituality--Fox's framework for a far-reaching spirituality of the Americas. Passionate and provocative, Fox uncovers the ancient tradition of a creation-centered spirituality that melds Christian mysticism with the contemporary struggle for social justice, feminism, and environmentalism. Basic to Fox's notion of creation spirituality is the gift of awe--a mystical response to creation and the first step toward transformation. Awe prompts indignation at the exploitation and destruction of the earth's people and resources. Awe leads to action. Showing how we can learn from each other, Fox's spirituality weds the healing and liberation found in both North and South America. Creation Spirituality challenges readers of every religious and political persuasion to unite in a new vision through which we learn to honor the earth and the people who inhabit it as the gift of a good and just creator.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7Ix2efGbKS0C&dq=Creation+Spirituality:+Liberating+Gifts+for+the+Peoples+of+the+Earth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Road through Kurdistan;: The narrative of an engineer in Iraq,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QH-6AAAAIAAJ&dq=Road+through+Kurdistan%3B:+The+narrative+of+an+engineer+in+Iraq,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kaplan SAT Verbal Workbook, 4th Edition","description":"A targeted prep guide for the verbal section of the SAT provides a host of verbal practice questions, extensive practice sets with accompanying strategic explanations, vocabulary-building lists, scoring conversion instructions, and two realistic Verbal Tests, and a comprehensive list of frequently tested words.

In Professor Rahman's view the intellectual and therefore the social development of Islam has been impeded and distorted by two interrelated errors. The first was committed by those who, in reading the Koran, failed to recognize the differences between general principles and specific responses to 'concrete and particular historical situations.' . . . This very rigidity gave rise to the second major error, that of the secularists. By teaching and interpreting the Koran in such a way as to admit of no change or development, the dogmatists had created a situation in which Muslim societies, faced with the imperative need to educate their people for life in the modern world, were forced to make a painful and self-defeating choice either to abandon Koranic Islam, or to turn their backs on the modern world.\\" Bernard Lewis, New York Review of Books \\"In this work, Professor Fazlur Rahman presents a positively ambitious blueprint for the transformation of the intellectual tradition of Islam: theology, ethics, philosophy and jurisprudence. Over the voices advocating a return to Islam or the reestablishment of the Sharia, the guide for action, he astutely and soberly asks: What and which Islam? More importantly, how does one get to 'normative' Islam? The author counsels, and passionately demonstrates, that for Islam to be actually what Muslims claim it to be comprehensive in scope and efficacious for every age and place Muslim scholars and educationists must reevaluate their methodology and hermeneutics. In spelling out the necessary and sound methodology, he is at once courageous, serious and profound.\\" Wadi Z.

This aesthetic and functional work is characterized by a unique decorative style and superb technical artistry. Many of the artefacts are embellished with mysterious visual narratives drawn from ancient religious and mythological sources, communicating spiritual beliefs and values that resonate to this day. Burmese silverwork is a distinct and little-known genre of silver art. This book tackles this obscurity by illuminating and describing for the first time 100 Burmese silver artefacts in a stunning photographic gallery. This silverwork  from the Noble Silver Collection  represents some of the rarest and finest quality work from the Burmese Silver Age. The centrepiece gallery of silverwork masterpieces is bookended by two well-illustrated and informative chapters that provide readers with deeper insights into Burmese silverwork: a robust frame of reference chapter summarises the 2,000-year history and cultural tradition of Burmese silverwork; and a chapter following the gallery deciphers the complex and allegorical iconography of the decoration, which gives the reader a deeper appreciation of its religious and cultural meaning and origin. This book captures the great, almost mystical, allure of Burmese silverwork  from the sublime artistry of the decoration, to the extraordinary skill of the silversmith and the profound meaning and importance of the visual narratives. In doing so, Burmese Silver Art takes its place as a definitive reference work for any art historian, collector, expert, student, or general reader interested in this hitherto-overlooked body of noble art.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5p4xEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Somethin' to Shout About!","description":"It chronicles Donna's battle with terminal breast cancer and her decision to baffle this chronic disease with Life Style modification versus traditional medicine.

Capstick journeyed on safari through Namibia in the African spring of 1989. This was a nation on the eve on independence, a land scorched by sun, by years of bitter war. In these perilous circumstances, he commences what is surely the most thrilling safari of his storied career. He takes the reader to the stark landscape that makes up the Bushmen s tribal territories. There, facing all kinds of risks, members of the chase pursue their quarry in a land of legend and myth. In this first person adventure, Capstick spins riveting tales from his travels and reports on the Bushmen s culture, their political persecution, and the Stone Age life of Africa s original hunter-gatherers. In addition, the author explains the economic benefits of the sportsman s presence, and how ethical hunting is a tool for game protection and management on the continent. Featuring one hundred striking color images from leading African wildlife photographer Dr. M. Philip Kahl, Sands of Silence: On Safari in Namibia superbly illustrates Capstick s return to the veld and perfectly captures life and death in the  land of thirst.

Roosevelt, American Public Opinion, and the War against Nazi Germany","description":"America's struggle against Nazism is one of the few aspects of World War II that has escaped controversy. Historians agree that it was a widely popular war, different from the subsequent conflicts in Korea and Vietnam because of the absence of partisan sniping, ebbing morale, or calls for a negotiated peace. In this provocative book, Steven Casey challenges conventional wisdom about America's participation in World War II. Drawing on the numerous opinion polls and surveys conducted by the U.S. government, he traces the development of elite and mass attitudes toward Germany, from the early days of the war up to its conclusion. Casey persuasively argues that the president and the public rarely saw eye to eye on the nature of the enemy, the threat it posed, or the best methods for countering it. He describes the extensive propaganda campaign that Roosevelt designed to build support for the war effort, and shows that Roosevelt had to take public opinion into account when formulating a host of policies, from the Allied bombing campaign to the Morgenthau plan to pastoralize the Third Reich. By examining the previously unrecognized relationship between public opinion and policy making during World War II, Casey's groundbreaking book sheds new light on a crucial era in American history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=goiDXY3COHsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Courage to Be","description":" Marie Kondo, but for your brain.

Shiphandling Simulation addresses how computer-based simulation can be used to improve the cost- effectiveness of waterway design while satisfying safety objectives. The book examines the role of computer simulation in improving waterway design, evaluates the adequacy of data input, explores the validity of hydrodynamic and mathematical models, assesses required and achievable accuracy of simulation results, and identifies research needed to establish shiphandling simulation as a standard design aid.

While others have attempted to explain or repair the break-up of the Jewish alliance on civil rights, Seth Forman here sets out to determine what Jewish thinking on the subject of Black Americans reveals about Jewish identity in the U.S. Why did American Jews get involved in Black causes in the first place? What did they have to gain from it? And what does that tell us about American Jews? In an extremely provocative analysis, Forman argues that the commitment of American Jews to liberalism, and their historic definition of themselves as victims, has caused them to behave in ways that were defined as good for Blacks, but which in essence were contrary to Jewish interests. They have not been able to dissociate their needs--religious, spiritual, communal, political--from those of African Americans, and have therefore acted in ways which have threatened their own cultural vitality. Avoiding the focus on Black victimization and white racism that often infuses work on Blacks and Jews, Forman emphasizes the complexities inherent in one distinct white ethnic group's involvement in America's racial dilemma.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YNbZ1eLjnvAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diagnosis and Correction in Reading Instruction","description":"An introductory text for diagnosing and correcting reading problems, updated to include recent tests and research in the field.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=e_BLAAAAYAAJ&dq=Diagnosis+and+Correction+in+Reading+Instruction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shane","description":"This bibulous, drug-indulgent and anarchic rock legend was born on a small farm in Tipperary, won a scholarship to Westminster, was rapidly expelled, became a rent boy, then a central figure of punk and the hugely influential star of The Pogues.

Birthplace of the Greek god Zeus, the Greek alphabet, and the first Greek laws, as well as the home of 15 mountain ranges and the longest gorge in Europe, this land is indisputably unique. And since ancient times, its inhabitants have maintained an astonishing tenacity and sense of national identity, even as they suffered conquest and occupation by Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Venetians, Ottoman Turks, and Germans. Throughout this evocative book, now in trade paper, Unsworth describes the incredible physical and cultural proportions of the island in history, myth, and reality. Moving and artful, Crete gives readers a comprehensive picture and rich understanding of this complex and indeed, almost magical world of Mediterranean wonders. With the same keen eye and clear, eloquent prose that distinguishes his acclaimed historical novels, Barry Unsworth delivers his readers a two-fold traveler's reward, at once a wonderfully detailed panorama of Crete's many layers of history and an evocative portrait of an island almost literally larger than life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xizc_SQTI_cC&dq=Crete+(Directions)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scripture Matters: Essays on Reading the Bible from the Heart of the Church","description":"Popular author and scholar Dr. Scott Hahn has released a collection of essays on the study and interpretation of Scripture from a Catholic perspective.

We have felt time speed up and felt energies that are at times so chaotic and unpredictable that we have been thrown off our usual course. Some of us have been rocked to our very core. We are asking ourselves  what is this and why is this happening?  We each have chosen to come to earth during this time of great transition. We are all here sharing our lives with each other, helping Mother Earth move into the Golden Age, the spiritual Age of Aquarius. This transition will complete on the date that the Mayan civilization predicted some 26,000 years ago, December 21st, 2012. There is much work to be done as we realize the need for the shift that must occur in our personal lives so that we can be in sync with the new fifth dimensional energy on this planet. As our world resets itself, so too must we reset ourselves. What this means to each of us is that it is time to understand the meaning of how to live more fully in the fifth dimension. Each of us must identify where we currently stand and where we need to go in order to experience the wonderment of fifth dimensional living. Why? Many of us may be existing as a two or a three dimensional person. The energies that sustain those dimensions no longer exist on this planet. So, the old ways of thinking or operating that produced success at one time no longer exist. It is now necessary for us, if we are to exist in harmony with our planet, to transition as well. If we choose not to transition, then frustration and anger will become paramount in our lives. The choice is up to us. To live in the fifth dimension is not only to experience the energy of magic and miracles but to learn that we can create all the perfection we desire in our lives by simply shifting our thinking into fifth dimensional thinking. We are able to see the perfection where formerly we saw the illusion of imperfection. This new vantage point allows us to become the center of our own reality and easily navigate through difficult individuals and challenging events while maintaining a state of balance and harmony. We are then able to turn possibilities into probabilities and probabilities into actualities! This journey begins with describing and identifying all of the unseen, but certainly not unfelt, influences in our lives that have been given to each of us to help us live our life on earth in the best and easiest manner possible. Each reader will be able to identify their birthright gift as well as the other gifts available to tap into and expand one s energy thereby allowing this innate knowledge to grow and develop. All of the necessary techniques and tools are explained in detail in this book so that you can easily make the transition from your current dimension into the fifth dimension, allowing you to create a new future. You are able to learn and make friends with each of your bodies of consciousness and their respective inner child and together you begin a journey of healing. You, as parent of these inner children, learn how to set the stage and the rules so that everyone is playing by the same playbook. You learn that you may win as a team or you may lose as a team, but you are all on the same team working together to achieve that balance that allows you to maintain your newly found center. By removing fears one by one, each of us can transition from a place of fear into a place of love, learning to live from the heart. As we work towards this goal, we isolate and identify the negative emotions that have been growing and harvesting within. These negative emotions equate disease. This book is your guide to help acknowledge these fears, recognize and release them one by one creating a new you, a lighter you. We then experience a new energy, a more evolved energy, a higher vibrating energy, as we invite the energy of excellent health and balance into our bodies.

Perhaps the most commonly advanced argument for school choice is the notion that markets will force public schools to improve, particularly in those urban areas where improvement has proved so elusive. However, the question of how public schools respond to market conditions has received surprisingly little attention. Revolution at the Margins examines the impact of school vouchers and charter schooling on three urban school districts, explores the causes of the behavior observed, and explains how the structure of competition is likely to shape the way it affects the future of public education. The book draws on research conducted in three school districts at the center of the school choice debate during the 1990s: Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Cleveland, Ohio; and Edgewood, Texas. Case studies examine each of these three districts from the inception of their local school choice program through the conclusion of the 1999 school year. The three school districts studied did not respond to competition by emphasizing productivity or efficiency. Instead, under pressure to provide some evidence of response, administrators tended to expand public relations efforts and to chip holes in the rules, regulations, and procedures that regulate public sector organizations. Inefficient practices were not rooted out, but some rules and procedures that protect employees and vocal constituencies were relaxed. Public school systems are driven by political logic, according to Hess, and their incentives lead them to respond generally through symbolic and metaphorical gestures. Choice-induced changes in public school systems will be shaped by public governance, the market context in which they operate, and their organizational characteristics. Revolution at the Margins encourages scholars and policymakers to think more carefully about the costs and benefits of educational competition, to understand how competitive effects will be heavily shaped by the outcomes of more conventional efforts to reform schooling, and to reevaluate some of the facile promises of market-based education reform.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_kaBRL0z0F4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quantum Field Theory of Many-body Systems: From the Origin of Sound to an Origin of Light and Electrons (Oxford Graduate Texts)","description":"This book is a pedagogical introduction to new concepts and quantum field theoretical methods in condensed matter physics, which may have an impact on our understanding of the origin of light, electrons and other elementary particles in the universe.

Much has been written about why someone would take his or her life, and about the prevention of suicide, but there is little recorded to throw light on what it is like to endure such a dramatic severing. Sunshower begins with a portrait of Karen and Dick Kenyon's early marriage, the birth of their son, Richard, the birth and death of a baby daughter, Johanna. Then on November 3, 1978, Dick did not come home from work; instead, without warning, he took his own life. The author charts her grief process, her awareness, her questions and turmoil, and her eventual path back to life and love. Sunshower is a mystery story in the sense that life is a mystery. It is told through the eyes of one person, but all our struggles and joys are somehow one. We all love, we all lose. Surviving after suicide is only a dramatic metaphor for survival of any kind. Every day we live we are choosing life, creating life. Symbolically a sunshower is the union of sadness and joy, of rain clouds and of light. The sunshowers of our lives are our releases and baptisms into new life. This book, though it deals with and faces death, is most importantly about life and about love. Sunshower is the story of loss, but it is also a story of transformation and rebirth. Karen Kenyon has written a remarkably honest account in SUNSHOWER. In writing of a harrowing experience, she has avoided both self-pitying sentimentality and hidden angers. It is a valuable -- if not priceless --addition to the literature of suicide. Harold Greenwald, Ph.D. August 6, 1981 \\"...we do a tremendous amount of suicide prevention work and I'm sure your contribution in the form of this book will help many people.\\" -- Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross SUNSHOWER has been recommended by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross to women who are in need of support--the ripple effect goes on, your gift of sharing and compassionate understanding. -- Janet Marlow for Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bozZUX0Ct6AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reaching for the Sun: How Plants Work","description":"From their ability to use energy from sunlight to make their own food, to combating attacks from diseases and predators, plants have evolved an amazing range of life-sustaining strategies.

Bailey's in bed with her commitment-challenged lover K.C. when she gets a frantic call from her high-maintenance boss at Gloss magazine. Grabbing coffee and a cab outside her Greenwich Village apartment-the consolation prize in her divorce settlement-Bailey reluctantly heads uptown. At Cat Jones's Upper East Side town house, she finds something that seriously clashes with the chic decor: the dead body of the family's live-in nanny. As Bailey-unofficially-delves into the murdered girl's past, she finds no shortage of A-list suspects. But when a startling discovery suggests that Cat may have been the intended victim, Bailey is suddenly up to her bed head in a high-profile investigation that's perfect fodder for a tabloid headline: Is someone trying to kill the editors of women's magazines? With the spotlight on New York's glitzy media world, Bailey interviews back-stabbing editors, straying husbands, and one sexy, six-feet-two psychologist who could make her decide to kick K.C. to the curb. Sporting her pair of red slingbacks and armed with the investigative skills she's honed as a true crime reporter, she sets out on a search that takes her from Manhattan's exclusive Carnegie Hill area-the nanny heartland of America-to the ritzy weekend estates of Pennsylvania and Connecticut. Bailey will need all her street smarts and some lightning-fast detective work to catch a killer who could end up deleting her name from the masthead for good.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LYJmAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"With The Empress Dowager of China","description":"First published in 1986.

Nine months later, the now classic Story of a Soul appeared and proved an immediate success. However, when historians had access fifty years later to manuscripts written by Th r se they were surprised to discover enormous differences between these texts and the published version of Story of a Soul. Jean-Fran?ois Six has written this new book with two purposes. First, he recalls the history of how Mother Agn s, Prioress of the Carmelite convent and sister of Th r se altered and completed Th r se's text so that it became a travesty of the original. Secondly he re-establishes the truth of the last months of Th r se's life, her authentic spiritual message, and her contribution to the history of mysticism. In working on his book, Jean-Fran?ois Six has relied on texts which can definitively be said to come from the hand of Thr r se. In contrast to the sentimentality which is so often associated with her, he has found a powerful, lively figure, full of humor even in the depths of the spiritual night she experienced during her last months-the spiritual night which others have tried to deny or minimize.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cMcIAAAACAAJ&dq=Light+of+the+Night:+The+Last+Eighteen+Months+in+the+Life+of+Th%27r%27se+of+Lisieux&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To a Widow With Children","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6vtazQEACAAJ&dq=To+a+Widow+With+Children&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dreamcatcher Movie-Tie In","description":"In   n avond verdwijnen vier jonge kinderen op mysterieuze wijze in Moonlight Bay, maar vanuit de politie blijft het stil.

Hij besluit in het holst van de nacht op zoek te gaan naar de vermiste kinderen in de donkere kelders van Fort Wyvern. Er gaan geruchten dat hier ondraaglijke experimenten worden uitgevoerd. Is hij opgewassen tegen de gevaren van genetische manipulatie? De horrorthriller  Grijp de nacht  is het tweede verhaal over Christopher Snow, waarmee bestsellerauteur Dean Koontz je opnieuw de stuipen op het lijf weet te jagen.

Jan Johnson-Smith shows how, in line with national political upheavals, this vibrant and perplexing genre set about expanding the myth of the Western frontier into deep space. She looks at the \\"sense of wonder\\" or sublime that infuses much Frontier art and science fiction, and traces a possible historical precedent to the genre in the fabulous and heroic journeys of the Classical epic. She discusses narrative styles and their influences, from the overarching narrative of \\"Babylon 5\\" to the episodic formula of \\"The Outer Limits\\", considers how experimental series such as \\"Twin Peaks\\" challenge conventional structures, and how and why sci-fi television has adopted new technologies. She also explores the juxtaposition of arcane language and technological jargon in modern American sci-fi television, revealing the extraordinarily alien, yet curiously familiar arena it creates.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VgNQEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ha-Siddur Hashalem Daily Prayer Book","description":"Features the authentic Hebrew text with a new translation designed to let people know what prayers to say. introductions tell the reader what to look for in the the prayer service, how to use the commentaries, how to search for and find meaning in the prayer book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=T62fyrNCaVsC&dq=Ha-Siddur+Hashalem+Daily+Prayer+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black and White on Wall Street: The Untold Story of the Man Wrongly Accused of Bringing Down Kidder Peabody","description":"Wall Street's most successful African American trader relates how he was falsely accused of recording $350 million in phony profits","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TykgAQAAIAAJ&dq=Black+and+White+on+Wall+Street:+The+Untold+Story+of+the+Man+Wrongly+Accused+of+Bringing+Down+Kidder+Peabody&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oddsfish!","description":"It had been a very hot day in Rome, as was to be expected at that season; and I had stayed in the cloister in the cool, as my Lord Abbot had bidden me, not knowing whether it would be on that day or another, or, indeed, on any at all, that His Holiness would send for me.

It has been said that life is what happens while you're waiting to go fishing. Only weeks after his eleven-year marriage abruptly ended in an amicable divorce, James Dodson decided to go on a fly-fishing pilgrimage west. His goal: to heal his wounded spirit and explain as best he could the vagaries of life and love to his beautiful, precocious seven-year-old daughter, Maggie. With his beat-up truck, Old Blue, and his aging retriever, Amos, Dodson and Maggie travel without plans or reservations, following where the spirit--and the lure of America's mighty rivers--leads them, on their way to one of America's grandest treasures: Yellowstone National Park. On the way, Dodson discovers a great deal about fishing, about America, and about the special relationship that exists only between a father and daughter. They travel from the Adirondacks, once a fly-angler's haven, to the mist-shrouded Niagara Falls. From the Michigan lakes where Ernest Hemingway roamed as a boy to small-town county fairs. From the majesty of Mount Rushmore to the mysticism of Harney's Peak, where Black Elk had his legendary visions, to finally the fly-fisherman's paradise of the San Juan River. Together father and daughter are bound by a tie as resilient and unpredictable as a fly-fisherman's line. For as the emotional waters in which they fish become ever more turbulent, Maggie's unspoken feelings of grief, anger, and blame begin to surface--a depth of hurt that forces Dodson to face his own unacknowledged pain and, worse, leaves him feeling helpless to make everything all right in his daughter's life again. Yet if fly-fishing has taught James Dodson anything, it is the rewards of patience, of following the wisdom of the course of the stream, the unexpected revelations reflected in still pools, and, of course, an abiding belief in plain dumb luck. With a little of each, these faithful travelers will find their way home again. Literate, honest, and deeply observant, Faithful Travelers is a beautiful meditation on the bond between parent and child and the nature of love and loss. In Faithful Travelers, James Dodson proves that sometimes life isn't what happens while you're waiting to go fishing: sometimes it happens while you're there.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hvE0DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Checkmate","description":"All mating situations in basic classification, how tactics adjust to each. 127 games analyzed. 80 quiz examples, answers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hmBfzQBolzMC&dq=Checkmate&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eyes of Laura Mars","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=W2sNRAAACAAJ&dq=Eyes+of+Laura+Mars&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Legend of Old Befana","description":"Because Befana's household chores kept her from finding the Baby King, she searches to this day, leaving gifts for children on the Feast of the Three Kings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=40k8DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Legend+of+Old+Befana&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Low Fog in Eden","description":"A couple find their love shattered and their paradise lost the day a stranger moves into town and changes everyone's life forever.

It presents a format for analyzing the cases, topic by topic - a methodology that could be used by any R&D laboratory. The book also goes one step further and compares the cases that took place prior to national technology transfer legislation with those cases that took place after passage of such legislation. An additional feature is the summary of existing attempts to measure and evaluate technology transfer. This follows a backgroudn section on the technology policy context.

What few people realise, all these years later, is that the legend first took shape in those early years of 1961-1964 in Miami, where he trained with the celebrated Angelo Dundee. It was here that the young Cassius Clay honed his boxing as well as his self-promotional skills, transforming himself into the boxer who spun hilarious doggerel about his opponents and himself, top become both champion and legend. This book is a beautiful and faithful record of that transformation.

Mathew 11:28 (AKJV) In the early 1990s, a grassroots coalition of churches in Baltimore, Maryland helped launch what would become a national movement. Joining forces with labor and low-wage worker organizations, they passed the first municipal living wage ordinance. Since then, over 144 municipalities and counties as well as numerous universities and local businesses in the United States have enacted such ordinances. Although religious persons and organizations have been important both in the origins of the living wage movement and in its continuing success, they are often ignored or under analyzed. Drawing on participant observation in multiple cities, All You That Labor analyzes and evaluates the contributions of religious activists to the movement. The book explores the ways religious organizations do this work in concert with low-wage workers, the challenges religious activists face, and how people of faith might better nurture moral agency in relation to the political economy. Ultimately, C. Melissa Snarr provides clarity on how to continue to cultivate, renew, and expand religious resources dedicated to the moral agency of low-wage workers and their allies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WgwUCgAAQBAJ&dq=Godel%27s+proof,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bombshell Boobies","description":"Similar to other titles by acclaimed Japanese adult author Yukio Yukimino, Bombshell Boobies comprises of very erotic soap-opera-like short stories.

In Chapter 1 the postulates of Kantian critical philosophy are broadened to make contact with modern cognitive theories; it is argued that all knowledge should be regarded as an exclusively human product rather than the work of a transcendental being. On this basis the fundamental question posed in this text concerns the limits of knowledge defined by the limitations of instruments of observation, classificationn and analysis, and the limitations of researchers as individuals and as scientific communities. In this last respect, it is argued that current systems for the production and dissemination of scientific knowledge, while making such knowledge possible, also favour its sterility. Two specific areas of science are analysed from these points of view: psychiatry and standard cosmology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=eMvVoAEACAAJ&dq=The+limits+of+science&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nizam Ad-Din Awliya: Morals for the Heart: Conversations of Shaykh Nizam Ad-Din Awliya Recorded by Amir Hasan Sijzi (Classics of Western Spirituality)","description":"Translated from Persian, Morals for the Heart contains the conversations of Shaykh Nizam ad-din Awliya (d. 1325), a major Indian saint, as recorded by his disciple.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qftskkgQuTcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"GREAT AND GLORIOUS DAYS: The Duke of Marlborough's Battles 1704-09","description":"Armies led by John Churchill, the 1st Duke of Marlborough met and defeated general and army that King Louis XIV of France could put against them.

Appointed 'Escape Officer' by his fellow inmates, he masterminded many of the attempts. From tunnelling, to hiding in rubbish sacks, disguising themselves as German officers and even leaping from the castle walls, nothing was too dangerous or foolhardy compared to imprisonment by the enemy. Reid's own escape, in 1942, was both one of the most simple and the most daring.

Elaborate Description It is an altogether fresh \`reprint\` of the eminent Orientalist, Arthur Macdonell\`s A Sanskrit Grammar (1927 edition: Oxford). Which, ever since its first appearance, has been widely acclaimed: both in India and elsewhere in the world, as an authentic, at the once relevant account of classical Sanskrit. Projecting, with well-chosen examples, a whole mass of grammatical forms to be met within the post-Vedic Sanskrit literature, the author systematically explains the mechanics of its euphonic combinations (sandhi), declension, conjugation, nominal stem formation and compounds, and a lot else - with complete insights into the syntactical arrangement of Sanskrit sentence. Supported by several information-packaged appendices, the book also carries a brilliant resume of the Sanskrit grammatical tradition going back to the 5th century BC. Now typeset anew with the latest technological aids, the late Macdonell\`s work today remains as much indispensable to the students of Sanskrit as to the scholars, who seek to discover for themselves the splendour of its literary classics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NlswEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fair-Skinned Beauty","description":"Fair Skinned Beauty is Yukio Yukimino's first graphic novel which became a huge success in Japan and has since been published in Taiwan and now the US.

Therefore, it is not to be wondered at, that in the course of their investigations into the spiritual development of mankind, the writers have also encountered much that deals with the Zodiac, which is the boundary of our evolutionary sphere at the present time. So much has been perceived in the memory of nature that sheds light upon obscure passages of the Bible, that notes have been made from time to time of different points, but how to collect and collate these dissociated writings into a united whole has been a great problem for a long time. Even now, the writers know and feel that what they are bringing forth is only a very, very weak attempt to set before the students that great body of facts which have come to them through the memory of nature. They feel, however, that this will give a 3 4 THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS new and more profound meaning to the old symbols, and that by passing on what has been found they put themselves in line to receive more light. Concerning the future evolution of planets, The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception teaches, on page 256, that \\"when the beings upon the planet have evolved to a sufficient degree, the planet becomes a Sun, the fixed center of the Solar System. When the beings there have evolved to a still greater degree, and consequently it has reached its maximum of brilliancy, it breaks up into a Zodiac and becomes, so to speak, the womb of a new Solar System. Thus the Great hosts of Divine beings who, until then, were confined upon that Sun gain freedom of action upon a great number of stars whence they can affect, in different ways, the system which grows up within their sphere of influence. The planets or man-bearing worlds within the Zodiac are constantly being worked upon by these forces but in various ways according to the stage they have reached in evolution. Our Sun could not have become a sun until it set out from itself all the beings who were not sufficiently evolved to endure the high rate of vibration and the great luminosity of the beings who were qualified for that evolution. All the beings upon the different planets would have been consumed had they remained in the Sun. This visible Sun, however, though it is a place of evolution for beings vastly above man, is not by any means the Father of the other planets, as EVOLUTION AS SHOWN IN THE ZODIAC 5 material science supposes. On the contrary, it is itself an emanation from the central Sun, which is the invisible source of all that IS in our solar system.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eFsNEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Storm Warning","description":"When Amy and Dan learn the truth about the Madrigals and Grace Cahill's alternate will, these discoveries lead to the revelation of a secret about their family and a showdown with the man in black who has been following them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9ZkayAwxua4C&dq=Storm+Warning&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Islam and Science: Religious Orthodoxy and the Battle for Rationality","description":"In this book, Dr. Hoodbhoy, a nuclear physicist, eloquently and usefully draws attention to the plight of science and technology in the Muslim world and to the need to do something about it.

The author's personal experience of these rides and the reactions of others towards social nudity in settings outside of the traditional naturist clubs has resulted in this exploration of the whole issue, presented here in the hope that others may come to understand better what many find to be an uplifting and affirming way of life. This work discusses being nude in a social setting. The author shows why people choose to live at least part of their lives without clothes, that doing so is very enjoyable and that it offers a number of valuable benefits.

As a medium of communication, Love's silent language predates speech by millions of years. Today, we still express emotions and feelings largely apart from words. The postures, gestures, and facial cues of attraction are universal, in all societies and cultures. According to Dr. Givens, courtship moves slowly though five distinct phases: attracting attention, recognition phase, conversation phase, touching phase, making love. Since potential mates \\"test\\" each other before uniting as one, courtship is a choreographed give and take of signs granting physical and emotional closeness. Love Signals is part enthnography and part how-to. Dr. Givens documents the little courting rituals witnessed in elevators, on subways, and in the workplace. He examines the essential role the face plays in courtship and how it can be optimally displayed. He decodes the body to find silent messages given off by shoulders, neck, arms, hands, waist, calves, ankles, feet, and toes. Dr. Givens analyzes expressive shapes, colors, and markings encoded in arm wear, shoulder wear, leg wear, and shoes. He deciphers the background messages of spaces, places and interiors to learn how environs help or hinder in the meeting process. Chemical cues emanating from aromas, tastes, steroids, sterols, and hormones strongly shape a partner's feelings, so they are explored as well. The book suggests ways to gaze, ways to read eyes across a room, and ways to sit, stand, align, walk dress, and lift a drink to participate in the fascinating adventure of finding, winning, and keeping a mate. Knowing the unspoken vocabulary of love signals will give readers an edge. What this means for courtship is that the reader becomes able to read unspoken motives, emotions, and feelings with great clarity and precision. The more readers know about the nonverbal idiom of attraction, the more likely they will find a loving, lasting partner.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sPMclK9DPfcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simply Sushi - Book & DVD","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3YIZswEACAAJ&dq=Simply+Sushi+-+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dos","description":"De spannendste ontknoping in de eredivisie aller tijden was zonder twijfel die van vijftig jaar geleden. In een beslissingswedstrijd in de Nijmeegse Goffert duurde het op 15 juni 1958 maar liefst 109 slopende minuten voor er een goal viel. DOS werd kampioen, Sportclub Enschede, met Abe Lenstra in de gelederen, greep naast de titel. DOS uit Utrecht landskampioen? In het seizoen 1957/1958 was dat helemaal niet onlogisch. DOS had veruit de meest productieve voorhoede (84 goals) en versloeg dat jaar topclubs als Ajax (5-1), Feyenoord (6-2), Sparta (1-7) en VVV (6-1) met flitsend aanvalsspel. Frans de Munck (De Zwarte Panter) in het doel, de onverzettelijke Hans Kraay als stopperspil en de laconieke maar bij vlagen briljante Tonny van der Linden als topscorer - zij vormden de ijzersterke as. En daaromheen een vriendenploeg (waarin zelfs zwagers), die vooral bij een achterstand ongekende veerkracht kon tonen. Het Wonder van Utrecht vertelt het verhaal van dit sensationele kampioenschap. Maar het biedt ook een verrassend inzicht in de jaren vijftig, waarin voetbal nog zonder televisie kon, en waarin je op de tribune nog sportiviteit en achting voor de tegenstander tegenkwam. Maar er was w l omkoping, het regende protesten en er was altijd gedonder om de opstelling van het Nederlands elftal.

Therefore, in accordance with the aim kept in view in writing, it leaves out many of the details included in the previous one. The difference between them, however, does not consist merely in these omissions: There is also variation in the treatment of some topics, as, for instance, in the first two chapters dealing with early Indian thought. At least in two cases, again, there are important additions. In the earlier book, Buddhism was dealt with in reference to two stages of its growth. There is a third phase, representing the doctrine as it was originally taught by Buddha; and a brief resume of it, as it has been reconstructed by scholars in recent years, also finds a place here. Similarly, the account of the Vedanta has been amplified by the inclusion of the Dvaita system. In treating such a subject as Indian Philosophy, it is difficult to avoid the use of Sanskrit terms; but their number appearing in the body of the work has been reduced as far as possible, and a Glossary is provided to help the reader in finding out their meanings readily. It provides a concise, connected account of Indian philosophy, and interpretation and criticism are provided within the limits of the volume.

Applications working at higher frequencies and using novel technologies have led to a demand for more robust circuits with higher performance and functionality, but decreased costs, size and power consumption. As a result, there is also a need for more efficient oscillators. This book presents up to date information on all aspects of oscillator design, enabling a selection of the best oscillator topologies with optimized noise reduction and electrical performance. RF and Microwave Transistor Oscillator Design covers: analyses of non-linear circuit design methods including spectral-domain analysis, time-domain analysis and the quasilinear method; information on noise in oscillators including chapters on varactor and oscillator frequency tuning, CMOS voltage-controlled oscillators and wideband voltage-controlled oscillators; information on the stability of oscillations, with discussions on the stability of multi-resonant circuits and the phase plane method; optimized design and circuit techniques, beginning with the empirical and analytic design approaches, moving on to the high-efficiency design technique; general operation and design principles of oscillators, including a section on the historical aspects of oscillator configurations. A valuable reference for practising RF and Microwave designers and engineers, RF and Microwave Transistor Oscillator Design is also useful for lecturers, advanced students and research and design (R&D) personnel.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=na3j2Q7XPGsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"C.S.

Can it return individuals to a whole, to a world, to a community? Developing Giedion's claim that contemporary architecture's main task is to interpret a way of life valid for our time, philosopher Karsten Harries answers that architecture should serve a common ethos. But if architecture is to meet that task, it first has to free itself from the dominant formalist approach, and get beyond the notion that its purpose is to produce endless variations of the decorated shed. In a series of cogent and balanced arguments, Harries questions the premises on which architects and theorists have long relied premises which have contributed to architecture's current identity crisis and marginalization. He first criticizes the aesthetic approach, focusing on the problems of decoration and ornament. He then turns to the language of architecture. If the main task of architecture is indeed interpretation, in just what sense can it be said to speak, and what should it be speaking about? Expanding upon suggestions made by Martin Heidegger, Harries also considers the relationship of building to the idea and meaning of dwelling.

Liddell Hart's penetrating, decisive studies of these great captains reveal not only their genius and impact, but offer relevant lessons that 20th-century military commanders have yet to fully reap.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3PFIswEACAAJ&dq=Great+Captains&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Principles of Functional Analysis. (Student Edition)","description":"This excellent book provides an elegant introduction to functional analysis ... carefully selected problems ... This is a nicely written book of great value for stimulating active work by students. It can be strongly recommended as an undergraduate or graduate text, or as a comprehensive book for self-study. --European Mathematical Society Newsletter Functional analysis plays a crucial role in the applied sciences as well as in mathematics. It is a beautiful subject that can be motivated and studied for its own sake. In keeping with this basic philosophy, the author has made this introductory text accessible to a wide spectrum of students, including beginning-level graduates and advanced undergraduates. The exposition is inviting, following threads of ideas, describing each as fully as possible, before moving on to a new topic. Supporting material is introduced as appropriate, and only to the degree needed. Some topics are treated more than once, according to the different contexts in which they arise. The prerequisites are minimal, requiring little more than advanced calculus and no measure theory. The text focuses on normed vector spaces and their important examples, Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces. The author also includes topics not usually found in texts on the subject. This Second Edition incorporates many new developments while not overshadowing the book's original flavor. Areas in the book that demonstrate its unique character have been strengthened. In particular, new material concerning Fredholm and semi-Fredholm operators is introduced, requiring minimal effort as the necessary machinery was already in place. Several new topics are presented, but relate to only those concepts and methods emanating from other parts of the book. These topics include perturbation classes, measures of noncompactness, strictly singular operators, and operator constants. Overall, the presentation has been refined, clarified, and simplified, and many new problems have been added. The book is recommended to advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and pure and applied research mathematicians interested in functional analysis and operator theory.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=stGFAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"INVEST WITH A GENIUS","description":"\\"Invest with a genius\\" is the credo that made Michael Levy a very healthy, happy, self-made millionaire and it is also the name of his newly released book written to simplify the investment maze that seems to get more complicated every day.

The unifying thread in the presentation consists of an abstract theory, within which optimality conditions are expressed in the form of zeros of optimality junctions, algorithms are characterized by point-to-set iteration maps, and all the numerical approximations required in the solution of semi-infinite optimization and optimal control problems are treated within the context of con sistent approximations and algorithm implementation techniques. Traditionally, necessary optimality conditions for optimization problems are presented in Lagrange, F. John, or Karush-Kuhn-Tucker multiplier forms, with gradients used for smooth problems and subgradients for nonsmooth prob lems. We present these classical optimality conditions and show that they are satisfied at a point if and only if this point is a zero of an upper semicontinuous optimality junction. The use of optimality functions has several advantages. First, optimality functions can be used in an abstract study of optimization algo rithms. Second, many optimization algorithms can be shown to use search directions that are obtained in evaluating optimality functions, thus establishing a clear relationship between optimality conditions and algorithms. Third, estab lishing optimality conditions for highly complex problems, such as optimal con trol problems with control and trajectory constraints, is much easier in terms of optimality functions than in the classical manner. In addition, the relationship between optimality conditions for finite-dimensional problems and semi-infinite optimization and optimal control problems becomes transparent.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uoXuBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Experiencing youth;: First-person accounts","description":"This book is comprised of 27 autobiographical cases written as a requirement for a clinical course on the psychology of adolescence by graduate and undergraduate students.

Elaine Sciolino came to Paris as a young foreign correspondent and was seduced by a river. In The Seine, she tells the story of that river from its source on a remote plateau of Burgundy to the wide estuary where its waters meet the sea, and the cities, tributaries, islands, ports, and bridges in between. Sciolino explores the Seine through its rich history and lively characters: a bargewoman, a riverbank bookseller, a houseboat dweller, a famous cinematographer known for capturing the river s light. She discovers the story of Sequana the Gallo-Roman healing goddess who gave the Seine its name and follows the river through Paris, where it determined the city s destiny and now snakes through all aspects of daily life. She patrols with river police, rows with a restorer of antique boats, sips champagne at a vineyard along the river, and even dares to go for a swim. She finds the Seine in art, literature, music, and movies from Renoir and Les Mis rables to Puccini and La La Land. Along the way, she reveals how the river that created Paris has touched her own life. A powerful afterword tells the dramatic story of how water from the depths of the Seine saved Notre-Dame from destruction during the devastating fire in April 2019. A  storyteller at heart  (June Sawyers, Chicago Tribune) with a  sumptuous eye for detail  (Sinclair McKay, Daily Telegraph), Sciolino braids memoir, travelogue, and history through the Seine s winding route. The Seine offers a love letter to Paris and the most romantic river in the world, and invites readers to explore its magic for themselves.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x_uKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good Life San Francisco Restaurant Guide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=I2pswgEACAAJ&dq=Good+Life+San+Francisco+Restaurant+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"We have all gone away","description":"In We Have All Gone Away, his emotionally moving memoir, Curtis Harnack tells of growing up during the Great Depression on an Iowa farm among six siblings and an extended family of relatives. With a directness and a beauty that recall Thoreau, Harnack balances a child s impressions with the knowledge of an adult looking back to produce what Publishers Weekly called  a country plum of a book, written with genuine affection and vivid recall.  In a community related by blood and harvest, rural life could be bountiful even when hard economic times threatened. The adults urged children to become educated and to keep an eye on tomorrow.  We were all taught to lean enthusiastically into the future,  Harnack recalls, which would likely be elsewhere, in distant cities. At the same time, the children were cultivating a resiliency that would serve them well in the unknown world of the second half of the twentieth century. Inevitably, the Midwest s small, diversified family farm gave way to large-scale agriculture, which soon changed the former intimate way of life.  Our generation, using the mulched dead matter of agrarian life like projectile fuel for our thrust into the future, became part of that enormous vitality springing out of rural America,  notes Harnack. Both funny and elegiac, We Have All Gone Away is a masterful memoir of the joys and sorrows of Iowa farm life at mid-century, a world now gone  by way of learning, wars, and marriage  but still a lasting part of America s heritage.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=47VmVj7h-JYC&dq=We+have+all+gone+away&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kaplan TOEFL Workbook with 3 Audio CDs, Second Edition","description":"Offers proven strategies for both the computerized and paper versions of the TOEFL, offering three full-length practice tests and an accompanying CD-ROM with two additional tests, seventy-eight practice conversations, and a section on U.S. university admissions.

Located between the temperate north and the tropic south, with desert to the west and ocean to the east, the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas provides habitat for a variety of birds seen nowhere else in the United States. If you want to see a Hooked-billed Kite, Muscovy Duck, or Altamira Oriole, this is the place. Drawing on years of personal observation and study, Timothy Brush has written a classic work of natural history about the little-known breeding bird communities of the Valley and the diversity of nesting strategies and behaviors that can be seen. Brush estimates that there are more than 150 current breeding species in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. In Nesting Birds of a Tropical Frontier, he describes the habits, distribution, changes in occurrence, and general outlook of these as well as former breeders, concentrating on Valley specialties and other birds of particular interest in the Valley. The species are all dependent upon appropriate habitat, from riparian forest to mesquite savannah, and Brush describes the history of these habitats and the special features that keep the birds coming. He also discusses conservation and the need for both large-scale land acquisitions by public and private groups and small-scale restoration through urban parks and individual landscaping. Art by Gerald Sneed and color photographs by several of Texas  top nature photographers show off some of the Valley s famous birds. Historical maps of vegetation and geology help us gain a better perspective on the changes that have taken place along the Rio Grande and on the breeding bird communities of the U.S.Mexico frontier.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cMLC5c2Xr2YC&dq=Nesting+Birds+of+a+Tropical+Frontier:+The+Lower+Rio+Grande+Valley+of+Texas+(Perspectives+on+South+Texas,+sponsored+by+Texas+A&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How We Got Our First Cat","description":"Trouble starts when a strange black and white cat wanders into a family's backyard but everyone finally agrees that she can stay and have her kittens--and a good home.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ybYsOAAACAAJ&dq=How+We+Got+Our+First+Cat&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"103 Questions Children Ask about Right from Wrong (Questions Children Ask)","description":"Helping parents answer tough questions kids have about God, values, and the Bible, this series of books features real questions asked by children.

As his retelling draws on all his imaginative powers, Silva finds  to his nervous delight  that if the facts of the past can be rewritten as a romance then so can the details of his own dusty bachelor present.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pwSu1zgNpoYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Foundations of Theological Study: A Sourcebook","description":"This is a collection of readings in theology, classical and contemporary, intended for college level students.

Con la campa?a napole?nica -Austerlitz, Borodin? o el incendio de Mosc?- como trasfondo, se narra la historia de dos familias de la nobleza rusa, los Bolkonski y los Rostov, protagonistas de un mundo que empieza a escenificar su propia desaparici?n. Hasta hace pocos a?os, todas las traducciones de Guerra y paz se basaban en la edici?n can?nica de 1873. Sin embargo, en 1983, la Academia Sovi?tica de Ciencias public? lo que ellos llamaron la ?edici?n original?, es decir, la primera versi?n que Tolst?i escribi? en 1866. Es la espl?ndida traducci?n de ese manuscrito original, de la mano de Gala Arias Rubio, la que publicamos en este volumen. ENGLISH DESCRIPTION War and Peace broadly focuses on Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812 and follows three of the most well-known characters in literature: Pierre Bezukhov, the illegitimate son of a count who is fighting for his inheritance and yearning for spiritual fulfillment; Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, who leaves his family behind to fight in the war against Napoleon; and Natasha Rostov, the beautiful young daughter of a nobleman who intrigues both men. As Napoleon's army invades, Tolstoy brilliantly follows characters from diverse backgrounds--peasants and nobility, civilians and soldiers--as they struggle with the problems unique to their era, their history, and their culture. And as the novel progresses, these characters transcend their specificity, becoming some of the most moving--and human--figures in world literature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=h6nasgEACAAJ&dq=GUERRA+Y+PAZ+(Clasicos)+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Computer Font Book","description":"Designed to be useful to graphic designers, desktop publishers, CAD/CAM draftpersons, and hardware/software systems managers, this font primer discusses basic styles, standareds, formats, compression methods, and much more.

Sara Hall's life seemed perfect: a wealthy husband, a big house in an affluent suburb, three healthy children. But the surface of Hall's life hid a marriage filled with sorrow and pain. One day, at age forty-two, Hall sees a lone figure rowing in the harbor, and that image becomes her holy grail. In this richly layered memoir, the author tells how her determination to master rowing a single shell gave her the courage to free herself from the dark forces of abuse in her childhood and the failure of her marriage. In lyrical prose, Hall describes the rigors of rowing, the elation of winning, the joy of total engagement in passionate enterprise, and the triumph of breaking free. Ultimately, she declares sovereignty over her life and wins a world championship gold medal. Drawn to the Rhythm is a brave and soulful book, written for all women who seek to find their strength and voice.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FDUEAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This Island Earth","description":"Ever hear of an interocitor? No? Well, don't be surprised - neither had Cal Meacham, electronics engineer and chief of research at Ryberg Instrument. Nor had Cal ever heard of a catherimine tube with an endiom complex of plus four. Yet those, and other equally bewildering apparatus, were offered for sale in the catalogue from Electronic Service Unit 16. Unfortunately, there wasn't a single clue in the catalogue as to how an interocitor functioned, or even what it was, yet judging from the list of parts and the accompanying diagrams, it was an enormously complex piece of equipment. Cal realized that even if he ordered a set of interocitor parts, and somehow succeeded in putting one together, he would have no way of knowing if it were operating properly or not. Was the entire catalogue some monstrous joke, of which he was the butt, or had Cal stumbled upon a technology vastly superior to our own? Cal had to know - his curiosity, both as a scientist and as a man, was aroused - and thus began Cal's apprenticeship with the Peace Engineers. And in the surprising events that followed, Cal Meacham became involved in an adventure to stagger the imagination. One of the truly memorable science fiction experiences of this or any other year, THIS ISLAND EARTH is that rare science fiction novel which combines a sense of social responsibility and thrilling action within the framework of a cosmic struggle to maintain a barrier against an incredible invasion. Here is a book that will appeal to everyone who has ever stopped on a starry night to gaze in wonder at the vastness of the universe, and to ponder the place in infinity of this island Earth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gEvZrQEACAAJ&dq=This+Island+Earth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dan O'Brien's Ultimate Workout: The Gold Medal Plan For Reaching Your Peak Performance","description":"Dan O'Brien, the athlete's athlete, presents the ultimate fitness regime designed for the elite performer and weekend warrior alike.

A pompous Under-Secretary of State, an exploitative and acquisitive American and her unhappy \\"niece,\\" a shady radical peer, and a brutal aristocrat are only some of the characters in this, one of Trollope's most engaging novels: part sensation fiction, part detective story, part political satire, and part ironic romance. It is also a highly revealing study of Victorian Britain, its colonial activities in Ireland and India, its veneration of wealth, and its pervasive dishonesty. In her introduction, Helen Small explores the central themes of lying and truth-telling, placing the novel within contemporary political and social debates. An invaluable appendix outlines the political context of the Palliser novels and establishes the internal chronology of the series and the relationship between fictional and actual political events, providing a unique understanding of the series as a linked narrative. In addition, the book includes a compact biography of Trollope and a wealth of explanatory notes. About the Series: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OrV-Ii6qfR8C&dq=Eustace+Diamonds+(World%27s+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The doctrine of God,","description":"To an increasing number of people these days, the announcement of God as a timeless immaterial substance, a single subject who is the predetermining cause of all things, does not sound like good news. Concerned that such problematic understandings of God continue to govern current debates, F. LeRon Shults explores the emerging theological revival of such themes as the Trinity and eschatology. Linking traditional attributes of God with contemporary philosophy, his book culminates with a reformed doctrine of God that revolves around themes of God's omniscient faithfulness, omnipotent love, and omnipresent hope. Evangelical in conviction while engaged with a variety of Christian traditions, Shults navigates a faithful way between dismissing the biblical tradition and fossilizing it in early modern categories. Reforming the Doctrine of God marks an astute and much-needed reconstruction of Christian theology for our day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=N4o4Rgh8RWMC&dq=The+doctrine+of+God,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Essence of COM: A Programmer's Workbook (3rd Edition)","description":"Offers a tutorial introduction to Microsoft's Common Object Module, Distributed COM, ActiveX, Windows control programming, Windows Host Scripting, and Windows interface programming","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QlcZAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Essence+of+COM:+A+Programmer%27s+Workbook+(3rd+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Basic Endgame Strategy: Queens & Rooks (Road to Chess Mastery)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=I3xJzgEACAAJ&dq=Basic+Endgame+Strategy:+Queens&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"German Cooking Today: The Original.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Yy1UkgEACAAJ&dq=German+Cooking+Today:+The+Original.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fire In The Sky","description":"A chronicle of the Pacific Air War in World War II draws on interviews with surviving veterans of all duties to paint a detailed look at the war in the sky","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8uBmAAAAMAAJ&dq=Fire+In+The+Sky&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Aggressive Adolescent: Clinical and Forensic Issues","description":"Maximize your effectiveness with troubled kids!

It does not apologize for its strength, its speed, its formidableness. Nor does it attempt to conceal them. Once, it seems, the Kur race had a planet of their own, but somehow, apparently by their own hands, it was rendered unviable, either destroyed or desolate. So they searched for a new home, and in our solar system found not one but two suitable planets, planets they set their minds to conquering. But these planets, Earth and its sister planet Gor, the Counter-Earth, were not undefended. Four times have the Kur attempted their conquest, only to be beaten back by the mysterious Priest-Kings, rulers of Gor. As the Kurii lurk deep within an asteroid belt, awaiting the chance to seize their prize, their attention is drawn to a human, Tarl Cabot. Cabot was once an agent of Priest-Kings, but is now their prisoner, held captive in a secret prison facility. But what is their interest in Tarl Cabot? Whatever it may be, one thing soon becomes clear - that Tarl Cabot is a man to be taken seriously.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nZd2-Y2muh8C&dq=Gor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Letters to Penthouse XI: Where Your Wildest Fantasies Come True","description":"In these uninhibited letters to Penthouse magazine, the writers reveal everything that goes on behind closed doors, as well as in back and front seats of cars, locked offices, airplane toilets and other places.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vHFlAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Update on Adult Development Theory: New Ways of Thinking About the Life Course: New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education, Number 84","description":"Our approach to adult learners and the learning process is shaped by our knowledge of how adults change and develop across the life span.

He transformed American politics, and his eight years as president spawned arguments that continue to resonate. For all that has been written about this singular personalityincluding Clinton s own massive autobiographythere has been no comprehensive, nonpartisan overview of the Clinton presidency. Few writers are as qualified and equipped to tackle this vast subject as the award-winning veteran Washington Post correspondent John F. Harris, who covered Clinton for six of his eight years in officeas long as any reporter for a major newspaper. In The Survivor, Harris frames the historical debate about President William Jefferson Clinton, by revealing the inner workings of the Clinton White House and providing the first objective analysis of Clinton s leadership and its consequences. Harris shows Clinton entering the Oval Office in 1993 primed to make history. But with the Cold War recently concluded and the country coming off a nearly uninterrupted generation of Republican presidents, the new president s entry into this maelstrom of events was tumultuous. His troubles were exacerbated by the habits, personal contacts, and the management style, he had developed in his years as governor of Arkansas. Clinton s enthusiasm and temper were legendary, and he and Hillary Rodham Clintonwhose ambitions and ordeals also fill these pagesarrived filled with mistrust about many of the characters who greeted them in the  permanent Washington  that often holds the reins in the nation s capital. Showing surprising doggedness and a deep-set desire to govern from the middle, Clinton repeatedly rose to the challenges; eventually winning over (or running over) political adversaries on both sides of the aislesometimes facing as much skepticism from fellow Democrats as from his Republican foes. But as Harris shows in his accounts of political debacles such as the attempted overhaul of health care, Clinton s frustrations in the war against terrorism, and the numerous personal controversies that time and again threatened to consume his presidency, Bill Clinton could never manage to outrun his tendency to favor conciliation over clarity, or his own destructive appetites. The Survivor is the best kind of history, a book filled with major revelationsthe tense dynamic of the Clinton inner circle and Clinton s professional symbiosis with Al Gore to the imprint of Clinton s immense personality on domestic and foreign affairsas well as the minor details that leaven all great political narratives. This long-awaited synthesis of the dominant themes, events, and personalities of the Clinton years will stand as the authoritative and lasting work on the Clinton Presidency.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Fe88rwSW8ywC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The opening of a door,: A novel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=sbNiAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+opening+of+a+door,:+A+novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marketing","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mrZbz564TJwC&dq=Marketing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Five: A Novel of Jewish Life in Turn-of-the-Century Odessa","description":"\\"The beginning of this tale of bygone days in Odessa dates to the dawn of the twentieth century. At that time we used to refer to the first years of this period as the 'springtime,' meaning a social and political awakening. For my generation, these years also coincided with our own personal springtime, in the sense that we were all in our youthful twenties. And both of these springtimes, as well as the image of our carefree Black Sea capital with acacias growing along its steep banks, are interwoven in my memory with the story of one family in which there were five children: Marusya, Marko, Lika, Serezha, and Torik.\\" from The Five The Five is an captivating novel of the decadent fin-de-si cle written by Vladimir Jabotinsky (18801940), a controversial leader in the Zionist movement whose literary talents, until now, have largely gone unrecognized by Western readers. The author deftly paints a picture of Russia's decay and decline a world permeated with sexuality, mystery, and intrigue. Michael R. Katz has crafted the first English-language translation of this important novel, which was written in Russian in 1935 and published a year later in Paris under the title Pyatero. The book is Jabotinsky's elegaic paean to the Odessa of his youth, a place that no longer exists. It tells the story of an upper-middle-class Jewish family, the Milgroms, at the turn of the century. It follows five siblings as they change, mature, and come to accept their places in a rapidly evolving world. With flashes of humor, Jabotinsky captures the ferment of the time as reflected in political, social, artistic, and spiritual developments. He depicts with nostalgia the excitement of life in old Odessa and comments poignantly on the failure of the dream of Jewish assimilation within the Russian empire.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BQ4tBAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Five:+A+Novel+of+Jewish+Life+in+Turn-of-the-Century+Odessa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lambs' Tales from Great Operas","description":"Imaginative, comical and informative guide, for children and grown-ups alike.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=j-MYAQAAIAAJ&dq=Lambs%27+Tales+from+Great+Operas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thaddeus of Warsaw","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y6ATAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Peach: Four Seasons on a Family Farm.","description":"A lyrical, sensuous and thoroughly engrossing memoir of one critical year in the life of an organic peach farmer, Epitaph for a Peach is \\"a delightful narrative . . . with poetic flair and a sense of humor\\" (Library Journal).

De pompbediende, een jongen van vijftien, adviseerde mij ernstig om ergens anders heen te gaan. De Hells Angels gaan daar de boel op stelten zetten. Jezus nog aan toe, waarom zou iemand nog naar Bass Lake willen? Die gozers zijn verschrikkelijk. Ze branden de hele boel plat! Ik zei tegen hem dat ik een karatemeester was en dat ik zin had in actie. Hells Angels is een sterk staaltje gonzojournalistiek waar Hunter S. Thompson zijn faam aan ontleende. Een jaar lang trekt Thompson op met een chapter van de Hells Angels en brengt deze notoire motorclub in kaart: hij beschrijft het ontstaan van de Hells Angels, de regels en gebruiken, de kleding, de motoren en de tatoeages. Aan de hand van politierapporten, verslagen van ooggetuigen en gesprekken met de leden zelf, ontkracht Thompson de mythische verhalen die de Hells Angels omgeven en waar zijzelf dankbaar gebruik van maken om hun reputatie van \`bad guys mee aan te dikken. Hoewel Thompson bevriend raakt met een paar Angels - tot grote afschuw van buurtbewoners, die van angst in elkaar krimpen als er een Harley het terrein komt oprijden - behoudt hij zijn journalistieke integriteit en weet daardoor een genuanceerd en feitelijk beeld te geven van deze legendarische motorclub. Hunter S. Thompson (1937-2005) groeide op in Louisville, Kentucky, en pleegde in 2005 zelfmoord door zich door het hoofd te schieten. Thompson maakte naam met Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, die in 1998 werd verfilmd met Johnny Depp in de hoofdrol. In 2011 verschijnt tevens Thompsons debuutroman De Rum Dagboeken, waarvan de verfilming gelijktijdig in premi re gaat. \`Er zijn twee bijvoeglijke naamwoorden waar schrijvers iets om geven briljant en buitengewoon Thompson bezit beide Tom Wolfe \`Thompson biedt ons een kijkje in een wereld waar de meesten van ons nooit voet aan wal zullen zetten.

They afforded a sharp contrast. One was a thick-set and rather ruffianly looking fellow, not too cleanly in either person or clothing, and, amongst other evidences that at one time he had known the prize ring, possessing a badly broken nose. His companion was dressed with that spruceness which belongs to the successful East End Jew; he was cleanly shaven, of slight build, and alert in manner and address. Having ordered and paid for two whiskies and sodas, the Jew, raising his glass, nodded to his companion and took a drink. The glitter of a magnificent diamond which he wore seemed to attract the other's attention almost hypnotically.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uDCZDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SQL: Implmenting the SQL Foundation Standard","description":"Comprehensive coverage of critical issues related to information science and technology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=g2yz6MfqVGgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rick Springfield","description":"I first heard  Jessie s Girl  in the summer of 1981.

Over the course of forty-two years, Thomas J. Watson took a failing business called The Computer-Tabulating-Recording Company and transformed it into IBM, the world's first and most famous high-tech company. The Maverick and His Machine is the first modern biography of this business titan. Maney secured exclusive access to hundreds of boxes of Watson's long-forgotten papers, and he has produced the only complete picture of Watson the man and Watson the legendary business leader. These uncovered documents reveal new information about how Watson bet the company in the 1920s on tabulating machines-the forerunners to computers-and how he daringly beat the Great Depression of the 1930s. The documents also lead to new insights concerning the controversy that has followed Watson: his suppos ed coll usion with Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime. Maney paints a vivid portrait of Watson, uncovers his motivations, and offers needed context on his mammoth role in the course of modern business history. Jim Collins, author of the bestsellers Good to Great and Built to Last, writes in the Foreword to Maney's book: \\"Leaders like Watson are like forces of nature-almost terrifying in their release of energy and unpredictable volatility, but underneath they still adhere to certain patterns and principles. The patterns and principles might be hard to see amidst the melee, but they are there nonetheless. It takes a gifted person of insight to highlight those patterns, and that is exactly what Kevin Maney does in this book.\\" The Maverick and His Machine also includes never-before-published photos of Watson from IBM's archives, showing Watson in greater detail than any book ever has before. Essential reading for every businessperson, tech junkie, and IBM follower, the book is also full of the kind of personal detail and reconstructed events that make it a page-turning story for general readers. The Maverick and the Machine is poised to be one of the most important business biographies in years. Kevin Maney is a nationally syndicated, award-winning technology columnist at USA Today, where he has been since 1985. He is a cover story writer whose story about IBM's bet-the-company move gained him national recognition. He was voted best technology columnist by the business journalism publication TJFR. Marketing Computers magazine has four times named him one of the most influential technology columnists. He is the author of Wiley's MEGAMEDIA SHAKEOUT: The Inside Story of the Leaders and the Losers in the Exploding Communications Industry, which was a Business Week Bestseller. Residence: Clifton, VA . \\"Watson was clearly a genius with a thousand helpers, yet he managed to build an institution that could transcend the genius.\\"-from the Foreword by Jim Collins \\"Like all great biographers, Kevin Maney gives us an engaging story . . .his fascinating and definitive book about IBM's founder is replete with amazing revelations and character lessons that resonate today.\\"-Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Harvard Business School, bestselling author of Evolve! and When Giants Learn to Dance","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t42F8WUCrhAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"John: A Commentary for Bible Students (Wesleyan Bible Study Commentary)","description":"Romans has been described as the theological epistle par excellence.

That current is best identified by its catch-labels--Theater of the Absurd, Black Comedy, the Theater of Cruelty--which is to say the theater of alienation, of moral anarchy and despair. To the practitioners of those philosophies Man of La Mancha must seem hopelessly naive in its espousal of illusion as man's strongest spiritual need, the most meaningful function of his imagination. But I've no unhappiness about that. \\"Facts are the enemy of truth,\\" says Cervantes-Don Quixote.

He has taken the essentials of cognitive-behavioral, motivational, and sport psychology and integrated them with an energy component that not only explains why they work, but accelerates their outcomes. The technique of Feelazation, which is the addition of powerful emotional energy to visualization, is also introduced. Reese says, \\"There ?s nothing really new about goal setting, visualization, stress management, and how to think effectively. They are all important and effective for promoting success. What I bring to the party is adding the emotional and energetic components to the other skills so that with proper integration you can cause enduring success.\\" The 5 Essential Mental Skills are goal setting, visualization, energy management, effective thinking, and mental toughness. As stand-alones, each of the five mental skills can have a positive impact on performance, behavior, and success. According to Reese, when these skills are integrated, there is a synergistic effect created in which the result (enduring success) is much greater than the sum of the parts. He also posits that the integration of the first four essential mental skills can encourage mental toughness, a trait that many feel you have to be born with. In his Ph.D. dissertation Reese showed that a Div. I Volleyball team enhanced both individual performance and mental toughness when the program was implemented. For 25 years Reese served as an athletic trainer in the NFL. Develop the Winner ?s Mentality is replete with both humorous and poignant stories of how some of the athletes he worked with utilized these skills to ensure their success. The most moving example is that of Dennis Byrd, a New York Jets player who was quadriplegic from a broken neck and who had a grim prognosis - he would be confined to a wheelchair for life. Byrd ?s use of emotive goal setting to walk out of the hospital only three months after his injury leads Reese to refer to him as the Ultimate Goal Setter. Forewards for Develop the Winner s Mentality are provided by two time NCAA National Champion University of Southern California Head Football Coach Pete Carroll, and former NFL All-Pro wide receiver and TV Celebrity Ahmad Rashad. Both high performers, Carroll and Rashad discuss their use of the mental skills and their personal relationship with Reese. The book is sectioned into 15 chapters that are written in a manor that facilitates the novice in the learning and application of each of the 5 Essential Mental Skills. Winner ?s is also interesting enough to keep the successful veterans of mental skills training engaged so that they can enhance the skills they already possess. Included in Develop the Winner ?s Mentality are many exercises for the reader to apply, which makes it a workbook within a text. Adjunct materials such as a voiceover PowerPoint and web support are in development so that Develop the Winner ?s Mentality can be used as continuing education for executive, life and success coaches; athletic trainers, physical therapists and physical therapists assistants; strength and fitness coaches; and anyone else interested in enhancing performance with individuals or groups. Winner ?s is well researched from both popular and scientific literature, and may be used as a primary or supplemental text for college courses such as introductory psychology, college success, and sport psychology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sgvmbfKiVqcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The art of boot and shoemaking;: A practical handbook, including measurement, last-fitting, cutting-out, closing, and making","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6PMHAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Broadside","description":"In 1965 Dudley F.

The Theory of Measures and Integration illuminates the fundamental ideas of the subject-fascinating in their own right-for both students and researchers, providing a useful theoretical background as well as a solid foundation for further inquiry. Eric Vestrup's patient and measured text presents the major results of classical measure and integration theory in a clear and rigorous fashion. Besides offering the mainstream fare, the author also offers detailed discussions of extensions, the structure of Borel and Lebesgue sets, set-theoretic considerations, the Riesz representation theorem, and the Hardy-Littlewood theorem, among other topics, employing a clear presentation style that is both evenly paced and user-friendly. Chapters include: * Measurable Functions * The Lp Spaces * The Radon-Nikodym Theorem * Products of Two Measure Spaces * Arbitrary Products of Measure Spaces Sections conclude with exercises that range in difficulty between easy \\"finger exercises\\"and substantial and independent points of interest. These more difficult exercises are accompanied by detailed hints and outlines. They demonstrate optional side paths in the subject as well as alternative ways of presenting the mainstream topics. In writing his proofs and notation, Vestrup targets the person who wants all of the details shown up front. Ideal for graduate students in mathematics, statistics, and physics, as well as strong undergraduates in these disciplines and practicing researchers, The Theory of Measures and Integration proves both an able primary text for a real analysis sequence with a focus on measure theory and a helpful background text for advanced courses in probability and statistics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Y8COquGJy3IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"George Washington Carver","description":"Born in 1860s Missouri, nobody expected George Washington Carver to succeed.

Hirschfeld argues that knowledge of race is not derived from observations of physical difference nor does it develop in the same way as knowledge of other social categories. Instead, his central claim is that racial thinking is the product of a special-purpose cognitive competence for understanding and representing human kinds. The book also challenges the conventional wisdom that race is purely a social construction by demonstrating that a common set of abstract principles underlies all systems of racial thinking, whatever other historical and cultural specificities may be associated with them. Starting from the commonplace observation that race is a category of both power and the mind, Race in the Making directly tackles this issue. Through a sustained exploration of continuity and change in the child's notion of race and across historical variations in the race concept, Hirschfeld shows that a singular commonsense theory about human kinds constrains the way racial thinking changes, whether in historical time or during childhood. After surveying the literature on the development of a cultural psychology of race, Hirschfeld presents original studies that examine children's (and occasionally adults') representations of race. He sketches how a jointly cultural and psychological approach to race might proceed, showing how this approach yields new insights into the emergence and elaboration of racial thinking.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zO9Wky90Xh8C&dq=Race+in+the+Making:+Cognition,+Culture,+and+the+Child%27s+Construction+of+Human+Kinds+(Learning,+Development,+and+Conceptual+Change)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Advertising For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","description":"Dit boek behandelt de planmatige aanpak van marketing van producten en diensten via het internet.Het boek heeft tot doel marketingtechnieken te vertalen naar de wereld van het internet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=sQsLQRp8rHgC&dq=Advertising+For+Dummies+(For+Dummies+(Computer/Tech))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cisco Internetworking and Troubleshooting","description":"King Arthur would have been just another king if he was content to just sit at home.

One of baseball s original  bonus babies,  Pat Jordan signed with the Milwaukee Braves in 1959 and then proceeded to struggle mightily in the minor leagues over the next three years. Depressed and frustrated, he gave up on baseball and eventually discovered his true calling as one of American s greatest sportswriters. But the unfulfilled promise of his youth continued to haunt Jordan, until, at the ripe old age of fifty-six, he resolved to get back into shape and rediscover his fastball. Come hell or high water, he would pitch again, this time for the Waterbury (Connecticut) Saints, an independent minor league team made up of players half his age. Eloquent, honest, and delightfully bawdy, A Nice Tuesday is the sequel to Jordan s acclaimed memoir, A False Spring, and the unforgettable chronicle of a sports comeback unlike any other.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jPeyCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dogfight: And Other Stories","description":"A collection of ten deeply insightful stories captures with psychological insight the pathos and small triumphs of everyday life, with its fumbling attempts at deeper human relations, disappointments, and moments of grace, in a new edition of the author's acclaimed literary debut.

The following linguistic levels are analysed: phonology, morphonology and morphology. Apart from this some remarks on syntax and a lexicon have been included. The first chapter contains an overview of existing descriptive publications on Resian. Taking this overview as a starting point the choice of exactly the San Giorgio variety as the topic of this study is accounted for and the need for not only phonological, but also morphological analysis is made pointed out. The chapter further contains information on the native speakers whose speech is analysed and on the various methods used to obtain the dialect material. In the second chapter the phoneme inventory is presented, along with information on realisations, (optional) neutralisations and sandhi phenomena. Notwithstanding the considerable amount of phonetic detail given, the first and foremost aim of this chapter remains the quest for phonological oppositions and their functioning. In the third chapter the morphonological alternations that occur in the substantive, adjective and verb categories are being treated. Instead of dividing this information over the respective chapters on these categories, the alternations are presented together in a separate chapter, because some of the more frequent of them occur in all these word classes. However, through a classification by accent classes alternations concerning the location of stress are treated together with the word class they occur in. The third through seventh chapter inclusive contain the morphology of the substantive (chapter 4), the adjective (chapter 5), the pronoun, the numeral and the article (chapter 6) and the verb (chapter 7), respectively. In each chapter, together with an inventory of the attested desinences, an overview is given of rare desinences, of irregular declinations/conjugations and of the distribution of alternative desinences.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=feN61pMZGjgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Systematic Theology, Vol. 2, God/Creation","description":"Systematic Theology is the capstone of Robert Jenson's long and distinguished career as a theologian, being a full-scale systematic/dogmatic theology in the classic format.

While this vocal and visible political movement has long voiced grave concerns about the Supreme Court and cases such as Roe v. Wade, they weren't able to effectively enter the courtroom in a serious and sustained way until recently. During the pivot from the 20th to the 21st century, a small constellation of high-profile Christian Right leaders began to address this imbalance by investing in an array of institutions aimed at radically transforming American law and legal culture. In Separate But Faithful, Amanda Hollis-Brusky and Joshua C. Wilson provide an in-depth examination of these efforts, including their causes, contours and consequences. Drawing on an impressive amount of original data from a variety of sources, they look at the conditions that gave rise to a set of distinctly \\"Christian Worldview\\" law schools and legal institutions. Further, Hollis-Brusky and Wilson analyze their institutional missions and cultural makeup and evaluate their transformative impacts on law and legal culture to date. In doing so, they find that this movement, while struggling to influence the legal and political mainstream, has succeeded in establishing a Christian conservative beacon of resistance; a separate but faithful space from which to incrementally challenge the dominant legal culture. Both a compelling narrative of the rise of Christian Right lawyers and a trenchant analysis of how institutional networks fuel the growth of social movements, Separate But Faithful challenges the dominant perspectives of the politics of law in contemporary America.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8_3-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Get on Reality TV","description":"Dan Gheesling is known for winning the grand prize on the hit CBS Reality TV show Big Brother.

When John B. Gordon's assault at Fort Stedman failed and Philip Sheridan swept Lee's right flank away at Five Forks, the only option left was a fighting retreat to join Joseph E. Johnston's army in North Carolina.Petersburg traces the individuals who took part in that desperate fighting which forced Robert E. Lee to retreat westward. Colonel Wensyel showcases not only the personalities of major characters like Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and Robert E. Lee, but also brings to life the ordinary soldier of both sides.

Typically, such extensions as customized context menu handlers, per instance icons (such as a data file icon that's based on the contents of the file), and customized property sheets are written in C++, and all of the available documentation focuses on using C++ for shell extensions. But even C++ programmers find the task rough going, given the woefully inadequate state of the documentation. Very few programmers know that writing shell extensions is not tied to a single language or development environment, and that Visual Basic is an excellent tool for creating shell extensions that more closely tie an application to the Windows shell. That, however, is precisely the focus of Visual Basic Shell Programming. It shows how to take advantage of shell services to develop shell extensions and it provides the basic documentation needed for accomplishing this. Each major type of shell extension gets attention, including: Context menu handlers that can add items to the popup menu that appears when the user right clicks a file. con handlers for displaying per instance icons that, like the standard Recycle Bin icon, vary depending on some condition Property sheet pages, which appear when the user selects the Properties option from a file's context menu. InfoTip handlers, which display tooltips, or \\"info\\" tips for a file object on a per instance basis. Pointers. Since VB tends to hide pointers from the programmer, Hamilton shows how to take advantage of the undocumented VarPtr, StrPtr, and ObjPtr functions, as well as the Win32 RtlMoveMemory function. Using class identifiers (CLSIDs) from Visual Basic. VTable modification, which allows control of the HRESULT (or status code) returned by a call to a COM method. In showing how to integrate applications with the Windows shell by building shell extensions, author J.P. Hamilton provides a concrete tutorial on COM programming with Visual Basic. And while developing their own shell extensions, readers get to learn advanced VB concepts and techniques such as: Visual Basic Shell Programming ventures where none have gone before by giving readers both the know-how to develop shell extensions and an advanced treatment of COM programming with Visual Basic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=H5lIzQEACAAJ&dq=Visual+Basic+Shell+Programming&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"\\"The dying swan,\\" (Fischer edition, no. 5526)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZWDpAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22The+dying+swan,%22+(Fischer+edition,+no.+5526)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crown of Creation: The lives of great Biblical women based on Rabbinic & mystical sources","description":"This study examines the lives of the great biblical women of the past.

Using the modern approach but without emphasizing the mathematical generality inherent in many of the arguments, it bridges the gap between existing nontheoretical texts written for undergraduates and highly technical texts written for graduate students. The book can also be used in masters' programs, and advanced graduate students will find it a convenient guide to modern industrial organization.The treatment is rigorous and comprehensive. A wide range of models of all widely used market structures, strategic marketing devices, compatibility and standards, advertising, R&D, as well as more traditional topics are considered in versions much simplified from the originals but that retain the basic intuition. Shy first defines the issues that industrial organization addresses and then develops the tools needed to attack the basic questions. He begins with perfect competition and then considers imperfectly competitive market structures including a wide variety of monopolies, and all forms of quantity and price competitions. The last chapter provides a helpful feature for students by showing how various theories may be related to particular industries but not to others. Topics include: the basics needed to understand modern industrial organization; market structure (monopoly, homogenous products, differentiated products); mergers and entry; research and development; economics of compatibility and standards; advertising; quality and durability; pricing tactics; marketing tactics; management, compensation, and information; price dispersion and search theory; and special industries.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tr4CjJ5LlRcC&dq=Industrial+Organization:+Theory+and+Applications&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Year With Jesus: The Living Bible","description":"This devotional guide will take the reader through a study of the life of Christ in one year's time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_T9YI80GwTkC&dq=One+Year+With+Jesus:+The+Living+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hindu-Yogi science of breath: A complete manual of the Oriental breathing philosophy of physical, mental, psychic and spiritual development","description":"Modern medical science and the ancient writings are as one on the importance of correct breathing as an aid to longevity and emotional stability.

Set against the dark background of World War this extraordinary trilogy follows the author s wartime fortunes and examines his emotional growth under the cruel pressures of hand-to-hand combat in the field. Perhaps the most striking qualities of Sassoon s record are its honesty, its simplicity and its lack of pretentiousness and false heroics. It is, after all, a deeply personal account of a complete phase of a man s life, spanning in continuous narrative form the period from the author s childhood to the war s end. The trilogy begins with Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man, a fond reminiscence of boyhood and adolescence set against the background of the author s rural English home. Full of the scent of leather and the huntsman cries on a frosty autumn morning, the scene is set as the world moves slowly towards war. In the second volume, The Memoirs of an Infantry Office, the mood deepens. A classic among war books, it tells of the author s steady disillusionment with the Army and of his ultimate rebellion against the cruel realities of war. Finally, in the last of the three, Sherston s Progress, set in an asylum for shell-shocked officers, the author is able to accept these realities and to resolve his emotional turmoil. Through it all, there is always the presence of Sassoon the fluid, sensitive prose, the fine perceptions of the poet yet spoken here in the voice of the average man. With charm and humor and quiet understatement, he has managed to articulate the hidden feelings of any sensitive man who in the normal course of his life is suddenly exposed to the nightmare of war.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tc-mDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+complete+memoirs+of+George+Sherston,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Survival of the Adversary Culture","description":"The Survival of the Adversary Culture shows that contrary to much popular and journalistic opinion, the rejection of American society conceived during the 1960's has not substantially declined but has taken root and endured despite surface changes.

Het neemt je mee naar de story meetings, de postmortems en de Braintrust-sessies en laat zien hoe je een cultuur bouwt waar creativiteit ontstaat en floreert. Pixar domineert al bijna 20 jaar de animatiewereld. Films als de Toy Story-trilogie, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Up en WALL-E hebben box-office records gevestigd en wonnen samen 27 Academy Awards. Het plezier in het vertellen van verhalen, de inventieve plots en de emotionele authenticiteit laten zien wat creativiteit werkelijk is. In dit boek onthult Catmull de idee?n en technieken achter het succes en de winstgevendheid. Bij Pixar is een unieke omgeving gecre?erd met processen die creativiteit beschermen en die ingaan tegen conventies: - Geef een goed idee aan een middelmatig team en ze verkloten het. Geef een middelmatig idee aan een fantastisch team en ze repareren het of verzinnen iets beters. - Als je er niet naar streeft om het onzichtbare zichtbaar te maken en het te begrijpen, dan ben je slecht voorbereid om leiding te geven. - Managers zijn er niet om risico s te vermijden. Ze moeten een omgeving cre?ren waar het veilig is voor anderen om risico s te nemen. - De kosten om fouten te voorkomen zijn vaak hoger dan de kosten om fouten te herstellen. - De communicatiestructuur van het bedrijf is niet gelijk aan de organisatiestructuur. Iedereen moet elkaar kunnen praten. - Ga er niet vanuit dat algemene overeenstemming leidt tot verandering  zelfs als iedereen aan boord is, kost het veel energie om een groep in beweging te krijgen.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Yu5hBAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Tank+Gang:+Finding+Nemo+Coloring+Book+Plus+Bathtub+Stickers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reviewing Leadership: A Christian Evaluation of Current Approaches (Engaging Culture)","description":"Evaluating Current Approaches to Leadership This book offers a comprehensive evaluation of current approaches to leadership from a discerning Christian perspective.

But the real nightmare's brewing in Bahrain. There, the most dangerous bomb expert in Al-Qaeda has targeted Horn for attack- as the first step in a plan to redraw the map of the whole Middle East.

Offers a rare inside glimpse at the creative process of one of cinema's giants: threetime Academy Award-winning editor Walter Murch. Includes anecdotes from the director, edit staff, and producers; photos, emails, and journal entries from Murch; and behind-the-scenes insights. Accounts from Apple's Final Cut Pro team about what they think about the future of it in feature films. As the first software-only desktop nonlinear editing system, Final Cut Pro sat the film industry on its ear when it debuted back in 1999. Now it's shaking things up again as editor Walter Murch, director Anthony Minghella, and a long list of Hollywood heavy-hitters are proving that this under-$1,000 software can (and should) be used to edit a multi-million dollar motion picture! This book tells the story of that endeavor: the decision to use Final Cut Pro, the relationship between the technology and art (and craft) of movie-making, how Final Cut Pro was set up and configured for Cold Mountain, how the software's use affected the work flow, and its implications for the future of filmmaking. More than anything, however, this is Murch's own story of what seemed to many a crazy endeavor-- told through photos, journal entries, email musings, and anecdotes that give readers an inside view of what the film editor does and how this particular film progressed through post-production. The book includes, in his own words, Murch's vision, approach, and thoughts on storytelling as he shapes Cold Mountain under the intense pressures of completing a major studio film.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HQANBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guilty As Charged: The True Story of a Gay Beret","description":"The true story of the psychological trauma experienced by the first Green Beret soldier when he was court-martialled by the Army in the 1970s.

In this probing book, a brilliant Bible expositor brings us into the very heart of God by answering such questions as: If God is love, how could He send anyone to hell? What's the difference between the loving God of the New Testament and the angry God of the Old Testament? If God is love, why did He require His Son to die such a cruel death on the Cross? How can God be both loving and jealous? The author argues against the two polar views of God as a sentimental grandfather whose doting love could not bring him to punishment of the disobedient and God as an angry tyrant who would rule by threats. \\"Both extremes paint a distorted picture of God and further confuse the issue of understanding God's love,\\" Dr. MacArthur writes. He insists that what God loves is actually defined by what He hates, and that neither His love nor His wrath can be understood in isolation from the other. Although the author is clearly aware of the way great men have grappled with these issues in the history of the Church, his doctrinal presentations arise more from the biblical text than from dogmatic theology. He examines in detail the way John?\\"the apostle of love\\"?treats love in his First Epistle, then fleshes out the doctrine of God's love in vivid representations of real people interacting with divine love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7wQq6ef-1u8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Autour De LA Litterature: Ecriture Et Lecture Aux Cours Moyens De Francais : Instructor's Edition","description":"The Sixth Edition of AUTOUR DE LA LITT RATURE retains its unique approach to literature, encouraging students to play and create with the language as they explore both classical and non-traditional Francophone literature.

It is new because it combines elements of many existing types of writing, yet in the end fits into none of them. At one level, it may be read as an account of how a puny, bookish boy discovered the importance of his own physical being; the \\"sun and steel\\" of the title are themselves symbols respectively of the cult of the open air and the weights used in bodybuilding. At another level, it is a discussion by a major novelist of the relation between action and art, and his own highly polished art in particular. More personally, it is an account of one individual's search for identity and self-integration. Or again, the work could be seen as a demonstration of how an intensely individual preoccupation can be developed into a profound philosophy of life. All these elements are woven together by Mishima's complex yet polished and supple style. The confession and the self-analysis, the philosophy and the poetry combine in the end to create something that is in itself perfect and self-sufficient. It is a piece of literature that is as carefully fashioned as Mishima's novels, and at the same time provides an indispensable key to the understanding of them as art. The road Mishima took to salvation is a highly personal one. Yet here, ultimately, one detects the unmistakable tones of a self transcending the particular and attaining to a poetic vision of the universal. The book is therefore a moving document, and is highly significant as a pointer to the future development of one of the most interesting novelists of modern times.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lIo8HQAACAAJ&dq=Sun+and+Steel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A treatise on suits in chancery: Setting forth the principles, pleadings, practice, proofs and processes of the jurisprudence of equity, and giving ... suggestions for solicitors and masters","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=I9zJDAEACAAJ&dq=A+treatise+on+suits+in+chancery:+Setting+forth+the+principles,+pleadings,+practice,+proofs+and+processes+of+the+jurisprudence+of+equity,+and+giving+...+suggestions+for+solicitors+and+masters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Joys of Live Alchemy","description":"Essays in this volume reflect simple wisdom, organic philosophy, bright humor, luminous choices, and lucent alternatives inspired by humanity's triumphs and tragedies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bgvRG1jP-hgC&dq=The+Joys+of+Live+Alchemy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Commemorative Issue, Three Volume Set","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UHp1AQAACAAJ&dq=The+Feynman+Lectures+on+Physics:+Commemorative+Issue,+Three+Volume+Set&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto","description":"Explores a range of modern cultural phenomenon, including Internet pornography, tribute bands, baseball rivalries, and reality television.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8bvFIHE0u4kC&dq=Sex,+Drugs,+and+Cocoa+Puffs:+A+Low+Culture+Manifesto&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Systematic Theology, Vol. 3: Sin/Salvation","description":"In partnership with the Dutch Reformed Translation Society, Baker Academic is proud to offer in English for the very first time the third volume of Herman Bavinck's complete Reformed Dogmatics.

With over 20 components including texts, workbooks, CDs, videos and teacher s manuals, it is also one of the most comprehensive. Now, a decade after its first revision, the entire series is being redesigned, updated and consolidated to meet the needs of 21st-century students and businesspeople who want to learn natural, spoken Japanese as effectively as possible in a limited amount of time. The book features not only a sleek, new design but also a unit structure that groups thematically linked lessons together, making it easier than ever to learn Japanese. Moreover, it now comes with a CD containing audio for the dialogues and listening exercises from the text. The exercises in the book have also been thoroughly revised to incorporate more comprehension and production tasks. Many of these exercises are illustrated, making for a stimulating learning experience, and the purpose of each one is clearly stated. This first of three volumes introduces \\"survival Japanese\\"   the absolute minimum amount of Japanese needed to live in Japan. Thus, the vocabulary and grammatical items it introduces are limited to about a third of what is typically introduced in a first-year course. In addition, the book features notes on Japanese culture intended to expand the learner s understanding of Japan, its customs and people. Japanese for Busy People I is available in two formats: romanized and kana. The Romanized Version uses romanized Japanese throughout, with kana in the Opening Dialogues of each lesson. The Kana Version   exposing students to hiragana and katakana from the very beginning   uses only kana.The content of the two books is otherwise exactly the same.

The near destruction of the music industry at the hands of online piracy and its subsequent recovery on the backs of digital streaming platforms is more than just the biggest story of disruption and reinvention of the digital age. It is also a trove of insights on how to confront the metamorphosis we are all facing in dealing with the Covid-19 era, as accelerating tech and economic changes reshape our work, our play and our very minds. Will Page, Spotify s first chief economist, extrapolates music s journey into eight guiding principles for pivoting through the ubiquitous disruption in nearly all industries. Expect the unexpected with transferable lessons coming from Starbucks, Tupperware and even Groucho Marx. The notion of 'Tarzan Economics' ties these principles together: a framework for recognising and acting on disruption, by letting go of the old vine and grabbing onto the new. Page joyfully brings these insights to life and provides a guide for knowing not just how to grab the new vine, but when. He assesses the new dynamics of the 'long tail', identifies friends and foes in the battle for scarce attention and provides a practical tool for discovering the right role for each of us to succeed in this new modern world. As we emerge from the unprecedented disruption of a global pandemic, Tarzan Economics shows all of us - individuals, organisations and institutions - that if the vine we are holding onto is withering, we can have confidence to reach out for a new one in 2021 and beyond.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jZ_cDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"EPA/625/6-91/030 Handbook: Sewer System Infrastructure Analysis and Rehabilitation","description":"FROM THE PREFACE Wastewater collection systems are dynamic, not static. There is no single maintenance method, equipment, or technique that works best. Keeping an open mind, trying new techniques and technologies benefits sewer system operators. No two collection systems are alike. Maintenance staffing, skill levels, equipment, budgets, age and complexity of the system make each agency unique. However, collection systems do have many traits and problems in common. Based on inventory and analysis, problems are identified. Defects may then be prioritized, and corrective maintenance operations put into effect. Preventive maintenance techniques can be applied to all collection systems. Preventive maintenance is cost-effective; it strives to prevent problems from occurring rather than reacting to difficult situations and \\"putting out fires.\\" This book examines problems shared by all agencies: roots, grease, deterioration, hydraulic inefficiencies and structural defects. New solutions to age-old problems are applied: TV inspection and video interpretation, rehabilitation analysis and trenchless technologies. Computerized maintenance management and GIS softwares are discussed. Jetting, line cleaning and exciting developments in nozzle technology are included. Roots and chemical root control foam, wastewater control and grease are major topics as well. Wastewater Collection System Maintenance shares insights drawn from operator experience, trial and error, successes and failures in the field, interviews and years of research and studies. A user-friendly rating and evaluation system is explained and applied to field conditions. Equipment operation and maintenance, and \\"tricks of the trade\\" are also discussed. As cities grow, new systems are extended upstream from older sewers. Many of these core drainage basins are now under capacity and in need of capital improvement projects. There are approximately 600,000 miles of sanitary sewers in the country. Nationwide, there exists a huge backlog of sewer pipes that need rehabilitation. Replacement would cost many billions of dollars. Maintenance operators are entrusted with the care and feeding of an aging sewer infrastructure.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SC8iii47dVQC&dq=EPA/625/6-91/030+Handbook:+Sewer+System+Infrastructure+Analysis+and+Rehabilitation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies","description":"(Applause Books).

Reformers across the political spectrum advocate moving these women off the welfare rolls and into the labor force as the solution to their problems. Making Ends Meet offers dramatic evidence toward a different conclusion: In the present labor market, unskilled single mothers who hold jobs are frequently worse off than those on welfare, and neither welfare nor low-wage employment alone will support a family at subsistence levels. Kathryn Edin and Laura Lein interviewed nearly four hundred welfare and low-income single mothers from cities in Massachusetts, Texas, Illinois, and South Carolina over a six year period. They learned the reality of these mothers' struggles to provide for their families: where their money comes from, what they spend it on, how they cope with their children's needs, and what hardships they suffer. Edin and Lein's careful budgetary analyses reveal that even a full range of welfare benefits AFDC payments, food stamps, Medicaid, and housing subsidies typically meet only three-fifths of a family's needs, and that funds for adequate food, clothing and other necessities are often lacking. Leaving welfare for work offers little hope for improvement, and in many cases threatens even greater hardship. Jobs for unskilled and semi-skilled women provide meager salaries, irregular or uncertain hours, frequent layoffs, and no promise of advancement. Mothers who work not only assume extra child care, medical, and transportation expenses but are also deprived of many of the housing and educational subsidies available to those on welfare. Regardless of whether they are on welfare or employed, virtually all these single mothers need to supplement their income with menial, off-the-books work and intermittent contributions from family, live-in boyfriends, their children's fathers, and local charities. In doing so, they pay a heavy price. Welfare mothers must work covertly to avoid losing benefits, while working mothers are forced to sacrifice even more time with their children. Making Ends Meet demonstrates compellingly why the choice between welfare and work is more complex and risky than is commonly recognized by politicians, the media, or the public. Almost all the welfare-reliant women interviewed by Edin and Lein made repeated efforts to leave welfare for work, only to be forced to return when they lost their jobs, a child became ill, or they could not cover their bills with their wages. Mothers who managed more stable employment usually benefited from a variety of mitigating circumstances such as having a relative willing to watch their children for free, regular child support payments, or very low housing, medical, or commuting costs. With first hand accounts and detailed financial data, Making Ends Meet tells the real story of the challenges, hardships, and survival strategies of America's poorest families. If this country's efforts to improve the self-sufficiency of female-headed families is to succeed, reformers will need to move beyond the myths of welfare dependency and deal with the hard realities of an unrewarding American labor market, the lack of affordable health insurance and child care for single mothers who work, and the true cost of subsistence living. Making Ends Meet is a realistic look at a world that so many would change and so few understand.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1_YWAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kinds of Power","description":"This title is part of UC Press's Voices Revived program, which commemorates University of California Press s mission to seek out and cultivate the brightest minds and give them voice, reach, and impact.

For Parents, Teachers and Everyone who cares for a Child There s nothing like the inspiration to be drawn from a story of someone overcoming challenges and achieving the impossible, especially when that story involves a child.

He noticed that it was the men who comforted others and who gave away their last piece of bread who survived the longest - and who offered proof that everything can be taken away from us except the ability to choose our attitude in any given set of circumstances. The sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision and not of camp influences alone. Only those who allowed their inner hold on their moral and spiritual selves to subside eventually fell victim to the camp's degenerating influence - while those who made a victory of those experiences turned them into an inner triumph. Frankl came to believe that man's deepest desire is to search for meaning and purpose.

Orage (especially, why he wanted to collaborate with them, and why that broke down). It shows that Gurdjieff was, fundamentally, a mystic, and that his contemplation-like methods were probably drawn from Mt Athos and its hesychast tradition. It shows the continuity in Gurdjieff's teaching, but also development and change. His original contribution to Western Esotericism lay in his use of tasks, disciplines, and contemplation-like exercises to bring his pupils to a sense of their own presence which could, to some extent, be maintained in daily life in the social domain, and not only in the secluded conditions typical of meditation. It contends that he had initially intended not to use contemplation-like exercises, as he perceived dangers to be associated with these monastic methods, and the religious tradition to be in tension with the secular guise in which he first couched his teaching. As Gurdjieff adapted the teaching he had found in Eastern monasteries to Western urban and post-religious culture, he found it necessary to introduce contemplation. His development of the methods is demonstrated, and the importance of the three exercises in the Third Series, Life Is Real only then, when 'I Am', is shown, together with their almost certain borrowing from the exercises of the Philokalia.

When the air turns chill, the area is transformed into a ghost town with only a handful of lifers who stay. Amethyst is bursting with mystery, romance, and jealousy all-year-round. When Quinn Rutledge and Summer Rosales met on a warm summer night on the shores of beautiful Lake Amethyst, they were both young, all was right in the world, and the only thing on their agenda was romance--one that neither of them wanted to end with the summer and closing of resort town Amethyst's tourist season. Promises and plans were made. Promises were broken... Summer was just about to begin law school with her closest friend--her pole opposite who'd dragged her to Amethyst in the first place. Apple Wooten came from a rich family she didn't appreciate and was sliding her way through life, trying to get the most fun she could out of it--including stealing just to see what she could get away with. Summer found herself in the unfortunate position of taking the blame for one of Apple's thefts, and not only spent time in jail but also was the victim of an inmate's wrath that led to the disfigurement of one side of her face before she was acquitted of all charges and allowed to pursue her law degree. Quinn had a lucrative dream career stretching out before him as an author who'd already won numerous accolades despite his youth. Though he'd returned to his livelihood after the summer with the woman he'd fallen so hard for, his heart prevented him from keeping away until they could see each other again the following summer as they planned. When Summer didn't show up, he'd tried to find her and couldn't. Though he should have returned to his writing, he's instead found himself settling in Amethyst, waiting hopefully, and probably foolishly, through endless winters until Summer comes around...","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o5u7CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Punany : The Hip Hop Psalms (New Classic - Color)","description":"Liefde als het erop aankomt van Daniela Krien is een sprankelende roman over liefde in al haar facetten.

Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City shook the nation, destroying our complacent sense of safety and sending a community into a tailspin of shock, grief, and bewilderment. Almost as difficult as the bombing itself has been the aftermath, its legacy for Oklahoma City and for the nation, and the struggle to recover from this unprecedented attack. In The Unfinished Bombing, Edward T. Linenthal explores the many ways Oklahomans and other Americans have tried to grapple with this catastrophe. Working with exclusive access to materials gathered by the Oklahoma City National Memorial Archive and drawing from over 150 personal interviews with family members of those murdered, survivors, rescuers, and many others. Linenthal looks at how the bombing threatened cherished ideas about American innocence, sparked national debate on how to respond to terrorism at home and abroad, and engendered a new \\"bereaved community\\" in Oklahoma City itself. Linenthal examines how different stories about the bombing were told through positive narratives of civic renewal and of religious redemption and more negative narratives of toxicity and trauma. He writes about the extraordinary bonds of affection that were created in the wake of the bombing, acts of kindness, empathy, and compassion that existed alongside the toxic legacy of the event. The Unfinished Bombing offers a compelling look at both the individual and the larger cultural consequences of one of the most searing events in recent American history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1WDS-INyWXEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"August Gamble (RCMP Series #1)","description":"He was well known to the Chester detachment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as well as to many residents.

Collected Poems: 1956-1998, as Joseph Brodsky said of Herbert's SSelected Poems, is \\"bound for a much longer haul than any of us can anticipate.\\" He continues, \\"For Zbigniew Herbert's poetry adds to the biography of civilization the sensibility of a man not defeated by the century that has been most thorough, most effective in dehumanization of the species. Herbert's irony, his austere reserve and his compassion, the lucidity of his lyricism, the intensity of his sentiment toward classical antiquity, are not just trappings of a modern poet, but the necessary armor in his case well-tempered and shining indeed for man not to be crushed by the onslaught of reality. By offering to his readers neither aesthetic nor ethical discount, this poet, in fact, saves them frorn that poverty which every form of human evil finds so congenial. As long as the species exists, this book will be timely.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2LHv4xUZUacC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Que le Duele? Beginning Spanish for Healthcare Professionals","description":"The purpose of Qu le Duele? is to teach healthcare professionals how to communicate, in Spanish, with Hispanic patients. This highly practical text is designed to help students and practicing professionals develop their oral communication skills. Basic grammar explanations and relevant vocabulary, with an emphasis on the construction of yes/no questions, are provided. The text focuses on highly applicable and relevant material. The exercises in each chapter begin with simple drills testing the readers recognition and comprehension of the material learned, culminating in more involved exercises (such as role-playing) geared towards the practice of Spanish in real-life scenarios. Furthermore, a CD that can be used for at-home practice accompanies the text to help improve ones listening comprehension skills.This book is adaptable to classes of different types and lengths. Some hospitals are providing six to eight-week Spanish courses of levels 1 and 2, with a total of twelve hours of instruction per level. This book is ideal for such a setting, as it could be divided into two parts: the first part for level 1, and the second part for level 2. For other types of courses, such as semester-long classes offered at community colleges or universities, this book is equally as ideal because, in its entirety, it provides more than enough material for such a class.In the second edition, students will find pre- and post-reading activities for every cultural reading selection. The pre-reading activities will help students brainstorm about their own culture and experiences; the post-reading activities will ask students to apply what they learned in the reading to different real-life scenarios, and to compare and contrast their own culture to the Hispanic one. In addition, we have added Study Tips throughout the chapters and developed a PowerPoint presentation for instructors to use in the classroom.Qu le Duele? will serve as a traditional textbook for students and as a reference tool for healthcare professionals who must speak with Hispanic patients. Emphasizing practicality, this relatively small book with a soft cover and index will allow readers to locate needed material \\"on the spot.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JVsqAQAAIAAJ&dq=Que+le+Duele%3F+Beginning+Spanish+for+Healthcare+Professionals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Progressive Fingerpicking Guitar","description":"A comprehensive, Lesson by lesson method covering all aspects of fingerpicking guitar, with special emphasis on folk styles, arranging, fingerpicking patterns and techniques.

It encourages them to speak out on issues of homosexuality where curricula, civil rights, personal freedoms, and social entitlements are concerned. It promotes the development of school-based intervention for gay, lesbian, and bisexual students. While the controversy over education and homosexuality is one of the most personally threatening in this nation s history, the timely research presented in Coming Out of the Classroom Closet will hearten gay and lesbian educators to continue to strive for fair treatment as peers and for equal representation in educational materials. Pointing to reports of greater social support and legal protection than is assumed by most in the educational system, this book should be required reading for all persons concerned about continuing to provide high-quality education at all levels--college and university, secondary, and even elementary. Chapters of Coming Out of the Classroom Closet look closely at many issues surrounding the issue of homosexuality in schools, including a history of treatment of gay and lesbian educators and their legal rights; effects of internalized homophobia on homosexual educators; gay and lesbian student s perceptions of their counselors and teachers ability to understand and help; beliefs, lack of knowledge, and lack of training of counselors and teachers about the needs of gay and lesbian youth; images of gays and lesbians in sexuality and health textbooks; important AIDS education; and the issue of homophobia.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sxoCAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Drip and microirrigation for trees, vines, and row crops (with special sections on buried drip)","description":"This book contains previously unpublished & practical design & management information on all forms of drip & microirrigation for agricultural crops.

Indeed, for 250 years - until early this century - it was performed with grand operatic additions set to baroque music. In his introduction Nicholas Brooke relates the play's changing fortunes to changes within society and the theatre and investigates the sources of its enduring appeal. He examines its many layers of illusion and interprets its linguistic turns and echoes, arguing that the earliest surviving text is an adaptation, perhaps carried out by Shakespeare himself in collaboration with Thomas Middleton. This fully annotated edition reconsiders textual and staging problems, appraises past and present critical views, and represents a major contribution to our understanding of Macbeth.

For four years Leon Dash of the Washington Post followed the lives of Rosa Lee Cunningham, her children, and five of her grandchildren, in an effort to understand the persistence of poverty and pathology within America's black underclass. Rosa Lee's life story spans a half century of hardship in the slums and housing projects of Southeast Washington, a stone's throw from the marble halls and civic monuments of the world's most prosperous nation. Yet for all of America's efforts, Rosa Lee and millions like her remain trapped in a cycle of poverty characterized by illiteracy, teenage pregnancy, drugs, and violent crime. Dash brings us into her life and the lives of her family members offering a human drama that statistics can only refer to.

Originally published in 1929. Preface: The present volume gives a systematic treatment of potential functions. It takes its origin in two courses, one elementary and one advanced, which the author has given at intervals during the last ten years, and has a two-fold purpose first, to serve as an introduction for students whose attainments in the Calculus include some knowledge of partial derivatives and multiple and line integrals and secondly, to provide the reader with the fundamentals of the subject, so that he may proceed immediately to the applications, or to - the periodical literature of the day. It is inherent in the nature of the subject that physical intuition and illustration be appealed to freely, and this has been done. However, in order that the ok may present sound ideals to the student, and also serve the ma pmatician, both for purposes of reference and as a basis for further developments, the proofs have been given by rigorous methods. This has led, at a number of points, to results either not found elsewhere, or not readily accessible. Thus, Chapter IV contains a proof for the general regular region of the divergence theorem Gauss, or Greens theorem on the reduction of volume to surface integrals. The treatment of the fundamental existence theorems in Chapter XI by means of integral equations meets squarely the difficulties incident to the discontinuity of the kernel, and the same chapter gives an account of the most recent developments with respect to the Pirichlet problem. Exercises are introduced in the conviction that no mastery of a mathematical subject is possible without working with it. They are designed primarily to illustrate or extend the theory, although the desirability of requiring an occasional concrete numerical result has not been lost sight of. O. D. Kellogg. August, 1929.

By 1961 NASA was confident enough to put a human being into space. But how had it acquired enough medical knowledge to ensure an astronaut s safety in just three years? It hadn t. The credit goes instead to decades of military medical research. Witnessing the first German missile attack on London in 1944, U.S. Army flight surgeon Harry Armstrong had been immediately concerned that aeronautical engineers would transform the A-4 (V-2) into a vehicle for transporting soldiers. He vowed, as founder (in 1934) of the military s only aviation human-factors research lab, to make such trips survivable. Efforts at Wright Field and the army s School of Aviation Medicine, which Armstrong had also turned into a world-class research institution, were the real reason for the successful start to America s manned space program. In Testing the Limits, Maura Phillips Mackowski describes the crucial foundational contributions of military flight surgeons who routinely risked their lives in test aircraft, research balloons, pressure chambers, rocket-propelled sleds, or parachute harnesses. Drawing on rare primary sources and interviews, she also reveals the little-known but vital contributions of German emigr  scientists whose expertise in areas unknown to Americans created a hybrid specialty: space medicine. She reveals new details on human aeromedical experimentation at Dachau, Washington s decision to limit astronaut status to males, and the choice to freeze the air force out of the research specialty it had created and brought to fruition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=J078wAEACAAJ&dq=Testing+the+Limits:+Aviation+Medicine+and+the+Origins+of+Manned+Space+Flight+(Centennial+of+Flight+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SQL Tuning","description":"A poorly performing database application not only costs users time, but also has an impact on other applications running on the same computer or the same network. SQL Tuning provides an essential next step for SQL developers and database administrators who want to extend their SQL tuning expertise and get the most from their database applications.There are two basic issues to focus on when tuning SQL: how to find and interpret the execution plan of an SQL statement and how to change SQL to get a specific alternate execution plan. SQL Tuning provides answers to these questions and addresses a third issue that's even more important: how to find the optimal execution plan for the query to use.Author Dan Tow outlines a timesaving method he's developed for finding the optimum execution plan--rapidly and systematically--regardless of the complexity of the SQL or the database platform being used. You'll learn how to understand and control SQL execution plans and how to diagram SQL queries to deduce the best execution plan for a query. Key chapters in the book include exercises to reinforce the concepts you've learned. SQL Tuning concludes by addressing special concerns and unique solutions to \\"unsolvable problems.\\"Whether you are a programmer who develops SQL-based applications or a database administrator or other who troubleshoots poorly tuned applications, SQL Tuning will arm you with a reliable and deterministic method for tuning your SQL queries to gain optimal performance.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dOYPtfVqS_MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fluid Power Technology","description":"Ideal for use in industrial training seminars, this well-illustrated and exceptionally lucid guide to fluid power technology strikes just the right balance between theory and application, providing both conceptual and practical information needed by today's technicians and technologists to succeed in the field.

However the dashing Carey, possibly a cousin of the Queen, merely trades one set of troubles for another. One black night in 1592, Carey is on night patrol along the unsettled border anchored by the garrison in Carlisle. It's a disaster. First, there's the fugitive he has to hand over to the warring Scots. Next come Wee Colin Elliot's sheep stealers. And then a gun explodes and takes off the hand of one of Carey's men. Back in Carlisle, Carey soon learns more faulty guns lie in the armoury in place of the sound weapons shipped in from Newcastle only last week. When these explosive deathtraps are stolen, he sets off in pursuit of both batches of guns  and the thieves. The search ends in Dumfries where King James VI of Scotland  potentially King James I of England when his cousin Elizabeth dies  and his raucous court have assembled.

It provides comfort and meaning, shapes ethical and political beliefs, and influences culture and arts. Faithful Generations details the significance of religion in the construction of Asian American identity. As an institutional base for the movement toward Asian American panethnicity, churches provide a space for theological and political reflection and ethnic reinvention. With rich description and insightful interviews, Russell Jeung uncovers why and how Chinese and Japanese American Christians are building new, pan-Asian organizations. Detailed surveys of over fifty Chinese and Japanese American congregations in the San Francisco Bay area show how symbolic racial identities structure Asian American congregations. Evangelical ministers differ from mainline Christian ministers in their construction of Asian American identity. Mobilizing around these distinct identities, evangelicals and mainline Christians have developed unique pan-Asian styles of worship, ministries, and church activities. Portraits of two churches further illustrate how symbolic racial identities affect congregational life and ministries. The book concludes with a look at Asian Americanled multiethnic churches. This engaging study of the shifting relationship between religion and ethnicity is an ideal text for classes in ethnicity, religion, and Asian American studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7yAad44ySG0C&dq=Faithful+Generations:+Race+and+New+Asian+American+Churches&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sword of Valor: Black Sabre #5","description":"In a final volume of the popular series, West Point graduate Lieutenant Argonne Sharps, the first member of her family to join the ranks of American front-line women, flies a helicopter with the famous 101st Airborne \\"Screaming Eagles.\\" Reprint.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dRmQRAZjczYC&dq=Sword+of+Valor:+Black+Sabre&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spit in the Ocean, No. 7: All About Ken Kesey","description":"Celebrating the life and work of revolutionary novelist Ken Kesey, this remarkable anthology includes previously unpublished materials by Kesey, as well as contributions by such luminaries and cultural icons as Hunter S.

Embodying the zeal of youth and the wisdom of age, this gentle jewel of Catholic apologetics traces the origins of the Sign of the Cross back to the Fathers of the Church, to the Apostles before them, and finally to our Lord Himself. Along with St. Francis's other lucid explanations of our Catholic Faith and his undaunted love even for those who hated him, this modest book helped restore to their native Catholic faith tens of thousands of heretics who not long before were intent on killing him. As they did for the Calvinists in St. Francis's day, so in our day these pages will bring you a better understanding and a renewed love the Sign of the Cross, that brief and lively exterior prayer by which, from time immemorial, God has been invoked by serious Christians before all of their endeavors. Among the other things you'll learn here: Why now is always the right time to make the Sign of the Cross Why God chooses to attach power to the Sign of the Cross Why it is made on the forehead How to convince skeptics to value and pray with it Two uses of the Sign of the Cross: do you know both of them? How the Sign of the Cross is the antidote to the Mark of the Devil Errors in the claims of those who oppose this practice The theological significance of the motions, vertical and horizontal Two reasons it has particular power against the Enemy Why you should make the Sign of the Cross publicly and often. Outside the Creed itself, there are few topics to which the Fathers testify as universally and unanimously as the pious practice of making, frequently and well, the Sign of the Cross. With the help of these holy pages, the saints love for it will enkindle yours. Soon you ll be saying with St. Jerome, \\"With every work, with all of my comings and goings, may my hand make the Sign of the Cross!\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NbykAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"B East","description":"First Published in 2000.
