The internecine warfare Orwell documents reads more like a description of the Vietnam War than the Second World War that followed.What might have appeared to be a war of all against Franco and, more important, a war to stop what was perceived as a tidal wave of fascism engulfing Europe became, in fact, a political war of various coalitions against other coalitions, ultimately to the detriment of Orwell's own division.Also, note how remarkably cautious Orwell is when describing events; how carefully he reminds readers of the limitations of his vantage point, of the fact that his experience may well be idiosyncratic -- not representative of the totality of the complicated war he is documenting. When is the last time any you remember hearing a journalist express that level of humility?"},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"George Orwell traveled to Spain in 1936 as a journalist. However, his political views and sympathy for the Spanish Rebublic's struggle against fascism in the guise of General Franco led him to enlist in the militia of the Partido Obrero de Unificacion Marxista (Party of Marxist Unification) or P.O.U.M. While his own political views were communist, his connections in Spain came via an English group called the I.L.P. which had ties with the P.O.U.M. and he concluded that he would first enlist and then later transfer to a unit more closely affiliated with the Communists. Ultimately, his wound and the changing political climate in Republican Spain would compel Orwell to end his service in Spain and literally flee that country after less than one year. Based upon that experience, he has some interesting observations to offer on the various armed forces serving the Republic - as well as the nationalists. He served both in the ranks and as a squad/platoon leader in the frontlines. Although he speaks of \\"trench warfare\\" he also makes it clear that his frontlines were not the continuous trench lines of World War I but more chains of hilltop outposts separated from both friends and enemies by the steep ravines that cut through this hilly terrain. Thus, his frontline experience was more a matter of long hours of bored watchfulness punctiated by raids back and forth across 'no-man's land' and some longrange sniping (his wound the result of such an incident).The resulting experience offers some interesting insights into the Civil War in Catalonia. His service in Spain ended in the wake of the Spanish Republic's supression and arrest of the P.O.U.M. militia and its supporting party as the growing communist influence in Madrid resulted in demands for the elimination of their rivals in the anarchist P.O.U.M. and its militia. In Barcelona in May 1937, Orwell had a front row seat for the Barcelona uprising that became the justification for this suppression and is able to rebut convincingly the communists' description of that event in the propaganda defending the elimation of the P.O.U.M. Force to flee while still seeking treatment for his serious wound at the hand of a fascist sniper, Orwell's experiences colored forever his perceptions of the Soviet Union and the international communist movement as reflected in many of his subsequent works. He wrote \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" and saw it published in 1938, before the end of the Civil War in Spain and this 1952 reprinting has the advantage of his own subsequently added footnotes where he noted errors he had made in his original account and how subsequent events related to or reflected upon the story told here. In this book, George Orwell offers an interesting and informative tale of men at war, of how the war in Spain looked to the men in the 'trenches,' and how his political views were forever shaped by the incidents of this conflict. This is a must read for anyone seeking a better understanding of the civil war in Spain or of George Orwell the man and his body of work."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"This should be the essential English read when it comes to first-hand experiences on the Spanish Civil War, Republican side.Orwell writes about every single thing he experienced about many aspects of the Republic during the Civil War. The struggles of ideologies, the society, the environment, the ravages of war, etc. Orwell, a leftist, sided with the P.O.U.M., a militant marxist party which fought the fascist, and at the same time were discriminated by the dominant Communist Party of Spain.As Orwell writes in these memoirs, he explains the several differences between the ideologies within the Republic. The Communists believed that it was better to defend the democracy and wait to do the revolution. This was particularly useful for the USSR (at that time, under Stalin, who Orwell despised), which pretty much was the big ideological boss of the Communist Party, and provided weaponry as well. The anarchists and the P.O.U.M., however, believed the Revolution went along with the war, they couldn't be separated. Catalonia was the scenery of this struggle for a classless, egalitarian, and stateless society, which was somewhat very successful during the beginnings of the War. It was, as Orwell put it, the ideal of an anarchist society, which would eventually fall to the fascists.If you want to initiate yourself on the Spanish Civil War topic, this is a good book, since it's a foreigner's report on a War in which both sides made up lies about each other. However, this book won't give you a good image about the fascist side led by Franco, so don't take it as an universal report on the Civil War and it's conditions."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"One of George Orwell's lesser known works, \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" is however, equally deserving of recognition as any other of his fine, fine writings. Shorter in length than most of his books (the memoir itself is approximately 190 pages long, with appendices taking up the remainder of the pages), it nonetheless paints a vivid picture of Orwell's experiences as a militiaman during the Spanish Civil War. Fighting against Franco's Fascists, Orwell left England to enlist in the radical and populist Republican militia. Unlike many in his militia unit, Orwell was not tied to any particular political persuasion in Spain, When asked why he had made the journey to Spain he replied simply \\"to fight Fascism\\", and when asked what he was fighting for he merely replied \\"common decency\\". Orwell left for Spain under the auspices of the ILP (Independent Labour Party), and as such, found himself among the ranks of the POUM militia. In actual fact, a point that Orwell appears to be at pains to repeat to his reader is his attempt at impartiality in his final assessment of his experiences. He denounces for example, the blatant lies and distortions of the Communist and pro-Communist press works just as he attacks the Fascist press with equal criticism (although he does exempt the Manchester Guardian from his wrath, which he commends for it's \\"honsest reporting\\"). Throughout the book, one gets a sense of Orwell's commitment to honesty.Orwell's vivid, journalistic prose is perfect for capturing the human side of warfare and how the human spirit reacts to the immense stresses brought about by armed combat. Orwell himself however, did not experience combat on a regular basis, and a great deal of his observances of life at the front are filled with descriptions of conditions in the trenches, the attitudes of his fellow soldiers and the occasional peek above the trench in the hope of spotting a Fascist! The book is as much social commentary as it is war correspondance.By far the most intriguing section of the book is Orwell's depiction of the cynical betrayal of the Republican militia by the Spanish Communist Party and it's agents. Having arrived in Spain, Orwell witnessed a Barcelona in a state of social revolution. Upon his return to the city after a stint at the front, he was witness to something very different. Under the order of the Spanish Communist Party (who in turn reported directly to Moscow, the Kremlin and Josef Stalin), Barcelona was the centerpiece of a dictatorial state within a state. Police and agents of the Communist Party turned their sights on members of all non-Communist militia units, be they radicals, populists or anarchists. Waves of arrests were followed in many cases by murders within the confines of Barcelona's frightful prsion cells (including that of Orwell's commander, Kopp, a Belgian). One can very easily see the beginnings of his later works of \\"Animal Farm\\" and \\"1984\\" in these pages, where he denounces all Communist Parties as agents of Moscow and condemns their propaganda offensives against opponents of all kinds. It was Orwell's experiences in Spain that resulted in him making this now poignant statement:\\"Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly against totalitarianism and for democratic Socialism as I understand it.\\"In conclusion, \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" should be read by any fan of Orwell, and as a prelude to \\"Anmal Farm\\" and \\"1984\\". My only criticism is that Orwell's use of abbreviations to describe the many political factions can leave the reader in a slight state of confusion. However, this should not detract from the merits of this book."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Written with passion, verve and brilliance, this is Orwell's personal history of his time fighting in the Spanish Civil War. A liberal leftist in the old sense of the words, his dedication to political liberty compelled him to put his life on the line for the ideals he held dear.And a harrowing experience it was. Orwell shows how the forces of the Republic were themselves split along idealogical lines and eventually became totalitarian as the war progressed. The atrocities on both sides, the deeply felt values of his anarchists and the political intrigues of an increasingly crumbling republic are all highlighted.Read Orwell. Read this, his essays and his novels, not just the popular 1984 or Animal Farm. His one one of the great voices of the early-mid twentieth century. A contrarian, a liberal leftest and an anti-totalitarian. Homage to Catalonia is one of the most gripping tales of the twentieth century by one of it's most shining minds."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"George Orwell went to Spain in late 1936, in his role as a journalist, but then, pretty inevitably, put down his pen and spent the next year fighting with the P.O.U.M (Partido Obrero de Unificacion Marxista) Militia against the Fascist forces under Francisco Franco. Homage to Catalonia, written immediately after his return and published in 1938, tells the story of his military service with the POUM, both against the Right and the Left, and, in quick succession, of his initial hopes for the classless society that he thought he had found on first arrival, then of his disappointment with the level of disorganization of the Leftist forces and finally of his disillusionment when pro-Stalinist &quot;allies&quot; began attacking Socialists and Anarchists who refused to toe the Soviet line. Orwell, who by then had nearly been killed when shot through the neck in battle, and his wife were ultimately forced to flee from Spain, to avoid Stalinist security forces, which had labeled him pro-fascist.The one thing, more than any other, that makes Orwell one of the great literary and cultural figures of the 20th Century, is that it was this last fact that truly galled him. Orwell was committed to the idea of revolutionary Socialism. As he says when the security forces attack POUM:I have no particular love for the idealized 'worker' as he appears in the bourgeois Communist's mind, but when I see an actual flesh-and-blood worker in conflict with his natural enemy, the policeman, I do not have to ask myself which side I am on.He was fueled by an animus towards the class system which is almost incomprehensible to us Americans, but which came naturally to young British intellectuals, particularly in the wake of the First World War. Accordingly, he was not unsympathetic to the Soviet decision that they had to take over the Left in Spain; in his revolutionary heart, he could understand that such a maneuver, however brutal might eventually serve the greater cause of the Workers. No, what he could not tolerate was that the perpetrators and their fellow travelers in the Press lied about it. It is the essence of the man that being purged was tolerable, but having his political beliefs portrayed incorrectly was intolerable.Orwell's concern for honest language is easy to discern in 1984 (see Orrin's review) and Animal Farm (see Orrin's review) once you know to look for it, but it is first evident here. He recognized early on that one of the ways in which dictators would attack freedom was to degrade the language and by cheapening the meaning of words, deaden the emotional reaction of the citizenry to events. Prescient in so many ways, Orwell was never more correct than when he made this connection between the integrity of language and the integrity of the men using it. One can only imagine a profile of Bill Clinton as written by Orwell.The Spanish Civil War is second only to the Hitler/Stalin pact as a dividing line between mere Left-Wingers and genuine Communists. It was here that the true nature of the Soviet Union first intruded itself upon the public consciousness to such a degree that its defenders truly had to be considered apologists, not simply naive do-gooders. Orwell, objective and honest as always, wrote only about what he saw, so his portrayal of events is necessarily incomplete and, writing while the conflict was still going on, he was not able to form the really harsh judgments that our historical perspective allows us to make. But it is to his great good credit that he wrote what he did and when he did. Many of his brethren on the Left refused to do so for fear of hurting &quot;the cause&quot;. Orwell chose to tell the truth and let the chips fall where they may; for that alone he should be celebrated.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Not long after George Orwell wrote HOMAGE TO CATALONIA, a famous friend of his remarked to him, \\"You've turned what could could have been a good book into journalism.\\" Orwell, who could take it as good as he could give it, agreed that this was the case, but added that if he hadn't been thinking journalistically when he wrote it, it never would have been written at all. In an essay called \\"Looking Back on the Spanish War\\" he later admitted that his motivation for writing HOMAGE was not to relate his experiences as a volunteer foot-soldier on the Republican side during the Spanish Civil War, but rather to blow away the fog of lies which surrounded the conflict and tell the unpleasant, politically incorrect truth: that the Loyalists, darlings of the political Left and supposed champions of freedom, were nearly if not equally as villainous as the Fascists, and were, even as Orwell was writing, murdering in large numbers many of the foreign volunteers who had come to help them fight, merely over a difference in political orthodoxy. HOMAGE was written objectively as possible, but also in great anger. If it is journalism, it's muckraking of the very best sort.HOMAGE begins with Orwell, in Spain to cover the war for a Leftist newspaper, abruptly deciding to throw in his lot with a Loyalist milita group called the Party of Marxist Unification, or P.O.U.M. In the early stages of the civil war, the democratic government relied very heavily on militias formed from the ranks of the Spanish trade unions to supplement its regular fighting forces (most of the Spanish Army had sided with the Fascists), but its relationship with the militas, were Socialist, Anarchist or Communists in persuasion, was strained and uncertain. Sent to the front at Aragon, Orwell quickly discovered that the mistrust of the government was preventing the militas from being properly equipped - he describes them as virtual rabble, lacking uniforms, sort on rations, and using outdated weapons. On leave, he also discovered - a recurring theme not only in HOMAGE but all his later writings - that there was a substantial difference between what was actually happening at the front and what was being reported both in and out of Spain. Objective truth seemed to be fading out of existence; each political faction, including all of those on the Left, had its own version of what was really happening, with actual events being rewritten or ignored depending on one's leanings. When his own group, the P.O.U.M., fell afoul of the government, Orwell was appalled and infuriated at how quickly Leftist university professors in England declared everyone fighting for it to be a Fascist spy and refused to be persuaded otherwise. He saw cowards lauded as heroes, heroes denigrated as cowards, major battles reported where there had been no fighting, and heavy fighting subjected to complete historical blackout. The idea that a completely fraudulent history of the war was being written frightened him, but not merely so much as the idea that an \\"accurate\\" history was not going to be possible, because regardless of who won, the winning side would write only lies, and those lies would, to the future generations raised on them, become the truth.HOMAGE is partially a battle memior, but Orwell's fighting experiences, which included being shot by a sniper, were secondary to the grinding realities of trench warfare on a neglected front - lice, cold, hunger, exhaustion, and boredom. He paints a vivid picture of war on a shoestring budget, but the book is most notable for his description of the Loyalist's suppression of the P.O.U.M. by force, an act which led to street fighting (a civil war within a civil war) in Madrid and very nearly cost Orwell his life. Slipping into journalism mode, Orwell tries to trace the causes of the fighting and the motivations of the government, while simultaneously documenting his own desperate struggle to escape the police and get out of Spain alive. The atmosphere of political orthodoxy, hatred, lies, hypocrisy, privation and terror he experienced during this time were fuel for the fire that later became \\"1984.\\"HOMAGE isn't a perfect book by any means, but it is classically Orwellian - tactless, penetrating, honest, thorough, and decent. It provides the reader with a depressingly clear picture of how petty political rivalries on the Left helped to hand victory in Spain to their worst enemies, the Facists."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"George Orwell must be an excellent writer because, in all honesty, I wasn't overwhelmingly interested in reading about the Spanish Civil War. Nevertheless, I really, really liked this book.Understanding the history behind the war isn't a necessity, but I definitely recommend bringing yourself up to speed via wikipedia before starting. That way, Orwell's personal recollections, which are the meat of the book, will be more relevant to you.Orwell presents a refreshingly honest account of the war and his own evolving take on it. Spain's resulting chaos is a prescient warning for those who take too passionately and seriously partisan politics. Orwell shows that it never takes too long before ideals are thrown out the window to be replaced by the centuries repeated same old quest for power.I recommend this book to anyone interested in the Spanish Civil War, human nature's struggle for power, or Orwell's insightful, often humorous observations."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"George Orwell in \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" wrote an outstanding book on his perspective of the Spanish civil war not a journalist reporting on what they saw in war, but from the view of someone who participated in the War in 1936 and 1937. Orwell and his comrades, armed with raw idealism but ill-equipped with little training, fought in the war for seven months as a private near Barcelona on the side of the loyalist (Republican) government forces.On the one hand were General Franco's fascist forces with the allies mainly the conservative groups such as wealthy classes, the Roman Catholic Church fighting to overthrow the Republican government. On the other hand were the Republicans comprised of various groups including socialists, communists, trade unions, liberal democrats, anarchists and secularists. Orwell was exposed to all the horrors of war and almost got killed himself. His insight into the brutal Spanish Civil War is very enlightening, as he describes the sad story, sometimes in a humorous way. He brings to life the privations and squalor that soldiers in the front line had to endure. The human toll from this terrible war was staggering, running into hundreds of thousands of killed, largely as a result of callous mass executions.In the book, Orwell gives a vivid and eloquent description of the time he was fighting in the militia which provides an eyewitness account of the fighting. Orwell explains how the fascists managed to prevail against the Socialist Republicans. Among the reasons were the Communists and Anarchists who often fought fiercely against each other. The betrayal by the pro-Stalin Communists, with USSR machinations during the war being more focused on furthering the Soviet Foreign policy than the communists cause. In other words, the communists were as deceitful and insincere as the fascists. From these experiences, Orwell detested USSR style of communism, which he depicted in his famous satire \\"The Animal Farm\\" as well as in \\"1984\\". I now have a different perspective of the politics of this war.This is a fascinating, depressing and at times hilarious book. It provides the reader with a more balanced account of the fighting during that dark period of Spain's history. This is recommended reading for those who like war stories, the history of Spain or just good writing."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"I picked up Homage to Catalonia on a whim. I am glad I did. Orwell writes in magnificent prose his experiences as an idealistic young man taking up arms to fight the spread of fascism. It concludes with a disillusioned, near mortally wounded (but still idealistic) Orwell fleeing the country for his life - a wanted criminal in the land he fought and bled to save. While he spent only a few months in Spain, but his vivid descriptions of the personalities he met, the hardship he endured and the near-fatal gunshot wound he received clearly impacted him in a profound way. His account will similarly impact the reader.Homage to Catalonia is really two books - one is the graphic retelling of Orwell's daily existence with the POUM (a Marxist group of revolutionaries), his impressions of his fellow militia-men, the privations they suffered, and the combat that they hardly ever saw. The other is Orwell's first-hand account of the politics &quot;behind the scenes&quot;; the Machiavellian plotting and schemeing between various revolutionary groups, the half-truths (and outright fabrications) of the media, the jockeying of politicians and nations in what would become the &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; for the Second World War. Much to my amusement, Orwell realizes he is writing two books, and point-blank invites the reader to &quot;skip&quot; the political analysis and get to the &quot;good stuff&quot; if the reader so wishes.In either case, Orwell wrote a tragedy. A tragedy that Spain had to suffer as it did. And that such noble ideas (as those Orwell himself fought for) were eventually washed away with Great Power &quot;realpolitik.&quot; The book was written while the civil war was still playing itself out; I beleive Orwell saw the writing on the wall. Highly recommeded reading."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"A vivid account of Orwell's experience as a militiaman in the Spanish Civil War, &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot; reverberates with Orwell's passion for equality, justice and humanity. According to Orwell himself, &quot;The Spanish Civil War and other events in 1936-37 turned the scale and thereafter I knew where I stood. Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democartic socialism, as I understand it.&quot;The events of that chaotic period clearly influenced Orwell enormously and within the pages of &quot;Homage to catalonia&quot; one can find the reasons why:&quot;I had dropped more or less by chance into the only community of any size in Western Europe where political consciousness and disbelief in capitalism were more normal than their opposites. Up here in Aragon one was among tens of thousands of people, mainly though not entirely of working-class origin, all living at the same level and mingling on terms of equality. In theory it was perfect equality, and even in practice it was not far from it. There is a sense in which it would be true to say that one was experiencing a foretaste of Socialism, by which I mean that the prevailing mental atmosphere was that of Socialism. Many of the normal motives of civilized life--snobbishness, money-grubbing, fear of the boss, etc.--had simply ceased to exist. The ordinary class- division of society had disappeared to an extent that is almost unthinkable in the money-tainted air of England; there was no one there except the peasants and ourselves, and no one owned anyone else as his master. One had been in a community where hope was more normal than apathy or cynicism, where the word 'comrade' stood for comradeship and not, as in most countries, for humbug. One had breathed the air of equality. I am well aware that it is now the fashion to deny that Socialism has anything to do with equality. In every country in the world a huge tribe of party-hacks and sleek little professors are busy 'proving' that Socialism means no more than a planned state-capitalism with the grab-motive left intact. But fortunately there also exists a vision of Socialism quite different from this. The thing that attracts ordinary men to Socialism and makes them willing to risk their skins for it, the 'mystique' of Socialism, is the idea of equality; to the vast majority of people Socialism means a classless society, or it means nothing at all.&quot;"},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"In 1936 Orwell fell in love with worker-Anarchist controlled Catalonia. Of course, he was on the Loyalist side. But he did not realize, at first, the nature and extent of the conflict within the Loyalist side. The reactionary press was saying the Loyalist's side was Communist. But the truth is that the Communists originally had very little influence at the beginning. The Communists were able to gain power because the Soviet Union was the only country supplying the Loyalists with arms. In addition to his experience as a memeber of the P.O.U.M (Workers Party of Marxist Unification) militia and his nearly fatal shot wound through his neck, Orwell recounts the small civil war--within the civil war--following the Communist action to take over the Anarchist-run telephone exchange in Barcelonia in May 1937. He and his wife escaped into France when the Communist-controlled police of Barcelonia outlawed the P.O.U.M. But, most important, are chapters five and eleven, where Orwell sorts out the politics on the Loyalist side."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"This amazing book demonstrates Orwell's remarkeable gift to understand the momentous events occuring in Spain as they were rapidly occuring around him. Orwell makes you fell the dynamic between the misery of war and the triumphant feelings of fighting for what is right. This book is a must read for anyone even remotely interested in the Spanish Civil War!"},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"In late 1936 George Orwell went to Spain to write newspaper articles about the civil war, but joined the POUM militia almost immediately &quot;because at that time and in that atmosphere it seemed the only conceivable thing to do ... it was the first time that I had ever been in a town where the working class was in the saddle.&quot; Seven month later, he escaped from Spain, a wanted man, sought out by the Stalinist forces because of his membership in the communist POUM militia! Although an eye-witness, Orwell recognizes the subjectivity of his account:&quot;I hope the account I have given is not too misleading. I believe that on such an issue as this no one is or can be completely truthful. It is difficult to be certain about anything except what you have seen with your own eyes, and consciously or unconsciously everyone writes as a partisan. In case I have not said this somewhere earlier in the book I will say it now: beware of my partisanship, my mistakes of fact and the distortion inevitably caused by my having seen only one corner of events.&quot;Orwell describes the misery of life in the trenches well. Prior to reading this book I had viewed (and reviewed) the video LAND AND FREEDOM, which is loosely spun off of Orwell's experiences. This book manages to capture the misery and discomfort that most war movies gloss over: lice, cold, damp, chill, sleeplessness, etc. Although he has much positive to say about the equalitarian nature of the militias (the same pay, food, &amp; clothing for officers &amp; men, mingling on terms of equality, voting on decisions), he repeatedly points out &quot;uncivilized&quot; and unsanitary conditions and behavior. For example:&quot;Sometimes it gave you a sneaking sympathy with the Fascist ex-owners to see the way the militia treated the buildings they had seized. In La Granja every room that was not in use had been turned into a latrine-a frightful shambles of smashed furniture and excrement.&quot;Besides life in the trenches, he tells of the street fighting in Barcelona between anti-Fascist forces, tells of being wounded, of treatment, the ban on the POUM, and living as a wanted man until his escape.The politics of the Spanish civil war are Byzantine at best. Orwell separates the political struggles of Republican Spain into two separate chapters, allowing readers who wish to ignore them to focus on his account of life during the struggle. He characterizes the Spanish struggle as the collision of three forces: 1) The workers (the anarchist FAI &amp; CNT, the communist POUM, and liberal socialists), 2) the Fascists (led by Franco's rebellious forces), and 3) the &quot;republican&quot; Liberals, Communists (Stalinists), and &quot;right-wing&quot; socialists. The workers seized the opportunity of opposing Franco's Fascism to promote social revolution. The Liberals and Communists worked to oppose social revolution and championed their struggle as one of liberal democracy against totalitarian Fascism. This led to the suppression of the workers' parties and militias.Orwell returned to England, still hoping that Franco with his Nazi and Fascist mercenaries could be turned back. Ultimately, the social revolution in Spain was suppressed, first by &quot;liberal&quot; forces, and then, they, too, were suppressed by the Fascists.This tale paints a human picture of life during the Spanish civil war. Orwell was able to leave the conflict. Most were not. Although the terrorism of smashing jumbo jets into skyscrapers shocks our consciousness, the systematic terror of Franco's government had a far higher toll in human life and liberty. As we face the challenge of responding to terrorism, let us remember that governmental suppression is far more dangerous in the long run than a few determined fanatics.Five stars for literary ability. Five stars for being able to present the Spanish political situation comprehensibly. Five stars for an enjoyable and powerful story. While less well known than Orwell's ANIMAL FARM and 1984, this book intensifies the meaning of his more popular writings.(If you'd like to dialogue about this review, please click on the &quot;about me&quot; link above and drop me an email. Thanks!)"},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"At a minimum, it should be required background for any class in which Animal Farm or 1984 are taught. I'm quite serious.Orwell's first-hand experiences in the Spanish Civil War, and the in-fighting on the Loyalist side, led him to form the views of the man who wrote the more famous works of fiction. However, those who read only Orwell's fiction tend to see only a condemnation of Communism (which is, at least in this country, too readily equated with socalism). They go away with a completely distorted view of the meaning of those stories, and of Orwell's perception on life.Homage to Catalonia is the truth behind the fiction. Read it."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"In addition to being a book about the experience of an infantry man in the Spanish Civil War, this is also a book about the nature of politics and political parties. Orwell doesn't hold anything back when he discusses his disgust at the Fascist party of Franco, as well as the fabricated lies of the Communist press, and the ignorance of the French and English media. His political analysis is quite intriguing in that it provides the reader with an historical context in which to examine the key players who would be involved in another conflict only a couple years later. The Spanish Civil War serves as an exciting background to the Second World War which is right around the corner.This is a vivid account of the life of a soldier. Orwell doesn't over dramatize situations; rather he tends to maintain a realistic style throughout this work. In addition, Orwell successfully intertwines humor with suspense as he recounts his brushes with death. In this book, Orwell examines the moral and physical experience of a man at war. His literary style resembles that of Remarque in his book All Quiet on the Western Front. Writing an engaging account from the first person point of view makes the account more authentic."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Although the book published the year before this one, _The Road to Wigan Pier_, is a more in-depth gauge of Orwell's politics, I still feel closer to _Homage to Catalonia_, a truly fascinating account of his months in the Spanish Civil War and an unwitting allegory for right vs. left, freedom vs. slavery, and other &quot;big ideas.&quot;It was with this book that I realized that Orwell was more than the apparently cynical curmudgeon who wrote _Animal Farm_ and _1984_. In fact, he was even more than an important political thinker. In all his writings, but especially _Homage to Catalonia_, one gets a sense of complete honesty and decency, completely unfeigned, that is impossible not to admire. His unflinching portrayal of all that was good and bad in revolutionary Spain makes this book one of those rare documents that can give you a slightly different way of looking a the world. I don't mean a conversion to radical socialism, but a sense that there is genuine wisdom in Orwell's uncomplicated, sincere way of looking at the world. His style, for me, disarms the most clever intellectual sophistry of those who are really nothing more than overeducated windbags.I don't always agree with Orwell, and I don't think he was by any mans the smartest Brit of the century. But I always admire what he says, and the way he says it, right or wrong.In a word: invaluable."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"George Orwell is now remembered for two works Animal Farm and 1984. As these books are parodies of Stalinist Russia one would imagine over time that he will gradually sink into obscurity.This book is an earlier work and tells of his experience as a volunteer during the Spanish Civil War. Orwell was a volunteer with the forces organized by POUM. The early part of the book tells of his experiences at the front line. As a memoir it is remarkable honest and readable.The Spanish Civil War was one of the early experiences of Communism seizing a nationalist movement and diverting it for their own purposes. Orwell was horrified at this occurring and a good deal of the book deals with the politics of the situation. He describes how a popular movement with some chance of winning was hijacked by Stalin's cronies and ended up being defeated.It is no surprise that he ended up being one of the most articulate and effective critics of Stalinism. This book is readable and a fascinating picture of a pivotal time in history."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"George Orwell (real name Eric Blair: 1903-50) is the widely known author of such classic novels as \\"Animal Farm\\" and \\"1984\\". In these novels the eloquent Mr. Orwell launches clever satirical attacks on modern totalitarianism and the repression of the human individual through propaganda.Lesser know is Orwell's work as a journalist. In \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" the English author reports on the 115 days he spent at the front in Spain fighting against the military revolt led by the Fascist soldier and eventual dictator of Spain the infamous Franco. Orwell fought in a Trotskyite miliia group in the Catalonia region near Barcelona. He suffered cold, hunger, the ravages of insect infections and was seriously wounded in the throat. Orwell and his wife had to escape from Barcelona to the safety of France due to his political party being banned by the Republican Communist government ruling BarcelonaOrwell is one of the finest prose stylist in the English language. He always sided with the common man against dictatorship which would limit freedom and do away with justice.Some of the chapters in this book are somewhat dull; especially the ones dealing with the internecine conflicts and rivalries among the leftist forces in the Spanish Civil War. The reader would do well to read on that spring training war prior to World War II prior to perusing this eyewitness account. The book has been listed as one of the most important nonfiction works of the twentieth century. Orwell is always worth reading as he was a man of firm opinions;he was on the side of the angels in the struggle to be free."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"into the tragedy that was the Spanish Civil War. The political complexities of this struggle are still misunderstood by many even to this day. It was far more than a struggle between the Left and Right (Communists versus Capitalists in this case)as Orwell shows in this treasure of a book. My first surprise here was to learn that the Communists were the far right in this not so little soiree. Orwell goes into great detail to give the reader a grasp of the many factions involved in this war. The travails of the POUM Militia to which Orwll belonged and the events that led to it's purge anchor things nicely. His personal experiences in the trenches along with his observations on the conduct of the war and of the many people he meets are very interesting and should not be missed by any student of history. A great book that belongs on the bookshelf of all serious collectors of Spanish Civil War writings."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"(A parody of yet another of Famous Archie Rice's music hall hits.) Others might call it PUT ME IN THE POUM -- Partry of Marxist Unification (or POUM) -- but I would discourage festivities on the grounds of toxic irony. Besides, in this conflict I would much prefer to be back at the Hotel with Orwell's wife, drinking tea and listening to her tell me what kind of man he was, and why she accompanied him to Barcelona while this thing was brewing. \\"Well, you see,\\" she might begin, \\"there was something going on, you know. 'Said it might turn into some sort of war. An' he 'ad to 'ave 'is story, like. An' I 'adn't been to Spain, I 'adn't. But who'd 'ave thought it to be so cold?\\"Me, well one of the things I didn't like about Orwell's Spain and the POUM in particular was that their mascot, a dog, was branded -- yes, branded -- with the letters P O U M burnt large on his hide. Makes you wonder: Who would brand a dog? Socialism's not for them, I suspect. But then, of course, what would you expect in a country which has as its great entertainment, the ritual public torture and killig of cattle?But this book does not flinch. This is a great documentary of the Spanish Civil war because this man went there only intending to watch, but joined in mostly without thinking, and kept notes throughout. (Got 'imself seriously wounded too, for 'is trouble.) Shortly after leaving Spain he transcribed those notes into the book before you.NOTE: Days later, after reading and reviewing this book I began reading it again very carefully, to check my first impression, and CATALONIA seems to me an even better book than I thought originally. That Orwell participates in the action and maintains his objectivity is phenomenal. It is impossible to imagine Hemmingway with all his vainglory, doing anything comparable. Some say Orwell was a great writer, some say he wasn't, but he himself wouldn't have wasted any time on that. You can't call Orwell a stylist, precisely. What you find when you read his work, is a sincere man writing in good English, without tricks.\\"It is difficullt to be certain about anything except what you have seen with your own eyes, and consciously or uconsciously everyone writes as a partisan. In case I have not said this somewhere earlier in the book I will say it now; betware of my partisanship, my mistakes of fact and the distortion inevitably caused by my having seen only one corner of events.\\"He has the skill his education gave him, but the remainder derives from the decency of his character. Orwell was a disciplined writer with high principles who never blew smoke up anybody's dress.Re-reading now, I came to realize suddenly that I read this book long ago; probably in High School, and either skipped over his description of the political causes of the war, or read them and simply didn't understand them. Now I understand: The Trotskyites were only those individuals who sought to practice that kind of humanist social collectivism he espoused when he was one of the Party's leading thinkers and writers; in other words, the true Revolutionaries. The Spanish Communists were comitted to a universalist totalitarian collective throughout Europe, directed from Moscow by Stalin. The later collaborated with the Spanish Fascists to eat the Trotsky-Socialists. It was typical of the brief Nazi-Soviet alliance that devoured Poland. (Stalin had Trotsky assassinated, later.) Soon, Franco, copying Napoleon's tactics, would sweep over Spain with his own mercenary army of North Africans, and devour the Spanish Comunists too.I recommend the book not because of its political posture -- whatever that may be (Orwell was Labor. What does that mean today?) -- for Orwell has no propaganda angle. Does he? Or does he? You have to figure it out for yourself."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"George Orwell was not like most British journalists nowadays who faff about in London pontificating on events they have no real experience of. He summarised the idealism of many young people in response to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. They knew it could be a vital test of history (they didn't know what full horrors were to come in WWII), and were attracted by the communual life of the militias fighting for the Spanish Republicans against Franco.Orwell's account captures much of the boredom, interspersed with dynamic fear of war. He hangs around Barcelona watching the effect of the turning tide of Fascist advance on that city, and describes the conditions of the front with his renowned eye for the right details - eating food out of the same pan you have washed in, the feeling of dying when you have just been shot but don't know the extent of the damage. Orwell's life brings to mind that line from Julius Caesar: Cowards die a thousand times before their deaths, the valiant never taste of death but once. Orwell's bravery is very apparent from his narrative.His political ear is acute, and a detailed appendix spells out the full ideological complexities of the parties fighting in the Civil War.Orwell was a brave, hardy intellectual who put his money where his mouth is. Makes the likes of Christopher Hitchens - he rages about Islamism, Iraq etc. but only goes to the places a couple of times a year knowing fine well he wouldn't last 5 minutes as a fighter - seem like they are all mouth and no trousers."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"My mother spent a frightful childhood in revolutionary Barcelona near the cathedral \\"Sagrada Famila\\"...FAI/CNT (anarchist)territory. Orwell's account in \\"Homage\\"is accurate and reveals his honesty as a journalist.Mother told me about the compulsory closed fist salute she had to give as a young child in front of the local church (turned FAI/CNT party headquarters). The buildings in her neighborhood were bedecked with the red and black colours of the anarchists, and her frightened crawling across the kitchen floor as bullets flew between the closely billeted Left militas every night were a nightmare come true. A horrible period of history...the precursor to WWII on the streets of Spain.Orwell did not let ideology hamper his account of the facts. There is more detail than dialectic materialism in \\"Homage\\".The hospital scene is particulary morbid...Orwell survived a shot to the neck by a Fascist. This section of the book reminds me very much of an essay (\\"How the Poor Die\\") he wrote about his brief stay in a french charity hospital during his transient-bum period, circa 1929, detailed in \\"Down and Out in Paris and London.\\" We can be thankful that we no longer have depression era hospital care.My mother's family were secret members of the Flange who issued false Costa Rican visas, mostly to clergy who were asked to work in my mother's backyard digging redundant trenches...the condition of ones hands determined the fate of many at the hands of the proletarian police who assessed the class ranking of people by the roughness of their hands as they crossed the French border. This fact is accurately described by Orwell in \\"Homage.\\"My family took one of the french refugee ships mentioned in the book just ahead of Communist agents. The hotels mentioned in the book were really controlled by the various militias-the churches were really gutted. Orwell's honesty and decency shine in \\"Homage to Catalonia\\".The real tragedy of the Civil War was the defeat of the center and the legitimate relatively moderate government of Spain. The chapter on the political factionalism of the Republic are historically valuable and not as unreadable as readers say.Orwell describes the chaotic infighting among the Left factions joined to the Republic which my mother witnessed on her street. Like the German Weimar Republic, the Spanish Republic largely lost the support of the army.The army defected to the Flange and the government was defended my a motley assortment of union and party militas: CNT, FAI, POUM, ect. which resulted in chaos for the Republic.Ironically, the Republic had earlier relied on Franco to crush a coal miners revolt which threatened its stability...perhaps this is what is met by the term \\"right wing socialism\\" which is mentioned in the book in reference to Negrin.I am also left wondering about Negrin and the definition of a \\"right wing socialist\\". Can anybody tell me?Interestingly, Orwell never mentioned the Right factionalism which plauged Franco: Carlists,Monarchist, and the Nazi element of the Flange represented by General Suarez who had conflicts with reactionary Flangists.The Suarez-Flangists later became the ill-fated \\"Blue Divison\\" which perished in Russia. Then again, Orwell would have had no way of knowing these conflicts since he was not a rightist.The Soviet role may have been positive in that it supported the legitimate government, the Republic, and helped to maintain order in the rear areas (with tragic results) while the fight against Franco continued.Orwell wrote that the token aid to the Republic provided by England and France, the latter being a Soviet ally, was puzzling and tragic. Would a stronger Soviet influence have resulted in a viable Republic? Why were the democracies so slow to react to Spain's tragedy? I am guilty of ethical utilitarianism in thinking that the Communists were possibly a positive influence on the Republic?Orwell was honest and detailed about the Spanish dilemma. \\"Homage\\" enshrines Orwell as a reliable literary time capsule- a gifted travel journalist...one of his goals stated in his essay \\"Why I Write\\".\\"Homage\\" is far better than many of his novels (pre-1940) which suffer from horrible character development and is well worth your time."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Generalissimo Francisco Franco's fascist troops invaded Spain in July 1936 in order to overthrow the newly established Republic headed by the Popular Front, (composed of liberal democrats, socialists, anarchists, trade unionists, communists and secularists). The country was basically divided into Red Spain - the Republicans, and Black Spain, represented by the landed elite, committed to a feudal system and Franco's cause, Fascists, the urban bourgeoisie, the Roman Catholic Church, and other conservative sectors. The number of casualties is only an estimate, but suggests that between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people were killed. Many of these deaths, however, were not the results of military battles, but the outcome of brutal mass executions perpetrated by both sides.During the war in Spain, approximately 38,000 non-Spanish, anti-fascist volunteers from fifty-two countries, took up arms to defend the Republican cause against Franco, who was aided by Hitler and Mussolini. Twenty-eight hundred Americans, in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, fought here alongside their Spanish and international comrades-in-arms from 1937 through 1938. These men and women believed the defense of the Republic represented the last hope of stopping the spread of international fascism. Most of the volunteers were not political, but idealists who were determined to \\"make Madrid the tomb of fascism.\\" English novelist, essayist, and critic, George Orwell was one of them.Orwell was not just a writer, he was a partisan and he was a political idealist. A revolutionary Socialist, not a Communist, he was affiliated with the Independent Labor Party (I.L.P.). Orwell originally traveled to Spain in 1937 to observe and to write, but he almost immediately enlisted in the militia as a private. At that time there were several political parties in Loyalist Spain, and each party had its own militia units, soon to be absorbed into the People's Army. Because Orwell's letters of introduction were originally from the I.L.P., which had connections to the P.O.U.M. (Workers Party of Marxist Unification - a small group of anti-Stalinists), he joined a unit of that party. Most volunteers fought Fascism under one of the Communist or Socialist banners, in a coalition effort, with the intention of working through political and social differences when the war was won. Until that time, he believed that the anti-Fascists should work together in a united front.When Orwell arrived in Barcelona, the Anarchists were still virtually in control of Catalonia. It was the first time Orwell had ever been in a town where the working class \\"was in the saddle.\\" He clearly conveys the sense of excitement of seeing the city under de facto workers' control, and the intensity of the revolutionary spirit which coursed through the people. \\"Servile and even ceremonial forms of speech had temporarily disappeared. Nobody said 'Senor' or 'Don' or even 'Usted;' everyone called everyone else 'Comrade' and Thou,' and said 'Salud' instead of 'Buenos Dias.'\\" It seemed like all men were equal, and there was hope in the air. \\"All this was queer and moving. There was much in it I did not understand, in some ways I did not even like it, but I recognized it almost immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting for.\\"After the most elementary training, Orwell spent weeks of bitter cold and hardship on the Zaragoza front, but saw little action. He was briefly hospitalized with a festering hand wound, and then returned to action - and this time there was plenty of it. Orwell's description of the fighting and conditions at the front is extraordinarily vivid and chilling. He went on leave to meet his wife in Barcelona in April, and thus was in the thick of things for the P.O.U.M. uprising. The situation in Barcelona had changed drastically since those initial days when everyone appeared on equal footing. There were startling changes in the \\"social atmosphere.\\" Perhaps initially, everyone had worn overalls and shouted revolutionary slogans \\"as a way of saving their skins.\\" Now, smart hotels and restaurants were once again filled with the wealthy, while food prices had jumped enormously for the working-class. The poor experienced serious and recurrent shortages. The differences between the luxuries of the \\"haves\\" and the increasing poverty of the majority became obvious. On May 3 a struggle began between the syndicalist unions and the Catalonian police force. Orwell saw the issue as a clear one: \\"I have no particular love for the idealized 'worker' as he appears in the bourgeois Communist's mind, but when I see an actual flesh-and-blood worker in conflict with his natural enemy, the policeman, I do not have to ask myself which side I am on.\\" He spent three nights on the roof of a moving-picture house, watching over P.O.U.M. headquarters until troops came from Valencia, and the street fighting stopped.After ten days back at the front Orwell received a near lethal neck wound. By the time he left the hospital he had lost his voice and all movement in his right hand. Warned by friends that the P.O.U.M. had been suppressed, and many members jailed, Orwell escaped to France with his wife. He began to write \\"Homage To Catalonia\\" shortly thereafter. It is a most inspiring and eloquent account of his time fighting with the militia during the Spanish Civil War, not just from a soldiers perspective, but as an eye-witness to one of the most significant events of the 20th century. It first appeared in 1938, but was coldly received by the left-wing intelligentsia, who regarded Communists as heroes of the war. In Orwell's lifetime \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" sold only about fifty copies a year.Many became disillusioned with communism in Spain, but kept silent fearing to harm the Loyalist cause. Orwell's take on the Communist's/Stalin's political machinations, and the overriding priority of the USSR to strengthen Soviet foreign policy, may appear obvious today, but those who put their lives on the line in Spain were much more naive. \\"The whole of Comintern policy is now subordinated (excusably, considering the world situation) to the defense of the USSR.\\" History now documents the Communist betrayal as far more terrible than Orwell conceived. He became an enemy of Soviet style communism as a consequence of his experiences in Spain, and advocated the English brand of socialism. There is an excellent Introduction in this edition by Lionel Trilling which discusses, to some extent, the political wheeling and dealing that occurred on the Republican side: how the Communist Party allied itself with right wing socialists and liberals to crush the P.O.U.M., with the standard Party line that anyone to the left of them were Trotskyists and therefore \\"fascist traitors.\\"This is a masterpiece which brings history to life. For a truly intense portrait of the period, you can do what I did, which was to read Ernest Hemingway's \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" with \\"Homage To Catalonia,\\" back-to-back. My highest recommendations!JANA"},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Homage to Catalonia may be the most important book I ever read. Important because it is the book that inspired me to become a journalist, a writer and a teacher.On the surface, this book is a reportage of the Spanish Civil War. It deals, of course, with the politics, some of the military strategy, and the deep social divisions of the period. More importantly, however, it is the story of how an idealistic, naive, but brilliant man discovered personal truths about war, politics and humanity.As a history of the Spanish Civil War, it is probably suspect. Orwell was isolated in Catalonia, affiliated with the POUM, a far-left revolutionary Marxist party led by Andres Nin [not Durutti who was, in fact, commander of the Anarchist CNT's militia], and a foreigner. He didn't see enough of the war to write its definitive history.However, that's not the task Orwell sets for himself. Rather, this is a chronicle of idealistic young men and women in dark times. It is a tale of the promise of revolution and its betrayal by power. Homage to Catalonia is a story of deep humanity about the dignity of man, home, and disillusionment.It is a great book."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"An editor from Slate magazine stated that \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" was one of his top three non-fiction books. That's a strong claim, and also what motivated me to download this to the Kindle.Orwell paints a vivid picture of the Spanish civil war prior to WWII. It is well written and a compelling read. Orwell travels from Britain to Spain and joins the Independent Labor Party and POUM [...] anti-fascist army in the fight against dictator Francisco Franco. His detailed descriptions of fighting on the front with ill-prepared comrades and antiquated weapons provide a palpable sense for trench warfare.At a few points in the book, Orwell departs the narrative and provides deep political analysis of the interactions between the PSUC, PCE, POUM and the various societal components of Spain at the time (bourgeois, farmers, workers, the Basques, etc). For the detail-oriented buff of Spanish history, these would no doubt be valuable nuggets, but I admit that I found these sections pretty dry and that I longed for the return of the story line. Suffice it to say that the political and social landscape in Spain around 1936 was extremely complex on one hand, and yet simplistic with regard to the world view of the rise of fascism elsewhere.Homage to Catalonia gave me perspective that I'd not had prior, and first-hand perspective regarding the views of Orwell himself. Recommended, but I'd fall shy of calling it one of the top non-fiction books.-j"},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"It's been said that George Orwell is every conservative's favorite liberal and every liberal's favorite conservative. This book likely did more to create that sentiment than any of Orwell's other works.\\"Homage to Catalonia\\" is the story of Orwell's experience fighting in Spain, during 1936 and 1937, against Franco's forces that were seeking to overthrow the Spanish government. Orwell originally traveled to Spain simply to report on the war as a journalist, but falling in love with the people of Catalonia and their revolutionary, honestly egalitarian spirit, Orwell joined the Workers' Party of Marxist Unity (POUM) militia.Once enlisted, Orwell traveled to the front lines of the fight in Catalonia. His observations of life on the front-line and the daily struggles for a soldier during war are at times funny, fascinating, and depressing. Remarking on war, especially the politics of war, Orwell writes, \\"I believe that on such an issue as this no one is or can be completely truthful;\\" yet Orwell seems supernaturally honest throughout this book.After risking his life for the socialist cause he believed in, even being shot in the neck, Orwell eventually realized that many people he once assumed were fighting for the same anti-Fascist cause as he were really no different than the enemy he was fighting. The anti-Fascist soldiers were generally divided into Anarchists (who believed that a Marxist revolution should be the immediate goal) and Communists (who believed that the Fascists must be defeated first and the Marxist revolution addressed after that). Orwell originally sided with the Communists in believing that the Fascists should be defeated first, but over time he came to realize that all the Communists were really wanting was the installation of their own totalitarian system. This left Orwell to fight with and support the Anarchists who were far more genuine than the Communists and simply wanted to be free from any oppressive rule. After months of political bickering, the pro-Stalin Communists in Spain began to arrest and remove the Anarchists with whom they had originally partnered in the fight against Franco, and many of Orwell's friends and brothers-in-arms were arrested and executed. Orwell, still recovering from his gunshot wound to the neck, barely managed to escape from Spain and avoid being caught in the brutal purge of the Anarchists. Knowing he had done nothing morally wrong or anything for which he should logically be arrested, Orwell inititally wanted to stay and help free his friends arrested in the Communist crackdown. But he soon came to realize, \\"It did not matter what I had done or not done. This was not a round-up of criminals; it was merely a reign of terror. I was not guilty of any definite act, but I was guilty of \`Trotskyism'. The fact that I had served in the P.O.U.M. militia was quite enough to get me into prison. It was no use hanging on to the English notion that you are safe so long as you keep the law. Practically the law was what the police chose to make it.\\"Orwell wrote \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" seven months after he escaped from Spain. By then he had time to consider the politics of the war from a distance and relate what he had seen and heard from people who never experienced life on the front-line of a war. The parts of the book in which he addresses these people are the most fascinating. In several of these passages Orwell writes of how he came to the realization that many of the people driving the Marxist ideas he once supported were every bit as dishonest and treacherous as the right-wing Fascists he always hated. As he writes of the press covering the war, \\"One of the dreariest effects of this war has been to teach me that the Left-wing press is every bit as spurious and dishonest as that of the Right.\\" Orwell's scorn extends beyond the left-wing press to wealthy English travelers through Spain at the time who were oblivious or apathetic to the widespread misery around them. Writes Orwell, \\"Some of the English visitors who flitted briefly through Spain, from hotel to hotel, seem not to have noticed that there was anything wrong with the general atmosphere. The Duchess of Atholl writes, I notice (Sunday Express, 17 October 1937): 'I was in Valencia, Madrid, and Barcelona... perfect order prevailed in all three towns without any display of force. All the hotels in which I stayed were not only \\"normal\\" and \\"decent\\", but extremely comfortable, in spite of the shortage of butter and coffee.' It is a peculiarity of English travellers that they do not really believe in the existence of anything outside the smart hotels. I hope they found some butter for the Duchess of Atholl.\\"It must have been hard for Orwell to come to terms with the fact that many people he once supported were no less repugnant than his enemies. When faced with such a situation, human beings have a natural urge to deny or make excuses for what they are seeing or hearing, for whatever their reasons. It is hard for people to admit when they are wrong, especially regarding something they care deeply about. Orwell faced this situation, and he chose honesty over ideology. Sadly, many of his contemporaries did not."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Ever wonder what it is like be shot right through the neck? Ever wonder what it is like to stare over open sights at an enemy soldier with his pants down (literally) relieving himself? Would you shoot? Ever wonder what it is like to fight with allies that may be as worse than the common enemy?Orwell experienced all of this and more as a member of one of the more obscure Spanish militias fighting for the Spanish Republic during the bloody internecine Spanish Civil War. He also became incredibly dissillusioned in the process. Finding his beliefs in revolutionary socialism, he was already jaded by communism and the cynical use it was put to serve Stalin's interests. He opted for a more loose organisation and therefore choose to enroll with the Anarcho-Syndicalists as a foreign volunteer in the Spanish Civil War. His particular group was called the POUMists (an acronym that I need not summarize here).Ill-equipped and with no training, they showed what raw idealism can do against Franco and his fascist oppression -- they stopped fascism cold on the battle field and were never found wanting in terms of courage. What did defeat them was the United Front launched by the Cominterm against International Fascism. For those that did not tow the line, Stalin's advisors and compadours inside the Spanish Communist Party sacrificed. Denied weapons, ammunition and food, the coalition --- made up a broad spectrum of liberal-democrats, progressives, socialists, communists, anarchists (and every shade between) --- were defeated in piece-meal battles. Orwell was shaped and scarred by the experience. Although always a social progressive, he realised that idealism in its most extreme forms could be as bad as the fascism one was fighting against. This shaped his eternal mistrust of Communism (but not as some rightist's bizaarly claim, push him into being some kind of conservative demigod).This book has it all: a trenchent analysis of political history, a serious war biography, a good slice of military narrative, and a chronicle of idealist growth, development and abandoning of a former way of thinking...Without a doubt one of my top 5 war biographies and one of the top 25 reads of my entire life, so far...."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Attracted by the idea of fighting against Fascism, the English journalist, Eric Blair, a.k.a. George Orwell, went to Spain in late 1936 to cover the fight against Fascism and found himself in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia in north-east Spain, joining the militia of the anti-Fascist \\"Partido Obrero de Unificacion Marxista\\", the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification - or POUM, for short. Yet Orwell himself, in a literary work praised by many for its - or its author's - honesty, admits to have joined without any pretence of knowing or caring what it meant to be part of any particular anti-Fascist militia. His take on all the squabbling, which existed at the time between the various anti-Fascist factions, was much the same as anybody who was ignorant of the facts; that is, \\"Can't we put this political stuff aside and get on with the war?\\" As a result, the consequences of being in the POUM militia - if not a party member himself (which he was not) - would become all too obvious later on when it was almost too late for him personally.The book is a mixture of a personal, eyewitness account of the fighting on the Aragon Front, in which he participated actively, and of the background to what he called the \\"internecine\\" nature of the infighting between the anti-Fascist factions which was to lead to back-stabbing by rival factions, including the Communists, with the POUM as the main target for attacks in the press, both Spanish and foreign.Orwell describes life in the front line in language that is meant to convey in an honest - some might say too honest - way just how things were: the ways in which pathetically ill-trained and ill-equipped militiamen were thrown into the front line without even having been shown any weapons of any kind, the privations of life in the trenches, the sheer boredom of being on guard-duty with only the occasional firing from enemy positions, several hundreds of meters away, to break the monotony, the sight of destroyed buildings, the fertile lands being turned into a wasteland, and fear of the cold being greater than fear of the enemy.For him, the most memorable incidents were the night attack against the Fascist lines, in which he participated, and the moment when he was shot in the throat, albeit at a later date. His descriptions of both incidents are lively and vivid. The crawling through no-man's-land, trying to make as little noise as possible, the firing of shots in unison, the throwing of hand-grenades, the deafening noises, the shouting of attackers and defenders, the bullets zipping overhead too near for comfort, and even Orwell himself chasing a Fascist up a trench trying (and failing) to bayonet him - all are described in language that he keeps as objective as possible, even to the point of regretting trying to kill anyone, even those trying to kill him.This is due to the fact that people like him were caught up in a war whose political ramifications were either misunderstood or else not understood at all, thanks largely to their being kept deliberately ignorant of the propagandist mud-slinging and governmental back-stabbing behind their backs. The militiamen (Orwell hardly ever uses the word, \\"soldiers\\") only knew that they were fighting, whether by choice (as in Orwell's case) or not, for causes which turned out to be somewhat dubious once one had a grasp of what the war was really supposed to be about.Orwell devotes a considerable amount of space to trying to explain the political background to all the war, yet he sends a caveat to the reader: \\"Beware of my partisanship\\", indicating that his account is necessarily one-sided, if only because he had been fighting allegedly against Fascism. At times, it can seem utterly confusing to a reader who, like him, knows nothing of the politics prevailing in 1930s' Spain. It seems that, if Franco was not trying to overthrow the Republican government, the various left-wing parties, representing socialism, anarchism and communism, were vying for power in the most brutal manner.The one thing that was most misunderstood by the foreign press, Orwell notes, was that there was a revolution going on in Spain, yet the Communists allegedly did NOT want revolution to happen, if only because revolution could only come once the war had been won. Instead, the POUM ended up as the political scapegoat, as it was viciously attacked in the press as a subversive organization that was allegedly pro-Fascist, even though the opposite was true. The party was suppressed, and it was a cat-and-mouse game for the wounded Orwell to avoid arrest and detention without trial by the police. His disgust at the way his fellow militiamen were treated is clear - these people had risked their lives at the front yet, once back in Barcelona, they were being thrown into prison.Orwell neatly puts propaganda and the war into perspective. What Spaniards and foreigners alike wanted to believe depended upon their prejudices being reinforced by whatever was being told in the press, and Orwell quotes many sources which were written in a way designed deliberately to mislead and mis-inform. Even British pro-Communist papers swallowed what Orwell points to as \\"lies\\" spread by the Spanish government in order to ensure that the main reasons for the war in Spain were never fully explained.It could not have been easy for Orwell, reading about how he and others like him were being portrayed as \\"Trotskyists in Fascist pay\\" when they were, in fact, in the bitterest fighting against the Fascists, yet such was the nature of the contemporary reporting of one of the least understood wars of the 20th century, not least because the politics behind it was badly understood. The attitudes that prevailed in Spain simply did not exist in England, something that Orwell points out, and this state of affairs simply contributed to the indifference to, and lack of understanding of, the war by people in his native England, to which he returned soon after his escape from Spain in June 1937.Said to be one of the most vivid examples in 20th century English literature of the futility of war and its consequences, \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" may be regarded as a combination of a personal memoir and an anti-war polemic, yet it has only been really understood and appreciated properly in the light of events which occurred since the book was first published in 1938. It is, indeed, still a powerful work where Orwell shows that he has the ability to be objective about what was happening, neither attacking nor defending the events around him, the hallmark of a true journalist."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"In this gripping book, you find some of the best reportage about the Spanish Civil War and you get some of the most engaging descriptions of anarchist and communal living. People always complain about the part of the book which emphasizes party politics in Spain, and you can easily skip that--or, you can peer into a seminal experience for Orwell. His frustrations with the Stalin-supported Spanish communists drove him to write 1984 and Animal Farm. Orwell is better known for these anti-communist writings and less so for his own socialist creed and deep compassion for the poor. Homage to Catalonia captures both his admiration of the working classes and his abject fear of communism. For the writing, for the vision of collectivism, for the war journalism, for the eyewitness accounts of crucial history, and for many more reasons, this book should be a part of everyone's library."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"The other week, a Seattle bookstore celebrating its 100th anniversary asked me to pick a favorite book to read at their celebration. I thought about five seconds and picked Homage to Catalonia.It's about the Spanish Civil War, which few of us still remember. More importantly, it's about human courage and idealism, and the struggle to make a better world.Orwell's unblinking in his vision. He's scathing toward the Communist apparatchiks who'd rather maintain control of their sectors than win the war against Franco. But he's generous-spirited to all the ordinary volunteers who served on the Republican side--to people who sacrificed for a sense of justice and human dignity.He also gives a glimpse of a world that might be possible--a world of human dignity and mutual aid. Later his vision got darker, even bitter. I read Animal Farm, for all its power, and don't see much hope. But Catalonia, without soft-pedaling any of the downside, embodies that hope in every page--in the portraits of human courage and aspiration. You read it and it makes you want to act.Orwell couldn't have anticipated it, but his same Spanish soil later nurtured a wonderful workers coop called Mondragon. Started in darkest days of Franco by a Spanish priest who'd fought with the Republicans, it now employs 23,000 worker-owners, and has $4 billion of annual exports. So the dream Orwell glimpsed wasn't entirely a mirage after all."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Between the World Wars of the 20th century, there was another devastating conflict on European soil that attracted participants from all over. It was the Spanish Civil War, and while internal dissatisfaction and agitation were breaking out around the country, Spain also became a proving ground for broader political ideologies. In 1937, George Orwell went as a journalist but the socialist siren song of the promise of bringing about a classless society drove him, as well as others from abroad, to enlist. He signed up with P.O.U.M., the party for Marxist unification but quickly learned that there were many similar political parties and labor unions, each with their own woefully unprepared militia, and none were working together against the threat of Franco's military coup and Fascism. He also found the Communists arriving, not to assist revolution but to thwart it.With a clear eye that catches remarkably prophetic insights into the Spanish future, Orwell manages to sort out the chaos of who's who, and the nuances of war that are sometimes awful, sometimes fertile ground for wry humor. Although the voice of the narrative is in memoir form, Orwell was writing only from a distance of 5 or 6 months after he escaped. The book is remarkable for the immediate eye-witness account of the turn of fortunes in Barcelona and the objective sorting out of events that were not being accurately recorded in the media. Orwell expresses deep respect for the native Spanish character, even when some of its inefficient tendencies produce frustration.My edition, which I purchased here last year, but which looks different from the cover above, offers an introduction by critic Lionel Trilling written in 1952, two years after Orwell's death from TB. It, too, is also a historical document now, preserving the sense of the ruling emotions of the era."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"The Spanish Civil War was the defining moment of the 1930s for most European intellectuals. The impact of Franco's attempted coup was comparable to the effect of Pearl Harbour on Americans. For the first time, an illegal Fascist attempt to seize power had been stopped in its tracks by an armed working class. For many intellectuals (like the poet W.H. Auden), the brutality and cynicism often displayed of both sides caused them to swear off politics permanently. Orwell was not one of those - however, it opened his eyes to the dangers of Stalinist Communism as well as Fascism. One can see the seeds of '1984' and 'Animal Farm' in the account of the suppression of the Catalan 'Trotskyists'(so-called) by the Communist-controlled state. This experience made Orwell what he became - a socialist who thought that state-control might solve the problems of poverty, but who feared the tyranny such state-control would bring in its wake. Orwell never seemed to decide which he believed in the more - socialism or intellectual liberty, something which made him describe himself once as a 'Tory Anarchist'. He never came up with a solution to what could be called the key problem of the 20th century, however it is the way he posed the problem that is important. As someone who is the only author in English read by every dissident behind the old Iron Curtain, his place as a defender of freedom is secure. In another sense, this is a great book about the experience of men at war - to me it is as good as any of the memoirs that have come out of Vietnam or World War II like William Herr's 'Despatches' or William Manchester's 'Goodbye, Darkness'. It can be appreciated without understanding the political background at all. Probably among the greatest of Orwell's longer works - its ranks alongside 'Animal Farm' and possibly ahead of '1984'."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"This book is THEE Spanish Civil War book, as far as I'm concerned. I read it with the hopes of getting an idea of what the Spanish Civil War was about, because it was very confusing to me. But it seems that Orwell wrote the book with the purpose of dispelling the confusion. He simply tells his account, and, through his experiences, I was able to learn about the war. I learned what he did in the war, the group he was part of, the other organizations, and what the outcome was for him.There is more to the story than what I am writing about. But what I wrote is good enough for me to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"HOMAGE TO CATALONIA has two narratives. The first discusses the experiences of Orwell from December 1936 through June 1937, when he fought as a common soldier in a socialist (POUM) brigade against the Fascists, recuperated from a nearly fatal sniper's bullet, and then fled Spain as a British bourgeois tourist as POUM soldiers were arrested and imprisoned in Barcelona in a Communist-led purge.This narrative of first-hand experience is absolutely first rate, with Orwell's writing perfectly clear, beautifully paced, and completely riveting. Within this narrative, highlights are Chapter 7, where Orwell participates in an assault on a Fascist redoubt at the front; Chapter 12, where he describes being shot in the neck and its aftermath; and Chapters 13 and 14, where Orwell encounters a nightmare-world of purges, when idealistic men who fought bravely for the Republican cause are arrested and imprisoned for the political affiliations of their military units.Meanwhile, the second narrative of HtC analyzes the contending, but long-dead, politics of PSUC, POUM, FAI, CNT, UGT, and so on. In this case, the considerate Orwell concentrates his analysis in two long chapters (five and eleven). And, he advises readers without interest in the war's labyrinth politics to skip this material, which can be done without diminishing the power of Orwell's story. But in general, what he conveys about this war's politics appears near the start of Chapter 5: \\"As a militiaman one was a soldier against Franco, but one was also a pawn in an enormous struggle that was being fought between two political theories.\\"HtC also works well as a historical document. On page 2, Orwell makes an observation that initially struck me as unpersuasive: \\"I had come to Spain with some notion of writing newspaper articles, but I had joined the militia almost immediately, because at that time and in that atmosphere it seemed the only conceivable thing to do.\\" But thereafter, Orwell communicates the mighty appeal of the Republican cause--its transformation of Spain from a feudal to an egalitarian society--as well as the desire of its adherents to finally limit the spread of relentless Fascism.And a last thought: Three cheers for Georges Kopp!"},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"This is a must-read for persons interested in the Spanish Civil War, and it's a side of Orwell that seems to be rarely discussed. Amazingly, Orwell even manages some humor in the midst of this terrible conflict (unlike Hemingway) as Orwell paints the picture of the 1930s Spain that was about to go from a horrific conflict into a horrific dictatorship that is still the dominant topic in Spain more than 30 years after Franco's death (e.g., the formation of the Basque separatist group ETA was greatly helped by hatred for Franco and his desire to crush all non-Castilian culture in Spain)."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Homage to CataloniaThis book is a great read for anyone out there who likes to read. I normally don't read nonfiction books but this one kept my interest throughout the entire book. Orwell describes things in a way that kept my attention the entire time. He even added some selected humour throughout which seemed to lighten the mood. Overall this is a great book that's worth every penny. I'd say go and read it right now if you're looking for a great read."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"This is one of the most complete and well-thought-out reports of the Spanish Civil War written in the English language. Considering the importance of international fighters in the war (debatable, but certainly in a political sense, noteworthy), and the effect of the war on socialist myth in the latter half of the 20th century, it is a book not to be missed by anyone interested in either World War II, modern socialism, communism, and/or anarchy, Spain, or George Orwell.The personal narrative was wonderful and typically vivid Orwell. His complaints about the politics going on behind the scenes, however, were sometimes dull. He admits (repeatedly) that he is biased and perhaps does not know all of what is going on. However, after reading _The Battle for Spain_, I got the sense that his complaining was actually very revealing from an historical perspective.I read _Homage to Catalonia_ and then _The Battle for Spain_ to get a basic idea about the Spanish Civil War, which I had previously known mainly through punk-rock songs and revolutionary anthem anthologies. I wish I had read them the other way around, though. Although I think this book is indispensable for English-speaking people to understand the Spanish Civil War, it is also a narrow view and very biased (as most works on the subject are). If it were anyone else, my expectations would be lower and I would probably have given it five stars. But compared to other Orwell works (including _Down and Out_) I would give it four."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"This story provides vivid depiction on the Spanish civil war from someone who fought the batlles in the trenches. Like all Orwell books the subject matter is dealt with in an extremly honest manner. The story takes place as a young Orwell follows his idealistic goals in fighting for the Spanish Anachists. The book demonstrats the mess the war evolvs into.What I really appreciate most about Orwell is his candidness and open mindedness. The book starts with his conviction of the rightness of the communists and anarchists and ends with his disgust with the insainity, corruption, and incompetence of the players involved. Sometimes virtue and good intentions alone arnt enough.I would judge this book as one of the best of Orwells works."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"The author's first-hand experience of the egalitarian society created by genuine anarchists in Spain's Civil War, and the valiant efforts to protect it against all kinds of fascism, is a useful counterpoint to the offhand references in American media to \\"anarchists\\" as irrational and immature thugs. I suggest that you find and read this book immediately. ..."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"This is a masterful book about Orwell's service with the anarchists and socialists who attempted (and failed) to defend their egalitarian society from a Fascist rebellion. A third of the book conveys the feel of the trenches: rats, stench, comradery, and shoddy weapons. Much of the book delves into the politics of the time, and though it can be tedious, Orwell tells us about the ideological differences on the Left which helped to defeat their cause. This experience helps to understand his _1984_ and _Animal Farm_, as he witnessed good people abused at the hands of power and politics. Some readers will tire of the politics, but most will find that Orwell's treatment of this fascinating, complex war is exceptionally clear and engaging. The war, and Orwell's book, provide clues to the rest of the century."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"The book is a must read, but I very much disliked this edition.If you love books, as I do, you may want to get one that doesn't say CHPATER as a header of 'every' chapter. This edition feels careless overall, I didn't expect that being sold directly from Amazon."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"George Orwell was one of the century's most honest, decent, and lucid writers about the human element in warfare and poltical revolution. His antitotalitarian novels \\"Animal Farm\\" and \\"1984,\\" which made him famous, grew partly from his acute understanding of the events of World War II and partly from his personal experiences as a Loyalist volunteer in the Spanish Civil War, which is the subject of \\"Homage to Catalonia.\\"Orwell was a Marxist-Leninist in the 1930s, sufficiently committed to risk his own life in battle to help bring about a people's revolution in Spain. This memoir, written in 1937-38 while the war was still on, records how his idealism was battered by the cynical, pro-USSR politics he saw betray the Marxist ideal on the one hand, and the irreducible practicality of most ordinary people that makes it an impossible dream on the other. In the process, Orwell's contempt for the low standards of news-media accuracy only increased. Fans of Fox and CNN, take note.By 1947 Orwell, the Marxist idealist, had become convinced that despite all their shortcomings and failures, the liberal Western democracies had developed the best form of political governance yet possible. Since the 1930s, one might observe, a leavening of socialist thought in these nations has brought about societies that are closer to Marx's egalitarian goals than the inflexible, authoritarian regimes that he directly inspired. The good intentions of \\"people's revolutions\\" are sure to be betrayed by the most ruthless leaders and factions they create. For every socioeconomic wrong they correct, such revolutions inevitably create many more of their own, totalitarian control and denial of due process being among the worst.\\"Homage to Catalonia,\\" written at the moment of Orwell's complete break with the Leninist variety of Marxism, is a model of fair-minded reporting. Anyone interested in the Spanish Civil War, the '30s, revolutionary politics, or even \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls,\\" should read this book.As somebody else mentioned, the fine recent movie \\"Land and Freedom\\" takes its inspiration from Orwell's book and ought to be watched in conjunction with it. Though fitted out with an imaginary love story, it is completely faithful to Orwell's spirit in \\"Homage to Catalonia.\\""},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"I am amazed that some (many?) of the reviewers claim that Orwell remained a socialist after his experience in Spain. I guess they just think it is intellectual to say they read the book, even if they didn't (or apparently any of his other works). This is a great book of this century - do your mind a favor and read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Picture a man in a twilight zone: He has left that uncomfortable and boring, at times deadly experience known as static trench warfare after a sniper's bullet has missed his jugular by a millimeter, and wound up on the run from the local authorities who were now chasing him as a terrorist suspect. Along the way he encounters newspapers which distort the truth and publish outright lies, thus rewriting history, he has to dodge and deceive local police who arrest people against their superiors' wishes and cart them off to secret jails to be eventually shot, and he has to keep his military identity and what unit he belongs to a secret, while keeping his military documents on his person to avoid getting arrested as a deserter. ... this first hand true account was written by a man, who would go on to become a British propagandist during the World War Two and who would lend his name to totalitarian omnipotence, the man is none other than George Orwell."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"George Orwell's \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" is an interesting book describing his experiences fighting in the Spanish Civil War. These experiences are what turned him away from Stalinistic Communism. One thing to remember while reading this book is that while Orwell rejects Stalin and Communism, he only switches camps to Socialism. If you think he becomes Conservative (in the American sense) during this event, then you'll be confused by his world-view in this book. His basic assumptions of how the world should work sound like those of a freshman Political Science student at a radical university (i.e., extremely left-wing) and will leave you scratching your head trying to figure out what he's talking about. So, that's one source of possible confusion while reading the book. Another is inherent in the event itself. This is not a chronicle of two sides fighting. Instead, it's a chronicle of many sides fighting for and against each other (at least Communists, Socialists, Anarchists, the \\"government,\\" and Fascists (Franco)). Frankly, he doesn't doesn't do a very good job of explaining all of it. There's very little background explaining what led to the Revolution and reading many of his pages is like looking at a bowl of alphabet soup: it's just a sea of meaningless acronyms floating around. Another issue is that he doesn't intersperse his chronicling of personal events with his political explanations very well: his political asides go on for scores of pages and totally disrupt the flow of the book. So, even though it's a very interesting book, I have to subtract a star for the technical implementation and give it merely an OK 3 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"I reread this book after decades of having first picked it up and I think that I got a little more of it than at first because since that time I learned more of Stalinism from reading Solshenitzin and Robert Conquest (and if you haven't read those books, do so!).A lot of rubbish has been written about the Spanish Civil War, almost all of it by leftists who have caricatured it: that it was a noble struggle of the Spanish people who tried to throw off the yokes of oppression and establish a decent life, but their idealism was stifled by Fascism, Mussolini, Hitler and the reactionary Catholic Church, yada, yada, yada. The other side, though it is seldom heard, is likewise a caricature.Homage to Catalonia shows that it was a highly complex, fluctuating, maelstrom. Written in the first person from someone who repeatedly---and refreshingly---warns the reader that his perspective was limited, and possibly biased, Orwell served as a volunteer in the Republican side on the Aragon/Catalonia front in the static, filthy, trenches (he did so, motivated by the leftist propaganda in England). At that time, each of the political parties, all of them leftists, had their own militia and he ended up in the POUM militia; it was being deliberately starved of arms by the Stalinists who were preparing to exterminate all of the members. Orwell ended up being shot at the front and on returning to the home front, he quickly learned that the Stalinists had began to portray the POUM as a Fascist entity, and/or a Trotskyite entity and thousands of arrests were being made and the POUM headquarters occupied; many of his friends and his comrade in arms who had been fighting the Fascists were arrested and shot as being Fascists. Ultimately, he escaped, thanks to the help of the British consul.Once in Britain, he was incensed at the printed lies that the leftist press put out explaining the pogrom of the POUM. He deals at length on this and this alone is worth reading when you think about our modern main stream media (which repeatedly claims to be impartial and professional).Throughout, Orwell has an affinity for the Spanish people, although he predicts that no matter how the civil war ends, it will turn out to be a disaster for the people. His sympathies are strictly on the side of the working class.Incidentally, there was a very strong Anarchist movement within Spain which likewise had its own flag and militia and which Orwell credits with having saved the Republic in the beginning of the struggle. It was responsible for the destruction of the churches and the massacre of priests (Spain was one of three countries with a very strong Anarchist presence, the others being pre-Soviet Russia and pre-Fascist Italy). I wish that he had dwelt a little more on them."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"A must read for Orwell fans who may not have read this work. This is the book that lead to Animal Farm and 1984."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"This first-hand account of Orwell's time fighting in the Spanish Civil War is a good primary source in its own right, if approached with caution, but also givens some vivid insight in to why he approached his later writings the way he did. Enjoyable read most of the time, but a bit heavy on philosophy in some parts."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"My husband and I moved to Barcelona earlier this year and decided to start reading classic novels about Spain and Catalunya. I just started reading it and can't give my opinion, but my husband absolutely loved it. It's a little silly, but he was giddy about it. He read it every chance he got, and finished it within 3 days. He's a quick-read, and I'm not. He's been telling all of our friends here about it and we plan to pass it on to them when I finished."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"I read Orwell's memoir in preparation for (and during) my second visit to Barcelona. Orwell is so English in his outlook, and clearly loves the people of Catalonia. The book is an excellent review of many of the issues involved in the Spanish Civil war, and how people's fates were decided so clearly by expediency and political whim. Having read _Animal Farm_ and _1984_ as required reading in some prehistoric educational experience, it was refreshing to be inside the head of a much more personal Orwell than I remembered. It was also particularly meaningful to read about places with which I was becoming increasingly familiar. The book was written before the end of the Civil War, and published around the time of Orwell's death in 1950, but it feels so very much in the present. I would place this little book and Zafon's _Shadow of the Wind_ on the \\"must read\\" list for anyone either planning to visit or recently returned from Barcelona."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Those who seek total and undiluted dominion over others understand that people are susceptible to the language -- but not necessarily the substance -- of noble ideals. In Spain, those who heralded the noblest ideals turned out to be the most brutal of totalitarians.The language of noble ideals is also present in modern political culture. Orwell's observations are as important now as they were 60 years ago."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Very well written and very entertaining. One of the best Biographies/Memoirs I have read."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Orwell's book is a chronicle of the Spanish Civil War through the author's eyes, but it is far more interesting as a meditation on war, politics, journalism, and idealism. Orwell's real strength lies in candid self-analysis, and his experiences sitting in the miserable trenches of Catalonia and witnessing political squabbles in Barcelona are vaulted from their particular dated circumstances and given universal significance. This is not a work of genius, but it is a personal and very human look at war, probably more relevant now than it was when it was written. Spain has changed considerably, as has the art of war, but human nature in times of conflict is very much the same."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Unlike 1984 or Animal Farm there is a constant upbeat current in this revealing account of his participation in the Spanish Civil War. Although a very political affair, Orwell's participation is not tied to the tenets of one particular party as much as his desire to do good in the world by helping to stop Fascism. So he brings his wife to Spain, enlists in the militia, is sent to the front, wounded, chased by the police, engaged in street fighting gun battles between different political parties that are on the same side of the war. An amazing account so very well told. There is a chapter in the middle that has to do with the complexities of the political parties at the time, at the very end of the previous chapter Orwell writes that if you are not interested in the politics to skip the chapter, so I skipped the chapter, preferring to stay with the adventure story. It is an adventure story, a war story, a comedy, a sad tragedy, but heartfelt and so real. Great book if you like good writing, or war stories, or politics or Spain. Above all, a well told story made more interesting that when Orwell finishes he is still assuming Franco would be defeated, which was not the case at all."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"George Orwell, in his usual &quot;live free or die&quot; mentality, tells his personal experiences during the Spanish Civil War. Although, interesting, it was, at times boring.One of the most ironic points Orwell explains in the book is how the USSR essentially sold out its &quot;fellow socialists&quot; in pursuit of its own best interests. You'll have to read to understand. And you should if you are at all interested in the Spanish Civil War."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"As a Spaniard, I have been deeply impressed by this book. My grandparents, who had to struggle for life during this period of Spanish history and somehow managed to survive, had told me many tales about the unjustice, suffering and madness of this war. When I first read this book, I could feel the same fears, the same confusion, the same pain.The book is superbly written and is really entertaining, despite the sad facts that it represents. I found especially interesting the description of the Barcelona fightings, as well as the detailed account of trench war. The two appendices are very enlightening regarding the fight among the various political organizations and the evidence that the Spanish republican government was completely abandoned by the rest of Western governments (something that we Spaniards had to suffer from for almost 40 years!)This book is a must-read!"},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"I have read quite a few of Orwell's books, but this one has to be my favourite. The reason being that it is one of the easiest ways to understand war. It tells it's tale from the point of view of someone who lived through it. It showed the high points, and the low points. What really makes this book stand out is its human quality. Orwell was not a soldier in the traditional sense,he just felt compelled to fight faschism, and that is what makes this book so special. Another aspect of this book that i liked so much was it's journalistic qualities. I suggest everyone reads this book."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"I say insightful because I, of course, had read 1984 and Animal Farm in high school. I knew about Orwell's participation in the Spanish Civil War with the POUM/\\"Trotskyite\\" sympathzing Independent Labour Party and that it influenced his work in both of the aforementioned works. But hearing it from Orwell's own words, his description of the Barcelona May Days and the reaction to it in the international press, of the Communist Party led suppression of the POUM in Catalonia, etc... All made the book very insightful. If you've read 1984 and/or Animal Farm, this is a must read to completely understand those books."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"I consider 1984 among my favourite books. I also enjoyed Animal Farm. Given my previous experience with Orwell as an author, I was really excited to buy Homage to Catalonia to read during my trip to Spain. In the end, though, I'm not the right audience for this book.I enjoyed the references to a region I was visiting, and I was able to visualize some of the references to specific places in Barcelona. I thought a comment he made about the Spanish early on the novel was characteristic Orwell and very insightful. Still, I didn't end up finishing this book. I don't read a lot of non fiction because it ends up feeling repetitive to me. I thought this would be okay as it was somewhat biographical in nature, but Orwell focused much more on things like weaponry than his fellow soldiers.I made it about halfway through this book before I set it aside for something else. Orwell has a strong narrative voice, and I think this book is well written. I think people who are interested in war and journalistic writing would likely enjoy this book, but I prefer a more human element to what I'm reading. I'm sure if I stuck with it I would get more into Orwell's personal growth over the course of this war, but I can't bring myself to slog through pages describing military attacks and weaponry with so little dialogue. Orwell's style saves this from being as dry as I find a lot of non fiction, but it's not enough to help me resist the lure of my many other books waiting for my attention."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"As with most everything Orwell, this book will not have you leafing ahead impatiently to find out if and when things get good. If there is one book you read on the Spanish Civil War (and I bet it will be only one), this should be it."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"George Orwell's HOMAGE TO CATALONIA is an example of prose writing from a master. Orwell's memoirs of his experience in the Spanish Civil War shows not only good writing but also knowledge and clear thinking. This reviewer considers HOMAGE TO CATALONIA to be Orwell's best nonfiction work. Readers would be well advised to read this book to get a better understanding of how political power actually works.Orwell volunteered to fight with the POUM units which were Marxist and Anarchist. Orwell admits this selection was by chance, and he never regretted it. Orwell was motivated his opposition to Fascism and idealism.Orwell begins this book by impressions upon his arrival to Spain at the beginning of the civil war between the Spanish Republic and Franco's Phalangists or as some called them fascists. Orwell's description of Spain during the civil war (1936-1939)undermines the false views presented by journalists too lazy or too cowardly to reveal events of this important episode in 20th century Spanish history.Orwell's description of the Spanish anarchists is an examplar of descriptive writing. Orwell is also very graphic in describing battle conditions and lack of supplies. Yet, as serious as a writer as Orwell is, he shows a pleasant sense of humor in this book which is not detected in his other books.The most important part of this book is Orwell's explanation of the reasons for the failure of the Spanish \\"Left.\\" Lazy historians and journalists present the Spanish Civil War as a political brawl between Fascism and Democracy (the political approval word for dull minded political pundits and lazy hsitorians). The anarchists in the Catalonia region of Spain had an actual revolution whereby the poor actually gained a degree of self respect and independence however brief. The future enemies of Fascism, the French and especially the British and the Soviets, undermined the Spanish anarchists. The cowardly British leaders were afraid of losing markets while the Soviets were afraid of losing possible allies in any showdown with the Germans.One thing that Stalin and his advisors were afraid of was the reaction in Western Europe witnessing a supposedly Communist Revoltion in Russia and another one in Spain in Western Europe. Stalin sent agents and equipment into Spain \\"with strings attached.\\" The POUM anarchists and supporters were finally accused of betraying the revolution and subjected to Stalinoid purges to eliminate their political influence. Stalin helped the capitalists and conservative Spanish in hopes of future political considerations, and this scheme worked very well. Orwell was one of very few who first had a coherent understanding of the political climate.Orwell has some interesting remarks for jingoist journalists who never fight but are \\"war wimps\\" who aid abet war without actually getting close to angry gun fire \\"unless for the briefest of propaganda tours.\\" Orwell certainly was no coward as he fought in the front lines and was seriously wounded.Orwell also expressed his profound respect for the Spaniards whether they Stalinist agents looking for him or even \\"Fascist troops.\\" He commented that his experience was that the Spanish men were always gentlemen first and maybe communists or fascists second.While Orwell was disillusioned about Big Communism from his experiences in the Spanish Civil War, he never lost his idealism and his political sympathy for socialism as a political ideal as opposed to socialist or communist poliitcs. Lional Trilling's introduction to this book makes this very clear. Those who read ANIMAL FARM and 1984 can easily understand where Orwell got his inspiration for HOMAGE TO CATALONIA. Orwell's critics who accused him of not reporting outrages committed by the Spanish \\"leftists\\" obviously did not read this book very carefully. Orwell states that he was aware of such outrages, and Orwell is also clear that this book was based only on his experiences in the Catalonia region of Spain. Orwell bluntly stated he could not speak for other areas of Spain.As stated in the first paragraph of this review, HOMAGE TO CATALONIA is well worth reading not only for political insight but also for masterful prose style. Orwell gives his readers a lesson in political reality which should make the careful reader and even careful reader think. This reivewer further advises the reader to read Lionel Trilling's introduction before starting the book. Two good companion volumes to Orwell's HOMAGE TO CATALONIA are THE SPANISH LABYRINTH and the SPANISH COCKPIT. Together these three books give the reader a first rate education of the Spanish Civil War which undermines the superficial popular history of this war."},{"Title":"Homage to Catalonia","review":"Book is brand new!

This is the best book on Lichens and well worth the price."},{"Title":"Lichens of North America","review":"\\"Lichens of North America\\" may be the ultimate tour de force in botanical publishing, and comes with blurbs by Edward O. Wilson, Lynn Margulis and David Ehrenfeld. The lucky authors are Irwin M. Brodo, Sylvia Duran Sharnoff and Stephen Sharnoff.The book starts off with about 100 pages of general information on lichens, these bizarre double organisms which seem to grow pretty much everywhere in nature. The general chapters are sufficiently popularized to be useful and interesting to the general reader. The rest of this work is a super-encyclopaedia of lichen species found in the United States and Canada, featuring range maps and...wait for it...high quality photos, all in colour?! It has keys, too, and could therefore be used as a field guide. However, I doubt you could bring an 800-page book with you on a field excursion. Try the mini-van!\\"Lichens of North America\\" is a kind of HBW of the lichen world (HBW = Handbook of the Birds of the World). What a shame the lichens themselves can't appreciate it! I admit I was fascinated by the sometimes quite bizarre specimens shown in this volume. And yes, I recognized the reindeer lichens. Some of them grow in Florida?!Well, what more can I say.

It has everything: pictures, check; identification keys, you betcha; general introduction to lichens, of course; uses for lichens, no problem; and the list goes on. If you are just getting into the world of lichens, or are one of the world's leading experts, this is a book that satisfies the desires of anyone wishing to have a reference to lichens.I strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in or studying lichens in North America. It could make a great coffee-table book for conversation starters. The uses for a book this well-written, and this well put-together are endless.If you are debating between two books on lichens in north America, buy this book. It does not disappoint."},{"Title":"Lichens of North America","review":"As a retired Forester, I am always looking for new things to study and understand. During my professional and personal time in the forests, I noticed lichens but never appreciated them and I knew far too little about their characteristics. During my University years in training, lichens were not recognized as an important component of an ecosystem. They seemed to stand alone as a curious set of plant life, mysterious but more or less useless. These plant forms simply hung around the limbs and stems of trees, or they lived on rocks and sometimes soils and provided a little color accent to the forest I was helping to manage. Irwin Brodo, et al, in the beautifully illustrated tome, The Lichens of North America, help to counter this misconception of unimportance. Over 795 pages of relatively easy to read material, they discuss what lichens are, how they grow and spread, what they have been used for, and review their value in the assessment of air quality. The authors guide the reader through keys that can help interested people identify the lichens that grow around them. The book is beautifully illustrated with hundreds of color photographs and pen and ink drawings. Some small knowledge and background in botany will help the reader to more quickly understand the material but I hazard to guess that any reader can use this reference as a stand alone guide to some of the strangest and most interesting plants on Earth. Anyone who wants to collect and study these beautiful, unknown plants can use this book to advance their own study. As in any publication of this size, there are a few typos and errors but corrections are posted openly on the Web and it is easy to make changes in your own copy. This is one volume that I would recommend to any one who wants to learn more about lichens. The book contains an excellent bibliography. It is well bound and heavy, high quality paper is used. The signatures are sewn together so there is little chance that pages will ever fall out with normal use. It is both a beautiful and helpful book. If lichens are of any interest to you, get this volume for your library."},{"Title":"Lichens of North America","review":"It's one of the top 3 books I've seen about lichen, treating largely about taxonomy, wich is rare to see.

As my lichen photography collection grew,I wanted to identify the lichen species I had photographed, so I did some research. I returned over and over again to a website that highlighted the chapters and images in \\"Lichen's of North America.\\" The book seemed an expensive investment for an amateur like myself, but, after reviewing other books on lichens at the library and in bookstores, I realized this book has no equal. Inevitably, I placed my order. When the book arrived, I was first surprised at how BIG it was. Hundreds of four color images jumped off the pages, each a work of art. Most importantly, the text is fascinating and easy to understand, even for a non-scientist. I read the first 14 chapters over the weekend. I was amazed by the important role lichens play in the biodiversity of life. It opened my eyes to an understudied and little understond life form that has a profound influence on the past and future of our planet. I recommend it to anyone who has any interest in biodiversity, natural succession, preserving the environment and nature in general. You will see Lichen in a whole new light!"},{"Title":"Lichens of North America","review":"At last! This book will open the door to the world of lichens for many interested botanists, conservationists, naturalists -- and prospective lichenologists. I had high expectations of this book, and they were surpassed by far: excellent scientific information, presented in a manner accessible to both the professional and the amateur, and extremely beautiful too. The introductory chapters are excellent, and the &quot;flora&quot; portion has excellent keys, range maps, text, and wonderful photographs. This book is a bargain at the list price.

The photographs are a naturalist's dream; they show the salient features of the lichens, but, at the same time, they are frequently works of art displaying the beauty and charm of both the subjects and their settings.The text escapes both of the usual faults of this type of book. It is neither so technical as to confuse and bore the non-specialist nor so superficial as to diminish the book's usefulness for the botanically sophisticated. Brodo's writing is clear, concise and graceful; a joy to read.The organization of the book is also all one could wish for, with a generous natural history section leading into clear, workable keys and descriptions of enough of the North American lichen species to satisfy any generalist and most specialists.All one is left to wish for is a paperback version to toss in the car."},{"Title":"Lichens of North America","review":"I haven't been this excited about a natural history book in a long time.

This is by far one of the most comprehensive guides to lichens in North America available and can also translate to other lichen guides throughout the world. This has been a fantastic addition to my personal library and I still pull it out and read it at home. Since I also collect and identify lichens for my classes, it is often used. I purchased three copies for my students to use during my lichen identification unit at my school. It is easy to use once you develop mastery of the terminology (helps that I'm a science teacher). I have a number of field guides and this ranks among the best. Although not useful for field work due to its size and weight, you can easily use it at home. The author obviously demonstrates his mastery of lichenology and identification techniques throughout the book. Updates can also be found on the book's website as science is an ever-changing field.

Beautifully illustrated, readable, and very complete, it is probably the only work like it on the subject of lichenology. All the main groups and species get covered, and although this is a very technical area, it's written to be accessible to the non-specialist as well.I had the great fortune to take lichenology from the late, great Dr. Harry Thiers, and the year I took the class (1984), it was the only lichenology class offered at a college in the U.S., which gives you some idea of how esoteric a subject lichenology is even for botanists, who are used to working more or less in obscurity and not having their area get the attention that other more glamorous areas of macrobiology get, such as mammology and ornithology, which are far more popular with the greater public.

In this sense, we are all victims of \\"the machine\\"--The Matrix style--where people in global peripheries (from where high-quality resources are extracted) as subjected to exploitation at the hands hands of people in global centers (to where the resources go).Hornborg uses the machine as a means of examining and critiquing industrialization as a process of converting high quality matter/energy into low-quality, but high-priced products. Because these are high-entropy products, they require much more material/energetic inputs in order to operate and sustain them. Thus, they require \\"feeding,\\" and that is the purpose of peole in global centers. Like that quote from \\"Fight Club\\"--\\"The things you own end up owning you.\\" In a sense, \\"machines\\" take on a life of their own as they have power over us and we literally worship them as inherently \\"productive.\\"I don't think Hornborg is a luddite--technology isn't inherently evil. It is more a problem of concentration and distribution. However, unless we reach an enlightened position about the true nature of industrialization and global resource transfer, machines will continue to own us, and may push us toward the brink of self-destruction.2) The book also challenges the reader. Hornborg makes the excuse early on that it is inherently challenging because it aims to construct a whole new worldview to replace the reader's current worldview. This is partially true. However the book is also challenging because how, and for whom, it is written. It is NOT an easy read. It is fairly non-linear, uses many terms that will be obscure to anyone outside of the many fields from which Hornborg draws. He doesn't include a glossary or define many of the technical words he uses, which is a big no no IMO. So keep a dictionary close by. Be patient and be prepared to work hard to extract meaning from what he writes--it is often like piecing together a puzzle where no single part makes much sense until you can gain a sense of the total image. In the end, I think the struggle is worth it--it is actually a very intuitive and even visual argument. I can see an animated diagram in my head that embodies his argument.But I also think he COULD have written it to be more accessible--there are many sentences that could easily be unpacked. Overall, it might have made the book 100 pages longer, but overall a much smoother read.I hope his argument gains steam and more people start writing in this vein (albeit more accessibly). The implications are vast, especially among all the trendy and often-meaningless talk about \\"sustainability.\\""},{"Title":"The Power of the Machine: Global Inequalities of Economy, Technology, and Environment","review":"Before reading this book, I had read several first-rate books dealing with environmental issues; books that tended to approach the subject from a biological (ecological) point of view. Although they were very useful and I learned a lot from them, I thought that they largely overlooked human/social factors, or treated them superficially. I intuitively felt that any analysis of sustainability (or whatever you want to call it) that was not also firmly based in the social sciences and the humanities was incomplete. In short, I decided to keep looking.I first encountered Alf Hornborg in a recent issue of an academic journal devoted to biosemiotics. The content and clarity of his article there so impressed me that I searched for more information about him on the Internet, discovered that he had written this book, and took the chance of ordering it. The book is all I had hoped for, and then some. I believe this author has seen more deeply into our environmental predicament than anyone I have yet encountered.Hornborg's main thesis, as stated in the introduction, is that we are &quot;caught in a collective illusion about the nature of modern technology. We do not recognize that what ultimately keeps our machines running are global terms of trade. The power of the machine is not _of_ the machine, but of the asymmetric structures of exchange of which it is an expression.&quot;He goes on to state:&quot;My argument represents a conjunction of perspectives from the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. It is polemical in relation to most conventional discourse on 'sustainable development,' ecological economics, and similar topics in suggesting that solutions to our ecological predicament will have to be more profound and radical than is usually envisioned in the environmental debate. I argue for a _defamiliarization_ of our conventional conceptions of technology and development, that is, a fundamental distancing from the cultural categories through which the modern economic system operates, and in terms of which most policy negotiations are conducted. Above all, I argue that we must recognize the global, _distributional_ aspects of development, technology, and environmental issues. The intellectual ancestry of these ideas can be traced to the underexplored interfaces between world system theory, political ecology, ecological economics, economic anthropology, fetishism theory, and semiotics.&quot;The heart of the book, in my opinion, is in chapters 8 through 11. Chapters 9 and 10 are particularly outstanding. Rather than try to summarize the material, which would be hard to do in this brief space, I will close with some brief excerpts from chapter 10, which should impart some of the flavor of what is here:&quot;Romanticist critiques of Western rationality have a long history, but studies in human ecology seem now to be in a position to articulate a _rational_ critique of that rationality. The contextualist position is not romanticism or mysticism but a sober recognition of the limitations of totalizing institutions and knowledge systems. Because of the sheer complexity and specificity of ecosystemic interrelationships and fluctuations, it is not unreasonable to expect that optimal strategies for sustainable resource management are generally best defined by local practitioners with close and long-term experience of these specificities, and with special stakes in the outcome. Yet it is clear that actual management strategies are today generally informed by entirely different sets of conditions.&quot;...&quot;Metaphor is a mode of knowing that positions the human subject by _evoking_ non-objectifiable inner states associated with specific forms of practice. The significance of metaphor for the contextualist argument thus lies in its capacity to activate tacit, practical knowledge based on experience of highly specific, local conditions. This position accommodates Ingold's proposition that cultural constructions of the environment are secondary to practical action ('the practitioner's way of knowing'), while recognizing the capacity of such constructions to codify and reinforce a specific, ecological _habitus_, not least in the transmission of such dispositions between generations. A metaphorical 'cognized model' does not so much encode ecological information as provide 'cues' for the activation of specific, practical repertoires appropriated in the context of action.&quot;...&quot;The discussion on 'traditional ecological knowledge' and 'traditional resource management' is thus intrinsically paradoxical to the extent that it hopes for an appropriation and application of local knowledge by the very modernist framework by which such knowledge is continually being eclipsed. In advocating what he calls 'epistemological decentralization,' Banuri recognizes that an increasing contextuality of knowledge will render 'the expert, trained in universal sciences, an anachronism.' Clearly, an 'expert' in an abstractly conceived field of 'local knowledge' is a contradiction in terms. But this paradox, of course, is a pervasive aspect of the anthropological condition. We can engage in a meta-discourse on knowledge, but in terms of concrete expertise we can at best become awkward apprentices to specific, local practitioners.Rather than approach indigenous knowledge as another 'resource' to be tapped, ecological anthropology might concentrate on the sociocultural contexts that allow ecologically sensitive knowledge systems to evolve and persist over time. There are reasons to believe that the best conditions for such local calibrations occur precisely when they are _not_ being subjected to attempts at encompassment by totalizing frameworks of one kind or another. In recognizing implicit and inextricable local meanings as the very stuff of ecological resilience, a critical inquiry into human ecology might begin to confront the agents of destruction by modifying its own ambition to encompass.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Power of the Machine: Global Inequalities of Economy, Technology, and Environment","review":"I'm basing my criticism on the extensive excerpts from the book in the review below mine (An outstanding book, January 9, 2002 By Michael S. Mcintyre).If the best chapters of the book are so so replete with stupefying technocratic gibberish then it isn't, in fact, a good book -- no matter if the actual ideas would otherwise have merit.Einstein once commented that when he was very young he mistakenly thought that difficulty in understanding an author meant that the subject was extremely complex or the author was exceptionally brilliant. When he got older he realized that, in fact, a difficult to understand writer is simply a bad (or arrogant) writer. I think he demonstrated his point pretty well by conveying so much of his theories of relativity to lay persons in written form. If Einstein could do it, what is this author's excuse? He has none.The author of this particular book may, indeed, have some good, original ideas but what is indisputable is that THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK IS FUNDAMENTALLY INCOMPETENT AS A WRITER. I probably would have bought the book but my time is valuable and so I will pass. If the ideas are worthwhile perhaps someone who can write could summarize the book for the rest of us?"},{"Title":"The Power of the Machine: Global Inequalities of Economy, Technology, and Environment","review":"This is a compilation of academic papers not intended for the lay reader.The numerous embedded citations are distracting. It is written in sociological jargon rather than English.

Mary Heather Elizabeth Livingstone","review":"Mary Heather Elizabeth Livingstone is a child star from the very beginning, but the pressure of being on the stage gives her a craving for chocolate covered cherries--a whole box per night, which she keeps under her pillow. She becomes too heavy for her parts, and falls from grace, growing up to be an overweight but content woman, even without being a star. At last, she goes back to the stage, to rave reviews.It is not clear to me what the author is trying to say in this book. Is it that it's okay to be overweight, and that you can still be content? If so, there is no commentary on the crass behavior and shallowness of the world of show business. Young children 5 and under don't usually have the framework to judge the behavior of characters in books, and may instead simply imitate that behavior.Another complaint I had is that the appearance of the chocolate covered cherries every night is not explained. Mary H. E. is not old enough to pull that off without help, and what is to be said of someone who would enter into that kind of arrangement with this child? Perhaps this is too literal, but the road to eating disorders is paved with good intentions.The art and surface story are pleasant enough, and I appreciate the message of accepting yourself as you are, but I was not inspired by this book."},{"Title":"SWEDISH Teach Yourself Books","review":"Although this book has been out of print for years, it should still be obtained by any serious student of Swedish. The opening section on pronunciation is outstanding; clear, well-written, and not too technical. The rest of the book is essentially a grammar text with exercises, so for more practical information the interested learner would need to get a more modern book like the newer \\"Teach Yourself Swedish\\" or \\"Colloquial Swedish\\". However, for traditional \\"grammar and translation\\", this book is still useful. I got my copy (1975 printing) many years ago when it was selling for [money]."},{"Title":"SWEDISH Teach Yourself Books","review":"Back in the day, language courses in the Teach Yourself line made many more demands on the student than they do nowadays, expecting one to be able to learn a foreign language the same way one mastered one's schoolboy Latin. R.J. McClean's Swedish course exemplifies this era.Instead of basing the course on a series of chapters dealing with some particular part of day-to-day life (ordering in a restaurant, going to the doctor, asking directions) like contemporary Teach Yourself courses, McClean has twenty-three chapters each dedicated to a grammatical category. In chapters one and two, he gives you the entire world of Swedish noun paradigms. There are sentences for translation after each long flood of conjugations and declensions, but no dialoguesIt is pretty obvious that with a course like this on its own, you'll never get beyond a passive reading command of Swedish. For learning conversational Swedish, I'd recommend Gladis Hirt'sSwedish: An Elementary Grammar-Readeras your main introductory textbook. Stay far away from the latest incarnation of TY's Swedish, which goes to the opposite extreme from old TY courses, and gives you tonnes of idiomatic dialogue with little grammar to help you make your own sentences.But even if it is no good as a primary textbook, McClean's old course does tell you a lot about the language that you are not likely to see in friendlier textbooks. For example, he gives the old plural endings for Swedish verbs, now archaic but likely to occasionally be encountered in literary texts. There are a number of Swedish proverbs and idioms here, enabling the student to better understand stock components of colloquial speech. Some of the translation exercises, especially those from English into Swedish, are quite rigorous and beneficial, though there is no answer key and one would need to ask a native speaker for corrections.I disagree with another reviewer who praises the chapter on pronunciation. True, this is enormously detailed (35 pages), but nowadays there are so many Swedish pronunciation cassettes and CDs out there that one no longer has to work through a printed phonetic transcription like in these old courses. Also, it gives no information at all about the pronunciation of Finland Swedish, which this student at Helsingfors Universitet would have liked."},{"Title":"The Book of Memories (Jewish Latin America)","review":"A moving testimony, superbly translated.

Good, bordering on great if but for the end.The first few hundred pages of the novel focus mainly on the alien changeling's initially fumbling attempts to be human. It uses myriad identities over the span of a century to better understand humanity, but also to find out exactly what it truly is. To a lesser degree, Haldeman tackles the \\"chameleon\\" who is no less intelligent but is motivated by more primal, baser instincts.The final part of the novel focuses both on the key to unlocking the changeling's and chameleon's identities as well as on the changeling's final lesson in what makes human beings unique. The problem, as other reviewers have noted, is that the denouement seems more than a bit rushed... almost a stock HEA ending, in fact. Nevertheless, I enjoyed Haldeman's excellent writing: his attention to detail and well fleshed-out characters."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Joe Haldeman first achieved fame with The Forever War, a story that won both the Hugo and Nebula awards as the best SiFi book of the year in 1975. This was not long after he returned from Viet Nam where as a draftee he won (as he puts it) \\"a Purple Heart and other standard medals.\\" That book described a fuzzy kind of war where the fighters hardly knew what was going on (Viet Nam?).In this book, about his 28th if I've counted correctly, the story is one of two Aliens who have only dim memories of an ancient artifact that has just been brought up from the sea. The human characters are human and very well developed. The aliens are quite different from you've seen in other books.A delightful read by a master of his craft."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"The strengths of Joe Haldeman's near-future SF novel include complex characterizations of the chameleon and the changeling, a Golden-Age-esque mysterious artifact, and some great humor. I do not normally care for shape-shifters, but Haldeman somehow pulls this off, with a quasi-scientific approach, which, while perhaps not biologically feasible, was \\"believable enough\\" for me to suspend disbelief.The weakness, overall, are the two-dimensional human characters in 2019 who're trying to uncover the artifact's mysteries. I found myself wanting to breeze through these parts of the books in order to see what the chameleon or the changeling would do next.That said, the strengths outweigh the weakness, though, and I'll give this one 4-stars for its humor, its page-turning prose, and the tantalizing and chilling exploits of the chameleon. It's an anti-hero you just want to learn more and more about.This was the first Haldeman novel I've read, and it was good enough to make me want to read more."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"As a writer myself, I am familiar with the problem of writing a beloved story only to realize suddenly that you need an ending in order to meet a deadline. The rushed endings that come out of such a process are rarely satisfying, and CAMOUFLAGE is no different.The story is about two alien immortal shapeshifters stuck on early for a large chunk of human history. One spends all its time as a player in history, while the other dips in and out of history merely to learn how to be human. Now, the human race has discovered a mysterious object at the bottom of the sea and is racing to find its secrets, which are tied up with one of the two aliens.The prose is well-written and deeply involving. I found myself unable to put the book down. The characters are strong, and the plot is fun - despite jumps back and forth thru time which some readers might find difficult to follow in spots. But then comes the ending where two titanic forces come together and... it is all resolved in about the space of 10 pages without any satisfying confrontation.Read this book if you love the process of story and character. Avoid it if the ending is all that matters to you."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"I never read anything by this author but I did like this little book. What a fun read. It's a pity Haldeman wasn't able to write a credible and interesting ending. He wraps things up hastily in a poor conclusion to an otherwise very well written and entertaining novel."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"It's hard to find great Sci fi these days. I thought this was an exciting and imaginative story. I gave it to my father for Christmas and he was also very impressed."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Before reading this book, I had read \\"The Forever War\\" and \\"The Guardian\\" and was surprised to see that one author could turn out such diametrically different novels. \\"Camouflage\\" was another surprise; although the straightforward, unembellished writing and the fast pacing gave a familiar flavor to the book, the story and characters were wonderfully original.I was immediately drawn into \\"Camouflage\\" because the story focuses on the idea of shape-shifting, a concept by which I've long been fascinated. Haldeman displays the kind of analytical curiosity that is the mark of all the best science fiction writers. (After all, don't all good sci-fi novels start with a simple idea: what if...?) He thoroughly explores the nuts and bolts of the two shapeshifters' existences: what are they made of? How do they work? What does it feel like? Can they reproduce with humans? The result is remarkably plausible and solid.Haldeman also shows off a mastery of character development that makes the novel irresistable. Unlike most stories, in which you meet \\"the good guy\\" on page 1, Haldeman keeps you guessing: who do you sympathize with? Who should you root for? Enough bread crumbs are dropped that clever readers will have a good time guessing at the outcomes, but the foreshadowing is never too blunt.As other readers have remarked, the ending is like passing through a small town in North Dakota: don't blink or you might miss it. I found myself not minding this too much--but I'd love to read a sequel!"},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"The first thing that really caught my attention was the writing style. The beginning of every book is like that first drink. You are getting in perspective about the time, place, and characters who will participate in the story. This part of most books is usually tedious, but necessary. However, in this book the author writing style shields you away from any possible tediousness. It hooks up your interest right after the second page and bombards you with details at a tremendous speed. You just can't stop reading. At the same time the author manages to structure his book with the perfect balance between grammatical complexity and grammatical simplicity. Essentially, he does not make it more grammatically complex than necessary. This results in a book that flows smoothly, letting your mind to fly through the story in a totally effortless fashion. Some writers out there bear the misconception that an extremely complex and elaborated grammatical structure will make their books more sophisticated and worthy. How wrong they are.The book indirectly touches philosophical issues and amazing possible paths for evolution in other planets. In my opinion the most impressive element in this book is that it let you look at the whole human phenomena from a whole different perspective, from the other side of alien eyes. This book develops an impressive idea and presents it to you in one of the smoothest and most comprehensive narratives I have ever come across.Starting right now with \\"The engines of God\\". This is one of the tedious ones, but it still can turn out great."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"This exciting, but ultimately disappointing, suspense novel suffers, perhaps, from the weight of its ambitions. An occasionally clever spin on the good-alien-versus-bad-alien theme, \\"Camouflage\\" sometimes seems to aspire to the level of a psychological thriller, imagining life on our strange planet through the eyes of an alien able to adopt any of a number of forms (from a shark to floor tiles) and faced with two threats: the comic, feeble foibles of human civilization and the pure evil of a second extraterrestrial life form that hides among humans. And they all--changeling, chameleon, humans--converge on Samoa to solve the mystery of an impenetrably solid artifact of celestial origins found on the ocean floor.The central failing of the novel is that it boasts a plot that pivots on the actions and reactions of the various characters, but we never learn much about them beyond their various exploits. The better portions of the novel are told from the point of view of the changeling, who, arriving as a blank slate, eventually mimics humans and is decidedly \\"moral\\"; but the explanation of its motives or instincts or development is as lacking as its DNA. Similarly, the chameleon-alien is singularly, absolutely wicked, but it ultimately remains an unfathomable being with a voracious appetite for death and destruction. The premise is a given: changeling good, chameleon bad. And the humans who populate and work at the excavation site are nearly indistinguishable (and this lack of individuality becomes a bit of an issue when Haldeman reveals his tidy plot \\"twist\\" at the end--which will be all too predictable very early on if you've been paying attention).I finished reading \\"Camouflage\\" about three months ago, and though I recall enjoying it (and there are a few scenes I found unexpectedly funny), I was surprised how few of the story's details I remembered when I sat down to write this review. It's ultimately popcorn fare, a soft-sci-fi/thriller/horror novel of the kind you'd expect from Michael Crichton, or a slightly more cerebral, made-for-TV version of \\"Alien v. Predator.\\" If you're looking for a bit of pleasure to pass a rainy weekend--something light that won't require too much metaphysical musing--you can certainly do a lot worse than this zippy little escapist adventure."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"In Camouflage, Haldeman postulates two very different aliens. Both can blend in with humans. One retains its innate bloodthirstyness for thousands of years. The other starts out utterly amoral, but while relating to humans, it eventually develops emotions, eventually achieving a sophisticated and benign morality.Both are attracted to an alien artifact, but for different reasons. We can tell early that the result will be conflict. But as others have stated, the setup for the conflict is carefully drawn while the resolution is over quickly.But I found the resolution pleasing enough. It avoided any melodramatic touches such as gratuitous battles or sermonizing.Haldeman has been known to stretch an idea a bit too far to get a novel out of it (see \\"The Coming\\" for an example), but not this time. And he continues to wring new implications out of SF staples, such as alien contact in this case.This is very much in the traditional vein of SF, with no touches of fantasy, cyberpunk, or other more recent styles. If you like straight-forward SF, you'll probably like this. It's not a classic, but it will keep you engaged, and perhaps even make you think a bit about the nature of morality."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"A great novel, couldn't stop reading, really enjoyed it. Would have loved to know more about the \\"bad\\" alien though. Let's hope a sequel will follow!"},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"I really like this author and have read most of his books, this book was a great example of his writing."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"This was an entirely unique story that was pretty fascinating with accurate historical details mixed in with a science fiction twist. The only complaint I have is how it ended. The book was leading to a climax but, unfortunately like many science fiction books I've read, they fall flat just at the end. It was like he either couldn't think of a satisfying ending or rushed to finish the book. Either way I felt unsatisfied when I was finished. If there were a follow-up sequel, then I would like it much better."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Nothing brings me down more than a \\"it's going so well\\" science fiction book that lets you down at the very ending. This editor should be fired for not proposing a diferent line of ending"},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Worth reading. Some silliness, but mostly an entertaining, reasonably well edited novel.The love bit is over the top, but doesn't spoil it."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Joe Haldeman can write. And he can write well. He is consistant in all of his works for creating interesting plotlines and following through with them til the end of the book. Camouflage is no exception. It's an interesting story on it's face about two different aliens who have been roaming the planet for at least a million years - they know they are different from the rest of the creatures on Earth, but don't quite know why or how. One alien becomes almost human in it's capacity to feel empathy and desire to learn, while the other is hell bent on creating destruction and causing pain. Although it would be easy as a reader to try to analyze what Haldeman is trying to say through these two characters, it's really not necessary in terms of enjoying the book. Just sit back and enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The main protagonist was intriguing and a detailed character. I really enjoyed the progression of the character through time and history. This element of the story reminded me of the Highlander character living through different time periods. I would highly recommend this novel. My 2 minor complaints are that the villain was not as detailed and a cookie cutter bad guy. Also, the ending was pretty weak..."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"\\"Camouflage\\", a short, self-contained SF novel by Joe Haldeman, is a perfect example of why he is held in such high esteem by SF critics and fans alike. It's great! 4.5 stars.At just 289 pages, Camouflage is a model of compact writing and plotting. While lacking Haldeman's trademark humor, the writing is still snappy and the dialogue believable. The main characters are fleshed out enough to make one care about them, and the plot \\"mysteries\\" stay hidden until literally the last few pages when all is revealed. No red herrings, all was there to figure out if one was paying attention. When I had only 10 pages to go, I was thinking that there was no way that Haldeman was going to be able to resolve everything fairly and to my satisfaction. I thought that I was either going to find out that this was \\"to be continued\\" although I was pretty sure that I had not seen any sequels in Haldeman's bibliography or else the ending was going to be lame. Neither was true.This is a unique first contact story and a very skilled and original description of totally alien psychology interacting with various human intellectual and emotional behaviors. A lightning fast and excellent read.J.M. Tepper"},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"My title says most of what I have to say. You can read this book quickly and enjoy it. It moves fast and is fun, but I don't understand how this got the Nebula award. It doesn't compare with past winners like Dune, Flowers for Algernon, Left Hand of Darkness, Neuromancer. I just don't get it. Maybe nothing very impressive was written the year it got the award."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"This is the second Joe Haldeman book that I have read. It was good, and had the classic Haldeman abrupt ending. This author is very imaginative, and I appreciate his ability to bounce back and forth between the past and future. Overall a good read!"},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"I agree with the consensus of meaningful reviews here on the points they make such as the start and middle of the book are much stronger than the finish. I'd go further and say the wrap up extremely weak but I can't discuss why without creating a spoiler which I don't wish to do because I do think the book worth a buy and a read.What I wish to add in the bad category is that the book has elements which I'd not expect from a veteran writer like Haldeman. A protagonist just shows up without explanation and then fades. Another protagonist is even less well explained as it shows up for no reason, doesn't seem to have any effect on the plot (except to supply some narrative filler) and then just vanishes. In fact, the book could be the literature's answer to The Sopranos TV series due to having such a high percentage of unresolved plot lines and characters.On the good side, I think this book much more thoughtful about the nature of alien life than generally depicted. This motivated me to write this review and encourage you to read this book due to an incident.I, like so many others, am laid off of work now. Due to that, I sometimes watch daytime TV where I encountered a show called 'Enterprise' which is a prequel to Star Trek. In the first alien encounter, the crew manages to turn up a bunch of aliens who look like humans with some head bumps, but the chicks are still very very hot. They live in a simulacrum of mid 19th century USA. They have the identical culture of that era USA. They even have the same mating rituals which we learned as we see the captain venture down that path with one of the extra hot aliens.That the aliens of Enterprise are less alien than a typical Arab is to a typical USA citizen is annoying beyond belief. Haldeman definitely does not fall into this trap. Instead his aliens are very very alien and act like they evolved, as humans did, as the top predator of their environment.I only wish Haldeman had tended better to his craft and eschewed a rather silly and frankly impossible wrap up, but overall I'm glad I got to read this book."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Stop me if you've heard this before: A strange alien artifact is found at the bottom of the ocean and ... What's that? You say you have read that same plotline? Yeah, but not like Haldeman tells it.In Haldeman's hands the story is fresh, thanks to his creation of two very different (from each other as well as from humans) aliens who quite possibly could be immortal. Both have been around long enough to have greeted mankind's first descent out of the trees. One has lived in the ocean, passing time as a great white shark, a killer whale and a dolphin until he (she? it?) takes human form and walks out onto a California beach in 1931. The other has much more experience with the human race and the concept of war.When the artifact is discovered and taken to Samoa, the stage is set for the aliens and a small group of researchers to finally meet. But don't assume you can guess where the story goes from there. Haldeman is a master of taking readers' expectations and turning them upside down and inside out. He also tells the story in such straight-forward writing that you don't realize until you've finished the book that it was far deeper than you first thought. This is definitely one of those books I'll be saving to read again ... and I have no doubt I'll find new ideas and insights the second time around."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"I really wanted to be Russell.It's not often that I wish a book was longer than it was. In this case, I think it could've benefited from an additional 50-100pgs. That being said, Haldeman is one of those few writers capable of saying so much with a minimum of words. In that respect he reminds me of Arthur C. Clarke with a stronger appreciation of sexuality and intimacy. The ending however did feel a little rushed.Two aliens have existed on earth for millions of years. In some ways they are similar (shape-shifters) but in others, vastly different. They take us on a quick tour of human history focusing on their relationships with humans throughout the years, all the while learning more and more about us and in the process, unintentionally become more human in the process. Not surprisingly as Haldeman is fascinated by war, interesting perspectives on WWII are presented as one (in addition to many other personas/forms) becomes a captured US marine on the Bataan death march, the other a Nazi concentration camp doctor. One is benign and compassionate, the other malignant and psychotic. Their stories are meshed with the recovery and examination of an alien craft from the ocean depths in Samoa that also becomes the focus of the two aliens and a crack scientific team.Well-structured, fast-paced, detailed, and emotive, Camouflage, while not one for the annals of sci-fi lore, still merits worthy mention. Haldeman creates compelling characters that we are strongly drawn to through affinity and a dash of spicy eroticism. I only wish he would've elaborated more on the aliens' origins (especially the chameleon) and stretched out the ending. This would make a great sci-fi flick. Just make sure Haldeman contributes to the script and direction."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"I completely enjoyed reading this -- Without Synopsizing the book, or giving away the ending --- I would just like to say -- What Fun! Kept me turning the pages and going on to the next Chapter-- Nice Struture --- Couldn't wait to see what happened next -- The one thing I did not expect, --- The Ending!~Thanks for the great entertainment Joe!"},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"I am a fan of Haldeman and I often use the Nebula Awards as a quick guide to buying SciFi, but in this case I was mostly disappointed. The book won the 2005 Best Novel Nebula Award and it is probably one of the weakest winners in recent memory.The premise and the writing are as good as expected from Haldeman, put the promise is never kept. In the end nothing is explained nor even resolved. The ending is just not there. I enjoyed reading the book and was really excited about seeing how Haldeman tied it all together; he didn't. I read the Kindle edition and I thought that somehow I was missing a chapter or something. I checked back to make sure.I don't think that novels have to have \`spell it out' type endings, but you are left with basic questions about he characters, the plot, and the outcome. I'll give this three stars for the writing but I would only give it a half-hearted recommendation."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"This fanatsy thriller, deceptively packaged as science fiction, is written in a light, entertaining style. It has some relatively mild gore and sensibly restrained sexual situations. Mr. Haldeman's professionalism shows in the way he prods readers to turn pages, but the observations of human nature aren't too fresh. I agree with other reviewers who thought the resolution was rushed, but the action sequences leading immediately to it filled pages without adding significantly to the suspense.The writing and concepts seem to be aimed at readers in their middle teens, making this a fast read.Overall, CAMOUFLAGE reflects the current state of science fiction publishing in the USA. Hard to believe this outshone all else to win the Nebula, but it is better than a lot of what comes from melding fantasy and science fiction."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"A wonderful kaleidoscope of species and gender metamorphoses is mired in an obsessive immersion in academia, but nonetheless the imaginative alien character is developed with feeling and stunnig graphic descriptions, except that the eventual development of virtually human sensibilities is a bit of a stretch. An often gory tale set in the near future, with a Samoan locale probably based on the author's vacation experiences. Some gore, some hot sex, but furious plot development alternates with dull academic stuff, and the ultimate decision of the human protagonist to somehow alienize himself is beyond belief."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Camouflage is what science fiction is all about. This is a science fiction thriller. It has just the right combination of science, human interest, politics (without being preachy), intrigue, a perspective on human history and interesting characters. This is the first Haldeman book I've read and now I'm going out to acquire some of his other works. If they're anything like Camouflage I know I'm going to enjoy them.Story involves two shape shifters and their interaction with humans throughout the course of history. You get to see things through the eyes of non-humans, from two points of view, and gain a unique perspective on how and why we treat each other the way we do. What does it really mean to be \\"human\\"? The science is first rate, and the storyline is compelling. Bravo Haldeman!"},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"In a genre that has become crowded with fantasy and space opera, it is good to come across a good science fiction story that stands alone, a story that will probably not turn into a franchise with all of the attendant co-authorships, marketing, and fan sites. Joe Haldeman has excelled at remaining true to the genre, writing thought provoking science fiction wrapped around interesting stories.\\"Camouflage\\" doesn't disappoint. It has an interesting premise, written in Haldeman's quick, spare style, yet \\"Camouflage\\" does touch upon some deeper themes, especially themes of human nature and character, made especially more vivid from the point of view of a nonhuman. The story is satisfying in its subject matter, delivery, and cadence, but it tapers off just a little too quickly and leaves one of its characters languishing without enough back-story to truly complete the story in a cosmic sense. This flaw, however, doesn't even become noticeable until the very last page so does not detract from the process of the story.\\"The Hemingway Hoax\\" and \\"The Forever War\\" made me a solid Haldeman fan, and \\"Camouflage\\" is good company as well."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"The story line was good. I enjoyed reading about the changeling's journey thru history. Only drawback, the ending. It's a very quick wrapup that seems like the author said oops my book can only be 280 pages and I'm at 278 so I'd better put an ending on it."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Camouflage was tight and fun to read. Haldeman's high concept approach and the book's corresponding structure are very strong. (Thank you for not writing another 500 page space opera, just because!) Those strengths kept me reading despite some rather obvious weak plot points and a couple of flat characters.It's worth noting that the weak plot points didn't bother me until I was well done with the book.What bothered me more was how little attention Haldeman put into making the Chameleon richer. There was a little too much of the Generic Alien Baddie with only a cursory attempt at motivation. If he'd done half as well with Chameleon as he did with Changeling, it would have been a much stronger and more memorable book.I loved Haldeman's diction and crisp witty style. The prose was sleek, and even with my quarrels it kept me reading in a pretty obsessive way until it was finished.Haldeman has been a bit of a blank spot for me-- one of those authors I've been meaning to read, but never quite got around to doing it. Based on this, I'm a lot more enthusiastic to give more of his work a try.I will admit to being puzzled as to why this won a Tiptree. I don't think he's doing anything that interesting with gender. Different strokes, I guess."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"This was way better than I expected. I admit, when I got started on this book. It seemed a little goofy at first. But as the story progressed, I was impressed at the depth Haldeman gave the central characters. I really like Haldeman's light and clean writing style. It makes for effortless reading without losing any good details.I won't give away the ending, but its a fun ending. Maybe it was obvious, but it still was satisfying."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"This is the first book by Haldeman that I have read and it was enjoyable. I had just finished reading \\"Light\\" by Harrison, so this book was a nice change. Very easy to get into, fun and straightforward--it made me feel like kid reading Andre Norton for the first time. At first it seemed a bit formulaic, the themes are very familiar. However, it doesn't matter, Haldeman builds (almost literally) the main character, the \\"changeling\\", from the ground up; we get to see it's transformation as it learns to be human. The style of writing makes for easy reading, if you are traveling or sitting on a beach."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Very well writen stoy about the 'good' shape shifter. Book would have been great with just that story... the whole bad shapeshifter story... sorry... lost me... total let down of an ending... Sure the reveal was a surprise but the culmination... bleh..."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"From the first few pages of the book, it promises to be an enjoyable read with a great premise that seems to have limitless potential. Unfortunately you quickly realize that the author wasn't really sure where to take this idea and how to develop it. Half way through the book you start to realize that this is not going anywhere and with every read page, my interest in the book was greatly diminishing. The ending feels rushed and completely dissatisfactory, as though the author decided that he wrote enough for publishing complete book and didn't feel like putting any effort in completing the story. To add to this, lots of things in the book don't really make much sense from any logical point of view. I'm not sorry about the money I paid for the book, I am sorry for the time I wasted reading.."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"The book has a great premise and was tightly written throughout. I found the ending a little unsatisfying considering how good the rest of the book was."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Joe Haldeman delivers a good, well considered novel that is Haldemanesque... in the sense that the enthusiasm that the book delivers and the original concepts he explores in his own unique way hold the plot together.I judge a good book on whether I can put it down, walk away from it and not think about it. In the case of Camouflage, I read it cover-to-cover and was sorry that the story was over. He left me wanting more and to me, that makes the grade.Other reviewers found a component of the book when the human and alien fell in love to be corny and unbelievable, but love does confound the wisest of us and I didn't think that it was nearly as big of a stretch."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Awesome alien profile. The only fault is with 10 pages to go you can tell there is now way to wrap it all up. No explanation of alien tech, which is becomming the standard these days. The ending was very abbreviated."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"This is a fun book of alien contact that lands somewhere between \\"E.T.\\" and \\"Species\\". Good story told in nice clear prose, but the ending is very abrupt and rushed. It's enjoyable but could have been better."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"To the above reviews let me add one thing. The book ends so abruptly that I thought the last few pages were missing. \\"He stepped into the chamber and began to glow.\\" This is an ending? It says that Haldeman either ran out of plot or the editor did a terribly climsy job. Lately Haldeman seems to be suffering from the Michael Crichton Syndrome: great start, great story, terrible ending."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"One of the best books I've read in a long time.

This was no exception. Joe, please, please give us a follow up tome. This story line has tons more material to explore and explain."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"I picked this book out because it was on the Nebula Award Winner list. I thought it had a decent chance of being a good book if it had won such an award. I felt somewhat disappointed.While it was entertaining enough to keep me reading to the last page, there were several things I didn't like about it.1. The characters were rather flat until the very end when they picked up a little depth.2. The chameleon seemed like a device thrown in to keep the reader going rather than any real part of the story.3. There were a few spots where the author shifted from calling the changeling by It to She, which may have been intentional but was distracting.4. There was no reason for either the chameleon or the changeling to be on Earth.5. The ending was underwhelming; it should have been more dramatic and meaningful to make the book work.6. A reviewer on the back of the book called it 'hard' science fiction, but this was NOT hard sci-fi. It was more like a cross between sci-fi and fantasy. If you can so easily bend or break the accepted laws of nature, and give no plausible explanation, then it's not hard sci-fi."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"I read the whole book, and honestly I enjoyed it. I still felt that it wasn't a particularly a memorable nor a \\"must-read\\" book. The positives are that it is interesting throughout, with the main characters growing as unique, fleshed-out people, even if they were non-human. Another positive note is the author's knowledge of war history, and his authenticity of portraying the fictional events of the book that are based on real war period circumstances. I mentioned a romance angle in the title of this review, and I think it's neither a positive nor a negative, but it clearly belongs in the overall themes of the book involving both physical and spiritual change. I do say that this is marginally Science Fiction because there's not really a scientific essence to be found.For negatives, I personally did not appreciate the several sexual descriptions in this book, ie. sodomy, rape, alien/human-sex. To me, they were graphic, revolting, and thought at least one or maybe more of these scenes didn't fit in with the progressive growth of the characters and the positive tone of the book. There may be a place for that kind of content, but it didn't strengthen this particular book.Lastly, like \\"The Coming\\", this is not a true SF book. Having a spaceship in the book isn't enough to make it SF."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Haldeman's Forever War is a masterpiece and deserving of all the praise and critical acclaim it has received. So I picked up Camouflage based on that reputation. I don't think I could have been more disappointed. This is derivative to the nth order. First there's the mysterious impenetrable alien object. Shades of 2001. But it's under the ocean. So that makes it somewhat of a Sphere rip-off too. Complete with aliens.But these aren't your ordinary aliens. These are sexual predators (that is what you would call someone who tricks someone else into sex under false pretenses), into sex with humans, and who participate in some of the most gruesome human experimentation in human history. They can also take any form they want, again, useful for tricking humans. This sounds like a job for good old James T. Kirk and his intrepid ability to bed every alien shapeshifter in the galaxy.If you think Kirk is a well-rounded character and him in bed with aliens is the high-point of sci-fi, adjust my rating to 5 stars. Otherwise, this is an easy book to skip if you've read 2001, Sphere, or probably countless other alien artifact books."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"I liked the concept of two aliens roaming the planet changing themselves and events around them. This could have been a much better book but I got the sense that the Author was rushing to get to the end. The first third of the book is intriguing but then its downhill from there. I think he should take this story re-write it when he has some time to really finish it."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"A whiz-bang save-the-world story, with a couple of way-out aliens, one a real baddie, and a good ending with an interesting twist. Haldeman's all-time greatest in my view is the Forever War. This isn't quite so epic, but still a very good read."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"The Nebula awards committee (SFWA) has become so heavily politicized over the past couple of decades, that I was surprised to see veteran science fiction writer, Joe Haldeman, win the 2005 Nebula award. Joe Haldeman is well known in science fiction circles for his absolute classic novel, The Forever War, and is also a Vietnam War veteran so he's able to write about the follies, atrocities, and fog of war from a first person perspective. However, reading the blurb on the book storyline, about two aliens on earth, a discovered alien artifact and the events surrounding them which are relatively familiar themes to those that read and watch science fiction, nothing jumped out as obviously political. In the novel Haldeman does write about the Bataan Death March, the march the Japanese forced captured American and other prisoners of war during World War II under heat, starvation, and other brutal conditions that lead to a considerable number of deaths. The Bataan Death March is a well documented and known WW II event to many Americans and is justifiably worthy to recant for those that are not too familiar with the events. What is disappointing is the usual trivialization of events right after WW II on the cold war and the Soviet Union. Most of the 20 million deaths committed by the Soviet Union was in eastern Europe so it seems that it doesn't qualify on the \`American Death Conversion Chart' (e.g. 500 deaths by a natural disaster in Asia equals news worthiness of 0.5 American deaths) to write about with any significance. (Granted these deaths occurred before the cold war, but the same repressive regime was in power.) The sad truth is that many atrocities have been committed by humanity, and numerous atrocities committed in the past 100 years. The Japanese committed horrible atrocities against the Chinese in Manchuria, and returning from a visit to the Tibetan government-in-exile in northern India brought further details of past and on-going atrocities by the Chinese. It's worthy to be reminded of past atrocities, least we forget, and it would be refreshing to read of them without other atrocities being marginalized.As it is, this is an excellent novel, quickly flowing, an enjoyable style of writing, with an interesting plot, and is well deserving of an award for best science fiction novel."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"There is a sub-genre of science fiction that I like to think of as the alien-encounter procedural. Among its most famous of members is Arthur C. Clarke's \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\". Humans meet a new species of alien and must figure out what procedures to follow to make some kind of contact. Emphasis is on the technology of contact, with suspense created by the unknown nature of the aliens. Often there is no emphasis on character development or illuminating human society by the strange circumstances. To maintain my interest the twists of the encounter or the solutions required must really be clever.All this is by way of saying that when I encountered \\"Camouflage\\", I expected just such a story and had set my techno-bableometer to dampen. Boy, was I surprised!Instead the story is told from the point of view of the alien and explores one of the most basic of literary questions, \\"What does it mean to be human?\\"Joe Haldeman's writing is simple and direct and he does not search for colorful language. Instead, he weaves together three separate story lines, each with its own time scale, that come together in the finale. Occasionally you might think the author was moving into irrelevant areas but ultimately he brings the unities home. Moreover, at the same time as the main character is developing, Haldeman uses the device of the doppelganger, that is, a parallel personality, to contrast with the character of the hero. Moreover, he sets the story against an historical perspective of the last two thirds of the twentieth century, with a major portion of the story set against the fall of the Philippines and the horror of the Bataan death march at the beginning of World War II. The purpose of this lengthy excursion into history is to fine tune our sense of the development of the hero.There are a few things that stretched my belief, particularly the behavior of one of the main human characters when he learns a secret of the alien, but I allowed myself to step back from my incredulity and to see it as a further device to explore the main question.The story moves along quickly, or at least as quickly as I could turn the pages. This may not be amongst the greatest of science fiction novels, but it certainly illustrates how a good premise and construction of a novel can not only sweep us along, but even provide food for thought."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Joe Haldeman is one of the top sci-fi writers around. This novel contains three interwoven stories:1. A sympathetic shape-changer who has lived on earth for millions of years, but only as a human from the 1930's on.2. An unrelated and malevolent shape-changer who's been around as long as man, whose favorite human is Josef Mengele.3. A mysterious and impregnable metal artifact dredged up from the ocean floor by a science reasearch team in Samoa, drawing the attention of both aliens.Thematically, the book is fascinating. The decidedly non-human characters highlight oddities of our behavior we simply take for granted, like courting rituals and various aspects of sexual and romantic love.The plot, unfortunately, doesn't measure up. JH starts out strong, neatly interweaving the three stories, sweeping through time and setting up a profound mystery with the artifact. But eventually these stories bog down as JH concentrates on a love angle, pretty much dropping the more interesting (to me anyway) exploration of the artifact and the nature of the evil shape-changer. A rather contrived ending ties it all together, but I hope he does a sequel to further develop his intriguing ideas."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Joe Haldeman is a unique voice and innovator in Science Fiction. Each of his novels is a new experiment in the craft of writing. Similar to his changeling protagonist, \\"Camouflage\\" represents key elements of his writing style that have evolved over the past several novels and are now combined with his natural ability to weave a compelling tale. The result is an exceptionally well-crafted novel that tells a complex story in as parsimonious manner as possible. Writing in this manner is a tall-order for any author, and a departure from the increasingly long, convoluted science fiction novels that grace the shelves of our bookstores today. His pacing is on-the-money here and helps build a sense of excitement. The result is a wonderful page turner that will leave the Haldeman fan eagerly awaiting his next effort. Haldeman does an exceptional job with this novel."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Haldeman is on my short list of all time great authors, but his last few books haven't always met that standard. With Camouflage I feel Haldeman has found his old magic, but at the same time I can see him moving forward picking style elements used in books like The Coming and Forever Peace much more effectively here. Best of all the Haldeman we don't always see, the one who writes a damn good mystery is back in force. It makes want to go back and read All My Sins again."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"With his last two novels - the very under-rated \\"The Coming\\" and his psuedo-alternate history \\"Guardian\\" - Joe Haldeman has taken the short but sweet approach to telling his story; a long and winding build-up which leads to the short, sharp ending/twist. I loathe to describe it as an long story or joke with a sharp punchline at the end, but the comparison seems apt. This approach has so far worked for Haldeman due to his strong approach in developing his characters through a time period based narrative. However, in \\"Camouflage\\", it seems that Haldeman is starting to get a bit lax.The year is 2019 and marine biologist Russell Sutton is working in the Pacific with his company that specialises in deep-ocean salvaging (his crew achieved fame through their rising of The Titanic). Russell is approached by Jack, a retired naval officer who enlists him to retrieve a mysterious oval object lying off the coast of Samoa. In the second storyline, we follow the \\"Changeling\\", an alien that has been on Earth since the dawn of evolution. Having taken the form of marine animals for most of its time, the Changeling takes on a human form in the 1930's and begins its journey to learn about humans.The secondary storyline of the alien's development over a period of a century is typical Haldeman - an entertaining memoir like account of events and happenings that brings us in to liking the character. However, problems arise when we jump back to the present with Russell and Jack. These characters are less developed than the Changeling and in the end they come across as one-dimensional characters. It is not a good thing when the alien character appears more human than the humans.Another problem is Haldeman's idea - the idea of an ancient alien artifact which involves 2 alien species, in a time where humans are ready for such a discovery is not new, but is interesting enough. However, Haldeman does not develop it well enough. It seems like the idea came as an afterthought. The end result is we follow the characters but to where, we do not know. The pace of the novel builds up in intensity like a thriller, but the only mystery we have here is the mystery of whether anything will actually happen.Haldeman's development of characters is still engaging but here, he has failed to make them of any use. Here, he is failing to develop a proper story, which makes Camouflage seem stale and pointless. Those are two words which I never imagined I would use for a writer which gave the word the powerful novel, \\"The Forever War\\". In Camouflage, it seems Haldeman is writing on auto-pilot and following a template."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"This is page turner. Put an alien on Earth a million years ago, give it amnesia, make it immortal, but give it a touch of empathy, while you are at it, add an artifact discovered in the present time. Just as it's about to boil, add to this pot, a pinch of spice called love. No Carbs. What more can you ask for from Joe Haldeman novel. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Haldeman's early works are among my all-time favorites. Since then he's cranked out a seemingly endless stream of almost-great but ultimately forgettable copy.Of Camouflage's three parts, one is as good as it gets. An alien shapeshifter has been on the planet for eons, so long that it's forgotten it ever was anything but a marine predator at the very tippy-top of the food chain. Then it comes ashore and undertakes the project of learning how to fit into the much more complex social structure of that environment's top species. Fascinating, and well worth a book in itself.\\"But wait,\\" I can hear some editor saying. \\"We need a quest for origin.\\" Okay, throw in a mysterious and impenetrable object salvaged from the bottom of an ocean trench. Problem; the reader already knows the object and the alien will come together at the end, memories will be restored, sidetracked destinies fulfilled, blah, blah. Boring.\\"But wait,\\" says some other editor. \\"Don't we need conflict?\\" (I'm assuming meddling editors are demanding these changes, because Haldeman is a better writer than this.) Anyway, JH sighs \\"No problem,\\" and adds a second, completely superfluous evil shapechanging alien which seems to serve no purpose in the entire book. I have to presume its origin is identical to the first shapechanging alien, but the differences between them are never explained. I think it's supposed to be a big surprise when the evil alien's identity is revealed, but it just wasn't important enough to the story for me to give a damn.\\"But wait,\\" says a third editor. \\"We need a romance angle!\\" At which point there really should have been a complete - and if necessary violent - refusal. Alas, that's not the way it worked out.In total, the book reads as if Haldeman originally intended a thousand-page epic and so could afford 300 pages of build-up, but then someone - possibly a fourth meddling editor - said, \\"Time's up!\\" As many other reviewers have already mentioned. there's a lot of great, leisurely material and then an abrupt, tacked-on ending.All in all, Haldeman's done a lot better."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Camouflage was pretty darned good.Mr. Haldeman's writing seems to go in two directions normally. On the one hand, he writes books like Forever XXX (War, Peace, Free), All My Sins Remembered, Mindbridge (a personal favorite) or Tool of the Trade. These are gripping remarkable stories that I hate to see end.On the other hand, there are the Worlds novels, the Vietnam era things (I know Mr. Haldeman is a veteran but did not enjoy these as much) Buying Time and a number of others. They aren't bad, but if I hadn't tricked onto Mindbridge early in my game, I wouldn't have found the rest.When Mr. Haldeman is good, there's no one better. I really dig his stuff and Camouflage is one of those.With this new novel, it seems Mr. Haldeman saw the movie Species and came up with some interesting variants of his own. His aliens are pretty cool and the story rocks. If I have any complaint, it is the standard Haldeman complaint that it ended very abruptly. I hope that there will be a sequel and that Mr. Haldeman is almost done writing it."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"I have followed Haldeman's work since I read \\"The Forever War\\" about ten years ago. I loved that book, and many of his short stories (available in a few anthologies). But his last few books didn't engage me - I thought \\"Guardian\\" moved too slowly, and \\"The Coming\\" wasn't my thing.But this one read like one of Haldeman's best works. I couldn't put it down - I was swept away by all three of the intertwining stories. I'd recommend this for any Haldeman fan. And if you haven't read \\"The Forever War\\", why the heck haven't you?"},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"In 2019 Baja, California, Russell Sutton owns Poseidon Projects, a relatively small marine biological research firm. Russell targets two to three projects a year, but none involving the American military having worked in the government back at the turn of the century. Thus, his highly regarded staff (six PhDs) is stunned when Russell accepts US Navy Admiral Jack Halliburton deep-water salvage proposal. Lying on the bottom of an oceanic trench, seven miles form the surface, sits a metallic object that Jack wants raised.Russell succeeds in lifting the small object out of the sea. In Samoa, they investigate the find, but the object is impregnable to their probes. While the scientific team continually fails in its query, two aliens roam the planet. The Changeling lived in the sea for millenniums before arriving on land nearly a century ago and dons any identity including an inanimate; the Chameleon has become the world's richest person. He also will kill without feeling any remorse. News surfaces about the object; along with the usual whackos in and out of the media and some intrigued scientists, the Changeling and the Chameleon have personal interests as both know that this is the key to their finally going home.This futuristic aliens among us tale is a terrific story line that hooks the audience from the moment the object is lifted from the sea as readers will want to know what this artifact is as well as who are the Changeling and the Chameleon. Russell is a fabulous lead human protagonist, but clearly, the mystery of the two ETs and their \\"key\\" is what grips the audience in a fabulous thriller that needs a chlorine-based sequel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"I immensely enjoyed The Forever War by Joe Haldeman. I saw this book in the library, and it looked pretty good. I was a little misled though, I thought it was going to be two Loch Ness type creatures coming after the artifact, I must not have read too closely.Anyway, I really liked the character of the changeling. That was pretty much the only thing that kept me engrossed in this book. I actually sat down and read the entire book in about six hours. I couldn't tell you when the last time I did that was.The chameleon gets hardly any page time or development. It was almost as if he were an afterthough to the story. And, don't get me started on the ending. I wouldn't even know where to begin. Things were horribly wrapped up, in my opinion. I wouldn't doubt if the publisher said \\"we need the book in 5 mintues!\\".Won't stop me from reading any of his other stuff though, of course. Camoflage is well written with some very interesting characters, and some very funny moments. Highly recommended, and came very close to being a 5 star review."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"The character depth and development was excellent. The science, the plot, it works for me.

And if that ending doesn't get your mind racing with possibilities, you're probably not from earth. ;)"},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Forever War and Forever Peace are two of the best books I've read, though Forever War is far better, IMO. Both, however, span millions of years, and that's what makes them unique. So I was initially disappointed that Haldeman's new book \\"Camoflauge\\" essentially began at two points: 1931 and 2000 something. Still, my initial disappointment was eventually swayed by Haldeman's excellent storytelling.The premise of the book is a mysterious artifact found in the ocean. It's transported to Samoa, where a group of for-profit scientists begin trying to figure out what it is. Meanwhile, two creatures: the changeling and the chameleon, roam our planet in disguise, and take two very different approaches to \\"fitting in.\\"Haldeman, oddly enough, seems to do better with the character development of the changeling than he does with actual humans. The changeling, by far, is more human than any of the humans Haldeman paints portraits of, and that's not good during those times when the book focuses on the humans in Samoa. Focusing on the changeling, however, is the best part of the book. The adaptation of the creature, the changes that it makes, and the behavior it observes is interesting, and keeps the book moving towards the inevitable conclusion.The end of the book is weak, IMO - I could have (and did) construct about a million more interesting endings in my mind as I was reading. Clearly the climax of the plot is in the final pages, and Haldeman, this time anyway, doesn't seem to believe that a denoument carries any importance whatsoever, since it's about 3 seconds in this book.But overall it's a page turner. Not Haldeman's best work, but still a decent book."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"This book is OK/fun. Only a bit less then 300 pages and only a day or two of reading. I can't rave about it but it is sturdy Science Fiction (a bit more like Clancy-esque fiction in a Sci-Fi setting). Not on the same level as Forever War but it is sturdy enough.... decent Sci Fi is hard to find.The book presupposes a immortal life-form (two, infact) traveled to earth with a ship and slowly forgetwho/what they are. The ship/artifact is lost formillions of years and it isn't until the artifact isdiscovered (and publicized) that events start bringingthe aliens together from their different paths (with norecollection of the other or themselves). A little toopat in places and events transpire to collide just alittle too quickly but it has a nice quirky ending andsome interesting takes on future society (takes placeprimarily @2020).

A quick read that engrosed at parts, but left me feeling cheated. He went in to too much detail in parts that didn't matter to the over all story. Other parts that were essential leave the reader questioning his motives. The end felt like the author just got tired of rambling on and decided to put the story out of its proverbial misery.Frankly, it just disappointed me."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Most of this book is a fantastic story, quickly paced, interesting characters, etc. The most engrossing parts are told from the point of view of two different shapechanging creatures who secretly mimic humans. This situation naturally leads the reader to anticipate how the real humans will react when they discover the identity of the aliens. The human and alien characters are interesting enough that I didn't mind one or two illogical aspects of the alien physiology (example: the alien has no DNA yet it produces histamine -- what does histamine do for this alien if it has no DNA to produce histamine \\"receptors\\"??). Everything was fine until page 250 (out of 296) when I realized that the book was not going to deliver a satisfying ending in so few remaining pages. Indeed, the last ten pages deliver a hasty convergence of three plotlines that must be described as \\"incomplete\\". Another hundred pages like the first 250 and I would have given in five stars easily, but like this I give three stars and a bemused chuckle. Apparently the Nebula judges have lowish standards for established authors like Joe Haldeman. Whatever...."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Eons ago, a very tough alien arrived on our planet. Recently it took the place of a California youth and entered the world of humans. It then continued to change its appearance and experienced more of the world including World War Two and many others. Now it is being drawn to Samoa where research is being done on an ancient object found on the bottom of the ocean. The object may be related to itself.Unknown to this changeling and shape shifter, another creature has stalked the planet for eons. This one is a chameleon and rather enjoys killing and mayhem. It too has been drawn by the strange object. Each creature has wondered if there are others like it on the planet. Soon they will meet and learn the truth. But the Chameleon has long since decided that others like itself should be eliminated.The story is told alternating between the book's present which follows the study of the object and the past of the changeling as it works its way through recent history (starting in the Great Depression) until the timelines converge. We get a little bit from the Chameleon's viewpoint and a synopsis of its involvement in human history. All together it makes for a very interesting tale and offers insights into human nature through the eyes of something not human. This is not a monster vs. monster story as the conflict that is foreseen is handled quickly. A nice tale that manages to be full of wonder while remaining down home. Check it out."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Haldeman writes excellent science-fiction. In Camouflage he tells the stories of a couple aliens who poke around the earth for a few millenia and make disparate judgments of what it means to be human. The novel rides pretty far on the strength of its premise but eventually it becomes clear that this is essentially a short story centered on the alien who comes to appreciate humanity for what it is. Though a fine story, there was much more that could have been said about life itself. Maybe Mr. Haldeman is just leaving room for a sequel.Finally, the author's theme of an alien discovering what it means to be human was bound to focus upon sex at some point. But seriously folks, generations of talented authors and playwrights have managed some excellent explorations of sexuality without dwelling on the pornographic. The explicit scenes in this book were just embarrassing. And the author's portrayal of Samoan morality as quaint and outdated was unnecessary."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"A \\"changeling\\" has been on Earth at least a million years, mostly in the form of various sea creatures, until deciding to become human. The changeling is callous toward human life, but slowly, very slowly, comes to appreciate humans, assuming every identity from circus dwarf to university professor, and slowly learning to love. In the meantime, another alien, a \\"chameleon\\", has been on Earth (its origin is murky). This chameleon has no empathy toward humans whatsoever.Then explorers discover, unknowingly, the changeling's original ship that brought it to Earth millennia ago. They begin an effort to retrieve it from a deep ocean trench, study it, and open it.And one day the ship \\"talks\\" to them. And the chameleon learns that he is not the only alien on Earth, and it is jealous of its unique status.That's the sci-fi story. The book really is about the \\"humanization\\" of the changeling. It's not a pretty story, and it really isn't a plausible story. It picks up a dozen or so university degrees, discovers sex, experiences a prison camp during WWII, and more. It lives, and \\"dies\\", as necessary to gain new experiences.

I read this story when it was serialized in Analog, and my initial responce was 'Is this really a new story freshly written in the 21st Centry?'This book is old-fashioned. I'm not saying it's a bad thing. It's just too-typical, too-1970's-like, too-comforting. I think readers who started reading science fiction back in the 1950s would find this book more interesting than I did. Haldeman is definitely a telented writer-I still remember the shock and wonder I felt when I first read his best works like _The Forever War_ or _All Sins Remembered_. This new novel won't league among them, but for those looking for a classical science fiction with a classical idea and humour, it would still be recommended.

I don't usually read books about aliens, usually avoiding anything about outerspace, but this was worth the read.

Since reading everyone elses reviews, I'm looking forward to checking out more books by this author especially."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Joe Haldeman has written a lot of books in which one of the main characters goes through one or more identity changes. (Off the top of my head, I can think of _Buying Time_, _Tool of the Trade_, and _All My Sins Remembered_.) I suppose it's no surprise that he's done it again. _Camouflage_ uses the idea to raise the question \\"What does it mean to be human?\\"--but not answer it.The book starts out quickly and compellingly: strange alien in the 1930s, strange scientific puzzle in the 2020s. (There's a prefatory section which explains the alien's nature; the book might have been better without it.) Once the 2020s timeline starts investigating the alien artifact, though, that plot thread loses all its steam. A lot of nothing happens, until the end of the book, in which much is explained through a slightly contrived timely revelation.The \\"Changeling\\" alien plotline remains very interesting, particularly to anyone with a taste for history. The other alien, the \\"Chameleon,\\" is less well-developed. There's a twist at the end, which isn't very surprising.If this review sounds too tepid for a three-star rating, blame it on the initial excellence of the story. The excitement doesn't carry through to the end, and the book doesn't have a compelling set of characters or a deeply-interesting theme that might carry it through. All the same, it's a pleasantly diverting read from an author who ought to be encouraged to publish more."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"This book fell into my hands when I was looking for a quick read while on travel. I only browsed the back cover and thought it might be interesting - which was a misunderstanding on my side that became clear already in the first chapter. First of all, shapeshifters really aren't my kind of thing even if they need more than a few seconds to change their appearance. The prehistoric introduction reads like an unsuccessful try at literature and gives away most of the details (or could-be-secrets) behind the aliens. There are some half-hearted tries to blend several war episodes with the story and set the stage for a twist in the end that really becomes very transparent already in the first half of the book. The aliens' motivations are barely beyond stereotypical, sometimes a little too obviously meant to be controversial when in fact they are not. The human side is even worse and borders on being embarrassing - one wants to suggest to move away from the ever-present war theme and spend a little more time on other aspects of human character. It's a short book though and the fast action carries it along too. I'll give Mr Haldeman an extra star for this one mainly because his \\"Marsbound\\" was infinitely worse and I still need to read the highly praised \\"Forever War.\\""},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"I won't bother with a plot description. But the book is a riveting read, the ending was completely unexpected (I kept wondering how they would get around the whole alien thing during the whole book) There's enough sex to keep it interesting but not so much that it seems perverted or pornographic. The plotline is original and, something I like in my sci fi adventures, it seems like it COULD possibly happen. A certain amount of poetic license is expected and required in sci fi, but if you allow for that it is a plausable story.

I praying it isn't ended this way as a setup for another unwanted (or un-needed) sequel or series.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Camouflage as a light, entertaining read (I mostly read it in the bathroom =) ) but it's about as far away from a Nebula contender as I've seen in recent memory."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Haldeman is among my favorite SF authors.

But the ending, when it comes, seems abrupt and seems to leave too much dangling - not least a bit of potential sequel-bait.Haldeman's craft is never in doubt.

Both of these creatures have blended into human lives and neither can be killed.Meanwhile, an artifact has been discovered on the island of Samoa that both these creatures are drawn to. The object is heavier than any known material and appears to be industructable. Both creatures are drawn to the object, the Changling to learn about it since it senses that the object has something to do with its own existance. The Cameleon feels that other creatures like itself may be drawn to the object and he wants to eliminate them as possible competition.The story of the Changling is told in a fascinating manner through decades where he is a man then a shark then a man again, then sometimes a woman or an object.The story builds to a showdown between the two creatures, the object and the scientists who are studying it. My only problem with the book is that I felt the author rushed the ending as a matter of fact I had 4 pages left and was thinking there will be a sequel but there was a kind of ending that made me feel that the author could have drawn it out more."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Camouflage is a tight little romp by Joe Haldeman centering around two succinctly different but intertwined plots. The first and far inferior plot revolves around the unearthing and subsequent tinkering with a large inanimate alien artifact that doesn't seem to do much. The artifact is in a makeshift lab in Samoa where numerous scientists are trying various experiments with little to no results or reaction by the said object. Unfortunately, despite the scientific thinking behind the different experiments, this subplot is tepid at best. The other and slightly more prevalent story line focuses on two separate immortal shape-shifting aliens who are roaming Earth. One is a sadistic war mongering killer always looking for the next challenge. The other (and more interesting) is a fish out of water (literally) trying to understand human behavior while searching for its origin and purpose.Haldeman's focuses on the more tranquil of his creations and its growth and participation in events of the 20th century is fascinating. It's subjective view of the human condition and how it learns to interact with humanity is both terrifying and tender at the same time. It's ability to change into any form or person within certain time constraints is well utilized by Haldeman and provides for many smart and tense moments.I don't think I've ever thought this about a novel, but I actually believe this book would have been better as a more sweeping, detail filled epic sci-fi novel. 600 hundred page books are not really Haldeman's fast pace \\"airplane\\" book style, but it might of really turned this otherwise well executed novel into \\"one for the ages\\". This book was nominated for the 2005 Nebula Award but lost out to Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrel and rightly so as that book was the epic and immersing novel this could have been.Bottom Line: Another great quick read by Haldeman who continues to produce excellent page-turners."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"What are the odds that shape changing immortal from a distant planet is living among us? Now double that and you have the foundation for Joe Haldeman's novel Camouflage. They dwell among us, take our form, live out one life after another, and then move on. One kills at need and the other kills by need. One may take on any form and the other; any human form. Russell Sutton, operator of a small specialist marine engineering firm is about to meet them both.Hired to raise a mysteriously dense, cigar shaped artifact from the depths of the Pacific Ocean, Russell unwittingly starts the chain of events that will draw both aliens into his sphere. The artifact is big news in the world of 2020 when it is floated to the surface and dragged up onto a beach in independent Samoa. It is obviously not of human origin. Too heavy to transport elsewhere, a laboratory is built up around it and Russell and his team set out to figure out not only what it is but who it might belong to. The aliens are two steps ahead of him.The multiple plot lines are straight forward, logical, and lead inevitably to a final confrontation between the titans that does not disappoint. The writing is smooth and the story flows easily from the short alternating chapters. By the end, a picture emerges of the good alien and the bad alien. The good one is like the boy who studies ants and plucks one or two from the hill for examination and the bad one is like the boy who stomps on the hill to watch the ants run around in panic. The good one ponders this thing called love. The bad one does not want to share planet Earth.A large portion of the book reads like a how-to-create-an-identity guide for wayward aliens. Other parts could serve well as a guide to human sex for aliens (the only kind neglected by the author was lesbian sex and no reason was offered for this oversight). The science behind the aliens and the artifact is beyond the realm of physics as we humans know it and while I am always a bit disappointed by fantasy science, I still liked this story. I never really bonded with any of the characters though, and I found the romance between Russell, a middle aged science geek, and young twenty something women a bit fanciful, but then, they were aliens. All in all it is a good read and a book I can recommend without hesitation.Reviewed by Hugh Mannfield at stormbold.com"},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"This is the first book I've read by this author, but I can easily understand why he has won both the Hugo and Nebula awards for previous novels. I was wary of reading this book because the idea of aliens secretly living among us is certainly not a new one. Even though it's something of an SF cliche, he does an excellent job of telling the story of an alien learning to pass as a human. This learning experience involves participating in some historic events that Haldeman portrays from the alien's more objective point of view. The author, being a Vietnam vet, was able to construct some very believable scenarios relating to war, and to show how absurd we humans can be.The trip through history, the alien's interactions with humans (and animals), and the detective work involved in concealing its identity all make for interesting reading. I also enjoyed his no-nonsense writing style. I felt the end of the book, however, was even more of a cliche (I won't give it away, though), and was anticlimactic. And I don't say that because I think there are too many loose ends; I was quite happy with the very open-ended conclusion of Ship of Fools by Richard Paul Russo. Camouflage was also sometimes a little too gratuitous for me. While sex is a huge part of what makes us human, there were times, especially towards the end, when I felt like he was using it as a crutch to keep the reader interested."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Like much of science fiction, Haldeman's \\"Camouflage\\" is really a reflection on human nature, using the eyes of an alien (actually, two different aliens). There's little here that requires an alien presence, it's really just the MacGuffin to allow Haldeman to give an analysis of mankind over the time he's been alive. Luckily, he does not fall into the trap of having the alien learn to do things - e.g. drive a car, shop at a mall, etc. Haldeman instead concentrates on what it is to BE human, in a much more philosophical sense.The plot is basically window dressing to allow the alien(s) to observe human nature. Such as it is, however, it is quite interesting. In 1931, the changling, who has lived as a shark and other sea creatures, ventures onto land to try living as a human. He kills a teenager and assumes his physical form. Because he's never really observed humans before, and can't speak the language, it is concluded that he has suffered neurological damage and assigned to an asylum. As his observations progress, he learns more and more what it is to be human. This story is intercut with the discovery of an ancient and obviously alien artifact on the ocean floor, and the scientists' efforts to study it (it's secrets are not readily forthcoming, to say the least). The changling passes through the years in a variety of guises, and eventually comes \\"up-to-date\\" and joins the same timeline as the scientists. We, the readers, know there is a connection between the changling and the artifact, but not exactly what.There is also a second alien, of a totally different species, on the prowl. Unlike the Changling, this creature is a sadistic monster who idolises such people as Auschwitz's \\"Dr. Death,\\" Joseph Mengele. This character is clearly the weakest part of the book. What is this second alien doing on Earth? Where did he come from? It's almost like Haldeman needed something to flesh out the story, so arbitrarily foisted another unrelated alien into it. Perhaps he meant it to be a counterpoint to the Changling, but he simply doesn't develop the character enough to make it interesting or relevant to the story.However, it's only on hindsight that you're disappointed with the second alien's contribution to the story. Overall it's a well-paced, well-thought-out, and interesting read. At a slim 290 pages, and with 47 chapters in that space, you can imagine that the book moves at a good clip and is difficult to put down. It's no \\"Forever War,\\" and may not have deserved the awards it's won, but it is a very satisfying (if quick) read."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"This book was my introduction to the excellent science fiction of Joe Haldeman. It is not his best work, but I found it entertaining and interesting. My major disappointment was the insubstantial character development and the other tantalizing plot elements. I just wanted more of the same, particularly about \\"the Chameleon\\" and the world from which the Changeling came."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Wow. Where does he come up with this stuff. The man is a literary genius. This was my first J.H. book and every since I just can't get enough. I intend to read every one of his books. I only regret that one day I will have read them all and then I'll have to go back to Koontz and King and the like."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"This book engaged me right away: neat idea; fascinating development; good writing without excess detail; good pacing. I was totally into it.Then in the middle of the book, things started to go downhill: ***SPOILERS BELOW***The changeling stops being an alien and starts to become more human, which makes the character much less interesting and more predictable. And then there is a stupid and useless love interest/relationship that really diminishes the story. The only other interesting character besides the Changeling is the Chameleon, who really doesn't get much page time or development. And the ending is really bad - just corny and stupid.Even saying all that, the book was still overall entertaining and I read it quickly. I am looking forward to reading more of Joe Haldeman's books."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Joe Haldeman is one of those authors that always entertains, but the question is: Does he satisfy? In this case I say yes.Camouflage is about two shape shifting aliens. One preferring to be male the other female that have been on earth for thousands of years. One is evil the other is good. They are united in the common goal of an artifact found in the water that might unlock the secret of one, or both. Also we must deal with the people caught in the crossfire of two very powerful beings.It has all the Haldeman touches, exotic locals, a near future and some gritty scenes.Using aliens to comment on the human condition is one of the oldest plots out there (but lets face it there are no new ones) the trick is the spin and presentation each writer gives and Haldeman gives a good one.The ending was touching and funny. Oddly enough I could see this as a James Cameron movie.The book is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"I think I'm about done buying books by Haldeman. The Forever War is deservedly a classic but I've never been completely happy with any of his books since, and this one is no exception.The story follows 2 immortal aliens from the time they arrive on Earth until they meet up in what seems to be the books main story line. One alien, dubbed the \\"changeling\\" is addicted to violence and can only take the form of male humans. The other, called the \\"chameleon\\" can take any form at all. At one point in the story it becomes a piece of linoleum flooring, and at another point we learn that it spent some time as a TV set! What seems to be the main story line concerns the recovery of what is believed to be an alien spacecraft from the bottom of the Pacific. However almost the entire story is devoted to the history of out 2 aliens, including an improbable love affair between the chameleon and the main human researcher.Maybe it's a problem with me, but I was not expecting the real story to start until the 2 aliens met up in the present day. Instead that's where it ends.I put my books into 2 categories, those I read once and pass on and those I keep and read over many times. This book falls into the first one."},{"Title":"Camouflage","review":"Hot alien babeomorph seduces nerd scientist to get near priceless treasure only to be semi-waylaid by evil billionaire immortal whilst buffeted by the passions of unintended xenoromance.Good stuff!"},{"Title":"Grantville Gazette II","review":"Grantville Gazette II follows the unusual format introduced in GG (I): short story and novela fictions that explain or will impact the big picture of the novels in the same \\"world of 1632\\" series. And following them with several factual articles laying out narrow technical details of the \\"1632\\" world that is faced by modern West Virginia townfolk who were suddenly transported back four centuries to Germany in the middle of the Thirty Years War. The series is now also called the \\"Ring of Fire\\" after the manner in which these \\"up-timers\\" arrived in \\"down-time\\" Germany. \\"Assiti Shards\\" is somehow connected to it, but has no present meaning.The longest story here is about the reform of medical education in Germany as it existed in the 17th century. A fierce academic struggle ensues to meld it with modern \\"miraculous\\" knowledge that has, unfortunately but predictably, run out of its modern supplies and lacks the industry to easily replace them. While clearly off the \\"main line\\" of the grand political confrontations presented in the novels set in the \\"1632\\" world, a story like this illustrates the great value of the GG anthologies. Inclusion of such details would clearly bog down the already big novels, far beyond the many necessary asides on historical matters they already contain. Yet these short stories answer the very questions that are asked by fascinated readers of the series. In fact, the articles, and stories, are submitted by readers online, and edited to conform with and advance the overall saga. The series is an intellectual adventure in Alternate History, full of yes, how would I have done that, moments. The stories are also fun when recognizable European \\"real\\" people of those distant times pop up, like Galileo or Cromwell.Although not excessively militarized, these stories often have the prose of military fiction: can-do, go-get-em, optimistically cynical, capsulized, declarative prose. Nothing wasted on evocative description, ambiance, atmosphere, flawed characters, or fancy words. Nor are they in the least amateurish, strongly edited by Eric Flint, who has become the choreographer of the series.I would expect more anxiety and desperation in these stories, and the series. Surely there was constant danger around these \\"colonists\\" from another time. Humor is laced through the stories, okay, but the characters also seem little worried by the harsh forces around them. Maybe short stories cannot be expected always to acknowledge those wider problems, but the later novels also lack this element of suspense. The uptime Americans and their allies don't seem to lose even the little schemes or conflicts. The enemies are obviously \\"bad,\\" often over the top evil, while the good guys cleverly triangulate the fundamental forces, but of course are never sneaky. They are suitable paragons for teenage readers. All the good W. Va. union men who lead Grantville act like they only manipulate situations and never busted a head. One never has the sense of grit, dread or awe one finds in Bernard Cornwell's books of continental conflict.In GG factual articles are presented in a more or less accessible style. Allthough they can be skipped by those interested only in the \\"action,\\" at no loss to understanding the action, they provide a depth of research that the authors of the fiction observe and that enlarges the novels in particular. For example, there is a wonderful discussion of the obstacles the up-timers will have finding their essential modern ores and minerals in medieval Germany. That article reviews the new geological setting of Grantville, and what its inhabitants could potentially find to sustain the industries necessary to withstanding and overcoming many hostile political and economic forces. \\"Wonderful\\" at least to natural scientists among the readers. However, it becomes clear that the manpower, skills and knowledge needed will have to involve the recruitment of native local people if the 3500 Americans have any hope of surviving and flourishing, and then bringing democracy and wealth to millions in Europe. These considerations will constrain how and when characters will make guns, bullets, containers, ships, and railroad steel, and why we won't see metal aeroplanes any time soon--even if these ground facts are not explicitly written in to future stories. I hope in future the GG will present some actual short biographies of the leading historical down-timers. Of course authors wouldn't want to give away what might be coming up in future stories (although those must increasingly vear from the historical record, mustn't they, now that up-timers have contaminated \\"our\\" history)."},{"Title":"Movements of Magic: The Spirit of T'Ai-Chi-Ch'Uan","review":"Very good.

Then I thought of the floating bridges that the folk at the Department of Transportation seem to like. I would have been disappointed if these bridges hadn't been included in this book. But they were, along with a bunch of other bridges that have failed also. One failed when a herd of sheep crossed it. Another when fireworks set it on fire. Earthquakes and the eruption of Mt. St. Helens caused more to fail. Then there was the one where a forty ton logging truck attempted to cross a bridge designed for a five ton load.But enough about failed bridges. This is really a book on the hundreds of other bridges around the State of Washington. Some of these are magnificant structures. A lot are surprisingly different, one bridge for instance that was bought war surplus. And I didn't realize that there were still three wooden covered bridges in the state.This is mostly a picture book, with just enough technical description as to the types of bridges to make it even more interesting. A lot of these bridges would make a good weekend excursion trip to go see. If you're interested in this sort of thing, this is a most interesting book.

There always seem to be a few barbs thrown at any sincerely Christian author, causing me to question the motives and credibility of PW. In the case of Beth Moore's book, one of the sour comments made by the PW reviewer was that this book lacks \\"zing.\\" Perhaps the reviewer confused this book with their own writing, because Beth Moore brings her usual stellar style to this book. And what Beth Moore has captured here in the substance of her book is the fundamental difference between believing that there is a God (something that even Satan believes) and actually *believing* God. Such belief, which produces tangible action, presupposes that there is a relationship between us and God, and that communication proceeds out of that relationship. This book will inspire the reader to draw closer to God...to get to know Him and His voice better. Moore also invites the reader to live a life of adventure, faith, and meaning, by knowing and following One in Whom we can trust. It's another winning work from Moore; a bracing read filled with great wisdom that, if heeded, will result in many benefits for the reader and for the ones the reader touches in their daily lives."},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"We all claim to believe in God, but how often do we actually believe God? Do we take his words to heart, believe in His promises to us, and His ability to make miracles happen? Beth Moore, the director of Living Proof Ministries in Texas, uses the biblical story of the Israelites wandering in the desert for forty years searching for the promised land as a metaphor for our own lives. The goal of \\"Believing God\\" is \\"to encourage any Christian who will listen to move to his or her personalized place of divine promise and to flourish.\\" Moore does not define this \\"promised land\\" as a life of ease or wealth, but rather as the place where we fulfill the destiny God put us here to accomplish. As we cooperate with God and God's plan for us, our lives take on greater meaning and we achieve an inner peace.Moore encourages everyone to make a five statement pledge of faith: \\"1) God is who He says He is, 2) God can do what He says He can do, 3) I am who God says I am, 4) I can do all things through Christ, and 5) God's Word is alive and active in me.\\" Several of the chapters of \\"Believing God\\" are dedicated to exploring each of these statements in greater detail. All five are powerful and have incredible ramifications for our lives, but perhaps the most life-changing statement is \\"I am who God says I am.\\" As Moore states, \\"I tend to want to rewrite it, 'I strive to be who God says I am.' Nope. That's not what the Word says. It says I'm already who God says I am.\\" And so, who are we? In Ephesians 1:3-8, we discover that we are \\"blessed, chosen, adopted, favored, redeemed and forgiven.\\" Moore also maintains that God tends to purposely put us in situations that force us to face our insecurities because God wants to weed them out of us.After discussing the five statements of faith, Moore turns her attention to helping the reader discover her promised land. She explores the importance of Scripture in our lives. She also encourages us to explore our own history with God in order to discover that God has been faithful to us. Lastly, she maintains that there will be moments of wonderful revelation, but that most days, following God and believing God means doing the basics - prayer, worship, and giving. By living our lives in tune with God we can have confidence in a \\"long-term victory.\\"\\"Believing God\\" is a powerful book. It forces the reader to take another look at a faith that she may have taken for granted. It encourages all of us to make \\"faith\\" an action rather than a noun. Most importantly, it can help us become the people God intended us to be.Reviewed by Patrice Fagnant-MacArthur, editor of \\"The Spiritual Woman Newsletter\\" (http://www.spiritualwoman.net) and author of \\"Letters to Mary from a Young Mother\\" (iUniverse, 2004)"},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"Have you wondered why so few Christians live a victorious Christian life?

I thought would save the seven bucks and get the CDs instead of the MP3 (which is usually cheaper). What a mistake! I imported it to itunes and found to my great dismay that there is no digital labeling whatsoever, except \\"track 01\\", \\"track 02\\", etc. No author, not even a title for the book. And there are 99 tracks per disc!! I guess the publisher thought it would be more convenient for CD listeners to bookmark it at 45 second intervals, but not so for iPod!I don't know if the MP3 has a better labeling system, but my advice is to spring for the extra $7 and save a lot of time if you are going to put this on your iPod."},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"I ordered a Beth Moore Bible study workbook.

Principles of believing God (who He says you are, what you can do through Christ, God's Word is powerful, put God's Word in your mouth and spirit, etc.).4. We can trust God for all eternity.5.

It brings me closer to walking with Him every day. However, I bought it thinking it was for the bible study and so had to turn around and buy the Bible Study work book to go along with the video presentation.So it would have helped me to know that this was NOT for the Bible Study.

Built on solid biblical truths it is the kind of work that accurately divides the word and encourages your spirit. I love it!"},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read about living the Christian life and want to read more by Beth Moore. She is so straightforward and Biblical. Her examples are very helpful and she is so honest about her own life experiences which gives the reader hope for his own life. She said at the beginning of the book that whoever is reading it, it is no accident. How right she is! This book was very needful at this time in my life and I'm sure many others who have read it feel the same way.I will be passing some of the concepts on to others who really need encouragement at this time."},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"i came upon this book at just the right time in my life ...when i was struggling to believe that God had a plan for me ... this book brought hope through her sharing her personal experiences that were so relate-able... that i was reminded again that God is good and involved in every detail of our lives... and that sometimes we go through experiences that we never thought we could ever endure...so that God can show us more of Himself...and we can love and trust Him more...all this and MORE just from this book.Beth Moore rocks!"},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"I have done several other studies by Beth Moore and wanted to read a book, just on my own.

I have honestly GROWN from reading and studying this book. It creates change. Loved it !"},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"For someone who has been a \\"believer\\" for years I was skeptical about how much of an influence this book would make on me. I realize that while I have believed in God all this time, much of my fears, insecurity, and spiritual turmoil is due to the fact that I don't truly believe him. Beth Moore has an amazing way of connecting with women, making time with the Lord meaningful and entertaining."},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"This is an excellent book. The material is biblically sound and very uplifting and encouraging. There is so much information to absorb that it would be beneficial to read this book 2-3 times to really retain it. I would recommend this book to any Bible-believing Christian that is looking for a deeper and more satisfying walk with the Lord. Beth Moore is a captivating and compelling author. When you read the book, you feel as though you are sitting in the same room with Beth chatting over a cup of coffee. She is so real and down-to-earth in her writing and it is very easy to relate to her experiences. Definately five stars."},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"The product worked great.

She challenges you to push past the status quo and gives reasons why we can expect greatness. Finally!"},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"This book is a tremendous blessing that the body of Christ so desperately needs.

Get this book if you really want to draw close to God. It changed me and people around me because I couldn't help but share what I learned."},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"This workbook was created to accompany the DVD series by Beth Moore. I think it would be good even without the DVD's, as it includes a lot of commentary by Beth Moore. I like it for group use because it also includes a lot of scripture references to research. Very well done."},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"Beth Moore is a Christian Bible teacher who makes no bones about her own frailty and struggles with faith. I find her Bible studies all the more powerful because of her humility and constant redirection of the reader from herself to her Lord. The basis of the book is the life changing difference between believing IN God and believing God- when He says He loves you, says who He is and what He has done and will do and when He says who you are as His child. I found this book profoundly helpful on a day-to-day basis, and its principles have stayed with me long after it went onto my shelf."},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"I bought two books for my husband and I to work on. I have done Beth Moore's study on the fruits of the spirit and loved it. I thought both of us would enjoy this study (even though these are \\"women's\\" bible studies). I got the workbooks and started working on the first lesson and was disappointed to discover you need to video series to do the study, a very expensive option if you are working on it individually or as a couple. You can stream the videos through the LifeWay website for $25 (this unpublished option is by far the cheapest one and I only found this out after calling the Beth Moore offices in Houston). But I don't recommend buying the book unless you are in a larger study. Unfortunately it seems the Beth Moore ministry has become video heavy and is very expensive for everyone except large wealthy churches."},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"I would definately recommend this book to anyone wanting to obtain a deeper faith in God. Whether you are new to Christianity or have studied God's Word for years, I believe you will enjoy and be deeply effected by this study."},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"This bible study is a must for anyone who is living in resignation and need to get a better biblical view of faith. I recommend this to any believer who really loves God yet their theology doesn't match their reality."},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"Beth Moore's best book for me! In Beth Moore fashion, lot's of biblical passages to drive home her point. This book has impressed on me to really believe that all the promises in the Bible are absolutely true and true for me personally. Highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"Do you want to know the God of the Bible? This is a Bible study that will increase your perception of Who God really is. If you can define God, then you don't know YHWH. This study helps open your heart and mind to see how awesome the God of the Bible is."},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"this book is fantastic, it makes me think, stretches me and gives me a chance to grow in my faith, Beth Moore has a way of speaking so openly and honestly that even when i am convicted i am happy to hear it. No judgement, just love and a way to move forward in my relationship with Jesus."},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"Although this DOES use a DVD of the Believing God series, we are going to attempt it without and I think it will work just fine. Love hearing and reading Beth Moore-we are believing for something good from this study:)"},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"I love Beth's insight and style of writing. She is frank, fun and thought provoking. I fell in love with her after reading her book &#34;Get Out of The Pit&#34;.

I'd highly recommend it to every women's Bible Study group. The videos that go along with the study are wonderful...Beth Moore has such an amazing gift for teaching the Word and speaking to women's hearts."},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"I had heard a lot of good things about Beth Moore's books, but had never read one. Someone recommended this book as a favorite of hers. I can see why! It is incredibly helpful. It is easy to read and keeps the reader engaged. I am using it as the basis of a new women's Bible Study and we will hold our third session this evening. It is the kind of book almost any Christian would find helpful no matter what their background."},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"I am really enjoying Beth Moore's book on believing God. It is full of helpful information to bring me to a place to \\"believe the God I believe in\\"."},{"Title":"Believing God","review":"Beth Moore's Believing God book will revive anybody's faith in God, including those who think they do not need a faith revival, aka myself. Lol. On a more serious note, I highly recommend this book to be used in an at-home Bible study group, which I did with 2 other people in my group. The breakthroughs we had were incredibly amazing and we have 2 more weeks left! Beth Moore seems to be well-researched on this topic and I love how she relates Old Testament stories to current faith and expectancy in God."},{"Title":"Adventures of Ideas","review":"There are four parts to this text: &quot;Sociological,&quot; &quot;Cosmological,&quot; &quot;Philosophical,&quot; and &quot;Civilization.&quot; The first part is a history of how ideas, especially moral ideas, have influenced the progress of civilization. Whitehead is by training mathematician and by nature a philosopher, not a historian. As a consequence, he covers a great deal of historical ground at a high level of generality which, in Whitehead's case, I consider a virtue. He has a beautiful, long-term perspective; his account of the transition from a world in which slavery was taken for granted to one in which it is no longer legitimate, and the role that the ideas of Platonism and Christianity played in that 2500 year transition, makes me quite optimistic about the long-term possibility of humane progress in the world.I describe the first section in depth because it is among the more accessible pieces of Whitehead's writing. The remainder of the book calls upon his unique metaphysical perspective to some extent, and is thus more of a struggle for the casual reader. It, too, is beautiful and valuable for those who are willing to learn how to read Whitehead, but it is not easy. Buy the book for the first part, then if you like Whitehead's highly idiosyncratic view of reality, train yourself to read the rest of the book.Personally, although Whitehead has fallen out of favor of academic philosophers for most of this century, I think that his work is more likely to be read 200 years from now than are most other works written this century. Whitehead is definitely thinking of the big picture with a certain serene timelessness. Far more people should be exposed to his 20th century articulation of the eternal search for the True, the Good, and the Beautiful (and the Adventure)."},{"Title":"Adventures of Ideas","review":"Whitehead was the foremost twentieth-century advocate of Process Philosophy--he called it &quot;The Philosophy of Organism&quot;--the conviction that reality is composed of processes rather than of substances or matter.Students of process thought frequently focus on Whitehead's major work, _Process and Reality_, sometimes to the neglect of his other books. But Whitehead's thought was, fittingly, in continual flux; and _Adventures of Ideas_, written after _Process and Reality_, contains new themes which, some would say, provide needed correctives to some of the notions in Whitehead's earlier books. _Adventures of Ideas_ is also considerably more readable than _Process and Reality_. It should not be passed over."},{"Title":"Adventures of Ideas","review":"Excellently written. I was somewhat fan of Whitehead's philosophical ideas before I picked up this book. However, since I started reading this book I have become quite fascinated by his works. I recommend this book for all who seek knowledge or would like to further their command over making an inquiry into pre thought process."},{"Title":"Adventures of Ideas","review":"I will admit frankly that I am a total beginner when it comes to Whitehead. This is the first book of his I have read, and like many of the other reviewer's on this thread, I found parts of it quite difficult. Whitehead was a highly original thinker and seems to have a vocabulary that is largely his own. It can, therefore, be daunting for the newcomer.But the mark of a successful book in my opinion is that it inspires one to want to learn more. Reading this book, I think, will convince just about anyone that Whitehead has something both important and profound to say that is well worth studying. As I make more progress in that task myself I intend to update my review.***Also, if anyone on here has any suggestions for good books about Whitehead please post a response to this review. I have had trouble finding good secondary sources on Whitehead which makes the task of mastering his thought even more difficult***"},{"Title":"Adventures of Ideas","review":"I have not yet finished reading this book. I have been too busy making notes, checking reference, and highlighting interesting concepts it offers.It's been a long time since I read a book that really makes me think.So far, it's the best retirement investment I have made.Strongly recommanded for anybody who likes to read."},{"Title":"Adventures of Ideas","review":"The thought in this book is profound and enlightening, the style and language are clear enough, but I found it unbearably hard going to get through it."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to Randolph Scott?","review":"Empire Publishing presents \\"Whatever Happened to Randolph Scott?\\", telling the inside story of George Randolph Scott...born January 23. 1898 in Orange County, Virginia...left us March 2. 1987 in Los Angeles, California written by his son C.H.

This book was not disappointing to me at all. As far as the book about his sex life, gee it is funny that this author chose to write this after BOTH actors were dead. People forget that when Cary Grant and Randolph Scott were living together, it was not socially acceptable to be living with women when you were not married to them . I hardly think that if they had a problem, Randolph Scott would not have been married for 45 years to one woman and look at how many times Cary Grant was married. I was not a \\"Grant\\" fan but I sure respected Mr. Scott and how he kept his private life to himself. To me, Randolph Scott was the best looking man I have ever seen and he only got better with age. Then there was that quiet, gentleman nature about him that not another Actor in these days has. Do I love and respect him, Yes, I do. Thanks to his son also for sharing his love and respect for his father."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to Randolph Scott?","review":"Originally published as \\"In the Footsteps of the Giant,\\" (and listed on amazon.com under that title as well), this is a loving tribute of a son for his father. It is not at all a revelatory book, nor in any sense a biography of interest to film scholars. It earnestly refutes rumors regarding Scott's sexual orientation, but unfortunately does so only by calling the rumors ugly and baseless. I personally find the rumors less than convincing, but this book by Scott fils is not part of why I don't believe them. There is less insight into Randolph Scott than one would have liked here, and perhaps a little more about the son than the average film student needs. But it's a valuable book nonetheless, simply because it's one of the few pebbles in the gaping hole where a book-length study of Scott's life and career should be."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to Randolph Scott?","review":"This loving remembrance of a son for his father is a good read; it allows a person into the home and life of an American Icon in the movie industry. Although Randolph Scott never won an academy award, he indeed gave every acting role the BEST he had, and the average movie go-er who loved westerns knows what to expect when Scott appears on the screen. With the commentary of his son relating incident after incident of his growing up, and the personal pictures collected in this book, one gets an idea of what the man was like, as a father, and as a person in general. If anyone is in anyway interested in actors or the Hollywood of the early to middle and late part of the 20th century I recommend this book. There is a filmography as well."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to Randolph Scott?","review":"I looked forward to reading this book since there are just a few titles on legendary actor Randolph Scott. Once in hand, I was very disappointed at the lack of biographical content and the simple prose of the author. You are going to need a great deal of patience to get through the simple tales of the author's interactions with his father. As a previous reviewer stated, this is really a tribute by the author to his father and not a biography of Randolph Scott, doesn't even get to first base."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to Randolph Scott?","review":"Written by Randolph Scott's son, this book gives us an inside look at a truly wonderful man, his passions, his films, his devotion to his family, friends and his craft. If you're looking for a &quot;Who Slept With Who,&quot; you won't find it here."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to Randolph Scott?","review":"The author did not answer his own question... Whatever happened to Scott after he stopped acting? Why was he so reclusive and so on? The author himself does not know.The author testifies that his father was wonderful and dignified man, but what would most people write about their fathers? It seems that the son was quite distant from his father, because it was in his father's nature to be distant from everyone and everything.C.H. Scott is preoccupied with one thing only in this book: refuting rumor about his father and Cary Grant. I sympathize with the author. But if he meant to fight against &quot;the slander&quot;, then he fails. Instead of being factual and objective in his refute, he just keeps coming back to the issue with his childish arguments. As the result this book is THE MOST BORING READ ever!!!The author talks about his own life too much. If this book was titled: &quot;Me and My Dad, Randolph Scott&quot;, it would have been appropriate. There aren't even any good photos, except for &quot;the young George Randolph Scott in his family house&quot;. The author should have taken a lesson from his father: When you have nothing to say, DON'T SAY ANYTHING!"},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to Randolph Scott?","review":"This book was disappointing. I was expecting a Randolph Scott biography. What I got was a loving tribute to a father by his son. As C.H. Scott wrote, &quot;This is an account of my relationship with my father, the thoughts we shared and the experiences I had with him.&quot; If I deleted Randolph Scott's name from the book, I could just as easily have been reading about my own father. The reader will learn little about Randolph Scott, other than he was a good father whose son loved/loves him."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to Randolph Scott?","review":"As one who needed to clear cerebral cobwebs formed while I watched, as a boy in the 50's, Randolph Scott in Saturday westerns, I was tantalized by every chapter of What Ever Happened to Randolph Scott?. To add to this reader's exasperation with this mysteriously superficial biography, Randolph Scott's adopted son states at several points that Randolph's life was much more complex than the son is willing to reveal out of respect to Randolph's wife and friends. My guess is that Randolph's family still controls what is by all accounts a fabulous estate; thus both their own as well as Randolph's privacy interests will live on. If the family will not cooperate with an effort to substantiate and compile a definitive biography, there is virtually no chance that the son will ever be able to tell us more.Nonetheless, my curiousity was relieved and I am grateful for crumbs.Alexander Witkowski"},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to Randolph Scott?","review":"This is a wonderfully written book about a very private actor. C.H. Scott confirms that Randolph Scott was the same person off screen as on. C.H. Scott also displays great respect for his family in showing a glimpse of their personal life while still maintaing the level of privacy that was so important to his father."},{"Title":"English 2200 With Writing Applications: A Programmed Course in Grammar and Usage : Tests","review":"Programmed learning appeals to all age levels. There is no anxiety nor confusion as one turns rapidly through this book. I have used this book with children who could read at the age of 7 and have received positive comments from adults who had missed a firm grounding in grammar. ESL learners also can profit from the guidance inherent in a programmed text."},{"Title":"English 2200 With Writing Applications: A Programmed Course in Grammar and Usage : Tests","review":"This book is great, differnt way of reading, which takes a bit of getting used to, but a fantastic book one we will always refer back to and use all the time..."},{"Title":"English 2200 With Writing Applications: A Programmed Course in Grammar and Usage : Tests","review":"I first used one of these books in high school over 10 years ago.

I guess I shouldve tried harder in school and in college."},{"Title":"Step into Xcode","review":"I am currently more than halfway through this book now and already I can say that I am very happy with my purchase.Firstly, this is not a programming how-to book. Plus, I don't think it should be your first Mac development book. The purpose of this book is to provide you with a solid understanding of the Xcode tool and to teach you some smart application design methods. I recommend that you start reading this book already knowing some Objective-C and Cocoa (at least a little anyway) because you will take with you so much more than just how to use the Xcode tool. Actually, without any Cocoa programming knowledge, you may just end up confused. The reason I say this is because the examples use intermediate to advanced Cocoa programs to illustrate Xcode as you advance through the book.This book starts you off with some background information about what happens when you compile a Cocoa application, how the runtime system works and some basic debugging skills. It then instructs the reader to build a command line tool which eventually buds into a mature Cocoa application as the chapters go by, each chapter adding a major feature to the application while introducing additional Xcode features as you go. Some of the Xcode features that I've already learned include: Including a command line tool in a project as a target dependency, how to build and include a static BSD library in a project, using Text Macros to add language-specific code patterns to the Xcode menus, I've expanded my knowledge of Cocoa bindings, how to include a framework target, working with dynamic libraries and more.Follow the examples! I was actually pleasantly surprised at the Cocoa skills I've learned simply from the examples' code. They are not typical. I've already assimilated the following intermediate to advanced Cocoa programming skills: Calling a command line tool from a Cocoa app using pipes and tasks, building and calling functions from a BDC static library, design skills that promote code decoupling and mixing C and Obj-C conventions together.I do have some gripes: Technical errors! I've never written a book but how difficult is it to make sure that the samples work once you reach the end of a chapter? And I'm not talking about the intentional errors the author left in the code that are later fixed. For example, in one chapter the book instructed me to add 3 object controllers in Interface Builder. By the end of the chapter the program didn't run because I was never instructed to configure one of the three controllers. I went back to make sure I didn't miss anything. I was able to figure it out myself after some time (another reason you should not be a newbie reading this book) but this error and others should not have made it into the book. Don't authors proof read their own work or at least have a couple of other people read the book and try out the examples? Sheesh!Also, be warned. I have yet to find any errata or contact info for the author for this book. So if you need help, you may not find any.This book is an easy read. No nonsense and straight to the point. Most chapters are between 10 and 20 pages, which provides you with plenty of opportunity to stop, rest and take in what you've just read.I wanted to rate this book ***1/2 for the errors and lack of help, but I can't give half-stars here. This book doesn't deserve 3 stars, so I gave it a 4.Note [16-MAR-2006]: Wouldn't you know it, I just found the official Step Into Xcode web site complete with downloadable code, errata and author contact info! Here it is: http://six.manoverboard.org/ I now officially increase this books rating from ***1/2 to ****. :)"},{"Title":"Step into Xcode","review":"I'm most of the way through this book and have been losing interest since the first chapter. This book suffers from 3 fatal flaws: incomplete instruction, nonexistent trouble shooting, and poor code design. The first is very frustraiting, if you learn by doing and try to write the code in the book instead of just looking at the included code, you will quickly find your code does not work because the author omitted entire functions from the book. When learning to walk you will stumble, good intro books should account for that and provide you with the means to pull yourself up. This book provides no help to handle problems and you will make many, with the incomplete information along with the general disconnected nature of objective-C & cocoa you, like me may find yourself spending most of your time with this book debugging rather then learning. Finally as a veteran programmer in Win32, Linux, & embedded systems, I found the author's software design sensibilities to be lacking. Functions seem shoved in to classes for little reason, simple data objects took on complex IO functionality; these poor practices are touted by the author as examples of good Mac programming.In summary I cannot recommend this book, its shortcomings make it difficult to work with, and these difficulties make it nearly impossible to learn from this book."},{"Title":"Step into Xcode","review":"Fritz Anderson really does a great job covering the ins and outs of Xcode in this book. If you are going to program on the Mac, the in-depth information in this book is a necessity! There are real programming examples to follow along with each chapter, and plenty of screenshots to describe what's going on. I'm glad I purchased \\"Step Into Xcode,\\" and it has earned a spot on my bookshelf along with Aaron Hillegass's \\"Cocoa Programming\\" and Stephen Kochan's \\"Programming in Objective-C\\"."},{"Title":"Step into Xcode","review":"As to a recommendation, I'd say yes. Step into Xcode is most valuable to those getting started with Xcode, but even for people who have been using it for a little while you are sure to pick up a few tips and tricks."},{"Title":"Step into Xcode","review":"I bought this book thinking that it might be a nice step by step tutorial for the Cocoa and XCode development platform. It turns out to be not much of an introduction to anything.Maybe it is just a personality difference or a difference in my learning style versus the style of the book, but I really hated it. Right off the bat, I could not bring myself to care anything at all about the project for the book. I found the whole thing to be a big, confusing, dreadfully boring mess.I can see that the book covers some interesting features of XCode. It is a shame that the book is not interesting at all for me. I could not sit and read it or get motivated to follow along. Of course, everyone is different. Maybe you will find it to be a real page turner for positive reasons.Maybe down the road I will find that this book has some value as a reference. It is also possible that this is simply the worst book I've read so far on the subject, but I have to admit that it has a great cover!"},{"Title":"Step into Xcode","review":"This book covers a lot of ground - great for beginning Xcoders, especially CodeWarrior converts. Not quite as in-depth as I thought it would be, based on the description, but well worth the price."},{"Title":"Mad Dog Summer and Other Stories","review":"As a fan of Joe R. Lansdale, I look forward to each new release with relish. Sometimes, however, these releases are difficult for a man of modest means to acquire, especially when several of Lansdale's works are published by small press publisher Subterranean Press. For a standard hardback release, Mad Dog Summer and Other Stories has a rather high price tag: $40 retail (Amazon and other sellers often offer a discount, but even that is usually not enough).So imagine my surprise when I came across this signed limited edition collection of eight fiction pieces (four short stories alternating with four novellas, each with an introduction from the author \\"hisownself\\") in the library! I couldn't have been more excited, literarily speaking. Mad Dog Summer and Other Stories turns out to be a bit of a mixed bag, however. Although I like Lansdale's short work, in general its more uneven than his novels. The same occurs here: Two of the four short pieces fall short of ideal, which all four novellas are worthy of celebration.\\"The Mule Rustlers\\" is all about taking fictional revenge on whomever stole Lansdale's own mule years ago. It has a lot of the same great features of other Lansdale fiction, but the unfair ending leaves a bad taste. \\"Screwup,\\" on the other hand, is pure fun to read. A loser gets in over his head and spends the rest of the time just digging himself deeper while trying to get out of trouble. There's not much in the way of backstory or character development, just one event after another leading up to an ironic, but entirely appropriate, ending, but you won't care. (This is the second story Lansdale has written with his wife, Karen. The first, \\"A Change of Lifestyle,\\" is available in Bumper Crop.)\\"Veil's Visit\\" was written with Andrew Vachss, a practicing lawyer as well as a writer, who wanted the opportunity to fictionally \\"defend\\" Leonard Pine (of Lansdale's Hap and Leonard series of novels) of a crime he committed in more than one of those books. It's short and has an obvious agenda, but until the next Hap and Leonard novel comes along, it's do. Later, Lansdale remembers his mother, and how she influenced his life, in \\"O'Reta, Snapshot Memories.\\" Like the title says, it's not a linear narrative, but the author fills the prose with such genuine emotion that it's easy to get swept up in it.\\"Way Down There\\" combines cartoons with comic books, Jules Verne with Edgar Rice Burroughs, all with that inimitable Lansdale stamp. A special group of friends go to Hell to rescue Satan (it makes sense in the story) and learn a lot about the underworld along the way. It even includes references for further reading, assuming you've got the right kind of library.I tried to read some Philip Jose Farmer once and just couldn't get into it. But Lansdale calls him his \\"outright favorite\\" (though he does admit to Farmer's unevenness) and wrote \\"The Steam Man of the Prairie and the Dark Rider Get Down\\" in tribute. It's a sci-fi Western, complete with metal men, talking ape folk, and rips in the space-time continuum right alongside crusty, meat-eating, livestock-screwing people of the land. Throw in astronauts, torture, and a hearty dose of cannibalism, and you got a wild ride that surprises at every turn. After this recommendation, I may just have to give Farmer another try.\\"The Big Blow\\" just may be a perfect story. Set during the Galveston hurricane of 1900, it offers action, sex, violence, cleansing, redemption, and a small dose of history, as it happens to typically Lansdalean characters. Centering around a boxing match between John McBride and \\"Lil\\" Arthur Johnson (later to be called Jack), it's a real action piece, its 56 pages flying past like roundhouse punches. The characters and setting feel impressively realistic, and the plot is entirely believable. I had read it once before, when it came around in rotation on the Free Stories section of the author's website, and it's even better the second time around. I could imagine visiting \\"The Big Blow\\" yet again, and I'm not much for re-reading.The title novella is the last piece in Mad Dog Summer and Other Stories. Fans of Lansdale's Edgar Allan Poe Award-winning The Bottoms may recognize it as the inspiration for that novel. It was originally written to order for publication in Al Sarrantonio's Bram Stoker Award-winning 999 anthology, but Lansdale felt that this story of a young boy's search for a serial killer in the Sabine River Bottoms of East Texas during the Great Depression deserved to be expanded.A warning: if you have any intention of reading The Bottoms, skip \\"Mad Dog Summer.\\" They're the same story with the same solution. That said, the novella is an ideal way for fans of the novel to revisit the experience without the same time commitment. I got lucky in being able to read Mad Dog Summer and Other Stories, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to fans of the \\"champion mojo storyteller.\\" It's also a fine place to start for the newcomer, as it gives a look at the author's ability to span genres without losing his own special touch that keeps his readers coming back time and time again."},{"Title":"Mad Dog Summer and Other Stories","review":"Just received this book yesterday and sorting my way throughsome familiar and the off the wall gems. When you pick up Joe R.Lansdale short stories you won't find the same old stories,you'll find some good life lessons and hard luck, some shockand laughs and down home tales, usually from a very twisted perspective at times. Always top notch stories. I especiallyenjoyed joe's expanded novel several years ago, \\"THE BIG BLOW\\", with everybody's eyes wide open to hurricanes(this year) this is a good timeto read Joe's take on the most massive early century hurricane and the story of a boxer's inner battles. The combination is a knockout! Also included is one of my two very favorite Lansdaleyarns, (novella size also) called \\"Mad Dog Summer\\", which is about as good a story to read as they come by, Lansdale style.This is a newer turn Joe's taken off the path over the past several years. Stylized from a generation or two once removed, writing in a vein much like the great Lee novel, \\"To kill a mockingbird\\" yet purely all Lansdale, this is an award winning novella(as was the full length fully realized \\"The Bottoms\\"(Edgar Award winner) from which this was spawned, a story that you won't soonforget and I'm glad its the title tale and back out. This should be standard reading in all schools across this country,its that good,(should have won a Pulitzer for such a compelingpiece of fiction). Even though Joe's moved away from some of his earlier shock and awe tales, he never quite lets us offthe hook when it comes to in your face gritty reality and that to mehas always been one of his greatest gifts, he know how to pack a big punch with his words without going overboard with 1000 page novels (and short stories). These stories are made to be savored and readmany times over the years, enjoy them, I sure am. Its also nice to see Joe pay tribute to his mother and share his views at thesame time. Joe's a BIG supporter of children and it all startswith good parents-teachers and values, another reason I've always foundhis stories to be REAL, regardless of their style."},{"Title":"The Power, Passion & Pain of Black Love","review":"The author made excellent points about the relationships among African-Americans.

It's funny now as I agonized over parting with the $9.00, which included shipping, for all three cookbooks. In looking back I could have paid $100 or more as these books have been faithful companions throughout my cooking journey. I love cooking; I've planned parties for 4 to 1,000 guests; I've written cooking columns for three newspapers, and two of my own cookbooks, but after all these years I still find myself referring to the BC Dinner in a Dish when I'm in the mood for comfort food like Sombrero Pie, Chicken Dinner Pie or Arroz Con Pollo...yum!

This in turn will make you feel more comfortable when you hire a surveyor to meet an insurance requirement or to evaluate things you don't feel competent to do yourself.This book does a great job explaining how glass is laid up, the different types of glass, mat, roving, etc, and where they should be used. Common problems found in fiberglass boats such as blistering are discussed with lots of surprising information.I've found that my personal experiences confirmed many of the points made by the author. Like the myth that fresh water boats are better than salt water. Contrasted with fresh water boats are more likely to have blister problems than saltwater.Today, many people come to me with questions about boats. As I write this review, I realize that many of the answers I give out come out of information I found in this book.I don't believe you have to have a survey on a boat to make an intelligent purchase decision. In part, because some of the surveyors are only interested in your money, and do not look boats over thoroughly. A properly educated individual can do most or all of his, or her, own survey.Some surveyors are very good, and some are very bad. How can you tell if someone is good or not?To become a surveyor some certifying organizations only require a couple of sample copies of surveys done and that you have a few books on your bookshelf. What a joke!I personally know of a real case, which happened in 1999, where an old survey was pulled up, the date changed and it was reused without any a new survey being actually done. This is a good reason to choose your own surveyor and not the one recommended by the seller.Going aloft and checking the rigging on a boat is not easy. Is it not surprising that important steps like these get skipped.Some surveyor's haven't read this book--so how good can they be? Contrast this with someone who has taken a 8 week course on surveying, holds a USCG license, and grew up on boats. This is the kind of person you want for a surveyor.It is up to you to be knowledgeable enough to make your own decisions-including choosing a surveyor if you feel you need one. This book will help you do that.Educate yourself. Being able to look a boat over to evaluate it for purchase is an important skill. This book is a good starting point. It is cheap insurance and worth the price."},{"Title":"Surveying Fiberglass Sailboats: A Step-By-Step Guide for Buyers and Owners","review":"Mustin gives a lot of good information in doing your own survey for that boat you have your eye on. I would never recommend not having a professional survey, but this book guides you through a lot of information with good pictures and sketches.

I felt that I could gauge the safety and useability of all the major systems of the boat within reason..is it safe, does it work properly, etc.I didn't always understand the why behind some analyses, but the average person can easily use the book to a) perform a basic survey on an inexpensive boat, or b) winnow the acceptable from the unaccptable before paying a professional to complete a thorough survey."},{"Title":"Surveying Fiberglass Sailboats: A Step-By-Step Guide for Buyers and Owners","review":"Henry does it in one 3 1/2 hour setting - completely.

His real world experience dealing with the problems of fiberglass boats and his discuss of what is a real problem and what is something you can live with/expect was informative. The last chapters on the trade of surveying boats for a living were excellent."},{"Title":"Surveying Fiberglass Sailboats: A Step-By-Step Guide for Buyers and Owners","review":"Books like this are great for scaring one away from the idea of boat ownership. Much alarm is raised regarding blisters, osmotic or otherwise. It's not clear to me why they're considered an emergency, so perhaps they're more of a resale cosmetic / FUD issue than anything else. This book is perhaps most useful for the rarified crowd of people already surveying other types of boats, or with heaps of experience with fiberglass laminates. Much here is above and beyond what a typical boat owner/buyer would realistically be able to do on their own, and assumptions are made about the knowledge and skills of the reader."},{"Title":"Surveying Fiberglass Sailboats: A Step-By-Step Guide for Buyers and Owners","review":"This has to be the \\"bible\\" of sailboat repair and maintenance.

I was a first time boat buyer and felt lost. If I had taken the time to read this all the way through I am sure it would have helped me to make a very informed decision, but I was only able to skim it minuets before I went to look at the boat I eventually bought. That being said, the skimming I was able to do did help me to see a few flaws that I used to bring the price down. This book is chocked full of info, but I would not recommend this to a first time boat buyer like myself. This book is better suited for someone with a boat that is in need of restoration and does not know where to start. This book will help you evaluate the true condition of any boat and help to lay out a plan for repairs. For those of you that want to perform those repairs yourself you should look at \\"This Old Boat\\" by Don Casey."},{"Title":"Legacy of the Jedi","review":"When reading the SW books that Jude Watson writes I can't help but wonder why she isn't writing adult novels too. Her \\"children's\\" novel are often smarter, wittier, funnier, and alot better read then most of the other author's books in the EU. This is definitely the case with Legacy of The Jedi.Legacy is separated in to four different section but weave into each other to create something magical. In the first part we learn of Dooku as a padawan and his friend Lorian. Next we get a look into Qui-Gon Jinn's apprenticeship with Dooku were they encounter Lorian once more. The third story centers around Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan and another mishap with Lorian. Finally we get a story about Obi-Wan and Anakin during the beginning of the Clone War that also involves Lorian, now an old man. While each story is separated they bounce off each other and blend into one big story.In this book we get a glimpse at Dooku's beginning and a peak at his fall. The reader also get a look at the different relationship between Master and Padawan. From the distance with Dooku and Jinn, to the close bonds of Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan, to finally the widening gaps of Obi-Wan and Anakin. It's very interesting to see the different approaches the Master each take and how different each Padawan is from the other.I especially like the part centering around Qui-Gon when he was a Padawan. I wouldn't mind seeing a series revolving around his and Dooku's relationship in the future or perhaps a sequel type book to this where we once again get all four generations.This book is a bit steep in price but reading wise it will entertain and make you wish it was a great deal longer."},{"Title":"Legacy of the Jedi","review":"I normally don't read the SW books intended for younger readers but sometimes I make an exception. In this case I was not disapointed. Though not nearly as dense as I'm used to with full-novels, LOTJ is a quick, fun read. The background of Dooku was a great treat that was handled expertly. Jude Watson did a great job of making the story accessible to younger readers without dumbing it down too much for older readers (I'm 30). Actually, it reads like a good comic book in terms of diologue and story flow. My only complaint is that it could have been longer. All in all, LOTJ was a read that I would recommend to all SW readers, of all ages."},{"Title":"Legacy of the Jedi","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot, and I'm well over the suggested age range. I've read many of Watson's books to my 7-year-old son, who's under the suggested age range, and we've both gotten hooked on them. I like the character bits and dialogue; he likes the fight scenes!This one is divided into 4 sections, each focusing on a different generation of Jedi. The first is about Dooku as a Padawan, the second is about Dooku as a Knight with Qui-Gon as his Padawan, the third covers Qui-Gon as master with Obi-Wan as his Padawan, and the fourth is set in the early stages of the Clone Wars with Obi-Wan and Anakin. Linking them all together is a character who appears in all four sections, a onetime friend of Dooku's named Lorian Nod who has several run-ins with the Jedi.Watson is a master of characterization and what I enjoyed most about this book was getting to see what Dooku was like at age 13, what he was like later on as Qui-Gon's master, and some of the events that shaped his life. Even more fun was seeing a young Qui-Gon and the early manifestations of his reserve, his rebellious nature and his compassionate desire to help beings whom no one else will help. One gets a sense of how difficult it must have been for Qui-Gon to have been Dooku's apprentice, given Qui-Gon's strong living force connection and Dooku's almost total lack of empathy for other beings.Part four was a mixed bag for me. I loved the scene where Obi-Wan was rude to Lorian Nod in the Jedi Council room. It's such unusual behavior for Obi-Wan, and yet it was completely in character. But the ending of the book kind of fizzled out for me; I was expecting a bigger payoff out of the redemption storyline and the ending felt rushed somehow.But overall, this is a very fun and thought-provoking book. You have four generations of important Jedi from the movies, two of which will never stray from the Jedi path, and two of which will ultimately betray the Order and become Sith. If you are thoughtful about this sort of thing you can wonder, did events concerned with Lorian Nod cause Dooku to fall, or was he doomed to fall because he could never control his pride or even see it as a fault? And similarly, did Anakin fall because of the events in his life, or because Obi-Wan failed him, or because of inherent and unchangeable personality traits? The book doesn't answer these questions but it gives the reader plenty to think about."},{"Title":"Legacy of the Jedi","review":"Got to admit (I'm 30 too) and enjoyed this book! I've been reading them with my son (who is 8) and he is totally engrossed in the stories.This one has been one of my favorites due to the elaborating of Qui-Gon as Padawan Learner to Dooku. My son loves Obi-Wan and I'm a Qui-Gon fan, so this book was great. And the fact that the one character that started out back when Dooku was a teen was great. Showing what friendship is about and that betrayal is and can be on different levels.Jude Watson did an excellent job in dividing the parts up. I wish that she'd write some of the adult SW books. I think she has the skill and definitely the mind for it!I have (as well as my son) enjoyed the Jedi Apprentice and Jedi Quest books. I believe that any true SW fan will definitely enjoy this one as well as the other books."},{"Title":"Legacy of the Jedi","review":"Even though this book, and many other books written by Jude Watson are &quot;for ages 9-12&quot;, the depth of emotions and the touching stories portrayed in these books are superior. For ages 9-100, I say!I am a 15 year old girl and I own all of the StarWars books, from The Rising Force (Jedi Apprentice #1) to the eighth book in the Jedi Quest series. I'm not a Sci-fi freak, but I love these books because they are so well written, and they teach important values, dealing with friendship, working through adversity, and even romance. These books are for everyone, boy or girl, man or woman.Legacy of the Jedi was brilliant. It linked the different generations of Jedi (Yoda and Dooku, Dooku and Qui-Gon, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan, and Obi-wan and Anakin)as if they were seperate little books in one. Jude Watson provided excellent coherence in the book by linking all of the relationships together with each master-padawan team battling a common enemy.Each team has a weakness that they have to work through. Each team is different. It is amazing to see what Dooku was like as a boy, and what made him become Count Dooku. It was also good to see what Qui-Gon was like before he became the logical, perfect master.This book is definatly recomended!! If you like this book, read Jedi Apprentice Special Edition 1&amp;2- they're awesome!"},{"Title":"Legacy of the Jedi","review":"This was the greatest book yet. I loved how Jude Watson keeps you waiting for the next. I had no clue about the character Lorian Nod. The new book taught me alot of new peices of imformation. I am the biggest Star Wars fan. I have read all the books, but i reccomend this one as number 1 on my list. The way Jude Watson lays the book out through 4 parts is really genius. I cant wait till the next."},{"Title":"Legacy of the Jedi","review":"This book gave a really good look at Dooku. He is, in my opinion, a very unexplored character and the two stories with him in them really added more to his character.The part with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan was excellent as well. I think my favorite part of the whole book was the little scene where they had their conversation about Qui-Gon not always knowing what Obi-Wan was thinking and Obi-Wan still being hungry after not being able to finish his meal. (Or something like that, it's been awhile since I've read that part.) I don't know why but this part just kind of hit something and it seemed very sweet.The part with Anakin was enjoyable too. Anakin is one of my least favorite characters but his role in this book was still good.And of course the reoccuring character whose name I can't remember at this exact moment. (Again, it's been awhile) He added a lot to the overall story and by the end you loved and you hated him.All the way around, this was a satisfying read."},{"Title":"Legacy of the Jedi","review":"This book is an excellent insight into the life of a Jedi student and Knight. If you're one of the fans who likes to picture themselves with a lightsaber, this book will help you make it clearer.The stories of how each Padawaan is phychologicly affected by their masters, such as Qui-gon's feelings on betrayel. Also gives a good description of the rebirth of Qui-Gon and Obi Wan's reconnection (See other Jude Watson novels).Also gives good details of the Clone Wars and Anakin's renewed attitude since Episode II."},{"Title":"Legacy of the Jedi","review":"i LOVE this book! i am glad i liked it, due to the fact that i spent my 10th birthday money on it! you don't have to be a kid to enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"Legacy of the Jedi","review":"This is a GREAT book. It is divided into four parts, each telling about the different masters and padawans, but all focus on one character from Count Dooku's past causing trouble. A boy named Lorian Nod.Part One: Yoda and Dooku. This part had to be the most intresting part. It tells about Dooku and his best friend Lorian Nod. But one day while entering Dooku's master's room, they stumble across the Sith Holocron. Stupidly, Lorian takes the book, and gets caught with it. After a few more events, Lorian is expelled from the Jedi Order, which sets up the rest of the bookPart Two: Dooku and Qui-Gon. This was also good. Space Pirates start kidnapping senators while in space. Then Yoda sendsDooku and Qui-Gon to board a senator's ship and see if they would get attacked. They do, and the leader of it is no one other than Lorian Nod.Part three: Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan: This was OK, but since I was getting used to the new and different stuff, I couldn't enjoy it as much because it was too much like a Jedi Apprentice book. Anyway, Qui and Obi go to this planet where another planet threatens to destroy the planet with a secret weapon. Then a new power rose that governed the people called \\"The Guardians\\". The head of the guardians is...Lorian Nod. Long after this both Jedi and a band of rebelles go to steal the plans for the weapon.Part Four: Obi-Wan and Anakin: Awesome part. This takes place in the Clone Wars, and once again Lorian Nod is involved....but not in the way you would expect. i'm not gonna spoil anything for you, but lets just say theres a chain of events that leads to another enchounter with Count Dooku.Buy this book. It is by far the best Star Wars book...ever."},{"Title":"Legacy of the Jedi","review":"I have enjoyed reading the young adult Star Wars books. I've read many Young Jedi Knight books and loved them. I also enjoyed reading this book. My favorite section was the first one with Dooku as a Padawan. Finally, this book was just the right length for me."},{"Title":"Legacy of the Jedi","review":"Excellent. A really good look into the lives of several very inportant characters in the Jedi Legacy. Back stories (and adventured) that we had not heard before."},{"Title":"Legacy of the Jedi","review":"This will be a compleate set for the person who likes Star Wars, it is a gift and I know he will love it; thanks for arriving on time."},{"Title":"Legacy of the Jedi","review":"Legacy of the Jedi is a great book for Star Wars fans to read for several reasons. It is a very engaging book, much more so than one would expect for a novel written for children. It also delves into the motivations of Dooku significantly, so that you can understand his motivations better.This book, like the Jedi Apprentice Special editions, is divided into sections, but there are four sections this time. The first deals with the time when Dooku was an apprentice. Dooku is faced with serious decisions to make regarding his friend Lorian Nod, and the effect that these decisions have on his beliefs and life push him toward his well known role as the Seperatist leader.The second section involved Dooku and his apprentice, Qui-Gon Jinn. After reading the Jedi Apprentice series, it's interesting to see how different their relationship is compared to the relationship that Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan will have. Again, elements of Dooku's personality emerge that indicate that there will be trouble.The third and fourth section deal with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan, then Obi-Wan and Anakin. These sections were not quite as interesting as the first two, but they are still good. In the Jedi Apprentice Special editions, the different sections had common villians. What is interesting is realizing that it is not Lorian Nod that plays the role of villian in all four sections. In this book, pride is the common enemy that the Jedi must face. Some respond appropriately to this temptation, and some do not, with disastrous consequences for the galaxy."},{"Title":"Mr.Golightly's Holiday","review":"Salley Vickers' story of Mr Golightly's holiday is a gentle and clever book which allows us all to consider the nature of faith and how God may view the complicated every day lives that we all lead. The characters are interesting (if a little pallid) in their routine kinds of lives; the village is believable, and if you don't know the key to the story you can have a bit of fun trying to work out who Mr Golightly is, what is his business, and why has he lost his only son (not really too difficult to work out).However, it is that very gentle cleverness that means that this book is somewhat slow at times, and in places I felt this rather hard going. I also felt the ending somewhat contrived, almost as if Ms Vickers wasn't sure how to finish the book.It is certainly an entertaining read, and a good story, but I feel that it fell somewhat short of its potential. I feel that Ms Vickers' undoubted writing talents are better portrayed in \\"Miss Garnet's Angel\\", which is a far superior book."},{"Title":"Mr.Golightly's Holiday","review":"I agree with the reviewer who has been recommending this to everyone. It's brilliant. Clever, funny, wise, deeply profound and highly original. Ms Vickers writes in a quiet, understated Brit way. Don't be fooled. There's a savage understanding beneath that decorous facade. And the ending is a tour de force. Bravo, Ms Vickers and may you continue to 'go lightly'!"},{"Title":"Mr.Golightly's Holiday","review":"I have been talking this book up to everyone I know because it is the best book I have read so far this year. It is absolutely delightful and I can't understand why it hasn't gotten more &quot;press&quot;. It is a clever, sweet, kind book with depth and humor and I enjoyed reading it (twice) immensely. Regardless of your faith or religious background, I think everyone would enjoy this novel and get something out of it. I will definitely be looking for other books by Salley Vickers."},{"Title":"Mr.Golightly's Holiday","review":"This is one of those books when you just wish it didn't have to end.Though it is not a book of action, excitement and cliffhangers, the simple lives of English villagers and that of the mystery guest to their town, manages to be a compelling and thoroughly enjoyable read. The characters are written well and you can't help but warm to them as you find yourself absorbed in their lives. The story moves towards a twist at the end which, if you didn't pick up on it, makes you review the book in a different light as it provokes an interesting way of thinking.A cleverly written book which you will have you savouring every word as you find yourself engrossed in story, though you may regret having to finish it."},{"Title":"Mr.Golightly's Holiday","review":"I can't say I \\"got\\" most of the historical and philosophical references to the Old and New Testaments, even with a \\"Bible Dictionary\\" on hand. Still, Vickers's novel does not rely on the \\"religion\\" premise. Her writing is insightful without cudgeling the reader, intelligent but not pedantic, humorous and heartbreaking and compassionate, snappily contemporary yet unposturingly mature. I'm no doubt biased to her writing and her novels.Describing the \\"plot\\" or \\"story\\" of \\"Mr. Golightly's Holiday\\" doesn't do the novel justice. As with any artwork, the indefinable affinity between the artist's world and the artist's audience, is what matters. If the reader does not feel affinity for Vickers's characters, then this novel is probably not a good match for the reader.What an \\"unhelpful\\" review for a prospective reader! If it helps at all, I will say that \\"Mr. Golightly's Holiday\\" reminds me of J.K. Rowling's novel \\"The Casual Vacancy,\\" which I also loved. Both novels encompass an enclosed world--a village/town--populated by very \\"real\\" characters; that is, people who can be petty, mean, manipulative, self-serving, and on and on, but at the core, people who are big-hearted, compassionate, wise, giving--just trying to do their best within their situations and limitations. People who are, often, just very sad, but manage to rise above their own concerns."},{"Title":"Mr.Golightly's Holiday","review":"As my first exposure to Salley Vickers work, I was pleasently surprised and pleased. Her narrative is very good and descriptive, and while her plot is not terribly complicated it was good reading.I will be reading more of her works to see if her discriptive methods continue.I enjoyed this novel and recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Mr.Golightly's Holiday","review":"I came to this cold not having read more than the brief blurb at the back of the paperback. Being neither religious nor that profound I did not twig what Mr. Golightly's business was until I was told. That was mainly because I read this as a bit of entertainment and did not think too hard about it. It is a sweet novel without being too sacharine. I loved the village and the characters in it. There was enough mystery to keep me reading along. It is one of those books where I did not skim as the prose was perfect. I could nave done without the afterword. If you want to read the deeper symbolism then you should not need an explanation and if like me you read it as a novel then you wuld not really care. However, this does not detract from the enjoyment of a beautifully painted story. This is not a great masterpiece but it is a well executed and beautiful watercolour, something you would gaze at with affection as you go about your daily life."},{"Title":"Mr.Golightly's Holiday","review":"Sally Vickers lastest book has many subtleties: what appears on the surface and lies beneath. Mr Golightly's Holiday challenges some of your beliefs particularly modern day Christian faith. The book is beautifully descriptive and intelligently written and might even welcome a second reading.A vicarious trip to southern England where life is centred around the pub is quaint compared to the north american style of living. People there are so busy with their own lives that they don't realize who Mr Golightly is and he doesn't want them to know either. That is another subtlety to be solved.I wanted to know many of the characters in more detail, particularly Ellen and could have used more pages and time. I am sure that a book club would have much more discussion on the history of the Moors which are fascinating and the people. Always felt there was a hint of Thomas Hardy's, Return of the Native in this book from a geographical position, a little mystery and mystique in those Moors. Readers will find that Mr Golightly isn't so light in its parameters and perspectives although he does step lightly."},{"Title":"Mr.Golightly's Holiday","review":"I love this author. I have read all three of her novels now. I wish she were more popular in the US."},{"Title":"Mr.Golightly's Holiday","review":"Salley Vicker's, latest book is best read by knowning who Mr Golightly really is; otherwise, you might have to read the second time which isn't a bad idea. At first, I thought he might be a drifter, escaped convict from the prison or a person running away from something. For those, that really want to savor and enjoy this book to the fullest, I will give away the secret that Mr Golightly is definitely the author of original bible and universal creator come back to earth to see how humanity is doing in a moor village of Dartmoor in southern English, a typical English village where the pub is central to everything going on. The reader moves in too and meets all the characters of Great Calne and their vicissitudes of everyday events.Since I had to read to the last chapter to know who Mr Golightly was, I felt I missed the subtle humor of the characters especially the village lady vicar that saw her mission as reforming everyones sexual behaviour. The vicar was sure that Mr Golightly must have a problem as a single man and showing up in their village to rent a cottage. Now if the universal creator has a problem, then the vicar really needs to revise her job description as spiritual adviser.Do we need a new edition of the bible today or are the characters in the original still current in our 21 century? Problems still the same? Mr Golightly isn't pushy, but has a gentle, compassionate interest in everyone in this place.So get a good glass of your favorite beverage and sit back and enjoy this intelligent, descriptive, vicarious trip to Dartmoor. There is no rush to go anywhere as I haven't given everything away. The reader will be immersed in the mist and moors to decide if they agree with what happens at the end."},{"Title":"Mr.Golightly's Holiday","review":"Book was obviously well used from library with old cracked protector and just not something you want in your personal library.

Schmitz","review":"I'm a long time fan of James H Schmitz from when his stories first appeared in the sixties and seventies, and so I was pleased to see his work coming back into print This volume is just a sampling of what he was capable of. It introduces several of the characters that appear in many of his other stories. Telzey Amberdon in here, in both Novice and Goblin Night. Heslet Quillan is in Lion Loose (along with one very interesting monster), Just Curious is not so much a Science Fiction story as a horror mystery, while the other stories show the broad range of his writing. One interesting aspect of Schmitz's writing was the way he wrote about ecology as a major factor in his stories. Grandpa and Balanced Ecology include the life forms of a world as major characters without being preachy or pedantic. In that line I strongly recommend his book The Tuvela (also titled The Demon Breed) if you can find it in used book stores. That book also features Nile Etland, one of Schmitz's very interesting female characters. Schmitz was using strong, and believable, female characters long before anyone else, and they are both realistic and sympathetic, much more so than most of the ones in print today. In case you think he did only strong female characters, this book also has The Guardians, one of his best stories, with a sympathetic, and believable, male space pirate. And of course, Heslett Quillan is here in Lion Loose. The bibliography at the end of the book, as well as the cross-reference of stories and characters is very helpful. But a major character in his stories is the background itself. The Federation of the Hub is a fascinating place. This book gives a glimpse of it. All in all, I recommend this book as a sampler and starting point for those wanting to know more about a very good, and seminal SF writer. And while they were not written as children's stories, their content, and relatively short length compared to the massive books out today, make them ideal ways to introduce young children, especially young girls, to SF."},{"Title":"The Best of James H.

It contains an introduction by Janet Kagan and a bibliography of Schmitz's SF works in addition to nine stories.The introduction provides a rather good analysis of Schmitz's characters, plots, and style, but doesn't much address his environments, probably due to length considerations. A more extensive analysis of these environments is provided by Eric Flint in the Baen editions of Schmitz's SF works.\\"Grandpa\\" is a story of a Colonial team that found a surprise in the ecology of an unexplored planet. \\"Lion Loose\\" is a Quillan tale wherein he gains an unusual ally. \\"Just Curious\\" is about a unique mental ability and the reaction of a man who has been subjected to it. \\"The Second Night of Summer\\" tells what Grimp and Grandma did during summer vacation. \\"Novice\\" is another summer vacation story, in which Telzey drives her Aunt Halet to hysterics. \\"Balanced Ecology\\" is the story of an environent that adopts a human family. \\"The Custodians\\" is a tale of a hijacking and a man's conscience. \\"Sour Note On Palayata\\" is a Psychological Service story about consciousness and wisdom. \\"Goblin Night\\" is a yarn about Telzey, Chomir and a spook.This collection is a fairly balanced selection of the author's short works, ranging from the quite familiar to the fairly obscure. Although not necessarily the \\"best\\" of his short stories, all are interesting and enjoyable and have that characteristic sense of wonder.

All his stories I've ever read are an enjoyable way to pass an evening."},{"Title":"The Best of James H. Schmitz","review":"Schmitz was a very unusual author for his time, and each of his stories brings something new to the table. Even today, his work stands out for being so far in advance of our technology yet still shows the human (or some cases non-human) element within these technological worlds. While we see some of what he foresaw in the Internet and other similar inventions, he has carried them farther than we have been able to to date. On the human side, while many of his stories are the classic hero's journey, each one of them tells this classic model in a unique way - and with Schmitz, the end of the journey is rarely what you would expect!"},{"Title":"The Best of James H.

But shortly after the publication of _The Best of James Schmitz_ (1991), Ace Books began the noble task of compiling multiple volumns of his stories. There seems to be a resurgence in popularity for this author... at least, for a while.The NEFSA Press anthology remains an excellent introduction to one of the best craftsmen in science fiction. There is a good critical introduction by Janet Kagen, an excellent bibliography of Schmitz's stories by Mark Olson, a good cover by Kelly Freas (originally illustrating \\"The Custodians\\") and several interior illustrations by Merle Insinga. Oddly enough, there are only three interiors. I would have liked to see a few more.There are nine stories in all: \\"Grandpa\\" (_Astounding_, 1955), \\"Lion Loose...\\" (_Analog_, 1961), \\"Just Curious\\" (_Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine_, 1968), \\"The Second Night of Summer\\" (_Galaxy_, 1950), \\"Novice\\" (_Analog_, 1962), \\"Balanced Ecology\\" (_Analog_, 1968), \\"The Custodians\\" (_Analog, 1968), \\"Sour Note on Palayata\\" (_Astounding_,1956), and \\"Goblin Night\\" (_Analog_, 1965). This anthology marked the first book publication for \\"The Custodians\\" and \\"Sour Note...\\"Three of the best stories are short pieces: \\"Grandpa,\\" \\"Balanced Ecology,\\" and \\"The Second Night of Summer\\". The first two are classical biological hard science fiction stories. The third is a straight space opera that features a sly old secret agent named Grandma Wannattel, who is like a benevolent Long John Silver. The story is irresistably charming.Almost as good are \\"Novice\\" and \\"Goblin Night,\\" two early adventures of the psionically gifted Telzey Amberdon. All of the Telzey tales are well-written, but the early stories strike me as a bit fresher and crisper. In \\"Goblin Night,\\" Schmitz demonstrates his ability to end his story at just the right spot, without dragging it on.\\"Lion Loose...\\" was nominated for a Hugo in 1961, which indicates that it is a story of some popularity. (It was beaten by Brian Aldiss' Hothouse series.) I have always felt that the story could have been better than it is. Schmitz dreamed up a marvelously deadly alien. But instead of pitting it agaist the hero, the alien and the hero are allies against some rather colorless space pirates. The conflict isn't as interesting as it could have been. It is resolved too easily.\\"The Custodians\\" is an aliens-among-us tale with a few new twists. \\"Sour Note on Palayata\\" is a study of human-alien relations that is crashingly dull. \\"Just Curious\\" is a well-written but nasty piece of goods. I will leave it to you to decide whether you like it.I would like to close on a bibliographical note. When this anthology was published, there were a number of Schmitz stories that had not yet been published in book form: \\"Beacon to Elsewhere,\\" \\"Ham Sandwich,\\" \\"Left Hand, Right Hand,\\" and \\"Clean Slate\\". Other stories like \\"Gone Fishing\\" and \\"Planet of Forgetting\\" had been collected-- but only once or twice. This is indicated in the bibliography. Since 1991, thanks largely to the project launched by Ace Books, many of these uncollected and neglected stories have been rescued from oblivion. Let us hope they stay that way."},{"Title":"The Best of James H. Schmitz","review":"Schmitz is one of my favorite sci-fi authors. His general style is what I call super science. Other authors who write in this vein are Van Vogt, Campbell (Stuart), Wallace and Doc Smith and like them stands alone. If you like those guys you'll love Schmitz (and vice versa). A beautiful clothbound edition with short stories of his that you will have a hard time finding elsewhere including a Telzey Amberdon prequel. Agent of Vega and the other Telzey books are his best work, I wish they would be printed like this book."},{"Title":"The Best of James H. Schmitz","review":"Very enjoyable. Schmitz is one of the few sci-fi writers who does not rely entirely upon technology and gadgets, but instead actually develops the characters personality."},{"Title":"Of men and plants;: The autobiography of the world's most famous plant healer","review":"This is an amazing story; one that could never be dreamed up. A true life story, written autobiographically, of how a young peasant boy was mentored daily by a father who knew how to heal with the common plants found locally in his Gascony region in southern France. Later Maurice builds on that foundation to become a famous healer to many, including national and international personalities.His style is easy to read, and engaging as his life experiences unfold. It is delightful to see how he takes the same care of a village woman's arthritic pains as he does the social elite. It is refreshing to see how he avoids the heady atmosphere of his associations with high-class celebrities by keeping the thought - \\"you are only a peasant from Gascony\\".This is a must read for anyone interested in how the art of healing really plays out in the real life of a remarkable 'peasant'.This book proves again - life is much more enchanting than fiction."},{"Title":"The Shy Stegosaurus of Cricket Creek","review":"I read this book years ago to my older children and they loved it! I'm now reading it to my youngest. He doesn't want me to stop reading!"},{"Title":"The Shy Stegosaurus of Cricket Creek","review":"I have a friend whose grandson loves dinosaurs.

I've read both books to my class and they have liked them."},{"Title":"The Shy Stegosaurus of Cricket Creek","review":"I got this book when I was a kid (about 30 years ago), but never got around to reading it. I was looking around the bookshelf for something to read a few days ago, and came across it. I figured, well, why not read it? It's about twelve year old twins, Joan and Joey, who discover a stegosaurus living on their ranch. He has been alive for millions of years, and he can actually talk. But he's shy, you see, and doesn't want the kids to tell anyone else about him. I won't give away any more of the plot, but I will say that this is an enjoyable kids book."},{"Title":"The Shy Stegosaurus of Cricket Creek","review":"I had this book in a Paperback Edition when I was in elementary school. That was back in the early 1960's. Unfortunately I lost the book and was never able to find it again. Then I joined Amazon and did some book looking and I found this book. It is brand new and a hard cover edition as well. I am extremely pleased with my purchase.William Zinner"},{"Title":"The Shy Stegosaurus of Cricket Creek","review":"My family has a beat-up, sad-looking copy of this book. I really wish I could read the first one, because I read the second one about half a million times. The twins (Joey and Joan?) help an absent-minded professor find fossils, with a little help from the Stegosaurus himself. In the process, they even catch a crook!"},{"Title":"The Shy Stegosaurus of Cricket Creek","review":"This is one of those books I must have read a dozen times as a kid. Now that dinosaurs are so popular with children, someone shoud get it back into print."},{"Title":"The Shy Stegosaurus of Cricket Creek","review":"There are only a few other reviews posted on this obscure children's book, which has to be almost 40 years old, so I thought I would post a few comments.Lampman's children's books were ahead of their time, and should be better known. One reviewer here recalls reading the book back in 1964, which is about the year I would have read it. All the reviewers seem to have fond memories of reading this delightful book. The story about George the shy stegosaurus was one of the most entertaining children's books I ever read, which, from the title, you might think we were all nuts. But back in the early 60's this was state-of-the-art for children's books, and it really was a great little book.The book skillfully integrated a dinosaur theme with the story of the curious little brother and sister who discovered his hideaway, and things take off from there. I understand there are occasional rare, used copies available--but unfortunately they're not cheap.Lampman also wrote several other books, Rusty's Spaceship, one other Shy Stegosaurus book, The Shy Stegosaurus of Indian Springs, and The World Under the Back Steps. Rusty's Spaceship was another one of my favorites. In this book, Rusty and his alien friend, Tipia, go gallivanting around the solar system, having various adventures, before returning to earth, where they have a few more in their invisible spaceship.All these are great books for your kids. If you can find reasonably priced used copies, they're all worth picking up."},{"Title":"The Shy Stegosaurus of Cricket Creek","review":"I read this book several times when I was a kid in the 60's. It was always a favorite of mine. In fact, every time I see a Stegosaurus in a movie, I think of this book. A few years ago, I tried to find it online and couldn't but I'm pleased to know it is available again and plan on getting it for old time's sake."},{"Title":"The Shy Stegosaurus of Cricket Creek","review":"This is simply a good book to enjoy. An interesting situation of a family living on a ranch, about to go under financially. The two children discover (or are discovered by) a stegosaurus that has been left alive over these many years. Shy of people, the stegosaurus remains hidden from everyone else until it sees an airplane, which it thinks is a flying reptile.Plot complications include escaped bank robbers, a discouraged paleontologist, and the 12 year old son who has the dinosaur pull their car into town in order to get help. The shy stegosaurus asks the boy to turn the car's headlights off, as the dinosaur thinks the car is staring at him (he's not very bright).I read this when I was younger, and it helped guide me into the earth sciences. An enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Shy Stegosaurus of Cricket Creek","review":"This book was a favorite of my brother. Every time we went to the library, we had to see if they had &quot;George&quot;, that being the name of the dinosaur. It's plot concerns a single mom trying to make it on a ranch, and her two children who are trying to help her out. A living dinosaur, a shady real estate buyer, and a palentologist who can't see what's under his nose make this an intersting book, with plot twists and an ending that, while happy, shows that not everything works out perfectly. I highly recomend this book to anyone who has a dino crazed child and would like to expand their reading to include other genres. --Christy Minnis"},{"Title":"The Shy Stegosaurus of Cricket Creek","review":"I first read this book at the Children's Museum in Boston, way back when the Museum was within walking distance, housed in a couple of Victorian Mansions along the Jamaicaway. (I lived in the library there, and was so frequent a frequenter that I got to see the dollhouses not on display, and could help feed the snakes- what a great time & place!) In my memory, this book is actually called \\"George, the shy stegosaurus,\\" and it's singly responsible for my lifetime enthusiasm about dinosaurs, stegs in particular. When I got to visit Dinosaur National Monument in Utah and saw the bones of a stegosaurus all curled up at what once had been the bone-clogged confluence of a prehistoric river, it was because of this book that I felt such reverence and glad amazement in witnessing history via fossils. It's only as an adult that I've discovered Ms. Lampman wrote another of my ever-favorite kids' books, \\"The City under the Back Steps,\\" a cautionary & riveting story of kids shrinking to ant size, then living with the ants. This is another great and scientifically rich story, full of fascinating cool info (such as, ants keep aphids as farm animals) which still comes to mind forty five years later!

I really, really wish someone would reprint \\"City Under the Back Steps\\", also by Lampman."},{"Title":"The Shy Stegosaurus of Cricket Creek","review":"Strange, but if I were to pick the two books that have had the biggest influence on my life, this would be one of them--the other being The Brother Karamazov (but that's another review).I remember reading this book, just before my tenth birthday. The story was so dramatic, so moving (remember--I'm nine years old here), the characters so vivid--even though I knew it was fiction, that there really wasn't any stegosaurus (never mind a shy one who spoke english & wagged his tail like a dog), that after finishing it, I cried harder than I ever remember crying in my life. NOTE: The stegosaurus does not die--nobody dies. But somehow, that made it worse for me--The seemly imposible bind of a continued lonely existance for the stegosaurus: too shy to meet anyone, too social not to.So while I was unable to stop crying, barely able between the sobs to explain to my poor mother (a saint, believe me) the terrible agony of this non-existent dinosaur's life, refuting all of my mother's suggestions about what the stegosaurus might have done in his new life away from Cricket Creek, at the same time I knew I loved this book. This book was the first book that really touched me--a book that communicated real emotion, that moved me more than anything else ever had.A book about two kids and a talking dinosaur, written five years before I was born. I still love this book, because it was the first book that made me cry--and from that moment on, I knew I would always love books....because every once in awhile, they can make you cry about things that do not even exist.Would a hip hop happening kid of today like this book? I do not know. I still love it. I bought it for my nieces, but I think it was a little to square for them. But many kids today still read (and cry over) Laura Ingalls Wilder's books. So who knows...And while you are at it, read Sid Fleishman's Mr. Mysterious & Company. That book is even better than Shy Stegosaurus...."},{"Title":"The Shy Stegosaurus of Cricket Creek","review":"By Christie Schultz I'm currently looking for titles by an author that I remember with fondness from my own childhood. I am a teacher, and have been trying to find them for my students, and my own son. E.S. Lampman wrote not only about Native Americans, but about fantasy worlds which put science fiction effectively into the hands of young people. The first two are the &quot;Shy Stegosaurus&quot; books. I found one of them listed and it is &quot;hard to find&quot;; the first is &quot;The Shy Stegosaurus of Indian Springs&quot;. It's about a stegosaurus which not unreasonably has a weird liking for bananas (the more ripe, the better), and at some point it is labled as an Indian spirit by the local Native American Shaman. You're right, it's a great story! The second book is &quot;The Shy Stegosaurous of Cricket Creek&quot;, the story line of which I forget other than a brother and sister find the last living dinosaur, and it can talk to them. The children are out riding horses in the canyon, and suddenly they see the rock face move...the dinosaur has to live near a mineral spring to survive.... Lampman effectively uses biological concepts like natural camoflage of animals as plot devices, makes reasonable guesses about their dietary needs, and as well she shows an effective grasp of Native American cultural issues.One of her later sci-fi books, &quot;Rusty's Spaceship&quot;, was pure fantasy with the weird visits to various planets in the solar system, but it is such a ripping good story that questionable science facts become immaterial! (Jules Verne wasn't accurate either, but he's still in print!). In fact, reading it as an adult, I see it for what it is, the book is a child's dream of what might really be on Jupiter (creatures made of gas bags) or on Mars (armies of flying ants) or how it might be to take your homemade spaceship into space.Another title by this author is &quot;City Under the Back Steps&quot;, and it's a precursor to &quot;Honey I Shrunk the Kids&quot; and a semi-steal from L.F Baum's &quot;Policeman Bluejay&quot; (another rarity from 1910 or so). Storyline: two children are bitten by the Queen ant and shrink down to ant size....and learn a good deal about the life of a hive of ants.Lampman had a very pithy sense of humor I thought at the time, and I enjoyed these books, and others by her, very much as a child. I wish they were around for youngsters today."},{"Title":"The Shy Stegosaurus of Cricket Creek","review":"George is strong, loyal and shy. He's also a Stegosaurus dinosaur.

Their adventures include George taking on an airplane (he thinks it is a Pteranodon), and going after a bank robber! With black-and-white illustrations by Hubert Buel, Evelyn Lampman's The Shy Stegosaurus Of Cricket Creek is wonderful reading, and ideal for young readers ages 8 to 12.

Along the way, she meets a very lucky stable boy name Hyu and her treacherous sister Tranceptor, Ravanna.A little short on plot, it has all the Manning signature elements of high quality illustration and incredibly inventive settings. The scenes and the characters are original and beautifully rendered.

Interesting and inventive - I can't wait to see the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Tranceptor: The Way Station (Tranceptor Book One)","review":"A great book reminiscent of early 80's Heavy Metal and Epic magazines.

This book is truely only for BDSM fetish lovers and those who enjoy viewing pony slaves and other fetishes. Manning uses a lot of shemale or adrogenous characters in his stories, which I love but it isn't for everyone. At times the Mannings stories tend to get bizzare and hard to follow, but the beauty of his artwork more than makes up for a slightly odd storyline. This story could use a few more fetish drawlings in it and gives me the feeling Manning is holding back a bit, but overall he is one of the best fetish artist out there."},{"Title":"Tranceptor: The Way Station (Tranceptor Book One)","review":"Wow....This book is filled with all the erotic imagery that you can expect from Manning.

The story is basic, with very little to endear one to the any of characters. The happenings are boring enough that I was distracted by the weather outside the window. The erotic part of it can be better attained by one's own imagination. Not what I would call a worthwhile read, and certainly not for the price I paid. If you see somewhere for $3 or so, pick it up.

The combinations of photos, hand sketches and detailed black and white illustrations give an immense look at each part of the body. From the first section of the book on bones, to the next on muscles, and finally to other details some books over-look like body structure by ethnics, emaciation and obesity, as well as superficial elements like veins and wrinkles, this book covers so much all at once. Also I admit I haven't 'read' much of the content in this book but really the pictures speak for them selves and are clearly labeled. It isn't one of those books that bombards you with needless text but it does have a more precise description in what text is there that serves to enhance rather then overwhelm. Out of the countless art books I have bought seeking answers to my proportion problems or to find out in best detail the actual structure beneath the skin (as well as a better understanding of how the skin layers over it) this book has been the best and most comprehensive thus far."},{"Title":"ATLAS OF HUMAN ANATOMY FOR THE ARTIST","review":"Atlas of Human Anatomy For the Artist is an excellent book.

I read alot of anatomy books and have not come across too many willing to go beyond the ideal body type. I found it especially helpful that this book provides detailed drawings and photographs of the figure; some books only have rough sketches which are not very helpful. This book is not just for those who want to draw the figure; those who model the figure in 3D applications will also find it useful.

The book is pretty inexpensive, and it's pretty clear, and I haven't found something better that doesn't cost a whole lot more. It was published in the 50s, and it hasn't been changed one bit, so the usual number of cornball drawings are included (they look VERY 50s). And the racial and gender characterizations are incredibly goofy and/or offensive. I'm a woman, and believe me, I've seen worse characterizations, but still.... The racial characterizations are truly amazing: really booga booga (oddly, no women are included in the photographs of the races). Lest white men think they're off the hook, they're not. Many of them get the Ken-doll treatment (blurred-out genitalia: at least I hope they've just been blurred out).Still, the price of the book is right and has lots of good basic information (I like the descriptions of joints and how they work: very 50s and very easy to understand.It SURE would be nice if somebody would publish lots of pictures of skeletons next to muscle overlays next to photos of real people in natural poses (all kinds of normal people, and skeleton, muscle, and humans side by side). So far, everything I find is so stupid. Barcsay is still probably the best book, but lacking in some cohesiveness.Just reviewed what I wrote: I switched to a much more expensive textbook, which was worth it (Nathan Goldstein's \\"Figure Drawing\\").

Illustrations and photographs of male models and body structure outnumber those of women by at least ten to one. Incidentally, sexist prioritization places the female form in a small section toward the back of the book.This sexist bias extends to the text, which describes the female body in less than glowing terms while lauding the ideal nature of the male form. An example from page 175 on the navel: &quot;In the female a large deposit of fat, especially below the navel, causes the pit to be deep and obscure in detail. The navel of a lean, muscular male is distinct and firmly rimmed.&quot;The short section on racial features contains perhaps even more offensive language, describing dark-skinned people as having a &quot;muzzle&quot;! I assumed that this must be a technical anatomical term applicable to all human beings but the only other reference to it in the book occurs in a note on genetic defects. As might be expected, illustration of racial types also starts with the Nordic male and whiter peoples first, in tacit hierarchy.While the racism and sexism of Peck's book may be mild for its time, it seems that our enlightened sensibilites demand an updating of the text. I am not an individual who supports political correctness but I believe these issues need to be addressed in their own right and before giving the book a perfect five stars."},{"Title":"ATLAS OF HUMAN ANATOMY FOR THE ARTIST","review":"Copyright 1951? Wow, what a stimulating discovery, and what fun! Besides the skeletal and musculature illustrations, \\"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist\\" is full of Peck's own drawings of basic anatomical features. These are not just the \\"final\\" drawings, like the master prints in Hale, but the beginning \\"rough sketches\\". I find this delightful because every beginner needs some inspirational guidance in drawing's first steps. A simple rough sketch of a nose, with shading; or bones drawn as a simple hinge joint, an arm or leg.... Peck's general reduction of the human figure to basic shapes is of inestimable help. The reader may just find himself saying, \\"Hey, I can do THAT!!!\\" And that is the wonderful thing about PECK's book.Peck has impeccable credentials and must be compared to Robert Beverly Hale. Peck's is not merely an alternate duplication of the same material Hale covers. There is a 'personal' touch in Peck; but the problem with any/all anatomy books, for beginners, is that they are simply intimidating, in their detail, their precision, their absolute realism. PECK overcomes this anatomical intimidation. I would venture that PECK ought to be included in at least the first several \\"drawing\\" books that one acquires. Sometimes it seems that several pages offer more practical instruction to a new student than entire chapters in the books coming out in recent years with gimmicky titles.\\"Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist,\\" in combination with any beginning book on figure drawing is a must. With Famous Artist's School, Willy Pogany, Walt Reed, Jack Hamm, Viktor Perard and similar instruction, any ...................book-buyer / beginning artist will find themselves advancing steadily. I rate this in the top 4 of figure drawing books for the beginner.The chapter on \\"Distinctions of Age, Sex, And Race\\" is highly useful. PECK may be in danger of getting shoved aside with time and the publication of new pablum texts containing nothing new or vital; but PECK has written a timeless text that commands respect.

There are some photos for reference as well. The writeup is descriptive and simple to understand. The examples are well illustrated and clearly labeled. It's pretty comprehensive.While it also has some figure drawing tips and instructions, it certainly is not as comprehensive as dedicated figure drawing books. Here, it's on the approach to drawing certain parts. There's not much on posing the figure.I see this book get mentioned a lot on art forums online, for good reasons.

I have not seen (ever) a better description of human anatomy, bodily motion and the methodology for capturing both in artistic media. This book describes every detail of the human anatomy from multiple angles.In the section describing the bones, it shows you how the bones look for all ages and each sex. It shows you how the bones move, and work together. It shows you what the bones look like from the underside.In the sections covering muscles, it shows you how fat is stored in the muscle, how the the muscles move, how blood vessles show through the muscle and how the muscles layer.There are detailed portrayals of proportion, motion, emotion and prospective, all in photos and drawn graphics - not just in words.As I said, I've never seen a better book for describing the human body to an artist, and I've been on the look-out for more than 20 years."},{"Title":"ATLAS OF HUMAN ANATOMY FOR THE ARTIST","review":"Mostly focusing on bone, and muscle structure this guide is excellent for finding what you need quickly.

A part of me regrets buying this book because I expected a figure drawing book. It isn't. It's a reference to human anatomy and I guess half if not most of the book is useful. I just can't give it 4 or 5 stars because Mr. Peck uses more words than visual diagrams to explain how the body moves and where fat develops. The section about fat is purely textual. It would have been better if there's a diagram of an average person overlaid with outlines where fat develops.I still use it to supplement Joseph Sheppard's Drawing the Living Figure though.I ordered Anatomy of Movement by Blandine Calais-Germain and I hope the high reviews of that book reflect its actual quality.I guess it's true that there is no one-stop shop book on anatomy and figure drawing. An artist must have access to a library - personal or otherwise - to learn from.Again, Mr. Peck's book in my opinion doesn't deserve 4 or 5 stars but if you do buy it, you won't regret it as much as let's say buying an anatomy book authored by Christopher Hart (blech)."},{"Title":"ATLAS OF HUMAN ANATOMY FOR THE ARTIST","review":"By far the best book on human anatomy for artists.

Study them well until you can reproduce them from any angle from memory. Those simple, blocky diagrams and the accompanying handwritten teacher's notes are like gold.

Fortunately, he supplements them with his own soft pencil drawings on other pages, and he includes detailed (and surprisingly readable and relevant) descriptions of how different bones and muscles connect. He does give the proper names for muscles and bones, but he doesn't bore us with overly scientific discussion.The few photographs don't illustrate much, but they serve as fair examples for differing body types and positions. Peck puts uncommon effort into facial features and expressions: he doesn't just draw the muscles on the face, but he indicates the directions they pull and how they work to express temperament.A previous reviewer expressed dislike for the racial comparisons - but I liked them. I don't think Peck means to say &quot;all white people look like this, all black people look like this, etc.&quot; but he gives the artist characteristics to watch for when drawing from life (to base your own drawings off of his descriptions, well, yes, that would be silly).He also describes proportions and motion in good detail.

Learning body and head proportions is key to drawing more realistic-looking people, and this book can help you along. Peck's illustrations show you different ways to look at the human body, sometimes using blocks, spheres, and other objects to represent how a certain muscle group works or looks to help you better understand how it should be drawn. He covers everything from musculoskeletal structure to facial expressions, emotions, and photos of faces from around the world. And for those who like to warm up their skills by sketching people but have no model to use, there are several human model pictures towards the back of the book to help you out. Before I took college courses and had real models to work with, I used these photos to do my many quick pencil or charcoal sketches as a warm-up for drawing. Having this book before those courses definitely helped me draw better and faster than some of the others who were learning to draw people for the first time. I have referenced it several times since then when drawing or painting people to make sure I'm getting the right idea of the muscle structure. I have used other books for learning to draw people that was more step-by-step, but this book has a lot of different detail other books don't have.And I was surprised to find out it was from the 50's when I looked it up here on Amazon, since it doesn't really appear that way at all."},{"Title":"ATLAS OF HUMAN ANATOMY FOR THE ARTIST","review":"I am an art student who wanted a guide to the human body.

Unfortunately, this book has proven to be a massive disappointment - especially for the typical price a 1st edition Rowland goes for - with none of the graphics, none of the comparative study, barely any of the contemporary concrete or New Town design you'd expect from a book with such a 'modern' title and such hauntological stable-mates.Over half the content of this book is given over to Venetian piazzas, Medieval woodblock prints of hovels, and stone fronted Georgian terraces all depicted in flat, insipid B&W; plates that have none of the contrast or zing that tends to feature in good 1960s architectural photography [and which features in the other three books]. There is barely a chapter at the end on modern design, with a couple of flyovers & footbridges, a shopping centre, and a housing estate. Nothing of the planning or design methodology of either ancient or modern towns is shown pictorially making this a very dull and dry book and a really disappointing departure from the style of the previous volumes in the series where just as much information is represented visually as written about.I have given this book one 'excited/disappointed-more-with-each-turn-of-the-page' read after unwrapping, and one 'I-simply-cannot-believe-what-an-awful-waste-of-an-opportunity-this-was' flick through a few days afterwards. I shall be selling it on without hesitation.If you are curious about Kurt Rowland's books, buy 'Pattern and Shape' instead, which is much better."},{"Title":"Who Speaks for God?","review":"This book was very interesting to me, as it was a nice break from the media representation of all religion as being part of the conservative moment. Wallis takes the Religious Right to task for their lack of religion, especially their non-concern for the poor. His ending segment from the Call for Renewal about how &quot;religion as a political cheerleader is inevitably false as a religion&quot; sums up the whole book - we must remain true to our religious ideals and not become ideologues. Unfortunately, the Christian Coalition is strictly political and not religious and true voices for religious politics, like those of Wallis and most other religious folks, get lost in the media stereotype of religion."},{"Title":"Who Speaks for God?","review":"I found this book had a lot to offer. Wallis starts with the assumption that the Religious Right (or the Christian Coalition, take your pick) doesn't really represent the opinions of most Christians, nor does it really represent the teachings of the guy that the whole shebang is named after, Jesus. He also maintains the Left, with its emphasis on certain issues, doesn't really offer a whole lot for Christians of moral conviction. I can't really argue with his analysis. He goes on to deal with what America, and the world, really needs: compassion, community, and civility. He then details how these are currently lacking, how these concepts tie in to Christianity, and how these concepts can help improve things in general.My two nit-picking complaints are that, one, he doesn't do much to detail how to achieve the desired states of compassion, community and civility, and, two, he doesn't do much to explain that this message is for more than just Christians. His message is one of inclusivity, and throughout the book, he does mention people of other faiths, but this book seems mostly written for Christians. I think it's important to realize that there are a number of people of other faiths, and a number of people of no particular faith, who would agree with what he says we need.Overall a pretty good book, encouraging and inspiring.

(Wallis doesn't appear to evenknow any conservatives). Then I tried searching for whatother people had found in it on the web - thinking thatcould bring some clarity to the what it is, what it means.I found that a lot of other people thought highly of it -It's won some awards!

Whenclassifying it as entertaining, I mean entertaining in the same sensethat 'Melrose Place' or even 'Days Of Our Lives' is, or was, classed as entertainment.

There are numerous mysterious characters, ranging from assasins to rich powerful playboys - all of whom we've seen so many times in the wide variety of day time soap operas.

Brian Freemantle wrote this under the pen name of Jack Winchester. I haven't read any of his other novels but certainly this ranks up there with my all time favourites so I have been keeping an eye out for his other work.It's relatively short for a thriller novel, but the physical length of it is deceptive - its depth of character is so engaging that it actually takes longer than you would expect to read it. It's the story of an ageing spy, an ex-concentration camp victim who, later in life, is a double agent for the CIA and KGB. Given the opportunity to return to a more normal life, he forms a plan to escape from the clutches of both agencies. However, it's more about the main character, a very intelligent but simple man, flawed and human. The story itself is also interesting, and overall it is well presented, and easy to read.I've never known anyone to dislike this book and I am frankly very surprised it isn't more widely available. Highly recommended and a very satisfying novel."},{"Title":"Child's play","review":"This play was written in 1970 and made it immediately to the stage, where Fritz Weaver won both a Drama Desk award and a Tony as best dramatic actor and the play won a Tony for Best Drama in 1970. The play itself concerns the events at a private all-boys school somewhere in America. A newly-hired athletic coach witnesses the cruel blinding of a young boy on the playground, and begins to suspect that something is not quite right. The on-stage crucifixion of another youth and the suicide of a faculty member heighten the tension. It sounds horrific and cheesy, but in fact the play is heavy on dialogue, introspection, and lengthy monologues about the nature of loyalty, love, admiration, social norms and rules, group-think and trust. The shocking denouement had my jaw open when I first saw this play produced in college.

I could hardly wait to see what the next page would bring. There was a slight lull when Charlotte seemed to wander aimlessly after her attempted affair with Peter, but all-in-all, a definite all-nighter!! I particularly appreciated how the author did not give sordid details of the actual rapes, but rather left that to the assumed knowledge of the reader. While this is a sensitive subject I feel the author handled it quite sensitively and managed to not allow Charlotte to feel that she had done something to warrant this treatment from Ted. It was also quite refreshing to see how Claudia, Ted's mother, and Charlotte could put aside their obvious uncomfortable positions and remain close friends. Also, while Claudia displayed the feelings of a true mother, she also felt that Ted should be punished for the crimes he so apparently had violently committed. I felt the subject matter was handled in a delicate and appropriate manner. My sincere congratulations to Ms. Plain."},{"Title":"Secrecy","review":"The older we get, the more memories we collect - and many are built on former memories!

I think I read it to him seven times just today. He has always been a dinosaur fan, but this book really brings the characters to life for him. He loves pointing out each dinosaur in each illustration and telling me their names. When we are not reading the book, he asks us to act out the roles of the dinos in the story. For some reason, I always get to be Tyrannosaurus Rex! I'm thrilled with the book because it is a fun story that also happens to offer factual information about the dinosaurs in it. It's been a great help to our discussion about which dinosaurs were herbivores and which were carnivores.

The novel does not paint detailed pictures, but the cleverness of Austen's wit is worth the read in itself. I was disturbed in a one place where Austen broke the continuity of the story for a personal rant, but overall the subtly and intricacy of the plot was much more than I expected, and in the later half of the book I was particularly on edge.I also think that this would be a good book for young people trying to understand relationships. Austen very powerfully demonstrates the underlying manipulation and frivolity that so often accompanies young men and women."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Another fabulous story by Jane Austen. This may be \\"lite\\" as another reviewer suggested...but I've never found anything heavy about any of Austen's works. They are all delightful to read. It never fails to surprise me how little the dealings between men and women have changed over the past 200 years. This was truly a joy to read and I would recommend it to everyone. The characters and the storyline are full of humor and mystery...with a touch of debauchery thrown in. FABULOUS!"},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Okay, so I still love Mansfield Park (my other favorite JA), but I have to say that after reading Northanger Abbey, I now have a new #1. By the last couple of chapters, I was reading only about two pages per day, just so I could prolong the enjoyment of reading this book. I did not want it to end! Northanger Abbey is wonderful on so many levels! The richness of Austen's prose has never been more delightful than in this, her earliest work. The humor infused throughout is gentle and affectionate, but elicits out-loud laughs on many occasions. The setting, especially that of Northanger Abbey, is just as mysterious and intriguing as one could hope for. And the characters! Never has Austen presented us with such a charming and memorable cast. Catherine Morland is my favorite heroine ever. She is just adorable. You cannot help but love her, with her vivid, overly-romantic imagination --- which I'm sure many of us devoted novel-readers can relate to --- and her guileless sincerity. She is sweetly innocent, intelligent, modest, and just extremely lovable. And Henry Tilney has got to be the best hero Austen has ever created. I was certainly in love with him! He is kind, clever, handsome, and intelligent. He teases Catherine in the most affectionate of ways, yet defends her with ferocity. I always got the sense that she was safe when he was near, and I got nervous every time he left Northanger Abbey. The scenes between Catherine and Henry contain some of the snappiest dialogue Austen ever wrote. They are a perfect match, to be sure. And the supporting characters! Talk about a female antagonist that you will love to hate! Isabella Thorpe is really a piece of work --- one of Austen's most memorable creations. Not to mention Isabella's brother John. He is one of those characters that makes you cringe every time he appears on the scene, because you just get the sense that he is going to cause trouble for Catherine. General Tilney is really fascinating. I won't give anything away, but let's just say that I was as mystified by him as Catherine was. And Eleanor Tilney is really a wonderful character that doesn't get the credit she deserves. She seems perfect --- kindhearted, loyal, beautiful, moral. Yet she never comes off as cloying and proves herself to be the kind of true friend that Catherine longs for.Northanger Abbey is a real page-turner. Austen's best work, in my opinion. I only wish it was longer!

The text is not too small unlike some other editions, it makes for comfortable reading. The book itself is sturdy, as it is in hardback, but not unwieldy - it fits nicely into my hands.

In all, a value buy."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Northanger Abbey is a gem. Jane Austen (1775-1817)has written a charmiing little novel about a charming little lady named Catherine Moreland. Catherine is 15 as the novel begins in Wiltshire. She and the hilariously stupid Mrs. Allen go on a six week trip to nearby Bath to take the waters. Catherine meets the fashionable and fast Isabella Thorpe. Catherine dances with the clergyman Henry Tilney at a ball becoming infatuated with the clever young man. Henry and Catherine share a love for the Romantic Gothic novels of such authors as Ann Radcliff and Fanny Burney. Complications ensue but in the end the couple are wed.The first half of the novel deals with doings in Bath; the second half is a trip taken by Catherine to the Tilney estate Northanger Abbey. Catherine thinks the house may contain a ghost as she is influenced in her thinking by a vivid imagination fueled by her sensational Gothic reading.Minor characters are of interest: Captain Frederick Tilney the ladies man brother of Henry; old General Tilney the gruff father of Fred and Henry; Catherine's parents and Eleanor Tilney the kind and lovely sister of the two Tilney boys with whom Catherine forms a solid friendship.The book includes a spirited defense of the art of novel writing by Miss Austen. It is a light and commonplace tale of young love told with the wit and wisdom of one of England's greatest authors. This less well known Austen novel is a delightful way to become an addict of the spinster from Hawton parsongage!"},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I absolutely love this story. It was written to be read more than once, as the humor is sometimes lost the first time around. My favorite thing about the novel is the \\"normal\\" heroine Catherine. I found it really easy to relate with how she was feeling throughout the entire book and could just picture her talking to me.John Thorpe reminded me of high school and his character added to the adolescent/innocence of the overall book.My favorite part of the book is Catherine's trip to, and arrival of, Northanger Abbey. Henry's tale was very graphic and Catherine's sleepless night and awakening morning made me laugh.Any Jane Austen fan would love this book and those that found Pride and Prejudice too difficult/boring/etc., this book might make them a fan."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"The satire isn't as harsh, and the humor isn't as brilliant as you will find in Austen's major works, but don't let that stop you from enjoying this little book.It's a charming and funny short novel that spoofs gothic fiction and romantic sentiment in a way that is surprisingly modern. Although the novel is full of subtle references to Jane Austen's favorite (and least favorite) books, you don't need to know anything about them to enjoy the story. Think of it as a teen comedy with moments of slapstick, lots of offbeat humor, and social embarassment galore, and you will be right in the spirit of Northanger Abbey. Some of the customs and vocabulary in the book are out of date, of course. But most of it will be easy to understand even without footnotes, (although it's nice to have them handy if you need them). Austen's wonderful talent for dialogue still makes this little novel a treat to read. I have re-read Northanger Abbey every year since I was a teenager myself, and I still smile all the way through it!"},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I was a little wary of reading this book since she was never able to get it published during her lifetime despite trying for many years. I assumed that if she couldn't get it published that it probably wasn't very good. I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of this book. It is meant to be a satirical work mocking the Gothic romance popular during Jane Austin's lifetime. In such romances, there were fictional monsters and secret corridors and such, and in this book the main character, Catherine, keeps thinking that such things were going to pop up or had popped up, but they never really had. Towards the end, instead of some fantastic mythical monster, a real monster emerges as the culprit behing the pain Catherine experiences: pride in rank. The father of Henry Tilney, whom Catherine has fallen in love with, refuses to allow them to be married because Catherine is of a lower rank and has less money that his family does. Austin vilifies the wealth heriarchy of her day through both Henry's father and through her friend Isabella who tries to do anything that she can to marry someone wealthier than herself, leading Catherine to much pain.This is nowhere near as good as some of Miss Austin's other works, but it is good nontheless, and a fun read. It's much better if you understand what Gothic romance novels were like, since this is a satire on those novels.Overall grade: B+"},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Seventeen-year-old Catherine Morland has always been preoccupied with three very important things: dancing, dressing, and reading sensational novels. But doing these things won't get you a husband, or acquaint you with other young ladies, such as yourself. So, upon request from a neighbor, Catherine is invited to spend some time in Bath - a fashionable town, where Catherine will have the opportunity to interact with people of her own age and stature, who are not related to her. And that is where the naive Catherine meets up with the Thorpe family. Quickly becoming friends with Isabella Thorpe, Catherine begins spending much of her time with the illustrious, yet conniving family. And it is only when Catherine is rescued by Henry Tilney, along with his charming sister, Eleanor, and whisked off to their ancestral home, known only as Northanger Abbey. There, Catherine's choice of reading material - mysteries and ghost stories, that is - comes back to haunt her; for Northanger Abbey is victim to terrible noises in the night - such as creaking, and frightening winds, that leave Catherine feeling as if she is residing in a haunted place herself. The fact that the enormous house is filled with various locked doors, and a curious history only heightens young Catherine's suspicions, and makes her question what mystery and secrets are lurking within Northanger Abbey, and the Tilney family, in general.Jane Austen has been a favorite of mine since I was very young, but it was not until this past weekend that I happened upon NORTHANGER ABBEY while browsing through the bookstore, and decided to purchase it. I will admit that, hands down, this has become one of my favorite Austen books. Catherine is an enchanting character, whose innocence, and naivete make her charming from beginning to end; while her overactive imagination leaves the reader chuckling in delight at the many crazy notions she creates within that bright head of hers. Catherine's interactions with Isabella Thorpe, and the rest of the Thorpe family are intrepid, and truly make you feel strong emotion towards those particular characters; while the charming Henry Tilney - like Mr. Darcy - makes you root for a romance to blossom between our dashing businessman, and our young heroine. A wonderful, satirical piece of fiction, that should certainly be discovered by anyone who calls themselves an Austen fan.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"This was a wonderful read. This was a realistic, though satirical, work about a young girl who goes to Bath and is at first utterly out of place, and then finds her niche. She makes some terrible friends at first because of her gullibility and innocence, but then falls in with some nicer people who appreciate her honesty and this same innocence. Her friendships develop in realistic ways, first with Isabella, which quickly and unreasonably flares up. Her friendship with Henry's sister begins more slowly but as a result is that much more lasting. Henry is a very likable and witty character; the introduction to the text says that it is in some ways based on Austen herself. He is also, however, not idealized completely. Through her characters and their interaction, Austen shows us the pitfalls of English society in this time period, and also lightly mocks the dramatics and irrationality of gothic novels. It is a nice commentary on literature of that time period, and a joy to read!"},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"This was the first Jane Austen book I read, when I was a teenager, and it didn't impress me then--maybe because it starts off rather boringly, as she spends a whole chapter and more telling us how mediocre and ordinary her heroine is. Now that I've read more romantic-adventure novels--and seen the same kind of movies--Austen's warnings that Catherine isn't a beautiful orphan who is likely to get into life-threatening situations are a bit easier to take. The parallel romances of Catherine and her flirtatious friend Isabella are delights to follow, and I can't help but wonder why no film has been made of this Austen novel (though I believe there was a British TV miniseries). In short, not the best of the Austen romances, but a charmer that the author herself keeps warning us not to take too seriously."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I hear that authors never like people to pick their early works as their best, but I've always had a sneaking fondness for Northanger Abbey. Luckily, Jane Austen is unlikely to complain about me liking one of her earliest works.The novel's appeal is its extremely likeable anti-heroine, Catherine Morland. Catherine's appeal is her innocence and above all her fallibility. Of course, none of Austen's heroines are perfect, but Catherine has a charm that Austen's more self-possessed characters like Emma Woodhouse and Lizzie Bennett lack.For this reason, I would say that Northanger Abbey can be a good introduction to Jane Austen, especially for younger readers, who may identify more readily with Catherine's naivete than with some of Austen's more mature characters.As ever, Austen is in fine satirical form, but she and her characters stop short of outright mocking the fanciful Catherine and her unfortunate novel-reading habits. As one might expect, the novel ends with Catherine's reform, redemption would perhaps be too strong a term to use here, and Austen allows the imperfect Catherine to shine among a sea of other imperfect characters. (Naturally, some are more imperfect than others.)One of the novel's stated objects is to satirise the gothic novels of Mrs. Radcliffe and her imitators. For the most part, Austen succeeds admirably, but once again her treatment of the subject is rather gentle. Although not many people these days will read the original gothic novels, I'm sure there are plenty of people out there addicted to contemporary fantastical horror that would crack a wry smile at the story, and be able to identify with 'poor' Catherine.Perhaps at times the characters do seem to be a little overstated, maybe a little too black and white, but this is a very creditable early effort from Austen, and perhaps some of her characterisation issues can be traced back to her use of the gothic novel as inspiration.All in all, a fine book, and certainly one for all of those 'almost pretty' girls out there who have their heads stuck inside books at every opportunity."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"A 17 year-old girl,Catherine Morland travels to Bath with Mr and Mrs.Allen,the family's neighbours and friends.There she meets some friends,including a man that Catherine will fall in love with,a polite gentleman,Henry Tilney.She is invited by the Tilneys to spend some weeks in Northanger Abbey,where Catherine ,influenced by the reading of The Misteries of Udolfo and naive as she is,starts to have the most absurdings ideas about the place and about Henry's father!!This is a very funny,enjoyable book.It's ironic and satirical in a delightful way."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"This is the novel of young Catherine Morland, who comes into the unfortunate knowledge that reality does not consist of the fantastical realms literature represents it to be.

Young Catherine takes us through her stay at the affluent city of Bath; with it's balls, theater and propietous atmosphere- her stay with friends at a mysterious, grand abbey and her trip back to her home.

Austen was on the top of my list. After reading Northanger Abbey, I think I'll eventually go thorough all of her works.Why? Well, it's like reading about an alien race and their customs and habits. I realize the society that she writes about was her own and not that long ago ... yet, it's so foreign when compared to today's society. It's like being plopped down in a foreign land and expected to relate to the natives -- and yet the characters are so vibrant that you find yourself drawn in.Catherine Morland is every person who takes people at face value -- if they are recommended as nice, kind, and entertaining people then they must be. In her sheltered life, that attitude has always worked. But on her first trip to Bath, Catherine has to learn to listen to her own heart, observe what others do and form her own opinions. Sounds simple but in that society, women weren't exactly encouraged to think for themselves. Catherine's active imagination, fueled by all the novels she has read, color her perceptions. She learns to recognize the difference between fantasy and reality but maintains her sense of humor.Delightful, insightful, and fun to read."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"If you're a fan of Austen's other works like I am, you'll probably read this book regardless of any detracting review... so this is more for me to vent than anything else!The last time I read this was as a teen, and it didn't leave much of an impression then. I've just finished reading it again after having watched both film adaptations.The story itself is engaging and interesting. It is a satire of gothic novels, and that aspect of it is very entertaining. I found myself laughing out loud at quite a few lines. But I could only enjoy it on that level, because I couldn't bring myself to care about the characters themselves. They seem to be written on purpose to be either unlikeable or uninteresting.The main character, Catherine, is a complete simpleton. I kept finding myself rolling my eyes and inwardly saying, \\"Oh, please,\\" in regards to her outlandishly wrong opinions and conjectures about people. The fact that she's 17 doesn't excuse this extreme naivet&eacute; and lack of judgment. I was a better judge of character at 17, and I was about as naive as it gets!Henry Tilney, who is supposed to be such a gentleman (especially when compared with one of the novel's \\"villains,\\" John Thorpe) seems to me to be as rude as John Thorpe but just in a different way. Until the very end of the book, Henry almost never says anything that is not sarcastic or joking. And usually his conversations are based on something he finds amusing about the other person that he wants to play off of, but so subtly that the person he is addressing doesn't realize that he is making fun of them. He does this even with Catherine, who is his love interest. I can't for the life of me figure out what attracts him to her (or vice versa)--other than the fact that he enjoys having someone always around whom he can feel superior towards. (Austen even alludes to this in Ch. 14: \\"a good-looking girl with an affectionate heart, and a very ignorant mind, cannot fail of attracting a clever young man.\\") He even calls his sister \\"stupid\\" in one of these sarcastic speeches, after which his sister assures Catherine that \\"he must be entirely misunderstood if he can ever appear to say... an unkind [thing] of me.\\" Sorry, sis, he just did! Whether or not he meant it, it was still unkind.The Allens, the Morlands, and Miss Tilney are all nice but dull, and everyone else surrounding Catherine is positively obnoxious. Maybe this was on purpose and Austen's intent was that the characters and not just the plot be satirical. If so, then she succeeded. But personally, I prefer novels in which I can care about and like the heroines and heroes, as I do in her other books.If this were all I knew of Austen's writing, I wouldn't be inclined to read any of her other works! Fortunately her others are much better than this one. P&P; is one of my favorite books of all time and I've read it countless times. Next in order of preference would be Emma, S&S;, Mansfield Park, and Persuasion. But this one I could do without. I guess that's not too suprising since it was her first novel (though last to be published)."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Catherine Morland has nothing to recommend her as a bride. She is somewhat pretty in a tomboyish kind of way, but she is far from rich. She is also not particularly accomplished. She is passionate about gothic novels, but that is hardly a quality men seek. What is a girl of marriageable age to do? To Catherine's delight, she travels to Bath, where she meets the charming Mr. Tinley, who invites her to meet his family at his estate called Northanger Abbey. Catherine loves the house's dark and mysterious appearance. Her imagination gets the best of her, and soon she begins to experience things not unlike the stuff she reads about in The Mysteries of Udolpho.I didn't know what to expect from Jane Austen's \\"dud.\\" This was published last, though it wasn't the last novel Austen penned (I believe Persuasion was her final completed work). I had read all of her books except for this one, for everyone told me it wasn't that great. Well, even though this isn't the best Austen novel, it is not terrible either. It exceeded my expectations in more ways than one. Austen's keen eye for satire can be appreciated more here than in any of her other novels. She let us know what she felt about the gothic genre, not in a derogatory manner, but with sharp humor and interesting characters. Catherine is an engaging heroine, though irritating at times, and Mr. Tinley is so charming that I couldn't help falling for him. There are no surprises in the story, but that did not take away from my enjoyment. As a lover of gothic novels and a fan of the likes of Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Bronte and Daphne du Maurier, I was able to laugh at Austen's antics. I definitely recommend this novel if you haven't read it. If you're new to Jane Austen, then I advise you to read this one first, that way you won't be disappointed with it after reading the others. But if you hate this book, move on to the other books, for you might feel differently about the others.

It nevertheless has several merits.One distinction is that the voice of Jane Austen the narrator is perhaps picked up more clearly here than in her other novels. Here you will find, for example, her minor dissertation in praise of the novel, \\"... work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge of the human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humor are conveyed to the world in the best chosen language\\".A second quality is the strong sense of location that emanates from its pages. Jane Austen is rarely a travel guide, but here she conducts the reader around the small English city of Bath.A third excellence is its depiction of its \\"heroine\\" Catherine Moreland, a 17 year-old who gradually learns that reality is not the same as it's depicted in Mrs Radcliffe's novels.And so it is great fun to read of the novel-reading heroine Catherine finding mortifications and infatuations in Bath. It is fun also to see if \\"something must and will happen to throw a hero in her way\\"."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"One of Jane Austen's best attributes as a writer is her rapier wit and sense of humor, which especially shows itself in her earlier novels, &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; and &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;. &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;, which preceded both of them but was published only after her death, is a clever parody of the Gothic novel as written by Anne Radcliffe: full of dark, stormy nights, ancient castles with secret passages and locked rooms hiding unspeakable crimes, damsels in distress, and all the rest. Austen's heroine, Catherine Morland, has read a few too many such books, and we meet her at the age of seventeen, emerging from the chrysalis of adolescence as a passably pretty young woman with her head full of romantic notions and not much else. When she meets the hero of her dreams, Henry Tilney, a surprisingly level-headed young man, Catherine realizes that life as melodrama is a poor second to life in reality. Catherine is fascinated at the prospect of visiting Northanger Abbey -- what mysteries and horrors must be waiting to be discovered -- only to be brought up short by the pedestrian intrusion of real life (a locked cabinet which might have held vials of poison or, even better, a skeleton, turns out to hold nothing more dangerous than a laundry list).&quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is a good first novel but it is by no means Jane Austen's best, and Catherine is not as interesting a heroine as Elizabeth Bennet, Emma Watson or Elinor Dashwood; she's a somewhat shallow, undeveloped young lady who lacks their depth and their intelligence. But she's a likeable heroine; unlike Fanny Price, Catherine doesn't try to be perfect nor judge others for failing to be so, and unlike Emma Watson, she's not meddling in everyone else's business. She can admit when she's at fault and she has a generous spirit. We like to imagine her as the tomboy Austen pictures her in her childhood, rolling down hills and chasing her brothers and sisters. Austen provided a number of interesting supporting characters: Henry's amiable sister Elinor, his insufferably snobbish and narrow-minded father General Tilney, and the artful, heartless flirt Isabella Thorpe. By the book's end, Catherine has grown up a bit; she sees life as it is and realizes Henry's steady common sense is infinitely preferable to the histrionics of any Gothic hero. Jane Austen's first book was a promising introduction of better things to come."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"The voices on the book are hard on the hear speaking with no feeling or expression.

Not in the tradional sense of being a difficult begining. Truthfully I thouroughly enjoyed the book from the start. (The opening paragraph was brilliant in my opinion). No, I had done something very wrong. I watched the movie first. Not that this is always wrong,(altough should be avioded when possible), I have watched some movies that have left me looking foward to the inspiring lituarature such as PRIDE &amp; PREJUDICE or DAVID COPPERFIELD. But this movie punched me, left me reeling, never wanting to read a book that could produce a film like this.Flash foward a few years. My wife being an avid Austen reader was also hesitant about reading it. But she took the plunge and gave it a go. While it was not her favorite book, she enjoyed it enough to recomend it to me, saying it was almost completly different from the book.So with a little less trepidation I eventually decided I would read it. Amazing. I really liked this book. Why had I never wanted to read this book? How could they make a movie like that from this kind of material to work with? Why don't they get the people who did the PRIDE &amp; PREJUDICE mini-series to do this?My only problem with it was that it ended way to fast for me. Everything seemed to be resolved and finished in the last two or three pages, with very little of how thier lives turn out in the end.

However, on the whole, I found _Northanger Abbey_ to be a dull story, since it's an obvious imitation of more interesting gothic novels, such as Ann Radcliffe's _The Mysteries of Udolpho_ and _The Italian_, which I also just read.From an intellectual standpoint, I'd read this book again, and recommend it on that basis(probably because I read it for a course). But if you want a good and consistent gothic tale with an ending as strong as the introduction, turn to Radcliffe for starters.

The other 95% of the book was pretty boring to me. Maybe I am jaded by all the horror and mysteries I read where I am used to fast paced suspense, but seriously, I would read one chapter a day or maybe two with this book and that was all I could handle, because it would make me tired. I felt no connection with the main character Catherine, and I found myself not caring what happened to her, good or bad.

But after she gets to Northanger Abbey it is a bit of a letdown. When she starts to suspect that General Tilney has done away with his wife, how much better it would have been if that had, in fact, been the case. naturally Catherine would find the proof to convict the General. It could have been the start of a gret mystery series, under the general title of the Morland Mysteries, or Miss Morland Investigates. Hnery Tilney could have been her amiable but obtuse sidekick, poor old henry, he never gets the murderer's identity right. Miss Austen missed a golden opportunity here.

Intertwined with the themes of parody and the elements of foreshadowing and metaphoric language, Northanger Abbey distinguishes itself far from the expected in a Jane Austen Novel.The story starts out with dear Catherine, who at the age of seventeen is showing signs of the early peaks of beauty. Coming from a traditional family of ten children, Catherine is first described as very plain and subjected into playing Cricket and Baseball rather than with dolls. She is then introduced to a world in Bath, where society molds her years of adolescence and changes her into becoming a respectable young lady.What is really impressive in this work by Austen is that Catherine is not the typical \\"Damsel in Distress\\". Rather than being a damsel just waiting for the world to rescue her, she is distressed with the idea of being rescued and finds refuge in reading gothic novels. Jane Austen cleverly weaves in allusions of period gothic novels such as The Monk. As Catherine mentioned the books, Austen slyly put in hidden parodies and critiques of the works through the ridiculous images that Catherine imagines after indulging herself. The villains, the Thorpes, gave great humor in their dialogue as well as kept me captivated throughout the book as a whole. They were the epitome of gold diggers and what really amused me was the fact that Mr. John Thorpe played the role so perfectly that he could be representation of the modern day nut-brain in our society.The best part of the novel, in my opinion was Mr. Henry Tilney. Mr. Tilney, son of General Tilney, the hero of the story is by far in par with legendary Pride and Prejudice's Mr. Darcy. What puts him apart from the typical Jane Austen man is that Mr. Tilney has a personality that speaks volumes. He is full of wit and charisma that the slang word of \\"swag\\" wouldn't be enough to describe his aura. Early in the novel, when Catherine first arrives in Bath, he captivates her with his good looks and charming ways. Although Jane Austen is known for deceiving the audience with her men, Mr. Tilney is no fake, he is really charming. For the girls, like myself, who enjoy reading of distinguished English men with old school manners; Northanger Abbey is a seller.I could read this novel over and over, my only critique is that some of the characters such as Catherine's parents and Mr. Tilney's family could have had further characterization. It seemed as though at some points in the novel, those characters lacked growth. Other than that, it is now a favorite book of mine. I must say, because of Ms. Austen's lioness ways and feisty writing style, it can be concluded that once again the reader has entered into the lion's den."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"This is, by far, my favorite Jane Austen novel of all time.

This is as riveting as her other works, with the addition of some laugh out loud moments as Catherine explores the \\"secrets\\" of Northanger Abbey with a foreboding instilled by her reading habits.There is spookiness, family drama, thwarted love, betrayal, deception and manipulation, as well as the sense that integrity and goodness will win the day as they usually do in Austen's works. This is another unforgettable classic."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Northanger Abbey is not usually considered to be Jane Austen's best work.

Not surprisingly, my favorite was Pride and Prejudice, but my #2 choice was her little-known book Northanger Abbey. Northanger Abbey was published after Austen's death, though it was written much earlier. It's a bit different from her other works. It is a very good parody and satire of the financial considerations of marriage among English gentry of the time, as well as of the then popular Gothic literature.Catherine is different from the typical heroine. She is very ordinary, and not at all heroic. She's rather naive, somewhat ignorant, pleasant-looking but not beautiful. She's grown up one of ten children in a parsonage, but gets the chance to go with family friends to visit Bath. She doesn't have men falling at her feet, and actually has only one real suitor other than the hero. She wants to see the best in people and is easily misled as to the character of a friend, even when we can see that she's almost wilfully blind. She's enthralled with Gothic literature and when circumstances take her to a forbidding abbey, partially in ruins, her imagination is prone to running away from her.Austen's parodying of Gothic literature and the travails of the marriage market is outstanding. I love dry humor, and this book is rife with it, much more than Austen's others. A few samples:\\"When the hour of departure drew near, the maternal anxiety of Mrs. Morland will be naturally supposed to be most severe. A thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness, and drown her in tears for the last day or two of their being together;... Cautions against the violence of such noblemen and baronets as delight in forcing young ladies away to some remote farmhouse, must, at such a moment, relieve the fulness of her heart. Who would not think so? But Mrs. Morland knew so little of lords and baronets, that she entertained no notion of their general mischievousness, and was wholly unsuspicious of danger to her daughter from their machinations. Her cautions were confined to the following points. \`I beg, Catherine, you will always wrap yourself up very warm about the throat, when you come from the Rooms at night; and I wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend....'\\"\\"Under these unpromising auspices, the parting took place, and the journey began. It was performed with suitable quietness and uneventful safety. Neither robbers nor tempests befriended them, nor one lucky overturn to introduce them to the hero. Nothing more alarming occurred than a fear on Mrs. Allen's side, of having once left her clogs behind her at an inn, and that fortunately proved to be groundless.\\"I would definitely recommend this book to any who have enjoyed Austen's other books, but also to those who enjoy satire or dry humor. While relatively unknown, this is, in my opinion, one of Austen's best."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Jane Austen's first novel is a delightful and witty satire of gothic literature, and is a paradigm of both her future genius and current youthful exuberance. While I would argue that Austen by no means condemns the genre itself nor the reading of it, she does artfully illustrate the foolishness of expecting such romantic extremes in real life, and in her own writing acknowledges the conventions of the genre that render it so identifiable. Like Austen's later work, Northanger Abbey is full of social commentary and astute observations as she leads you through a year of the life of Catherine Morland - the increasingly romantic young woman who finds herself in several less-than-gothic conflicts.Northanger Abbey is as charming the second and third time as it was the first. As a fan of both Austen's body of work and the gothic genre, I can't help but find myself enamored with this particular work. I do not hesitate to give Northanger Abbey my highest rating."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Gothic romances were all the rage in the late 1700s and early 1800s -- and rather than the usual straight comedies of manners, Jane Austen once wrote a mellow satire of the very mockable genre. \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a clever and slightly tongue-in-cheek little novel about a girl who needs to learn the difference between fantasy and reality... and yes, there's some love tangles and deceptions too.Catherine Morland is an innocent young country girl with a love of gothic romances, and has lives an unremarkably life in a country parish. But then the wealthy Allens invite her to Bath during their vacation there, and of course she accepts -- and through balls and old acquaintances, she becomes friends with two pairs of siblings. One is the Thorpes, the uncouth dandy John and his manipulative sister Isabella, and the more mysterious Tilneys, the charming Henry and sweet Eleanor.When the Tilneys decide to leave Bath, Catherine is invited with them, to the vast stone manorhouse of Northanger Abbey -- which is as gloomy, eerie and remote as her gothic-loving heart could wish for. What's more, she believes that there are dangerous secrets in Northanger Abbey, related to the suspicious death of the late Mrs. Tilney.

There's big spooky manors, sinister noblemen, mysterious deaths... you do the math.And Austen clearly had a lot of fun with this book, enhancing her usual formal style with a bit of satirical melodrama (\\"A thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness\\").

She's sweet, naive, wide-eyed and essentially good-hearted, but she has a lot to learn about reality (especially about the golddigging family that befriends her). And Henry is an oddity among Austen's heroes, being a clever silver-tongued charmer with a heart of gold who likes to gently tease Catherine.Quick, light and full of teasing humor, \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is an oddity in Jane Austen's string of brilliant novels -- but being a clever, well-plotted spoof doesn't make it any less charming.

I love a good book and this just was not up to par."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Not one of Jane Austin's best works. Feels rushed, lack of story. It builds and builds and then just deflates, a little abruptly. Left me wondering where the other half of the story is."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"It's not surprising that \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is Jane Austen's first novel. It's not quite pulled together as smoothly as her more famous and well-regarded works, and the dialogue is stilted at times. However, the novel is still enjoyable enough that it's worth investing the time to read its mere 200 pages.Beginning novelists are told to \\"write what you know,\\" and a young Jane Austen followed that advice. \\"Northanger Abbey\\" tells the tale of a 17-year-old girl (Catherine) of a respectable family that lives in the countryside. Catherine is given her first real opportunity to see life beyond her rural village when she's asked to accompany an older couple on a six-week trip to Bath. Once there, Catherine is introduced to \\"society,\\" and her naive, straightforward way of looking at the actions and words of society people provides for satire and criticism of the pretensions of upper-crust life at the time.Many things are skewered, such as the idleness of time spent at bath, the lemming-like surges of people to the same places at the same time, and the rigid rules for manners and conduct that must be learned. But perhaps the thing most satirized is women. For example, Catherine's benefactor, Mrs. Allen, spends all of her time shopping for clothes and marking every occasion by what she and others are wearing. Also, Catherine's first Bath acquaintance, Isabella, constantly says one thing when she means the exact opposite and is always on the lookout for a new angle. (Remarkable how those traits continue today to be the primary cliches about how women spend their free time.)Meanwhile, Catherine stands in opposition to those two foolish women. Though not a beauty, she attracts the attention of two men. One is Isabella's brother John, who is a ridiculously boastful ass. Catherine quickly sees through his bluster. The other, Mr. Tilney, is a charmer who turns out to be a genuine gentleman. Things ultimately work out for Catherine and Mr. Tilney to live happily ever after, despite the machinations of John and some misunderstandings that involve Isabella, as well as Catherine's brother, and Tilney's sister Eleanor.Other reviewers have said that the book satirizes the gothic romances that were popular at the time, and I guess that critique is true. Austen goes to great pains to humorously distinguish the plot of her book from the intensity of those novels, and she makes it clear that her book is rooted in reality, not the supernatural realm that is the domain of the gothic.However, I detected a great deal of respect for those types of books. The narrator does attack gothic novels, and Austen also puts criticisms into the mouths of some of the characters. But she allows her heroine Catherine to defend those books because they: 1) Are enjoyable; and 2) Provide insights into human nature that are not readily available in non-fiction books. Given that the heroine Catherine is a devotee of gothic novels and that she triumphs in the end, in part because she uses the wisdom of those novels to understand people's motivations, I think that Austen is gentler towards popular fiction than many reviewers suggest. Isabella and Mr. Tilney, the other two favored characters, also declare their enjoyment of popular novels. If anything, I think Austen is defending the novels as providing some understanding about human nature, even while mostly serving as diversions for women wealthy enough to have leisure to read."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"\\"Northanger Abbey\\" does make a mockery of Gothic Romance. But Jane Austen shows that you can be passionate towards fiction literature without making fiction reality. The heroine, Catherine, learns that not everything in reality has a Gothic fiction story. That fiction is just that.Catherine Morland (17) goes to Bath with friends. She then meets Henry Tilney, whom invites her to his family's home - Northanger Abbey. Catherine expected a Gothic Abbey to match with the novels she reads (mainly Ann Radcliffe the creator of Gothic Romance). The comedy is that the Abbey, Henry and the Tilney's are just the opposite. They are wealthy \\"English Christians.\\"There are other subtext to parody of social marriages and manners. Jane Austen's books all have this comedic point if view.I would recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"What is there to say.... Jane Austin was the most dedicated writer of her time. Inclusive of love triangles, mystery, intrigue and of course deceit. For an author writing in the 1800's she is just simply amazing. I will warn readers to give yourself a chance to decifer the \\"language of the day\\".

In Bath, Catherine soon falls into fast company. Before any real harm can be done to her reputation, she meets Henry and Eleanor Tilney, respectable brother and sister, who are however members of the dangerous Tilney clan. Catherine is invited to visit the Tilney family estate of Northanger Abbey, where she finds that a gothic novel has somehow come to life around her...\\"Northanger Abbey\\" is perhaps not Jane Austen's best work, but it is a fun read and an example of her writing range.

Bought as a gift and they loved it very much. Would recommend."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Gothic romances were all the rage in the late 1700s and early 1800s -- and rather than the usual straight comedies of manners, Jane Austen once wrote a mellow satire of the very mockable genre. \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a clever and slightly tongue-in-cheek little novel about a girl who needs to learn the difference between fantasy and reality... and yes, there's some love tangles and deceptions too.Catherine Morland is an innocent young country girl with a love of gothic romances, and has lives an unremarkably life in a country parish. But then the wealthy Allens invite her to Bath during their vacation there, and of course she accepts -- and through balls and old acquaintances, she becomes friends with two pairs of siblings. One is the Thorpes, the uncouth dandy John and his manipulative sister Isabella, and the more mysterious Tilneys, the charming Henry and sweet Eleanor.When the Tilneys decide to leave Bath, Catherine is invited with them, to the vast stone manorhouse of Northanger Abbey -- which is as gloomy, eerie and remote as her gothic-loving heart could wish for. What's more, she believes that there are dangerous secrets in Northanger Abbey, related to the suspicious death of the late Mrs. Tilney. But Catherine has some lessons to learn about reality and fantasy: that everyday world is not nearly as melodramatic and twisted as her novels, and that it has its own dangers and deceptions.Unlike all the other books Austen wrote, \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a careful balance of two different styles -- a parody of all the lurid excesses of classic gothic novels (she even lists a bunch of real-life gothic novels!), and it's a subtle coming-of-age tale about a young girl who needs to figure out the difference between reality and fantasy. There's big spooky manors, sinister noblemen, mysterious deaths... you do the math.And Austen clearly had a lot of fun with this book, enhancing her usual formal style with a bit of satirical melodrama (\\"A thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness\\"). And while the plot is sprinkled with sinister pseudo-gothic hints, Austen also takes the time to sketch out some romantic deceptions and tangles, as well as some deliciously arch dialogue (\\"I was not thinking of anything.\\" \\"That is artful and deep, to be sure...\\").The only part that falls short is the climactic encounter between Henry and Catherine... which is completely skimmed over, and related only in a distant vague style. \\"I leave it to my reader's sagacity\\" is not a satisfying way to handle that sort of romantically-charged scene.Austen also has fun with Catherine as the unlikely heroine of the piece, especially since she makes it clear that Catherine comes from a very mundane, undramatic background. She's sweet, naive, wide-eyed and essentially good-hearted, but she has a lot to learn about reality (especially about the golddigging family that befriends her). And Henry is an oddity among Austen's heroes, being a clever silver-tongued charmer with a heart of gold who likes to gently tease Catherine.Quick, light and full of teasing humor, \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is an oddity in Jane Austen's string of brilliant novels -- but being a clever, well-plotted spoof doesn't make it any less charming. A delight."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"The heroine in this novel is Catherine Morland, who is just an average girl with straightforward manners and not an ounce of pretension; yet, she has an outrageously vivid imagination. This is cleverly and Austen-intended, I believe, to purposely deviate from the conventional heroines of the times.The story begins with Catherine joining a friend of the family, Mrs. Allen, for a vacation at her home in Bath. Her days are filled with socializing, taking walks and especially spending time at the \`Pump- room', where she meets the rather hard-edged Henry Tilney. Catherine's simple, yet direct and opinionated responses and approaches in conversation lead her to distancing Henry for a while.Realizing that she has feelings for him, Catherine begins to wish she could see Henry again and does everything possible for that to happen. Meanwhile she befriends Isabella Thorpe who shares her passion for books and poetry. As the two become inseparable, Catherine feels close enough to Isabella to tell her all about her feelings for Henry Tilney...In fulfilling her dreams of being with Henry, Catherine's journey evolves through a fiasco of events revealing true personalities, feelings and deceptions. Other important characters that help bring this about involve John Thorpe, Isabella's brother, who is full of mischief and schemes. As well, Catherine's brother James, is one who has a love-story of his own to mourn over as his sister begins to put all pieces of the puzzle together. Just to add to life's intricacies, Henry and Catherine become at odds about a dilemma, caused mainly by Catherine's imagination. The couple's difficulties do not stop there as problems get compounded by family misunderstandings.Confusion of events? You bet. This story is filled with the ups-and downs of young love, anxious situations and very comical moments. Catherine was a girl before her times, which makes situations heartening as well as endearing and perfectly understandable. I gasped, laughed and truly enjoyed this Jane Austen novel. It's the perfect introduction to the author's subsequent masterpieces."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I recently read Jane Austen's Mansfield Park and thought it was a little disappointing and full of annoying characters. Pride & Prejudice will always be my favorite, but I found Northanger Abbey superior to almost all of Jane Austen's novels, except P&P; and Persuasion.In this novel, seventeen year old Catherine Morland is invited to visit Bath with her neighbors, the wealthy Mr and Mrs Allen. Catherine is eager to attend balls and be introduced to society. In Bath Catherine makes friends with Isabella Thorpe, who is very quick to befriend Catherine and can hardly bear to be separated from her new friend. Isabella's brother, John Thorpe, always goes out of his way to befriend Catherine and press the friendship between Catherine and Isabella.Trouble brews when Catherine meets Henry and Eleanor Tilney, the children of a wealthy and distinguished General. Catherine is immediately attracted to Henry and desperately hopes to further their friendship, especially by befriending his sister, Eleanor. There is a glitch in Catherine's plan, her friend, Miss Thorpe tries, to discourage the friendship and with the assistance of her brother, goes out of her way to sabotage the friendship between Catherine and the Tilneys.The name of the novel, Northanger Abbey, refers to the Tilney home, where Catherine is invited to join her new friends. Catherine, who is an avid reader of Gothic novels, is in awe of all the history and possible mysteries lurking in the historic abbey. Catherine's love of Gothic novels, especially The Mysteries of Udolpho by Ann Radcliffe, convince her that something mysterious occured at Northanger Abbey. When Catherine sees the General behave in a strange manner when his deceased wife is mentioned, and when he suddenly appears just as Eleanor is about to show Catherine Mrs Tilney's former bedroom, Catherine convinces herself that something is amiss. Perhaps the General murdered his wife or worse, perhaps she is imprisoned somewhere in the abbey!Northanger Abbey is a parody of the Gothic novel. Catherine is so busy imaging the murder or imprisonment of Mrs Tilney, that she doesn't realize the joke is on her! Some people may not think that Northanger Abbey is Austen's best novel, but I thought it was absolutely charming and amusing. Definitely Jane Austen's best lighthearted novel."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I had not thought of Austen as a satirist prior to reading Northanger Abbey. Within the first chapter the author addresses what the book is not - a gothic romance, thought it is fashioned similarly, and named similarly. Austen points out the heroine's father did not lock up his daughters, there was no lover of unknown origin, (something Emily Bronte uses years later in Wuthering Heights), and the heroine's mother does not warn her of the seduction of barons. Rather, when the teenage heroine, Catherine Morland, leaves for a resort town to stay with neighbors, everything is done \\"with a degree of moderation and composure, which seemed rather consistent with the common feelings of common life...\\" 6. With the contrasts Austen makes to the typical gothic romance she conveys the message that life is not like the popular novel.Austen makes some straight forward comments in Northanger Abbey, without irony. Throughout the book she comments on novels, a rather new and popular form in the late 18th century. The novel, evidently, was looked down on, but was also a guilty pleasure. A person would suggest reading Milton or Pope or Addison, but would condemn books by Anne Radcliffe. Even novelists would do this. But Austen, as narrator, would not. She does, however, illustrate problems for those who read such novels, as the character Catherine experiences. Catherine is disappointed that Northanger Abbey isn't ancient nor dark nor in ruins. She is terribly mistaken in her perception of General Tilney, suspecting he has imprisoned his wife in the Abbey, based on what she had read in novels. I'm not sure if all statements of judgment are ironic or not.The satire is strong only in a few chapters of the book. Otherwise it is something of the standard Austen work, with characters pairing up according to society's expectations, then finding out they are mismatched. Though no one may expect Catherine to be a heroine, she is a very good character, practical, sociable, yet refraining from coquetry, earnest. The book tells of her maturation through the age of courtship."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"When it comes to Kindle publications, a review of the readability of the text really is much more critical than of the work itself.

I haven't written a review of it until now because I hesitated to ascend to such presumption. I, critique the great Miss Austen? Unthinkable! Yet I find I must put in my own glowing praise for this delightful novel.As many other reviewers have said, this is not Austen's most polished or refined work; it is not her greatest in terms of literary merit, scope or influence; it is not even her wittiest novel. But I think it is her cleverest work. The entire novel is a joke, and knows it. The narrator is charmingly self-conscious, as is the book itself. It is a novel that simultaneously parodies and praises novels.I must also mention that the heroine, Catherine Morland, is unique from every other Austen heroine in that her development as a character is solely for personal growth; she doesn't have to change or refine her mind or her character to be worthy of Henry Tilney because she already deserves her hero even before her self-actualization. She does not have to learn to be humble or attentive or how to conduct herself; she only has to learn how to use her own good judgment, and to trust it."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"This is a wonderful spoof of the Gothic novels that were popular at the time.

While a delightful story, it doesn't quite measure up to Austen's other works. Catherine Morland, 17 and completely innocent, is invited to spend a few weeks in Bath with some family friends. Bath, a vacation hotspot in 19th century England, is filled with fashions and eligible young men and women, as well as parents looking to make an agreeable match. Catherine has never left her small village and is accustomed to being surrrounded by people who love her, and so is vulnerable to the tricks and games played by Isabella Thorpe and her brother John. Isabella has formed an attachment to Catherine's older brother James, and John attempts a similar relationship with Catherine. But our dear Catherine has developed feelings for Mr. Tilney. While Mr. Tilney shows the sparkling wit that Mr. Darcy will later become known for, much of the book is told through the narrator's voice which is awkward at times. It wasn't my favorite of Austen's books, that would be Pride and Prejudice, but I enjoyed it thoroughly."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I approached this book somewhat warily, knowing that Northanger Abbey was to some degree a satirical take on the immense popularity of Gothic romances such as Ann Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho, a book I dearly love. Happily, Austen's means of poking fun at Gothic horror literature are far from mean-spirited and, as a matter of fact, can be delightfully humorous indeed. Her heroine, Catherine Morland, is by no means the type of heroine to be found in the giant tomes of Radcliffe and her indulgent imitators, as Austen tells her reading audience directly from the very start. \\"Almost attractive\\" on a good day, this unintellectual tomboy has reached her fifteenth year without inspiring a young man's fancy, nor would she be able to delight him with musical skill or even draw his profile in her secret notebooks if she had. Having encountered no strangers who would prove to be a lord or prince in disguise, her heroic ambitions seem stymied at best until fate steps in and grants her a stay of several weeks in the delightful town of Bath. Making her transition from nave girl to equally nave young lady, Catherine almost immediately falls quite in love with young Henry Tilney, while at the same time she becomes intimate friends with an older young lady named Isabella, whose inconstancy as both friend and intended beloved of Catherine's own brother eventually brings her much pain. To her intense delight, however, Catherine is invited by General Tilney, Henry's father, to spend some few weeks in his home, Northanger Abbey. Her joy at spending such private time in the company of her beloved and new best friend Eleanor Tilney is immense, but equally exciting to her is the chance to spend time in a mysterious former abbey of the sort she has read so much about. Such Gothic romances as Udolpho have been the source of her recent heroic training, and she is wildly desirous and fully expectant of discovering hidden passages, dark secrets, frightening circumstances, and possibly even incalcitrant perfidy in the halls of her beloved's family home. Her overactive imagination runs wild in Northanger Abbey, bringing her a fair share of embarrassment, but the very sweet and tender sensibilities that fuel her fire for Gothic mystery make her all the more endearing to me. Catherine is remarkably innocent, and as such she is absolutely delightful in my eyes.Much of the story does fit in with your typical Gothic novel, but the frightening and dismaying things Catherine eventually discovers are of a far from supernatural sort. Ever so gradually, a true monster slowly coalesces from the pages of this remarkable novel. I, like young Catherine, was somewhat overenthusiastic concerning the Gothic qualities of this adventure I feel I shared with her, and the truly despicable thoughts and actions of the book's villain did not immediately strike me as forcefully as they should have; the afterword by Elizabeth Hardwick included in my Signet Classic copy of the book, however, served to make me fully comprehend its import. Greed, selfishness, pride-these are the horrors of Northanger Abbey, and it does deeply hurt a reader of romantic sensitivity to stand idly by, unable to aid and assist a sweet young lady such as Catherine in her time of despair and emotional suffering.Lovers of Gothic horror or literature in general will surely find nothing but delight in the pages of Northanger Abbey. Austen's critique of Gothic literature is quite subdued, and I actually find immense pleasure in the overindulgence the author sometimes employs in her attempts to satirize it. Written by Austen at a tender age (though not published until the year following her death), Northanger Abbey features incredibly human, complex characters full of wit and charm. The hidden motives of seemingly delightful friends is brought to light, teaching young Catherine as well as the reader a painful lesson in real life, yet romance stands at the ready to right the wrongs of self-interest, deception, and greed. I absolutely adore this novel and everything about it."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I used to love Gothic novels. I collected out-of-print Victoria Holt paperbacks, I had stuffed animals named after characters in Charlotte and Emily Bronte novels, but ever since I've read Northanger Abbey, I can't read a Gothic novel with a straight face. Jane Austen does a marvelous job of sending up convoluted scary novels (and melodrama in general) in this book, and creates her most masculine and fascinating hero, Henry Tilney.Don't think that Catherine Morland, the heroine, is just a naive kid. Her naivete is a necessary component of the novel, as it allows her to see the wider world with fresh eyes, provide a foil to the more worldly characters, and ultimately capture the heart of the hero.And then there's Henry...he teases, he teaches, he forgives Catherine's regrettable fancies, knowing that he had a hand in encouraging them. He's witty, he's charming, he's kind of a slob, and he wears his greatcoats so well!As in all her novels, Jane Austen provides a great host of hilarious supporting characters, in particular John and Isabella Thorpe and Mrs. Allen. I defy anyone not to laugh at John Thorpe's nonsensical and contradictory comments. One wonders how many such &quot;rattles&quot; wearied Miss Austen's attention to provide such a character study.Great writing, great story, great characters...come to Northanger Abbey with a sense of humor and you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"&quot; &quot;I see what you think of me,&quot; said he gravely--&quot;I shall make but a poor figure in your journal tomorrow.&quot;&quot;My journal!&quot;&quot;Yes, I know exactly what you will say: Friday, went to the Lower Rooms; wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings--plain black shoes--appeared to much advantage; but was strangely harassed by a queer, half-witted man, who would make me dance with him, and distressed me by his nonsense.&quot;&quot;Indeed I shall say no such thing.&quot;&quot;Shall I tell you what you ought to say?&quot;&quot;If you please.&quot;&quot;I danced with a very agreeable young man, introduced by Mr. King; had a great deal of conversation with him--seems a most extraordinary genius--hope I may know more of him. That, madam, is what I wish you to say.&quot; &quot;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&quot;Northanger Abbey,&quot; the first, shortest, most satiric, and least read of Jane Austen's completed novels, is a delightful treasure that will make you quite literally laugh out loud (so beware bringing the book to the airport, as I did, lest you suffer strange glances for your smothered sniggers). Following the journey of the coming-of-age Catherine Morland and her misadventures in Bath to the &quot;horrid&quot; Abbey, Jane Austen presents us with perhaps her funniest sociological book, that proves not only that teens will be teens in any age, but that an overactive imagination is not always a blessing, and that love is often the result of being loved. Readers should keep on the lookout for the commentaries on novels, feminine wiles and homecomings from Austen herself - a technique subdued in her other novels. The cast also includes Jane Austen's wittiest hero, Henry Tilney (a.k.a. &quot;Da Man&quot;), as well as a female foil more duplicitous than &quot;Sense and Sensibility's&quot; Lucy Steele. The Signet Classic edition boasts a good introduction by Margaret Drabble, perhaps better read after the text as a commentary. Best viewed as a comedic parody, &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is a pleasure to read, whether you are a long-standing member of the JASNA, or just dipping into the boisterous literature of the Regency.Felicitous reading! Yours, &amp;c.,"},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"More lighthearted and less polished than Austen's other novels, &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is the chronicle of its heroine's adventures in turn-of-the-nineteenth-century British genteel society. Catherine, of marriageable age and reasonably attractive and well bred, goes on holiday to Bath, where she meets the gentlemanly Mr. Tilney and befriends the fickle Isabelle and her callow brother John. Her adventures in Bath and, later, in the home of her new acquaintances comprise the plot of Austen's mocking tale.As usual, Austen is mocking the meeting-and-mating customs of then-contemporary Britain. But she is also mocking the gothic novels of the day: Catherine, influenced by the lowbrow literature she reads, is forever attributing dark motives to her acquaintances and skeletons to their closets. &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is unusual among Austen's works in that it attacks not only the society in which its heroine operates, but the heroine herself. Catherine is easily manipulated and slow to learn from her mistakes, and she bumbles into her eventual happy ending completely by accident, none the wiser for her troubles. And Austen makes clear, at the book's opening, that she does not wish to attack the novelists who write the books from which Catherine derives many of her false ideas: the error is Catherine's misapplication of the stories' lessons.Although it was not published until after its author's death, &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is clearly a first novel. Its tone is different from the main body of Austen's work, and its quality is lower. While a pleasant read, the book is not particularly compelling and would probably be most enjoyable for Austen aficionados seeking a comprehensive study of her work."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"This was the first of Austen's novels to be accepted for publication (although it wasn't actually published for many years after). It's every bit as clever, witty, and multi-layered as her other books, and if you enjoy _Pride and Prejudice_ or _Mansfield Park_ you'll like this one, too. Austen wrote this book as a satire & parody of contemporary gothic novels and romances, and much of the humor in it comes from the heroine (a well-meaning, humble, honest, naive, and slightly silly girl) unwisely applying the conventions of gothic novels to real life. I recommend it especially to fans of Austen's wit, as it contains some of her most sharply-pointed writing.Like a lot of Austen's novels, there's an access problem; she presumes you're a member of 18th-century upper crust british society, and thus understand perfectly her references to carriage types, dress fabrics, etc. -- often, looking up precisely what different period terms refer to -- for example, what a \\"curricle\\" and a \\"gig\\" are -- will help explicate the jokes underlying specific passages. For similar reasons, it's often useful to watch a film or TV version of Austen novels before reading them, to help familiarize yourself with the socio-economic environment.Similarly, it'll help when reading this if you've read a lot of contemporary Gothic fiction. The Kindle makes this easy, fortunately -- it may be worthwhile to grab a Kindle version ofThe Mysteries of Udolphofirst (perhaps alsoThe Monk).Still, though, if you like Austen, this is one of her great novels, and you'll enjoy it regardless of whether or not you're familiar with the background she's drawing on.

It is her lightest work but it is still very good, we all need something light once in a while.Our heroine is Catherine, she is a rather silly young girl who has read too many gothic romances. &quot;The Mysteries of Udolpho&quot; in particular has turned her silly head. She seems to see a gothic mystery everywhere she looks. Catherine soon learns that the world is not all melodrama and eventually matures and marries a very sensible man. What keeps Catherine likable is her capacity to learn from her mistakes. She is certainly the least mature of Austen's heroines but she is never boring.This is a marvelous book to start with if you want to get into Jane Austen, it does not have as many characters or subplots as her other works and it is very breezy.

It's an easy read once you get the hang of the language.I really enjoyed Austen's tongue-in-cheek lambasting of novelists whose heroines never read novels - &quot;Yes, novels; for I will not adopt that ingenerous and impolitic custom so common with novel-writers, of degrading by their contemptuous censure the very performances, to the number of which they are themselves adding-joining with their greatest enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such works, and scarcely ever permitting them to be read by their own heroine, who, if she accidentally take up a novel, is sure to turn over its insipid pages with disgust.&quot; Her derision for the flights of fancy of the Gothic novelists of the day are readily apparent throughout the novel. Catherine imagines herself in romantic, mysterious situations (found in her favorite novel, Udolpho), as when she first thinks of her upcoming visit to the Abbey: &quot;To see and explore either the ramparts and keep of the one, or the cloisters of the other, had been for many weeks a darling wish, though to be more than the visitor of an hour had seemed too nearly impossible for desire.&quot; Yet when she arrives she is disappointed in its modernity and normalcy - something that wouldn't be tolerated in a Gothic tale!If the ends of books are like desserts, then the end of Northanger Abbey could be compared to Jell-O rather than Cherries Jubilee, but the readers should focus on the meat and potatoes instead. All in all, an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"While this was one of the last Jane Austen novels published, it was the first one to be written. I read this book before I was familiar with the conventions of the Gothic novel, but this book is a worthy send up of all of those conventions. Even if you are not especially familiar with the works of Anne Radcliffe or Monk Lewis, this novel is worth your time. The opening three pages which describe why Catherine Morland really isn't the heroine type are as funny as anything you'd read today. Other great passages are when Austen defends the reading of fiction in a passionate aside, and when Catherine becomes convinced that General Tilney is keeping his wife locked up in the dungeon of Northanger Abbey.In this book, we have the beginnings of Jane's devastating wit as she tears apart society. We also have the benefit of some witty one liners, flighty characters and hilarious situations. (Of special note is the fact that it would seem that college men have ALWAYS been drinking and swearing type guys... although Austen discretely blanks out the 'dirty' words so as not to offend her readers.)I used to rush home from work to read this book, and was not disappointed in it at all, from beginning to end. This is the best place to start with Austen (well, you could also read her juvenilia if you want... it is more silly than anything, but entertaining nonetheless), and it's definitely a fun read."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Jane Austen was arguably one of the best writers of her time; however, only she took the bold leap into poking fun at the books of her time. Northanger Abbey brings Catherine, the heroine (on whom, among other things, Austen periodically comments from afar) through the joys and troubles of being an eligible young lady with a probing mind and endearing naivete, acquired from none other than the countless novels she has read. The elegance, and at some points speed, with which Austen plays out and then reconciles her young heroine's difficulties is at the very least extremely amusing. The foolish suspense and embarrassed relief which center around the Abbey are no less entertaining when one considers this book against darker novels where the papers in locked drawers have slightly more bearing. Catherine's friend Isabella, her vain (and in-vain) suitor John, and Mr. and Miss Tilney are brilliant foils for her character's development. Overall, I think this book rates as one of the true gems of the 19th Century."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"This is perhaps the most childish (I mean that in a nice way) of Jane Austen's books. It's good for even teens my age to read and enjoy because it's shorter, with a more obvious side of humor to it than the other novels. (I have never minded reading classics; my friends think I'm weird but...I don't care!) Jane Austen seems to be laughing up her sleeve at her own story and its characters. It's a satire of Mrs. Radcliffe's novels and the stereotype heroes of the age and she often refers to Catherine as \`a heroine' and compares her plights to those of other heroines. It's really very funny and some of the situations Kate finds herself in are highly entertaining.Gone is the restraint and almost painfully polite atmosphere. This is really the only Austen book where you don't feel that suffocating blanket of manners and what's proper all around you. The heroine speaks pretty plainly, and the hero openly teases both her and his sister (and is very cute ^-^). The ending is pretty shocking and totally unexpected. My mom is almost psychic when it comes to guessing plots and their outcomes but even she didn't know what was coming when she read this book.This is also the only Austen book (besides Pride and Prejudice) that got me to laugh out loud. It has a priceless section about how most heroines would never deign to touch a novel; if they picked one up by accident they would be sure to put it back down in disgust. However, Catherine is more than ready to read novels with her friend Isabella; books like The Mysteries of Udolpho, though she wouldn't like to admit it. When the hero-much to her dismay-finds out, he entirely approves. They have the cutest romance, and I really like the nave Catherine as the heroine.The only thing about the book I didn't like was the soppy friendship between Catherine and Isabella. When Catherine is slightly late meeting her friend, Isabella says this sickeningly sweet phrase to her, \\"Where have you been, darling? I have been waiting for you this past hour!\\" (Not an exact quotation, but something along those lines) I much prefer Henry's sister as her friend. There is actually a really god contrast between the beautiful Isabella and the quiet shy sister who turns out to be the better and more deserving friend. And Catherine is such an imaginative heroine, who reminds a bit of Anne of Green Gables with her flights of fancy that end hilariously!I really liked this book and will probably read it again soon along with Emma and Pride and Prejudice. I'd like to see the movie also. Great book, and a great place to start reading Austen's novels. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"So much of the discussion of &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; centers on the Gothic send-ups of the second half of the novel, but the primary focus of this wonderful novel is the absolute skewering of the social mores and behaviors of the era. As Catherine, Isabel Thorpe, and the other girls their age frantically pursue wealth and status in the form of a fair-faced husband, Austen provides us with a splendid portrayal of a society. General Tilney's treatment of Catherine is only the most obvious of Austen's criticism's of the &quot;Bath society,&quot; for several other characters also behave selfishly.Read &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; for several reasons. First, it is an entertaining novel--and that alone should give encouragement to a prospective reader! Second, it is a pointed description of a society based only on class and wealth, in which one's happiness depends upon securing &quot;a fortune.&quot; Finally, it is an accessible introduction to Austen's works and may encourage you to read more.Enjoy journeying with Catherine Morland from her small town home to Bath and thence to Northanger Abbey and home again!"},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Not only does Austen create a gothic environment to haunt the readers and the characters, but she places the character ahead of the overall story. Not the story is bad, but readers tend to read Austen's work for her characters and their heartbreaking fates. This is truely a masterpiece featuring classic decision making from the main protagonist and an incredible and tragic solution that calms the storm of the story."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"First time reading Jane Austen....seen plenty of Jane Austen inspired movies and enjoyed them all but definitely prefer reading the books. Austen did not disappoint...this is a good read and keeps you routing for Catherine while guessing what will happen next."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Come to Bath for the season, 17-year-old Catherine discovers friends who will educate her socially and falls in with the Tilney siblings, who live in an intriguing Gothic abbey. To call Northanger Abbey a Gothic satire (as I was introduced to it) is to overlook over half the book, which concerns itself with the social tableau of Bath and Catherine's evolving role and relationships within; this section draws on predecessors such as Frances Burney, whose work--while not unknown--is not so popular today as Radcliffe's Gothic novels which inspire much else of the book. As such, Northanger Abbey can feel like two books uneasily combined into one; furthermore, it's exceedingly self-aware, which is both its joy and damnation. The book has a shifting focus, its satire is often heavy-handed, it demands self- and genre-awareness from the reader (yet its brevity and tone make it something of a pleasure read), but at its best it distills its genres critically and with great love. Northanger Abbey mocks the expectations of a heroine and the limitation of its own, yet creates an enduring and convincingly adolescent figure in Catherine; its social interactions can be frankly frustrating, but the dialog shines; it revels in the tritest of Gothic clich&eacute;s, then mocks the reader who over-indulges in them, yet embraces the emotional sensitivity that underlies the impulse. To my surprise, this is the most success I've had with Austen. It's too much of a niche taste, and begs too much background knowledge, for me to recommend it outright. But in the end, the best satires require love: love enough to know, and engage, and represent the beloved; to make something of it which is incisive but meaningful. Northanger Abbey has that, and won my love in return."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Catherine Morland succesfully captures the image of a bookish and curious teenager. Although sometimes it was embarassing seeing her faults so amplified...sometimes it was funny.The story is shorter the Austen's other works *happy sigh* and the format of writing it like an adventure with a \\"heroine\\" was entertaining because it was the story of everyday life.So many people have summarized the novel...I just want to add that it was surprisingly relatable considering it was written 200+ yrs ago. An example of this is her parents response to what happens.Her mother's lectures made me chuckle and I was wowed when her mum went to get the essay that would help Catherine deal with her moodiness. Of course it takes a while because of domestic distractions.It was an okay read. I didn't find the story that interesting or the focal charcters that appealing though."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Jane Austen. Some people like her, other people hate her. (At least, that's what I got from the writing.) Northanger Abbey is apparently the most cheerful and lighthearted of her novels, dealing with Catherine Morland, a young naive lady, who goes to Bath, and experiences fashionable society for the first time. She meets many new friends: Isabella, who shows her Gothic romances, and Henry and Eleanor Tilney, who invite her to their father's house, Northanger Abbey. \\"There, influenced by novels of horror and intrigue, Catherine comes to imagine terrible crimes committed by General Tilney, risking the loss of Henry's affection, and has to learn the difference between fiction and reality, false friends and true. With its broad comedy and irrepressible heroine, Northanger Abbey is the most youthful and optimistic of Jane Austen's works.\\" (Penguin Books.) I definitely enjoyed the light tone and writing of Austen, but (as I said early), I can definitely imagine how some people would not like it all. She wrote even before Charles Dickens, and yet her style is much less overwritten, with not many adjectives (Dickens is stuffed with them.) Austen's style is a sort gossipy tone; the young ladies talking among themselves about various happenings. Henry Tilney was a really great character, really likable. I liked the book overall a lot; it was quite a contrast from other literature from around that time, is definitely a readable classic for most people. Northanger Abbey was published posthumously right after her death.You can read all of my reviews at my blog novareviews.blogspot.com."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Having read all of Austen's novels, and letters, and unfinished works (not to mention sequels and mashups), I'd have to say Northanger Abbey is my favorite book, second only to Pride and Prejudice.I've read it twice and will probably re-visit it again at some point.Catherine Morland is a quirky, young, and likable character. Some have said that her personality is closest to the Austen herself. Scholars have pointed out similarities which I won't bore you with.It's the shortest of all the finished six Austen novels and as a Janeite (a lover of Austen), I advise my friends (the ones that ask) should they want to read Austen, they should start with Northanger Abbey.It's quick and satirical and you'll love Catherine Morland and Henry Tilney, young romantics. And since it's short, you'll get acclimate yourself with Jane's voice and by the end will be ready to take on more.i won't got into the story, but basically, Catherine has a great imagination which gets her into a bit of trouble; she has a talkative day friend; but Catherine's goodness is clear and shines through."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Old English novels, especially by Bronte sisters, I find fascinating.

Northanger Abbey is weak in ways I don't expect Austen to be weak, but for the person who seeks to watch her art in progress, this is an excellent example of the author learning her way toward her great masterpieces.You consequently will not be as swept off your feet, but you will learn a great deal about Austen's development as a unique and incomparable author in her time and place.I for one am always watching the way she develops her main female protagonist...giving her a mind in a day and age when women were seldom expected to have a mind, much less put it to any good use!I learned from this book...and for me that made the reading of it well worth it."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"An interesting look at the customs of the day, but not a page-turner.

The book is a satire of the Gothic novel, but I think it is more than that. It's the story how the words one person says may be reflected onto someone else and how they can be interpreted to either enrich or ruin another's life. The way that John Thorpe, in order to make himself look better, &quot;enriched&quot; Catherine's story; the diverging opinions of James &amp; Isabella; the general falseness of Isabella &amp; John; and how the simplest statement can be misconstrued &amp; almost ruin a friendship.Catherine, by living in her novels (aided by Henry, of course), sees things that aren't really there when she visits Northanger Abbey. She makes mountains out of mole-hills. Thankfully, Henry acknowledges the role he had in creating these fantasies and is able to help her laugh it off.This is a great Austen novel, and although you can tell that it was her first, I think it ranks right up there with the others."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"If you've read Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, or any of the Victorian gothic novels and thought that the authors overdid it a bit, you'll love this.

The heroine not only had a pitifully inconsequential childhood, but couldn't seem to find any dark secrets or mystical adventures."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Very funny in typical Austin fashion. A must read for any Jane Austin fan. It is a bit difficult to follow the characters and the relationships at first; Once you get to know who the characters are it is easy to appreciate them and their interactions. Austin's version of the Gothic novel.The Longman edition is very helpful in setting the context for the work. Being relatively new to Austin it was valuable for me to understand the historical setting and read the examples of contemporary authors that this edition provides. I highly recommend this edition for anyone who is not already familiar with the life and times of this period."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"In the first chapter of &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;, Jane Austen introduces Catherine Morland and pretends to apologize for having such an unromantic heroine. In the next few chapters, Catherine appears to live up to her creator's apology, while the author appears to forget all about telling us about the abbey for which her novel is named.The presence of the two shockingly audacious and impudent Thorpes--John and Isabella--almost makes up for this. Never did I want to slap and/or kick two fictional characters more. The ways in which they try to foil Catherine's hope of romance with Henry Tilney--and arrange a marriage between the artful Isabella and Catherine's innocent, unsuspecting brother--are enough to make readers gnash their teeth. Ironically, the scenes with the charming Henry and his kind sister Eleanor ramble along in comparison to the explosive scenes &quot;graced&quot; by the outrageous Thorpes.I liked the last twelve chapters better. Actually set in Northanger Abbey, they are a hilarious satire of the nineteenth century Gothic novel. Catherine stumbles into misadventure after misadventure (if I may be so generous as to call them such), thanks to her wild imagination and voracious novel-reading. It is wonderful to be caught in the excitement of a (pseudo) Gothic mystery that readers know is not real, but that they understand _could_ be real. It's the excitement of telling ghost stories around a campfire then trying to get to sleep. Everyone believes that anything could happen, though anything rarely does. It's nice, safe, thrilling fun.In my opinion, Jane Austen was having so much fun herself, in writing these scenes, that she did not sufficiently develop the romance between Catherine and Henry. They have few scenes together and Henry's character is too agreeable to be as interesting as John Thorpe's--or even General Tilney's. (Jane Austen should have apologized for him instead of for Catherine. Henry Tilney is more a Mr. Bingley than a Mr. Darcy.)Despite this, &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; has the expected happy romantic ending--with the author still giving cheeky asides to the reader. I'd still recommend this book . . . but only after &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, of course."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I was not too happy with this seller.

Is it a popular piece of literature or one that is lucky enough to stand the test of time? Maybe it is one written by a famous author and all his or her works become classics. I wonder these questions as I finish reading Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey.It has been many years since I've read any of Ms. Austen's work. I never read Northanger Abbey until I joined a book club that was reading it. I was thrilled. I'm to a point in my life where I'm revisiting all the books I hated in school or managed to avoid. I'm discovering that I'm enjoying most of them.Northanger Abbey proved to a hard read for me. I couldn't understand why until I really thought about it. I was so used to contemporary writing that reading a piece of English literature from more than a hundred years ago proved difficult for me. The plot seemed to drag and become nonexistent. I was truly disappointed. The story could have written in a quarter of the pages and delivered with a bigger punch.I know that all the Austen fans will be calling for my head. Truly, I tried. I don't think less of Ms. Austen. In fact, have another book of hers lined up to read. It was this one in particular that did not trip my trigger.If you want to read more of the classics and are just getting started, you might want to put this novel off and read some of the others. You might love it. You might hate it. I would put this in the category of a back-burner classic to read.This was a public domain book and came with quite a few formatting and editing issues. It did not detract too much from the reading. For free, I couldn't complain about the issues.Note: I purchased this book with my own funds."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Ah, Northanger Abbey, without a doubt my least favorite Jane Austen novel. For the longest time I thought Sense and Sensibility was the worst, until I reread them all last year and wondered just what the hell I was thinking all those years.Don't get me wrong, I think NA is really funny and I absolutely adore Henry Tilney (one of my top 3 Austen heroes!) but compared to her others, this novel is weak. It was her first novel sold to a publisher, in 1803, under the title Susan. For some reason, the publisher sat on it for years until her brother bought it back. I don't think it was revised at all before she died- it was published posthumously with Persuasion. It's very different in tone from all her other novels. It still shows glimpses of her wit and the dramatic ironies and everything, but it's closer to a spoof of the popular Gothic novels of the day than anything else. The romance is pretty lacking (again, spoofing the Gothic novels)- Henry only falls for Catherine because he realized she loved him!I don't want anyone to think I don't like this book- I do! It has comedy in spades. It just lacks the depth of all her other works."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I was promised vampires.

BORING!!!!! This book is extremely overrated. The novel is also hard to follow at times since Jane Austen jumps from one time frame to another time a lot longer down the road in only one sentence. If your teacher or professor makes you read this book, then good luck. I would pass on this book if you are looking for an intellectual stimulation or just plain old good story."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Austen's supposed satire of the gothic novel is tangled up with what would have been the finest fluff of effeminate fiction -- had anyone else written it. Austen, however, cannot resist sinking her sharp little claws into naivete, romance, and (of course, this IS Jane Austen) men. I will say, it is the only book of hers that I have ever been able to finish.No one would want to be quite as stupid as poor Catherine, but we've all been naive. Personally, I envy Catherine the ability to be so pure and trusting with the object of her affection -- as jaded and overeducated a modern woman as I am, I find myself reading the story with no feeling so strong as a wish that (after closely and cynically examining him) I could meet a man with whom I felt free to admire his perfections and flaws as the finest in the world! (I'm sure there's one out there.) I'm sure Miss Austen would find this proof that I am as contemptibly stupid as Catherine, but when we kill our inner innocent completely, then we have made life unworth living, and I pity all the people with whom we live and work.The book would be much better if it didn't dawdle with condemning feminine sweetness &amp; innocence &amp; male behavior's apparently universal (to Austen) unacceptability, particularly in tarring them all with the same brush. It would be far better if bereft of the perfunctorily &quot;happy ending&quot; which is treated in such a way that love and marriage wind up reeking of as much of Austen's contempt to at least the same degree as Mrs. Radcliffe's literary crimes.If you want to see this story the way it should be, the way it's funny, check out the movie (an episode of Masterpiece Theater). If you want to slurp latte in a windowless cafe and paint your nails black, buy the whole Jane Austen collection!"},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"'Northanger Abbey' is Austen's first novel to be written, though it was published after others. The protagonist Catherine comes of age in her first thorough exposure to the society of adults. This involves going to balls, falling in love, meeting a couple undesirable people, and forever discarding some childish beliefs and fancies.When I pick up a classic I tend to expect and anticipate heavier reading than in a modern novel. 'Northanger' didn't have that depth I was looking for; it was more of a romantic drama, a genre that usually doesn't do it for me (with certain notable exceptions such as the superb 'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' by Anne Bronte). Yet it surprised me with its wit and characterization.Austen renders, with great skill, several characters possessing a variety of personalities. Dialogue here is a delight to read and animates Austen's cast. You'll find at least one you can relate to; for me it was Catherine's brother James and also Eleanor Tilney. Though what seems a bit off to me is how the younger ones (especially Henry & Eleanor Tilney) tend to act more mature than the older folks! I can't recall a single grownup over 40 in the book who I would have serve as a role model to me. Perhaps Catherine's mother, but she barely plays a part in the novel. Henry Tilney is clearly cast in this role and he seems far more mature than the average 26 year old.I've read a couple of Austen's later works (Pride & Prejudice, Persuasion) and I tend to agree with other reviewers that 'Northanger' doesn't have the depth and subtlety that Austen develops later in her career. Sure I recommend it once you've exhausted the stable of superb British classics out there from the 19th century. I just started Thomas Hardy's 'Tess of D'Urberville' and I have to admit the contrast from 'Northanger' was a bit of a shock. Hardy's writing is on another (higher) level entirely."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"This early Jane Austen novel is a satire among other things of the reading tastes of the Romantic Period's young, sending up their near addiction to improbable Gothic \\"horror\\" stories. Despite being grounded in such literary particulars, the novel remains an awfully good read. Contemporary college students in my experience think overwhelmingly that Austen is not just writing about Mrs. Radcliffe et al, but has much to tell them about life and taking one another seriously rather than playing at \\"relationships.\\" Detailing the entrance of her naive, countryside heroine (Catherine) into the splendors and miseries of adulthood, Austen is here fully brimming over with her unmistakable satiric wit, charm, and astonishing worldly wisdom. Catherine, for instance, from the outset has already confounded life and art, so she is disappointed, to our delight, that on her first journey to Bath and grown-up experience, there's \\"not one lucky overturn of the carriage to introduce her to the hero.\\" Austen's women -whether naive (Catherine) or vain and coquettish ( fashion-hungry Mrs. Allen and men-with-money-hungry Isabella Thorpe)- are all well drawn, and equally so are her men, especially the boorish John Thorpe, an early example of the \\"it's all about me\\" guy, and the triumphantly witty, hard-headed, yet kind Henry Tilney. Astonishingly, Austen concluded very early as a novelist that it's only the few genuine individuals in life who follow a civilized code of manners, whereas most other people are in fact mere conformists devoted to the fashionable ways of the world, pursuing vulgar self-interest or greed, while thinking themselves smart for doing so.A few years back, adaptations of Austen for the screen were all the rage. \\"Northanger Abbey\\" had earlier been the subject of an inferior TV adaptation, set in the proper time period but too heavy on the Gothic \\"horror\\" element and largely witless. So far as I know it has never been made into a film. Given the continuing fondness of the young for horror novels (Stephen King's, say) and now scary movies, I'd argue \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a natural for an updated version (like \\"Clueless\\" was of \\"Emma\\") set perhaps among the young who leave home for the first time to attend college. They too might initially expect life to resemble to some degree what they've encountered in their romances, \\"horror\\" novels and slasher films, only to be wittily disabused, but then to discover in fact the real ways life always and everywhere is actually \\"horrid,\\" that is, owing to the timeless prevalence of vanity, self-absorption, and greed."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"In NORTHANGER ABBEY, Jane Austen satirizes what for her and her late 18th century readers was the Gothic novel. Even before Ann Radcliffe published the enormously popular MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO in 1794, the novel of sentiment was all the rage. In such stories the heroine was likely to cry, swoon, and moan at the drop of a hat. Radcliffe in her book added the other Gothic ingredients of fear, ghosts, haunted houses, and other paranormal phenomena. Austen looked down on writers who had their heroines engage in such unseemly behavior even though she was later to treat seriously the same trait of sensibility in SENSE AND SENSIBILITY.The heroine of NORTHANGER ABBEY is Catherine Morland, who seems unlike what will later prove to be a typical Austen protagonist. Catherine at the start of the book is much more closely allied to the \\"sense\\" half of the push-pull sense and sensibility dichotomy of all her works. She is the daughter of a prosperous clergyman who travels to a resort named Bath, where she meets and falls in love with Henry Tilney. There are the usual romantic plot complications of an Austen novel which normally allow the heroine to be attracted by her male counterpart and encounter suitable obstacles, all of which are neatly resolved after both parties undergo some serious soul searching which in turn leads to a higher level of moral vision. In this case, Austen has great fun with Catherine by first showing her as full of sense, then later shifting gears by morphing her into a standard \\"sensible\\" female of the Gothic genre, finally whirling Catherine back to a position of reason and logic. It takes half of the book before Austen gets to the Gothic satire for which it is well-known. When Catherine arrives at Northanger Abbey, she inexplicably is affected by the conventional Gothic trappings of the place. Where the earlier Catherine would see an occurrence that might have seemed spooky to other more stereotyped Gothic heroines but not so to her, the newer Catherine now could see that same eerie event and be filled with unfounded terror. It is only now that Austen makes clear the target of her barbed satire. She was plainly disgusted with other writers who purposefully filled the empty heads of their heroines with Gothic terror, but when she did the same, it was excusable since satire, not stereotype, was her aim. Later, Catherine's grasp of sense returns as she is able to exonerate in her own mind General Tilney from the suspected charge of the murder of his wife. By the end of the novel, the reader has been introduced to the theme of sense versus sensibility or unstructured emotion versus stifling reason. In Catherine Morland, and later for nearly of all of Austen's female protagonists, Austen suggests that in having to choose between the two extremes, one might seek a middle ground so that each one can complement, rather than supplement the other. There are simply too many examples of extremes who end badly in Austen's works for one to ignore her implied advice."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"This first book of Jane Austen's doesn't have the same subtlety as her later works, but it is light-hearted and good writing. It's amazing how skillful she was at writing dialogue, even at a younger age. I mention her youth because it pervades Northanger Abbey; the characters are youthful in spirit, and I think that of all her novels, this one might be the most accessible to the modern day younger reader. It was certainly one of my favorites as a teenager (though the pleasure of rereading it hasn't diminished as I've aged). The simple and natural emotions of the main character, Catherine Morland, would seem more real to many of today's teenagers than the repressed spirits seen in so many novels of this period. Catherine is perhaps the least 'civilised' of Austen's leads, in that she does little to conform her behavior to the decorous standard of the day, but she has an exuberance and sweetness that breathe life into every scene, and I think this carries the book. Northanger Abbey is a delightful read for all ages and Austen fans, even the most serious."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"If you have not read Jane Austen before, don't start with this book! (Start with perhaps Pride and Prejudice or Emma.)Northanger Abbey was her earliest written novel, but it did not get published until after she died. This book is meant to be a parody. She is making fun of some of other gothic books that were in circulation at that time. The main character gets a little too obsessed with gothic novel reading, and imagines a sinister plot in the abbey becasue her imagination is out of control.This book is much more juvenille than Austen's other books. I felt like I was reading something for teenagers. (Austen's other books have more depth and maturity to them.)However, it was an enjoyable, easy read... and as an Austen fan, I wanted to read Austen's earliest work."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"This early Austen novel about a society girl's coming of age reads easily with its considerable dialogue, despite the presence of extensive historical vocabulary. Definitely of greater interest to girls than boys NORTHANGER ABBEY introduces readers to 17-year old Catherine Morland, a nave but morally-honest well-bred young lady. Invited to the fashionable watering hole of Bath by the Allens--kind neighbors serving as hosts and chaperones, Catherine is delighted at this opportunity to seek Adventure away from her calm country home.Volume I presents Bath in high season where Catherine is formally introduced to and socializes with two families: the Thorpes and the Tilneys, who reveal stark social contrasts among the upper class. Mr. John Thorpe, a friend of her brother's, quickly attaches himself to Catherine, but his vanity, arrogance and deceit soon displease and eventually disgust her. His sister, Isabella, however, proves a dear and immediate friend,at least during most of Catherine's sojourn in Bath. Soon after she meets the distinguished Tilney family: a stern General, a son who is a Captain, a sweet and modest sister, Eleanor, and the cadet son, Henry. Vol. I concludes with Catherine receiving permission from her parents and the Allens to spend several weeks at the Tilney homestead, a former Abbey.Eager to explore a real edifice which might have been the setting for a Gothic novel, Catherine is thrilled at this extended invitation. By this time she is very fond of Henry and hopes privately that romance will bloom in the quiet, dignified setting. Unfortunately she expects the worst horrors as a result of her dedicated reading of Mrs. Radcliffe's novels, forwhere no mystery exits, Catherine is determined to discover one. Volume Two describes her gracious reception at Northanger, but she soon feels certain to have stumbled upon a secret family shame or even horror. Her imagination may be running away with her, but the General's odd behavior seems to confirm her growing suspicious of dark deeds surrounding the death of the late Mrs. Tileny.Suddenly, without any explanation, the domineering General orders Catherine thrown out of his home-defying all the rules of hospitality and decency. Henry is not present to protest, so Catherine is dispatched alone--in ignominy and secret tears--back to her unsuspecting family 70 miles away. This tale chronicles the most turbulent year in Catherine's young life, but how much is to be blamed on her excessive devotion to Gothic novels? Or is there a truly sinister plot undermining the hopes of the young lovers? JA uses her characters as mouthpieces to express her decided opinions on the role of fiction, literature and history. This is Austen-lite, with hints of her future work, where her heroines prove better judges of their acquaintances ans their own hearts."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I've always appreciated the wit of Jane Austen. Understated and sly, she manages to portray the inner wit and wisdom of early 18th century upper-class English women quite well. The choice is never to marry or not. The choice is always whom to marry and why.Unlike her other works, Northanger Abbey is a satire on the gothic \\"horror\\" novel so prevalent at the time. Full of suspenseful build-ups and hysterical interruptions, the story revolves around Catherine Morland, as unlikely a heroine as ever graced the pages. Amid the story, Ms. Austen interrupts with witty attacks on Mrs. Radcliffe and other gothic novelists.As always, Austen's humor is stylish and full of truths. She was perhaps a much happier forerunner to Dorothy Parker, in that she cut right through the sheen and told it like it was, as she knew it.I'd recommend Northanger Abbey to anyone who enjoys Austen's writings, gothic novels, or sly humor."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"When I was a kid, I loved to watch Wishbone, the terrier that used Classic Literature as a kind to life. One episode centered around Northanger Abbey. It was my favorite episode. I would play with my friends, that I was Wishbone, and my friend was the heroine, Catherine. That left me with a longing for the real thing. Well, the real thing is much better than the Wishbone version. Some may be surprised, but this is my favorite Jane Austen novel. Emma is second, and the P and P.

Read it!"},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"There isn't much to complain about with Northanger Abbey--it is pleasant enough, but hardly the caliber of P&P;, S&S;, Emma or Persuasion. The style is promising but stilted, and characters and plots aren't really finely tuned. Catherine Morland is promising enough but the young girl who is prudent and sensible seems to lose all sense of balance when she enters an abbey, imagining the most ridiculous and silly gothic nonsense. A bit of fluff and silliness--if Austen wanted to send up the gothic novel she manages to do so for only half dozen chapters and not to any real purpose.There is the familiar secondary love story with a character who proves unworthy but harmless as our heroine caroms toward her inevitable 'happily ever after'. Like a bolt from the blue Eleanor, sister of Henry, Catherine's beau, suddenly is affianced and raised to the nobility. In 2 paragraphs. Talk about wrapping up loose ends too quickly! Sadly missing too are those ridiculous minor characters--Mrs. Bennett, Lady Catherine deBourgh, etc. It's not bad, but if it were written by anybody other than Austen I wonder how many of us would bother? Very few I think.Anyone other than Austen would have gotten two stars. Even genius has to be allowed a learning curve."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Though I have read most of Austen's novels some of them numerous times, I have been saving this one for just the right time when I felt like I could appreciate it the most. I finally decided I needed a good Austen fix and was ready to enjoy it. I knew that it is considered by most critics to be Jane Austen's most satirical novel so I was very excited to dive into this book and see for myself. I was not disappointed, I loved our heroine Catherine Morland, I thought she had just the right amount of girlish charm mixed in with some moments of good sense. I found myself routing for her throughout the book. I also have to say that Henry Tilney found his way right into my heart from almost the first meeting, especially when he exclaims, \\"The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel, must be intolerably stupid\\", a opinion I agree with entirely."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Begun in 1798 and finished in 1803, Northanger was one if the first novels Austen completed, as well as her first sale, though it did not appear in print until after her death. She had already written Lady Susan and had started both Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice, however.The novel follows 17-year-old Ann Radcliffe enthusiast Catherine Morland on a visit to Bath. Under the guardianship of complacent childless family friends, Catherine visits the pump room and attends public balls, making new acquaintances. She quickly meets and befriends the lovely but manipulative Isabella Thorpe, and it emerges that the two girls older brothers know each other at Oxford. When the young men pay a visit to Bath a dual brother-sister match seems eminent, or at last intended. Catherine, however, dislikes Mr Thorpe and remains blissfully unaware of his blundering attempts at courtship. She's much too interested in Mr. Henry Tilney, a clever and handsome young clergyman. Just Catherine's visit draws to close, she is invited by Henry's sister to visit the Tilney family at their home, (you guessed it) Northanger Abbey.Northanger is perhaps the least sympathetic of all Jane Austen's satires. Though all have their comedies, ironies and follies, Sense and Sensibility, Emma, Mansfield Park, and Persuasion, also have the benefit of compelling heroine and at least one honest romance.Catherine, on the other hand, is, in many ways, a foil--a nice girl, honest and not too bright, but with a healthy imagination where melodrama is concerned. She is Harriet Smith, with a better family and a stronger character. Her romance with Henry Tilney also lacks the weight of the relationships in Austen's other novels--it's funny and frequently charming, but, like Catherine herself, not too deep.The real pleasure of the book comes from Austen's language, her frequent tangential diatribes on the nature and import of novels, and her many hilarious digs at Ann Radcliffe--who as far as Austen is concerned, seems to have been the Stephenie Meyer of her day (only pro-woman, a better writer, and a different kind of crazy)."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Before you read this free version of Northager Abbey I'd recommend watchingMasterpiece Theatre: Northanger Abbey. I can almost guarantee you will prefer the story that plays out in the movie. Still it is intriguing to compare the movie to the book. In the movie John Thorpe is much more likeable although annoying at times. In the book he is much more rude and coarse. I instantly disliked him for being rude to his mother and for treating his horse badly. What surprised me is how little we learn about Henry. He is fairly uninteresting and not very romantic. To compare him to say Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice would never do. Isabella is much more shrill in the book and is much more naughty in the movie. Catherine Morland is really the most developed character in the book although Jane Austen doesn't do a good job of explaining why she is so attracted to Henry. What amused me most was how Jane Austen talked directly to the reader about the value of novels. It was as if she was preaching to the choir.

As the fourth of ten children, she is overjoyed when a childless couple invite her to accompany them for a six-week stay at a wpa. There she makes several friends in succession, in a way such hat she comes to realize that real life doesn't copy Gothic romances quite as much as she thought. When she is invited for a three-week, then indefinite, stay at the Tilney household of Northanger Abbey, her reading causes her to leap to unwarranted conclusions from which she is yanked by the uncompromising sensibility of Henry Tilney.As she proceeds toward mental normality, away from the constant influence of the novels, she is totally startled when the General, Henry's father, who had appeared to be highly in favor of a marriage between Catherine and Henry, orders her sent home instantly with his strong disapproval. He is not even gutsy enough to tell her himself, but sends her friend, his daughter Eleanor, to tell her. It is due only to Eleanor's prudence that Catherine even has the money with which to get home by stagecoach.Still stunned, she is pulled out of the depths of depression by a visit from Henry, who tells her why his father had behaved so badly and assures her that he still wants to marry her. Her parents agree to the marriage only on condition that the general also agree.Up until now, the novel has worked very well. But what should be probably a quarter of the book is jammed into a couple of chapters of hasty telling, with no showing at all. One has the feeling that the author was tired of the book. Considering that it was her first novel and that she wrote it out in longhand, I suspect that was the case. All the authors I know, including my husband and I, are tired of the book by that point. But with a computer, it is a lot easier to go on and finish the book correctly than it was in the days of quill pens and inkwells--especially since Austen had no room of her own and had to keep her manuscript in what we would now call the living room, simply covering it when visitors arrived.This is a highly uneven book. That has led to a problem with deconstructionists finding in it all kinds of things that, for the most part, are present in neither the text nor the subtext nor even the author's context. Such fiddling around is not necessary. The faults in the text are quite obvious and do not need to be sought after with Satan's magnifying glass."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"So I thought that Pride and Prejudice was my favorite Jane Austen book. I was incredibly mistaken after reading Northanger Abbey. The story is told by Jane Austen herself.It is as if she was in the room with you reading it out loud. It is the only one of its kind. It really was a shock to know that this book was published so long after it was written and was one of the first novels she completed. As I found, this book was hardly re drafted, not like the other stories I believe. It is the closest we could ever get to Austen herself, the first instinctive writings we could ever read. Raw and powerful. When it was first published long ago it was some years later when it was written, Austen being the clever lady that she was made the story timeless,, so to speak as timeless goes .. that a women like me in the year 2010 could find enjoyment and humor in a book published so long ago. Now that speaks volumes..."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Jane Austen's first completed novel is lighter and more humorous in tone than her subsequent work. It is however, as beautifully written as that later work - there was, as always with Austen, a lot of rewriting before publication, which in this case was posthumous - and it is in no sense an inferior effort.All her novels have a sly, subversive wit, but Northanger Abbey is the one in which she employs her humor more or less throughout, although darker elements emerge as the story develops.It is basically a satire on the Gothic novel, a genre still familiar to us through movies, and makes particular reference to The Mysteries of Udolpho. You don't need to have read that to appreciate the humor; you just need to have some idea of what a Gothic story is, with its gloomy castles, secret chambers and dastardly deeds. In fact, in the episodes that take place in the abbey, the author shows herself very capable of building mystery and tension. She could have written a splendid Gothic horror.Austen's extraordinary insight into human nature is already evident here. In chapter 5 of this book - which has more author intervention than any of her others - she presents a defense or justification of the novel as a literary form, in which she says, \\"...the most thorough knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties...are conveyed to the world in the best-chosen language\\". That is certainly true of Austen's own novels.The Signet Classics edition has an introduction by Margaret Drabble which is more an excuse for Drabble to express some of her own prejudices. You certainly shouldn't read it before the novel, because it contains spoilers. The Afterword by Stephanie Laurens is much better and is worth reading. There are no end notes or footnotes to explain the many references and archaisms in the novel. I suspect there are other editions with better editorial content.[PeterReeve]"},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I am a Jane Austin fan so I am reading all her books this year I was surprised at how different Northanger is.

Her mother was an ordinary woman who sometimes had too much to do, while her father was a clergyman. Just for the season, Catherine was invited by Mr. and Mrs. Allen to come with them to a town called Bath. At first, Mrs. Allen and Catherine are disappointed by the lack of acquaintances, even though they walk the town all day and go to the upper room and the lower rooms. Mrs. Allen had a sense for fashion and always had a beautiful dress on. Soon enough Catherine was introduced to Henry Tilney. However, as she started to develop a crush on him and looked forward to their meetings, he did not come around for a while. By a sudden twist of fate, she meets the Thorpe's. A family whom her brother knows because he had befriended their son and stayed with them for a summer .She quickly became friends with the eldest daughter, Isabella Thorpe. She had a grace and way about her that Catherine admired very much. She is the one who encourages Catherine's interest in romantic fantasies and gothic reading. Isabella also starts a love triangle between herself and James Morland, Catherine, John and Henry. For the first half it is nothing but parties and friendship. It is not until the second half of the book that Catherine is invited to the Tilney's house in Northanger Abbey, where she gets caught up in her own imagination and believes that in that house there has been a murder and the murderer still lives there. Just like in the gothic novels she had been reading. Unfortunately, she was kicked out by General Tilney himself later on.In the end, the book was about a girl who was nave, awkward and shy yet she had kindness in her heart and sometimes got lost in her own world sometimes seeing things that were not true. With all the books she read and believed in, her imagination would tend to catch up to her.Overall, this book was a three star because even though the story was a little plane at the beginning, it improved later on. It was a good read if you are into a corky story or like the old books written in the late eighteen hundreds or beginning nineteen hundreds. I would not however, recommend it to anyone seeking adventure.By: Christina Menendez"},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Northanger Abbey was a good novel to read. It's not too long or short. It is very funny. Catherine, the main character, in the first is described fabulously as what you could call in these days as a ruff and tumble girl. However, Northanger Abbey's ending is disapointing. Nothing really is solved (opposite to other Austen novels)Catherine's marriage just brings in more upcoming problems. So the ending is like a cliff hanger. Some of it is rather spooky like when they actaully get to Northanger Abbey. But, if you expect this to be a horror novel; it is definetely not. Some parts maybe might be called scary, but its not a scary book as a whole. It may be a bit creepy in some parts but mostly not. Moreover, I liked this book."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Many of the references Austen made in Northanger Abbey were meant to be satirical towards the gothic writing style prevalent in her time. Certain elements of wordplay in her characters' dialogue will also sound dated to a modern reader. For example, Catherine describes a popular gothic novel as being &quot;Horrible&quot;, which can be taken as &quot;Awful&quot; or that the book was scary, which is a way the word was used in the author's time.Having said this, the book is slow, and is not as easy and interesting to read as her other novels, which can be explained by saying that this is her first attempt, and improvement was inevitable. The characters were not well-developed; I didn't understand the love-interest and I didn't believe that these two people were suited for each other. Again, she improved later.If you choose to read this book, try to get an edition with notes on the text.It will help a great deal in clarifying that which is now a centuries-old inside joke."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Got the same book from Feedbooks for the same price, free.

The first half is typical Austin fare, a heroin at Bath questing for a dear friend and a dearer husband. The cast of characters is complete; a nutty, vacant aunt, a dear best friend, a handsome but intolerable man...Then, it evolves into a biting pastiche of Gothic romance. It appears a little bit like she got bored with the novel halfway through, and decided to write something more interesting. The setting changes from society-haunted, frivolous Bath to the dark, shadow-haunted stone walls of Northanger Abbey.While not as charming as Austin's other books, &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is enjoyable for all it quirks. The dialog has that spark of wit necessary for enjoyment, and the writing, while not fully evolved, still evokes the same satisfaction that one gets from later Austin books.By no means should this be your first Jane Austin novel, but neither should it remain unread."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I now want to explain myself: Jane Austen is the world's greatest author and everything she writes is wonderful.

Catherine Moreland, the heroine of this delightful novel is a seventeen year old who has the marvelous good luck of accompanying a wealthy couple to Bath.

If you want a great classic, go elsewhere."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I bought them (Northanger Abbey, Persuasion, Mansfield Park and Emma) to complete my Jane Austen's collection, and honestly, didn't like the paper quality, it seems like they didn't even care for the presentation of them; it didn't look elegant, cheap to be more specific."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"eBook downloaded from Gutenberg. Catherine Morland's visit to Bath is enlivened by friendship with the shallow Thorpes and the fascinating Tilneys. Invited to accompany Miss Tilney to their ancient home, Northanger Abbey, Catherine expects to wander crumbling, mysterious halls but finds a modern, comfortable residence. The dictatorial General is the fly in the ointment, oppressing Catherine as well as both of his children.This is an early Austen and it shows. Austen's oddly cynical attitude permeates this unusual tale, frequently contrasting what is actually happening with what would usually happen in a novel. The story is disjointed and wraps up in a hurry, as if she had run out of paper suddenly. But the portrayals of both innocent and calculating characters are dead-on, as only Austen can manage."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"This is more a review of the free Kindle version of this book than of the book itself. It's Jane, so it's a good book. It's one from her earlier years when she was still using a much more exagerrated view of society, so it can be a bit silly, but I still enjoyed it. I read it years ago and had forgotten most of it.The formatting for this Kindle version was just great. It's not in Courier, probably Georgia or another similar font. Quite readable and I had no problems at all with it.Kudos to Amazon for making these free versions of the classics available to all.

To modern eyes the characters appear very tightly constrained in their actions, words, and even in their thoughts. Life in Bath was an artifice of social conduct designed to showcase breeding through demonstrations of social grace. Relatively minor infractions of these graces could, and did, bring disgrace and dishonor. Jane Austin portrays the resulting social tension with sensitivity and accuracy. The reader who fails to appreciate these delicate risks and the resulting precariousness of social status will also fail to follow the character development of the principal protagonists, and will find the novel dull. A disjoined second part of the novel is set in the country, in a great and ancient manor house. Our heroine is considerably awed by it, and never becomes comfortable as a house guest, despite the attentions of her love interest, Henry Tilney and his family. Indeed, her imagination is so active, that this dark segment of the book reads like an Edgar Allen Poe story. It is a side of Jane Austin which is not present in any other of her novels. Present, as always in Jane Austin, are the wonderful descriptions of carriages, horses, liverymen, and everything relating to horse-drawn transportation. Here the young Jane Austin shows the fascination with carriages which became a trademark of her writing. The ending, too, with its taunting unpredictability is a familiar feature for Austin readers, and which carries the tension straight through to the end. Alone, this novel would not have assured Austin her legacy. To me this novel appears to be a study for a subsequent Austin novel, Mansfield Park, which has a very similar basic plot, and where her thematic dimensionality and wordsmithing is perfected."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"In this novel Jane Austen lampoons the gothic romance -- the type of story in which weird things occur with accepted regularity, and nobody has anything but the most intense of emotions.Catherine, the heroine, longs to fall madly in love, so she does so. She visits the house of a friend, coincidentally the sister of her beloved. Northanger Abbey, with its medieval architecture and labyrinthine corridors, inspires Catherine to envision ghostly presences, long-hidden secrets, and hideous crimes kept locked behind closed doors.Of course, Catherine learns that reality is quite different from her grim imaginings. There are no mysteries inside the walls of Northanger Abbey. At the same time as she learns the truth about the abbey, Catherine discovers some realities of love. One is the realization that &quot;true love&quot; is less enigmatic than she had previously believed -- it springs from friendship and the belief that one will be loved in return.A readable, funny, and wise tale from the always practical, delightful Austen."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"This is by far my favorite book of Jane Austen's. I love the relationship of Catherine and Henry, I love how she is so pure and innocent. How she is able to enjoy life from such an angle. I love Henry's character and the conversation style between him and Catherine. if only all relationships were like this today. Fantastic!!!"},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Jane Austen takes a good-natured poke at her contemporary authors-of-a-certain genre, and the people (young, impressionable ladies) who read them, in this little late-19th-century gem. I enjoyed the indirect way she draws the characters of the devious Isabella and her money-hungry family. From a historian's viewpoint, the descriptions of vacationers in Bath and of the Abbey are fascinating."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Living a sheltered and quiet life in the small, peaceful village of Fullerton, Catherine Morland, at the ripe young age of seventeen, is in want of an adventure. Since she is fond of horrid Gothic novels, the ideal adventure for Catherine would be one with sinister characters, secret mysteries, and many Gothic horrors! Catherine does receive an adventure of sorts when the she is invited to travel to Bath with her wealthy neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Allen. Leaving her confined and quiet world behind, Catherine embarks upon a trip that will introduce her to many new acquaintances, test her understanding of human nature, and teach her that the real world is nothing like the fantasy world of novels...Out of all of Jane Austen's novels I find Northanger Abbey to be one of her wittiest. Between her poking fun at Gothic novels and her biting social criticism, I experienced many laugh out loud moments! Moreover, in reading this novel a second time, I gained new appreciation for Jane Austen's unabashed sarcasm and sharp tone which pour out from every page of this novel.In writing her first serious novel, Jane Austen focuses a great deal of page time on the subject of novels and heroines: (What is a heroine? Should people read novels?) I took pleasure in seeing the characters of this novel take part in enlightening debates and discussions of other novels whether it be a horror novel or history novel. In addition, I greatly enjoyed how warmly Jane Austen defends the reading and writing of novels in her narration and commentary.\\"Yes, novels; -- for I will not adopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so common with novel-writers, of degrading by their contemptuous censure the very performances, to the number of which they are themselves adding -- joining with their greatest enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such works, and scarcely ever permitting them to be read by their own heroine, who, if she accidentally take up a novel, is sure to turn over its insipid pages with disgust. Alas! if the heroine of one novel be not patronized by the heroine of another, from whom can she expect protection and regard? I cannot approve of it.\\" - The Narrator\\"'It is only Cecilia, or Camilla, or Belinda;' or, in short, only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humour, are conveyed to the world in the best-chosen language.\\" - The NarratorCatherine Morland is an utterly delightful heroine! Some readers and critics may find Catherine to be an immature and inferior heroine, but I disagree. While it is true that Catherine is a little fanciful and young, I find her naivet&eacute; and ingenuousness to be endearing and engaging. In addition, Catherine's tendency to think the best of everyone reminds me a little of Jane Bennet from Pride and Prejudice. At the close of the novel, Catherine emerges as a perceptive and discerning young woman. I took pleasure in viewing the significant improvement in Catherine's understanding, growth and maturity throughout her adventures and experiences away from home.Northanger Abbey is a stellar masterpiece that clearly illustrates Jane Austen's great genius. This novel will be sure to divert and entertain Jane Austen admirers no matter how many times they have previously read it before. One of the great things about rereading a novel by Jane Austen is that it will be never a dull experience; the brilliance of her writing will forever be discovered and rediscovered with each reading.Austenesque Reviews"},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I have seen numerous movies of other Jane Austen books, so this was nice to not know the story before reading it. You can tell that she wrote this earlier, becuase it didn't have the same flow that her other books had. The end was very hurried, almost as if it was finished hastily to get it published. Other than that, it was really good and still better than most books I read. I wish there were more Jane Austen books in the world."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"\\"The building is haunted\\" or \\"There's treasure buried in the backyard\\" are a couple things you might tell a child to make an ordinary event like a wedding rehearsal or dinner at the neighbor's more exciting and interesting. The novel's protagonist, Catherine, does the same thing; only she's telling the stories to herself! After reading a Gothic novel (which this book is, in turn, designed to parody) Catherine convinces herself that the abbey she's staying at houses a dark secret, that her her host murdered his wife nine years ago. As a result she takes on the role of detective and tries to solve the case. Those who are looking for a strong female lead like some of Austen's other characters (i.e. Elizabeth Bennet) may be less than satisfied with Catherine, who sometimes acts more like a spoiled child than an adult. However, Catherine in endearing in her own right, and her efforts to make the \\"boring,\\" normal life of the abbey into an intrigue-filled adventure are entertaining and enjoyable to follow. This reader certainly felt nostalgic for childhood games of make-believe, at least. The male protagonist Henry also makes a great counterpart to Catherine, as the voice of reason (or sometimes of teasing) that balances Catherine's imagination and naivete. This novel leads the reader on a fun, nostalgic adventure with Catherine, while also demonstrating the dangers (however humorous) of confusing fiction with reality."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"When I read the words written by Jane Austen telling me that Catherine Morland had been in training to become a heroine I knew I was going to enjoy this novel. This book allows us a glimpse of Jane Austen as a younger woman, as a beginning novelist and as a woman with a lovely sense of humor. There isn't any denying that this book, then titled \\"Susan\\", was the first to be sold by Austen to a publisher. There it languished in some forgotten corner for thirteen years before she tried to get it back from a firm which had no intention of publishing it. Ultimately she had to borrow the money to buy her own book back. People can probably get involved in scholarly discussions as to whether or not any revisions were made to this book by Jane Austen before her death, but that's isn't what I'm interested in. I wanted to read this book because I just couldn't believe that Jane Austen had really written a book which I didn't like. At all! Thankfully, I proved myself to be both right and wrong. I completely and thoroughly enjoyed this book and am only sorry that I allowed film versions of the book to turn me away from actually reading what the author had created.Catherine Morland became a heroine for me to love and to sympathize with, while I watched her grow and mature. At the age of seventeen Catherine is quite young to be starring in her own novel but according to the times she lived in this was a perfectly respectable age for a young woman to become a wife and mother. Up until the time Catherine was fifteen she was the epitome of a tomboy, much preferring playing games outside to learning the skills to help her in her housekeeping and marriage. When she was around fifteen she discovered novels. It was the most delightful thing to read Jane Austen's words in defense of her heroine reading novels and particularly Gothic novels. The information contained within those books colored so much of Catherine's thinking and when she is given the opportunity of having a prolonged stay in Bath with close friends and neighbors she is ecstatic. Mr and Mrs Allen will become the surrogate parents of this young woman for their stay and upon arrival Mrs Allen continually bemoans the fact that she knows nobody in Bath, therefore she and Catherine are restricted as to who they can talk to. Very quickly Mrs Allen meets a former schoolmate, Mrs Thorpe, her son and daughters, and from then on Catherine can move in society with Isabella Thorpe and later her brother John Thorpe. One process leads to another and Catherine makes the acquaintance of Eleanor and Henry Tilney along with their father Colonel Tilney. Austen uses Catherine and her new friends to demonstrate the social limits and restrictions on young women of the time. She also illustrates how easily deceit can be camouflaged as friendship.My reading of this novel was enhanced greatly because I was sharing the experience with a friend. We discussed the novel from the viewpoint of our previous interest in the writings of Jane Austen. I must rank this book right up there with my other favorite novels now. Yes, there is melodrama. Yes, Catherine is a very young woman prone to being fooled by others. Thankfully it is also about Catherine conquering her fears caused by the melodrama by facing reality and Catherine learning to see the motives of other people more clearly.This novel is Jane Austen at her most natural, at least it seems that way to me. She is obviously having fun with this writing, she also seems to genuinely like her heroine and the other \\"good\\" characters in the book and shows us the deceitful characters we all need to recognize and avoid. Austen seems young in thought and spirit in this writing. The prose is light and very readable. It is also a relatively short novel. I would have liked for it to be longer (of course!) but specifically because I would have liked for some of the characters, even major characters, to have been presented in fuller form. The only portion I'm definitely a little disappointed with happens in the final chapter, but I'll let you discover that for yourself. Who knows, you might not have the same reaction at all. I do highly recommend this novel as a truly great early novel from a writer who was to go on to a fame which probably would have truly surprised her. This Penguin Classic edition is a wonderful version of this novel. It contains much information aside from the novel which was a great help for me while I was reading. The Notes from each chapter by Marilyn Butler, Exeter College, Oxford, were invaluable in keeping me in the time frame of what was happening in Austen's world when this book was written. I also highly recommend this specific edition of Northanger Abbey."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Gothic romances were all the rage in the late 1700s and early 1800s -- and rather than the usual straight comedies of manners, Jane Austen once wrote a mellow satire of the very mockable genre. \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a clever and slightly tongue-in-cheek little novel about a girl who needs to learn the difference between fantasy and reality... and yes, there's some love tangles and deceptions too.Catherine Morland is an innocent young country girl with a love of gothic romances, and has lives an unremarkably life in a country parish. But then the wealthy Allens invite her to Bath during their vacation there, and of course she accepts -- and through balls and old acquaintances, she becomes friends with two pairs of siblings. One is the Thorpes, the uncouth dandy John and his manipulative sister Isabella, and the more mysterious Tilneys, the charming Henry and sweet Eleanor.When the Tilneys decide to leave Bath, Catherine is invited with them, to the vast stone manorhouse of Northanger Abbey -- which is as gloomy, eerie and remote as her gothic-loving heart could wish for. What's more, she believes that there are dangerous secrets in Northanger Abbey, related to the suspicious death of the late Mrs. Tilney. But Catherine has some lessons to learn about reality and fantasy: that everyday world is not nearly as melodramatic and twisted as her novels, and that it has its own dangers and deceptions.Unlike all the other books Austen wrote, \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a careful balance of two different styles -- a parody of all the lurid excesses of classic gothic novels (she even lists a bunch of real-life gothic novels!), and it's a subtle coming-of-age tale about a young girl who needs to figure out the difference between reality and fantasy. There's big spooky manors, sinister noblemen, mysterious deaths... you do the math.And Austen clearly had a lot of fun with this book, enhancing her usual formal style with a bit of satirical melodrama (\\"A thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness\\"). And while the plot is sprinkled with sinister pseudo-gothic hints, Austen also takes the time to sketch out some romantic deceptions and tangles, as well as some deliciously arch dialogue (\\"I was not thinking of anything.\\" \\"That is artful and deep, to be sure...\\").The only part that falls short is the climactic encounter between Henry and Catherine... which is completely skimmed over, and related only in a distant vague style. \\"I leave it to my reader's sagacity\\" is not a satisfying way to handle that sort of romantically-charged scene.Austen also has fun with Catherine as the unlikely heroine of the piece, especially since she makes it clear that Catherine comes from a very mundane, undramatic background. She's sweet, naive, wide-eyed and essentially good-hearted, but she has a lot to learn about reality (especially about the golddigging family that befriends her). And Henry is an oddity among Austen's heroes, being a clever silver-tongued charmer with a heart of gold who likes to gently tease Catherine.Quick, light and full of teasing humor, \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is an oddity in Jane Austen's string of brilliant novels -- but being a clever, well-plotted spoof doesn't make it any less charming. A delight."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"A man reading Jane Austen is a bit like a woman watching an old Chicago Bull's title series - you don't want to do it at first, you pretty much knows how it ends, but it is surprisingly captivating. With that being said, this is an enjoyable book with a predictable ending but an interesting path. The extensive scenes in Bath are intrinsically rewarding due to their humor and the knowledge that girlish precociousness has made it through to the 21st century pretty much intact. For the 99.99% of the world's population unfamiliar with 2nd and 3rd tier 18th century Gothic novels, the end notes to this edition are required to understand the parody.Plotline: girl goes to Bath, girl meets first 'friend' and then a true friend, girl visits big scary Abbey only to find out it is not actually the subject of her juvenile fantasy stemming from Gothic romances, girl falls in love, love is condemned, love conquers all. The narrative is very funny in parts, and always lively. One traditional criticism that holds true in my eyes is the uneven split between the first 3/4 (Bath) and the last 1/4 (the Abbey). Other than that, I have to say it is probably better than 75-80% of what modern writers can put out on their best day."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Jane Austen has created an immortal being in the heroine of the book: Catherine Morland. While at times Catherine is naive, her charming innocence and bright, engaging personality captures your affections. She is easy to sympathize with as she goes through a stay of 6 weeks in Bath, England, and as she is whisked away to an old abbey, the home of her new friend Eleanor Tilney, and also the home of the hero, Henry Tilney. Jane Austen has written a short novel that draws out your attention so you become completely involved with the characters and the plot. In my opinion, it is the best book by Jane Austen! I would highly recommend reading Northanger Abbey."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I loved this book, and although I do admit to liking all of Jane Austen's novels, I think it is the best way for a non-Austen-fan to understand her wit and charm. Her irony in this book is much more apparent than in the other five, except perhaps &quot;Emma&quot;. It is short, and easy to get through, and her leading lady is endearing. This was Austen's first novel, but wasn't published until later. It is obvious that she still has much to learn, but her genius is still present, if a little raw. A wonderful book."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"If you've ever tried to read Northanger Abbey and failed, listen to this audio cassette. Juliet Stevenson is brilliant at portraying all the different characters - the naive, sweet, impressionable Catherine, the deceitful, ambitious, scheming Isabella, her equally odious brother John and the handsome, witty Henry. In fact all of the characters are done full justice to and the humour of the book just shines through. This is Jane Austen at her best, lively, witty, funny and observant and Juliet Stevenson does an absolutely wonderful job of bringing the story to life. When you have listened to the tape you will immediately want to read the book - which is even more brilliant."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"This was excellent!

Jane Austen told the tale wonderfully and explained every thought and feeling vividly and emotionally."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I found this novel Jane Austen's most amusing. Catherine Morland is her youngest heroine and her innocence and large imagination land her in situations Lizzy Bennett or Anne Elliott would never tread. It's fun, clever and witty! Very enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Austen shows her mastery of subtle humor in this fun-spirited Gothic satire. Other reviewers have commented that they found the first chapter boring because it just talks about what an ordinary, mediocre person the heroine is. But I was cracking up and laughing throughout the whole book, and especially through the first chapter. Some authors try to make a big deal about how special their main character is, or about how extraordinary things can happen to their normal character. But Austen makes it clear that, most of the time, ordinary stuff happens to ordinary people, no matter how much they wish for excitement and adventure. Though the plot and other characters are not as well-developed as in other Austen novels, this is no reason to give it fewer stars as Austen is far better than most authors even when she herself is \\"mediocre\\". I found this book to be smart, sassy, and lighthearted. But the humor is very, very subtle. You need to be either very quick on the uptake or have a cynical mind to catch some of it."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I was mildly amused at first, but as the novel bogged down halfway through, I couldn't help but wonder if there was ever going to be an ending? What trivial and boring lives Austen satirized. Yes, this is satire, but it is not high satire. It's barely noticeable satire. I finally put the book aside, not even caring if the heroine ever gets the man who makes her heart thrill, or any man at all."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Northanger Abbey is a classic, but is able to be read with an ease usually associated with light, modern novels. It must be remembered that Northanger Abbey is a parody which can be more difficult that it sounds. Reading Northanger Abbey from a modern viewpoint and taking the action and dialogue seriously can quickly annoy the reader.Catherine isn't very worldly and has learned of the world through the books she has read. When she goes on a trip with her neighbors, she meets Tilney and falls in love instantly. Much goes on in the love lives of all of the younger people in the books, but most obvious is Catherine's utter innocent and naivety. More often than not, her doe-eyed charm is grating rather than endearing.Northanger Abbey is best when the characters discuss novels and reading. A lot of debate is put forth as to the worth of fiction and this discussion will strike a chord with most book lovers. Looking at it in a more specific light, this book delves a lot into the concept of the Gothic novel and readers may find themselves completely lost if they have no prior knowledge on the subject. The bulk of the humor stemming the parody aspect of the book is a take on this Gothic theme, so those who don't know the basics will miss this as well.The romance in Northanger Abbey can't be taken seriously, because taken at face value the love story is unconvincing, bordering on ridiculous. While Northanger Abbey feels like a casual read, a lot has to be brought to the novel in order to fully appreciate and enjoy it. While Northanger Abbey provides decent entertainment, those looking for a good Austen novel would fair better with Emma or Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"As with most of Austen's books, the plot is simple because the drama is within the people and their relationships. Catherine Morland is a sheltered girl who lived with her family in the country and never had nay friends or suitors. When a friend of her parents decides to take Catherine to live in the city, her whole life changes. She immediately befriends Isabella Thorpe, a deceitful and self-centered girl. Isabella's brother, John, attempts to court Catherine but she remains unswayed for her interests lay with Henry Tilney. As the story continues, Isabella becomes more demanding and almost tries to force Catherine to be with John. Eventually, Catherine finds her voice and refuses John's advancements. Yet, it takes Catherine almost the entire novel to completely come into her own. The title comes from the abbey that Henry Tilney's family owns. Catherine, who spent the majority of her youth reading Gothic novels, is completely enthralled with the abbey so when she is finally invited she just about bursts at the thought of hidden chambers and locked away skeletons. However, what she finds it nothing like what she had planned and when her imagination runs away with itself her relationship with Henry is put at risk.I really enjoyed this novel much more than I thought I would. I found other works by Austen to be boring, dated, and bombastic. Yet, Northanger Abbey is charming and has a message that still rings true today: don't allow yourself to be naive or prone to deceit because people will take advantage of you. In addition, I liked that the romance in the novel took a backseat to Catherine's development. Though it felt sluggish at times, I was never disinterested. I also loved Austen's defense of novels and the Gothic elements in this book."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Northanger Abbey is a fun book by Jane Austen. I had to purchase it for school, and I had a hard time reading it/getting into it.

He locked it up and did not intend to ever publish it. This was probably because it was entertaining but still the work of an amateur.

Where she learns what society is all about and the difference between reality and imagination."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Northanger Abbey is a lighthearted, sweet, satire....This is only my second Jane Austen novel, I read Pride and Prejudice before this, and while NA doesn't have the substance of P&amp;P, it is no less entertaining.The story deals with the familiar Austen themes of social mores and the pursuit of a suitable husband, but in this novel it receives a fun and lively treatment which will keep you turning the pages, by turns rooting for and laughing at Catherine, swooning over Henry, and cheering when Isabella gets her just desserts!I maybe the only woman to read Jane Austen for the first time at the age of forty, but I can't wait to read everything else she's written.....I've already bought them all.

One almost wonders how it ever got published. Given the style it was constructed in, being humorous, this book is very odd. Some parts I couldn't really understand, but other than that, fun story with no vampires - YAY!!! I always found the altering of classic literature to be rather horrid."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"It is believed that Jane Austen wrote many of her first works for the entertainment of her family and would read them aloud for their opinions and enjoyment. It is not hard to imagine that Northanger Abbey was presented to her family in this manner. The language and phrasing lends itself so freely to the spoken word almost like a stage play, that I was quite certain that an audio book would be a great enhancement to the text. Add to that the talent of a creative narrator and you have a great combination for several hours of entertainment ahead of you.I adore audio books and listen to them in the car during my commute to work. It is a great time to tune out the traffic, clear my head, and get lost in a good story. When I decided that I wanted to listen to an audio version of Northanger Abbey I discovered that there were three new unabridged audio editions that had been produced in the last two years to choose from. The first Blackstone Audiobooks (2007) was read by Nadia May, the second by Tantor Media (2006) and read by Donada Peters, and the third by Naxos AudioBooks (2006) and read Juliet Stevenson. The first two readers appeared to be professional narrators specializing in the classics with a diverse range of authors, and the third Juliet Stevenson is a well known British stage and screen actress, whose performance as the acerbic Mrs. Elton in the 1996 movie adaptation of Jane Austen's novel Emma was so hilarious, that I knew she would be an excellent choice to read the novel with the extra bit of animation that I desired.Ms. Stevenson did not disappoint and far exceeded my expectations. She added just the right amount of irony and humor to the reading of Northanger Abbey that no one would be in doubt that it is a burlesque on the sensational Gothic fiction or other overly sentimental novels popular in Jane Austen's day. Her choice of characterizations was imaginative and captivating. Hearing her interpretation of the emptiness of Mrs. Allen and her frivolous distinction for fashion, Isabella Thorpe and her shallow endearments, and Henry Tilney with his knack for reading and adapting to different personalities with wit and charm, I have a deeper appreciation and understanding of the novel."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I'd forgotten how much fun this novel is! Northanger Abbey was actually Austen's first completed novel as far as history knows, although it was published posthumously, long after her other works were published. It's really the funniest and most satirical of all her novels, and the gothic tomfoolery is what kills me. I just love it.A brief plot summary is that the story's protagonist, Catherine, is invited to spend some time in Bath with some family friends, where she meets the characters that will carry out the various themes in the story, namely two sets of siblings: Isabella and John Thorpe, and Frederick and Eleanor Tilney. A recurring theme any Austen fan will recognize is that of first impressions and innocence giving way to deception and misunderstandings, as a young, naive Catherine finds that her dear new friend, Isabella, is not quite who she at first appears to be, and that all kinds of scheming and plotting are going on behind Catherine's guileless back - based mostly, of course, on gross misconceptions that will cause all manner of ruckus down the road.The real jewel of this book in particular, though, is the hysterically funny and affectionately rendered spoof on the gothic suspense novel genre that was in its heyday during this period, a la' Radcliffe, Burney and Walpole. Anyone familiar with The Castle of Otranto, The Mysteries of Udolpho or any of the other gothic classics will really appreciate the humor. I absolutely love the gothic suspense novel in all its forms, so I get a huge kick out of it. The scene between Frederick and Catherine in the carriage on the way to Northanger Abbey where he teases her mercilessly (merciless because she's only about 2% sure she's being teased and is 98% wide-eyed with horror) about the abbey's dark corridors and hidden passages is so funny it makes me laugh out loud every time. Catherine's discovery that the abbey is decidedly un-haunted, sadly lacking in cobwebs and absolutely devoid of gothic gloom is even more amusing.There's a love story here too, and in fact a triangle or two, and as with all of Austen's stories, all's well that ends well. Wonderfully soothing balm for the Austen-starved soul, and secretly my favorite of her books (I usually lie and say Mansfield Park is my favorite. Sometimes Pride & Prejudice. Or even Sense & Sensibility. All lies. Northanger Abbey is it, hands down)."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Jane Austen just knocks me out. She wrote in a living room full of extended family,she wrote longhand when paper was not so plentiful as it is today and mistakes could not be so frequently wadded up and tossed to the landfill, she wrote without the instant editing afforded by personal computers, she wrote without benefit of the MFA programs and workshops we are assured today are the only route to producing literary art, and yet she wrote beautifully and for all time. Every word counts, every character is real, every scene pulses along in a swift current. Her work can be many things at once: social satire, romance, social criticism, a comedy of manners. It is a portrait of a certain society in a certain time, it is a universal commentary on human foibles, gender relations, class and money.NORTHANGER ABBEY was one of Austen's earliest mature works, and it stands alongside PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and the rest. She does something different in this one: she uses her own novel to, among other things, satirize the popular literature of her time, especially Ann Radcliffe's MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO. She sets out telling us that her protagonist, Catherine Morland, is not your typical heroine, that in fact she's ordinary without special talents, a dramatic home life or heart-stopping beauty. She belongs to the audience that was vacuuming up the burgeoning genre of popular literature of her time, and the second half of the story largely finds her attempting to live like a heroine in her favorite gothic romance, only to have reality jump out of the closet at her at every turn. The first half of the story is the set up for the second, the comedy of manners that positions her in the company of the residents of Northanger Abbey, whose name conjures up in her mind a dramatic ruin of a castle. There is, in fact, quite a bit of suspense that keeps you up late, just not the kind Catherine has in mind. If you pay attention in the first half of the book, you will find the \\"guns\\" neatly planted that go off in the last act."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"First let me say, I like Jane Austen. I'm not kissing up to my wife, and I don't feel less masculine in admitting it. I like good writing, and Austen is clearly a good storyteller.That said, I'm not always really into the subject matter of her stories - romance, coming of age, etc. But she writes well enough that I generally want to keep reading. Additionally, I've always enjoyed the many film adaptations of her books.But I wasn't crazy about Northanger Abbey. It was her first novel, and you can tell. The story is painfully slow, the characters (except for the heroine) are underdeveloped, and in general the love story feels very Jr. High (except with wealth and British accents).If you're reading the whole Austen corpus, then by all means read this. But if you are picking and choosing, I'd put Northanger Abbey at the bottom of the list."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I have to disgree with my fellow reviewer on the delight to be found in Northanger Abbey. I am a great fan of Jane Austen's work and am also somewhat partial to Gothic romances so I expected to really enjoy Austen's satirical take on this genre. While it started off with promise, I soon found myself wishing it would end as there is little action until the latter chapters when Catherine Morland, the heroine, finally goes to Northanger Abbey. I won't deny that there is some pleasure to be had in Austen's wit and humorous take on Gothic romances but the majority of the story drags a bit and the ending feels almost too rushed.Additionally, while it is clear that Austen created a heroine very different from those in her later work and that she is intentionally naive and easily influenced, she is difficult to like, making it hard to stay engaged with her story. Of course, Austen may have also done this intentionally as a way to hold Catherine up as an example of the failings of youth and the influence of this type of literature on a sheltered mind, but even in that case, it doesn't make the story any easier to enjoy.It is certainly worth reading to see a different side of Jane Austen as well as to judge the progress of her style and thematic focus but it may not stand up as well against the talent and mastery shown in her other work."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Being the first novel that Jane Austen ever wrote and the last that was ever published (posthumously at that); \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is an interesting specimen of a book. Though the plot itself is a little unpolished when compared to her later books, her sparkling wit is still firmly intact. Poking fun at the Gothic-Romantic novels of her time (and the effect that they have on impressionable young women) Austen crafts a satirical treatise on the dangers of the unbridled imagination and the real \`horror' of the time: the hypocrisy and two-facedness of the society Catherine lives in.Catherine Morland is an ordinary young woman, who thrilled by the excitement and intrigue that she finds during her holiday months in Bath. The fact that she is given quite a free rein by her foolish guardian Mrs Allen is just the ticket she needs to have a good time. Catherine enjoys the friendship of the glamorous Isabella Thorpe and her brother (whose attention is perhaps just a *little* unwelcome), the sights and sounds of the resort city and two new acquaintances: Eleanor and Henry Tilney. Quickly falling in love with the intelligent and well-read Henry (a character based on Austen's favourite brother of the same name), Catherine struggles with her innate sense of right and wrong, and her romantic delusions concerning the Tilney family. Marilyn Butler (the author of the introduction in my edition) describes her perfectly: \\"she is always capable of saying a good thing, which is either to the point, or refreshingly honest, or nave but disarmingly loyal to her parents and brothers and sisters.\\"Unlike heroines such as Elizabeth and Emma, Catherine is quite an immature young woman, and remains so for most of the novel. Her mind is filled with the fancies of romance-fiction, and as such Catherine is often criticized as being the weakest of Austen's heroines. But dismissing the novel on the basis of its weak protagonist is missing the point of the story itself (besides, I found Catherine to be Austen's most amusing heroine in light of her flights of fancy). Unlike \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and \\"Emma\\", \\"Northanger Abby\\" is not a character-study. In fact Austen makes it clear from page one that Catherine is not to be considered your typical heroine: \\"No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy would have supposed her born to be a heroine.\\" Austen douses Catherine's romantic ideals with a glass of ice-cold water, continually reminding the reader how ordinary she is, and - far from the romantic entanglements of her other protagonists - how simple and unaffecting her relationship with Henry is. In fact, Austen ultimately commends the major villain of the novel - his interference in the couples' plans extend their engagement and ensure that the two get to know each other better before they marry.Of course, Austen also has plenty of room for her other great literary technique: poking fun at the restrictions and regulations of her society. However, its treatment here is somewhat darker than it is in other books, as many of the decisions made by characters have very grave effects on others and aren't at all meant to be considered amusing by the reader. Catherine's mind is full of the horrors to be found in Gothic-Romanticism, and as a result is blind to the real nastiness going on around her; whilst she dreams about murders, secret passages and other sinister goings-on, she is completely unaware as to the cynical machinations and games being played right under her nose.The mastery of Jane Austen is of course that her work has aged magnificently, and is just as relevant now as it ever was. Just try and tell me that you can't relate to this following passage, as Catherine tries to avoid Mr Morland and find Mr Tilney at a crowded ball: \\"Every young lady may feel for my heroine in this critical moment, for every young lady has at some time or another known the same agitation. All have been, or at least all have believed themselves to be, in danger from the pursuit of some one whom they wished to avoid; and all have been anxious for the attentions of some one whom they wished to please.\\" First published in 1818, and these words are as true now as they ever were."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"The story of Northanger Abbey is really the story of the literary influence of fiction in Jane Austen's day. At a time when fiction was still spoken about in whispers and the subject of much debate, Ms. Austen was writing this epithet to the genre. Many believe that Northanger was the means of Austen's scorn for gothic novels. However, a closer look reveals a bold defense of the fiction writers of her day. This, alone, makes the book a treasure chest - because not only does Austen give you a picture of society's views of all things poetic, but actually lists novels that were popular in her time. Specifically, she lists novels and authors she personally enjoyed.The power that novels seem to hold over her leading lady, Catherine, was not a source of derision for the silly, flighty escapades of young ladies - but another way of Austen's showcasing the power of the written word - fictional word, that is. Here, she addresses the audience of her novel directly, and most provokingly in places - arguing those attributes of fiction novels which she believes show a greatness of mind.Because of the insecurity of fiction, she actually published her novels anonymously as did many other authors mentioned in her first novel - this one not being published until after her death. I have found great personal pleasure in seeking out and indulging myself in the many authors she lists whom she personally enjoyed and was inspired by. In reading them, I feel that I have discovered more about Ms. Austen and what made her brilliant mind tick. My imagination tells me that a glance at Catherine was a little glance at Jane."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I generally love both Jane Austen's work and the foot & end notes accompanying it that give a more thorough sense of the culture, but this time the notes completely ruined the story for me!At first I thought perhaps I was enjoying Northanger Abbey less than Austen's other works because it was her first, and therefore less practiced and perfected, novel. But towards the end of the book I realized that it's main flaws are not of Austen's doing.Every morsel that Austen holds back, every secret she hints at to draw the reader along with her main character is dashed to pieces by the explanatory notes! No wonder I didn't think it very good - before I'd read a third of the introduction (and there I stopped), I knew what trials would befall Catherine, what motives the antagonists operated under, and who the heroine would marry in the end!Of course her first work is not as heralded as Pride & Prejudice, but it is still worth the time of an Austen fan. If you are capable, ignore every memo in this book until after you're done. If you're incapable, I recommend you find another version so that you may enjoy Austen's first novel for what it is, without anyone spoiling it for you!A.L. TravisAuthor of The Pillar of Light: The Legends of Milana Series"},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"All periods have their literary crazes, the equivalents of &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; or serial killer books. In Austen's time, it was the Gothic romance, with its beautiful suffering heroines, haunted castles, ghostly visitations, and unspeakable horrors. &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is Austen's send-up of this genre, which she combines with a more typical (for her) story of husband hunting and social comedy.Catherine Moreland is the least accomplished of Austen's heroines. She's pretty enough and gently reared, but the author makes it plain that she's the early 19th century equivalent of an airhead. In typical Austen fashion, Catherine travels to Bath in the care of family friends and quickly becomes best friends with the husband-hunting Isabel Thorpe. She also encounters Henry Tillney and his sister Elinor. Henry and Catherine hit it off, although not without some rough spots created by the actions of Isabel and her family. When Catherine is invited to visit the Tillney's home, the ancient Northanger Abbey, she is delighted as much by the chance of having a Gothic adventure as by spending time with her beloved's family. Making much out of little and using her favorite novels as guides, she immediately begins to investigate the hidden secrets of the place and reads a nefarious purpose into Henry's father's every action. Eventually her eyes are opened to reality, duplicity is exposed in the real world, and Catherine gets her man.&quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is one of Jane Austen's earliest works, and many consider it her weakest. Compared to &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; it's definitely rough around the edges. But it still has its pleasures. Austen may not have created as admirable a heroine in Catherine as Elizabeth, or Emma, or Anne, but she treats her kindly in the end. Austen's eye for the foibles of those around her is just as sharp as it would be later, and her pen is just as lethal. As for Austen's literary parody, you don't have to have read the early 19th century Gothic novel to appreciate the humor the message. Just think about the effect that many of our novels and movies have on us today--it's basically the same thing. Austen may have been using what was familiar to her audience, but the point remains--art and reality are not the same and those who are too impressionable run the risk of confusing them."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"The story describes the development of a young girl, Catherine Morland. She is the daughter of a clergyman, not very rich nor especially handsome or clever. At the age of seventeen she is allowed to go with Mr. and Mrs. Allen to Bath, were all the upper class of England spends the holidays. She meets there a plenty of young people, for example John and Isabella Thorpe, Eleanor Tilney and her brother Henry. They all become friends, but John and Henry take a deeper interest in Catherine. She has to make up her decision: The young student John or the earnest reverend Henry, and soon it's clear. Catherine goes with Eleanor and Henry to stay for a visit at the abbey where they are living with their father, Captain Tilney, while Isabella ingages with Catherines brother James. As Catherine has read many novels about misteries (f.e. &quot;The misteries of Udolpho&quot;) she expects to find something puzzling and amazing in this old abbey. Everywhere she looks for a strange thing, but never finds anything. Even Henry tells her once how stupid she is to believe in such things, and now Catherine has a more realistic vue to the world around her. But then she receives a letter from her brother James where he writes that Isabella has left him, and moreover Catherine has to leave the abbey because Captain Tilney has found out that she isn't as rich as he thought and because of that not adapted to become Henry's wife. Through all these experiences Catherine grows up, and at the end of the story she is a very different woman than at the beginning."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"A CHRISTmas gift for my daughter who loves Jane Austen.The book arrived in excellent shape and by the date promised.It now sits on the top shelf of her new bookshelf with her otherJane Austen books!"},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I've been working on reading all of Ms. Austen's oeuvre, and all I have left is Persuasion. Reading Northanger Abbey was a miserable experience. The heroine is so insipid, and I could care less about the parody of the gothic novel. I'm reading Austen for her character-building abilities, not for her making fun of old novels I haven't read.The other characters were abominable too--Mr. and Ms. Thorpe, the Allens, the whole lot of them, Catherine as a child. And I thought for so long that the widower General was hitting on Catherine himself.I even had to listen to the audio version to try and move things along but it still made me grit my teeth and at times bored me to the end of my nerves.Well, if you only have one Austen to skip, skip this one. Or read it only if you're a diehard fan, which I am not."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"So it's time to review another classic. Ugh, these are probably the hardest ones to review for me. I'd give Northanger Abbey 4 Stars. I did like this book and it definitely had moments where I was extremely curious to know what was going to happen next, but as with all of Jane Austen's novels that I have read thus far, there are moments that are more boring in nature and therefore allow me to put the book down easily.The more I read of Jane Austen's writing and the more familiar I am with other works from the same time period, the easier it is to read these works. I'm more familiar with the phrasing and general canter of her writing style than I once was, but sometimes I still have to slow down in order to absorb what it is that she's trying to say.Northanger Abbey's heroine, Catherine, appears to me to be surrounded by several people who's speech is contradictory to their actually feelings or actions, Isabella, John Thorpe, and Mrs. Allen. And Catherine herself appears to me to be one of the most ignorant of Jane Austen's heroines. I don't mean that in a bad way necessarily. It's just that Catherine doesn't always know what is proper and usually defers her own judgment to those around her assuming that they know better than she does. While Catherine does appear perceptive in some cases, as in disliking John Thorpe very early on, she also appears the opposite in other cases, such as Isabella's true nature as well as John's supposed attraction to herself.I like the fact that while Jane Austen's heroines seem to be similar in some ways, they all have very different circumstances and experience which makes each story very much unique to itself. I do find that there has been in at least 3 of the novels that I've completely finished a character that I wholly dislike...and it's usually the one that talks the most about things they know nothing about. In this case, it's Isabella Thorpe. One thing I was disappointed in was the ending. It's not that she didn't satisfy my desire to know what happened or that I wasn't pleased with the end result; however, she essentially summarized the ending rather than letting the reader experience it as it happened.Anyway, a short read, but well worth it if you're an Austen fan. If not, I wouldn't suggest reading this one first, but work up to it."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Northanger Abbey is Jane Austen's 5th published novel, although it was actually written before her earlier novels. Catherine Morland is an impressionable, innocent and nave seventeen-year-old from the country, in Bath for the first time in her life. She is grateful to be befriended by the lovely Isabella Thorpe, but less than pleased to be pursued by Isabella's brother John. Henry Tilney and his sister Eleanor appear to be more genuine in their friendship, and Catherine is invited to be a guest of their father, General Tilney, at Northanger Abbey. Catherine is an avid reader of novels, and, believing life to be an adventure, gets the wrong end of the stick on more than one occasion. Austen's style is a little different in this novel; she occasionally mentions, as the author, her readers, her characters and the plot. She has her characters make some quite strong statements about novels and novelists. Catherine's plight towards the end of the novel brings a lump to the throat, but much of the novel is filled with humour. Probably the funniest Austen."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Northanger Abbey is a great addition for those who are already Jane Austen fans, but it's not a good choice for first-time Austen readers (or even, second or third-time Austen readers). I have now read all of her novels save Mansfield Park. Northanger Abbey is not without its merits, but overall, it is underdeveloped. According to Wikipedia, it is the first novel that Austen wrote, but among the last published. Knowing the novel's history helps one be more understanding and sympathetic towards all of the book's flaws. In fact, arguably, the value of this novel is precisely its unpolished state, for that provides precious insight into Austen's thoughts and development as a writer.Catherine Morland is the title's heroine. You know that she is the heroine because the author explicitly tells you at the outset. She is invited by family friends, Mr and Mrs. Allen, to travel to Bath, where she meets her hero. Again, you know who the hero is because the author explicitly tells you. When she first arrives at Bath, she bemoans her lack of acquaintances. Slowly but surely, she meets some friends; and thus, the first half of the novel revolves around Catherine's social life in Bath. The second half of the novel brings Catherine to Northanger Abbey, which gives the author an opportunity to poke fun at gothic settings.Northanger Abbey is largely a parody of popular gothic novels during Austen's time. Not having any knowledge of the gothic novels that Austen references, such as Udolpho, I couldn't properly appreciate Northanger Abbey. The best analogy I could think of was if someone today wrote a parody of Twilight, not in a mean way, but in a good-natured humorous way. Then two hundred years from now, someone reads the parody version without ever having heard of Twilight. That's the analogy I had in my head as I read Northanger Abbey.Thus, I tried to appreciate this novel for what it was. But still, I didn't care for the characters or the plot of Northanger Abbey. I never really took to Catherine Morland in the way that I always took to the heroines in Austen's other novels. Catherine's personality lacked that fire, that spark present in Austen's other heroines. I also didn't care for the story in this novel. Not much happened, and what did happen was choppy. Certain plot elements towards the end felt abrupt and I didn't get sufficient closure on certain characters at the conclusion of the novel.One unusual aspect of this book is that the author sporadically interjects herself into the novel, and even offers a lengthy ranting defense of novel readers in Chapter 5. From this I infer that others in Austen's society must have looked down on novel readers. Ironic, isn't it? Nowadays Jane Austen novels are considered classic literature, and I imagine that those who read classics are more likely to look down upon those who don't. Anyways, the author's direct interjections are weird and out of place. I know that sometimes writers speak directly to the reader as a literary device, but that is not the case here. Austen is just randomly spewing her thoughts here for no good reason.All of my complaints aside, I must give Austen credit for writing a pretty humorous novel. Some of the dialogue exchanges between the characters are delightfully funny. The parody of the gothic setting is amusing, even if not fully appreciated. I might even say that among the Austen novels I've read, this is the funniest."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I'm not sure why this novel is considered the \\"lesser\\" of the Austen novels. It's brilliantly funny and contains wonderful satire of the gothic romance novels popular at the time and the silly games that suitors play with one another. Through the character of Isabella Thorpe, Austen reveals the damages that can come from a deceptively manipulative friendship. It is only when our heroine Catherine Morland becomes independent from Isabella's influence that she can realize that she wasn't a true friend at all.I have great affection for Catherine Morland. It is true that she's the least intelligent of Austen's heroine's but that's because this is a true coming of age story. We get to see her journey from naive young girl, to an independent young woman, through her profound life experiences. And Henry Tilney is a great hero because even when he is amused and befuddled by Catherine, he does everything he can to spare her feelings and lead her in a sensible direction. Plus he's really funny.It has been years since I'd read this book and I forgot how many of Austen's best quotes come from it!

Something must and will happen to throw a hero in her way.\\"\\"Friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love.\\"\\"I cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible.\\"Catherine's thoughts on reading History:\\"I read it a little as a duty, but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me. The quarrels of popes and kings, with wars or pestilences, in every page; the men all so good for nothing, and hardly any women at all - it is very tiresome: and yet I often think it odd that it should be so dull, for a great deal of it must be invention. The speeches that are put into the heroes' mouths, their thoughts and designs - the chief of all this must be invention, and invention is what delights me in other books.\\"And my all time favorite Austen quote, as spoke by the wonderful Henry Tilney:\\"The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel must be intolerably stupid.\\""},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I like this book.

I was expecting, by the description on the back of my Barnes and Noble copy (and everything else I'd read about it), that this would be a gothic novel full of mysteries and enchanting (or not so enchanting) secrets. Not so. The first \\"Volume\\" was consisted of their time in Bath, Catherine and Isabella's friendship, and possible suitors (other than Henry) for both of them. Henry is introduced but not much happens between him and Catherine until a bit later.Catherine, Henry, and Isabella were developed well, as were Mr. Thorpe, Isabella's brother, and Eleanor Tilney, Henry's sister. Catherine and Henry were absolutely adorable together, honestly. I could totally picture them together. I guess character development is not the issue here. Execution of story and too much fluff are, however. There was so much that happened in the book that I totally could have skipped over and I still would have understood the story perfectly.

It has a real story with meaning and is an insight to life in the very early 1800's. In some ways, especially in the realms of social behaviour, nothing has changed that much. Of course this applies to normal intelligent people not some of the morons around today although they probably existed then but were dismissed as irrelevant. Northanger Abbey is so refreshing after reading most books today that seem obsessed with sex. There's plenty of it in Jane Austen's books but it isn't hammered into your face and leaves most of it to your imagination.

I know, I know. When all my friends in High School and College were reading her I was reading Robert Heinlein and Isaac Asimov. I've seen the movies but have never gotten around to reading the books. I'm not sure if this one is indicative of her writing style because the synopsis says that it was her spoof on the noir genre. I liked it. There was enough tongue-in-cheek humor as well as \\"fake\\" suspense to make it interesting. Her writing is very flowery and wordy (which was how everyone wrote in those days) so it took some getting used to. I had to wade through the salad to get to the meat of the story. Luckily I've read enough books by authors of that time period to not get frustrated with the slow pace of the plot. I enjoyed the feel of the story - you really got a sense of what the people and the society was like back then. Another thing I liked that I've noticed other writers from that time period also do: her characters read books by real authors. I've actually found some of those books on Gutenburg.org and Amazon and read them too! I discovered Mary Roberts Rinehart this way. She is supposed to have written the first Locked Room Mystery with her book \\"The Circular Staircase\\". It's free for the Kindle at Amazon. I will definitely be checking out more of Jane Austin's books."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"After being disappointed with a couple of Austen's books after P&P;, I was glad to enjoy this one. Her wit is rarely as good as she accomplishes here. The characters are back, too and here we have both a decent leading man and lady.As a work of satire and literary criticism, the story works. Although I am not familiar with the genre she criticizes (past Frankenstein), it lampoons the fans as much as the genre and there are many parallels in today's genre fans.I put \\"The Mysteries of Udolpho\\" on my list to round out my opinion, but it is huge and I won't be getting at it any time soon."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"The format is fantastic.

They published a version with the original language, and add many notes to explain references to help a reader understand the context of a word or phrase. The book itself is better than I had expected. Many people dismiss it, possibly because it is not Pride and Prejudice, but I thoroughly enjoyed the novel."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"This is Jane Austen's first published novel though not as well known as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and \\"Emma\\", it is still an ageless classic. Written in the English of the early 18th century it is at the same time almost poetic and difficult to comprehend, which can cause the younger reader to find it stilted or boring. In Austen's writing you must often times read between the lines, as in that period of time many things could not be openly expressed but only hinted at, so take your time. All her books relate to the reader lessons to be learned from life and the character of persons one might meet or associate with. This copy is beautifully formated by VOOK for navigation throughout the book, punctuation, and ease in reading unlike most of the poorly scaned copies of the classics that are available. Northanger Abbey also has a few nice picture illustrations."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I wanted to read this story because this is Jane Austen's take on a Gothic novel as well as her poking fun at novels of her day. I can see all these elements in Northanger Abby. Catherine's daydreams and suspicions of the old house, Austen talking to the reader in a humorous vein and the overall silliness of some of the characters.I have to admit I had a difficult time keeping all the characters straight and it took me a while before I didn't have to refer back to previous pages. This may have had something to do with the fact that I put the book down frequently. It's not that I got bored, because I didn't and when I picked it up again I enjoyed reading it. It just wasn't a \\"I couldn't put it down\\" novel.I like many of the characters and I feel they are the strongest element of the book. Catherine makes me laugh. She sort of reminds me of myself because she can be so oblivious. I felt her frustration and unhappiness as Isabella and John scheme to monopolize her and put her in a mortifying situation. I felt her disappointment at exploring the mysterious Northanger Abbey only to discover...nothing. I remember doing the same thing in my grandmother's old house. I hoped to find treasures, but only discovered old clothes that smelled like mothballs and cigar boxes full of pencils. Catherine's love interest, Henry, acts as mentor and teacher and tries to keep her feet on the ground, but he also indulges her whimsical imaginations. This aspect reminds me of Emma and Mr. Knightley. I feel Isabella and John are the most interesting. They are so self absorbed and manipulative that it is almost comical. What is more humorous is Catherine's slow and reluctant recognition of this. Someone said to me that they felt there is nothing extraordinary about Catherine, but this is precisely why I like her as the protagonist. Sure, I like to read about interesting, exciting people, but honestly, most of us are pretty ordinary and aren't we the protagonists in our own life story?Several times Austen speaks directly to the reader as if she is telling a bed time story. I read Pride and Prejudice so long ago, I can't remember if she did the same thing or if she does this in her other novels, but I find it a bit jarring and I'm not sure I like it.Northanger Abbey was published after Jane Austen's death and I wonder if she had lived to go back and re-work this novel what changes she may have made. Perhaps she would have shown us what happened at the end instead of paraphrasing or included the details of Eleanor and her husband. Maybe we would have seen more drama between Captain Tilney, Isabella and James or even Henry at odds with his father or friction between Henry and John.There are many things that are pointed out in Northanger Abbey that are just hinted at or taken for granted in her other novels, such as appropriate behavior, social norms and the subject of money. Although in my opinion, this is not a perfect novel, I enjoyed reading it. If you are a Jane Austen fan and have not read Northanger Abbey, it is a fun frolic through her world."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Northanger Abbey - Jane Austen4 starsThis was the first book that Austen wrote. She sold it; it was never published; so she bought it back when her other books became successful. Possibly she intended a rewrite. Her brother had it published after her death.The story concerns the teen-aged Catherine Moreland who has little experience of the world, but much experience with gothic romance novels. Austen manages to make Catherine comic in her awkwardness and excessive imagination, but lovable in her direct honesty. This book has all the satire and social commentary of Austen's later books, but other than Catherine, I felt the characters lacked depth. Although Catherine's brother has a failed love affair with one of her new friends, Austen only deals with the effect this has on Catherine's relationship with Isabella. Little is said about the brother. Nothing at all is known about Eleanor's relationship to her Viscount. That marriage is only mentioned because it allows Catherine and Henry to marry. I missed the more complex interplay of multiple characters and plot line that occur in Austen's later books, but I enjoyed Catherine's runaway imagination.Juliet Stevenson gives a wonderful performance of this book. Each character is captured distinctly while she adds to the atmosphere and the comedy with her animated reading."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I am making my way through all of Austen's book, and thiswas the third after Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility.This was the first of her novels and the last one to be published.However, her writing is most of the time almost as sharp as inthe later novels, and the plot will also not be too much of asurprise. The novel is, however, not at the level of the previuslymentioned two, perhaps mainly because the heroine is somewhatdim, although likeable. The conversations between Mr. Darcyand Mrs. Bennet are those of equals. However, it is sometimespainfully obvious in the exchanges between Henry and Katherinethat it is Henry who is the intelectually superior. Although theplot rambles a bit here and there, this is still a very good read,and Austen's wit shines through on a number of occasions."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"A delightful satire of the gothic genre, Austen's \\"Northanger Abbey\\" will delight gothic and Victorian enthusiasts alike."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I watched the recent BBC version of the Northanger Abbey story first and loved it. I'm a Jane Austen fan who hasn't read all the novels but I'm working on it. So I got the novel to see how it compared. It was great! I love her humor - tongue in cheek and so witty. But the thing I really want to comment favorably about is the Penguin Classics edition. I get so much background and insight and explanatory information from these editions. I've read 3 of them now and they are marvelous. I've read quite a few novels from this era and it is really helpful to have notes to refer to in the back that explain things."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"This excellent first novel by Jane Austen is a must read for Austen fans. Although this novel was the last to be published, Northanger Abbey was the first story she wrote. This first attempt is raw, emotionally driven, and shows the passion of a first time writer. The story is one of mystery, intrigue, and a match made in heaven... that is of course dependent on if society will allow it.From the balls in Bath to the secrets of Northanger Abbey Catherine Morland lives it all. Her youth and proper upbringing give Catherine the innocence and naivet&eacute; that everyone can't help but love in her character. Her truly good-hearted personality allows her to be liked where ever she goes. Catherine, it should also be noted, is a fan of gothic novels and is intrigued by the mysteries and secrets they hold. While on vacation with her wealthy neighbors the Allens, Catherine for the first time gets to experience the society in Bath. There she meets the amiable Mr. John Thorpe and the witty Mr. Henry Tilney. When Catherine is invited to the Tilney's Northanger Abbey, her imagination and the grandeur of Northanger Abbey takes hold of her as she tries to discover the truth behind the death of Mrs. Tilney (Henry's mother).\\"Dear Miss Morland, consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained. What have you been judging from? Remember the country and the age in which we live. Remember that we are English: that we are Christians. Consult your own understanding, your own sense of the probable, your own observation of what is passing around you. Does our education prepare us for such atrocities? Do our laws connive at them? Could they be perpetuated without being known in a country like this, where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing, where every man is surrounded by a neighborhood of voluntary spies, and where roads and newspapers lay everything open? Dearest Miss Morland, what ideas have you been admitting?\\" - Henry Tilney"},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Jane Austen wrote \\"Northanger Abbey\\" in the late 1790's, but it was not finally published until 1818, after her death. It is a broad satire of the Gothic Romance novels popular in her day. Its lead character, the innocent young Catherine Morland, is moderately attractive, good-hearted, and highly imaginative, but perhaps the least compelling of Austen's heroines. Nevertheless, Jane Austen's excellent writing gifts are on display in this short novel, which offers some superbly funny dialogue, witty commentary on social manners, and a sympathetic heroine.Catherine is offered the opportunity to vacation in the resort town of Bath by family friends Mr. and Mrs. Allen. In Bath, she falls in with two people her own age, Isabella and John Thorpe. Isabella is to be engaged to Catherine's brother James, while John, a college friend of James, takes an interest in Catherine. The Thorpes involve the inexperienced Catherine in the social whirl of Bath. They will also provide her with some hard lessons in manners.Catherine also meets Henry and Elinor Tilney, a brother and sister who introduce her to walks and intellectual discussion. Their father, the imposing General Tilney, invites Catherine to visit the family estate of Northanger Abbey. Catherine eagerly accepts the invitation, in part to stay close to Henry, on whom she has a crush, and in part to see the ancient abbey, sure to be the embodiment of her cherished Gothic Romances.Catherine's willingness to see dark secrets in ordinary events leads her on a search of the Abbey for clues to the suspected murder of General Tilney's wife. In a gentle confrontation, Henry ends the search, but is not able to save her from the sudden wrath of the General, who banishes her from the Abbey. A heartbroken Catherine is separated from Henry and Catherine, and returned unceremoniously to her home. There, an unexpected visit by Henry Tilney will offer an explanation for what happened at Northanger Abbey and a chance to reunite with the Tilneys.Readers expecting a story with the heft of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" or \\"Mansfield Park\\" may be disappointed. However, \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a fun book on its own terms, very much a Jane Austen product and likely to be enjoyed by her fans. It is highly recommended as an entertaining read."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"This is not a sophisticated read, but it is fun. Jane Austen wrote this before she wrote anything else and it was rejected, it is a bit adolescent, but fun. A young girl lets her imagination get away with her when she visits friends at an old house. I'm a high school teacher and I would recommend this for young teens who want to progress beyond R L Stine, etc."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"As a lover of Austen novels, it is well worth reading \\"Northanger Abby\\", which was Austen's first (but last published) novel. As her first novel, her writing style is still rough and lacks some of the refinment of her later works, but she still brings her sharp eye for satire and examination of societal/marriage topics. Catherine Morland pales in comparison to later strong heronies like Elizabeth Bennet or Fanny Price, but she's delightful to read and chuckle about her naive outlook on life."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Northanger Abbey was one of Jane Austen's earlier works, and, reading it , you can definitely see her gift of writing in its infancy. While this work is not perfect by any means, it is a fine-tuned effort that any Austin fan will enjoy and appreciate. Basically it works as part comedy/drama of manners and part parody of Gothic literature, taking many of the elements of Ann Radcliffe's work The Mysteries of Udolfo, and slightly satirizing it. The ending's closure--where Austin ties everything together nicely--is something seen in many of her other, more popular works, where all loose ends are tied and questions are answered.The first part of the novel focuses on Catherine Morland, her family, and her acquaintances. Catherine goes away from her family and stays with the Allen family. While there, she meets the Thorpe family, and becomes an acquaintance and friend of Isabella Thorpe. She has to fight off the advances of Isabella's brother. Later on, at a dance, she also meets Henry, a man who she will eventually fall in love with. She finally gets the opportunity to stay with the Tilney family at Northanger Abbey. Because of her love of novels, and her chance to become better acquainted with Henry and his sister, Catherine is excited to go. The second part of the novel begins with Catherine staying at Northanger Abbey.One of the funnier aspects of the novel is the 2nd part, when Catherine goes to Northanger Abbey and immediately becomes entranced with the many Gothic elements she seems to have read about. This is when her knowledge and love of Gothic literature tales runs away with her imagination. At one point, she believes that Henry's father has murdered or imprisoned Henry's mother, or that he is keeping her stowed away and doing malicious and evil things. There is also a moment when Catherine is alone in her room late at night and sees a chest, and fears that it has something awful inside it--so naturally she goes to investigate. It seems that all her suppositions and fears are well-founded to her, but we see that she clearly has taken some things too far in her mind, and perhaps there is an anti-climax in her not finding anything noteworthy.What makes Catherine a likeable heroine is that there are faults to her, so she is perfect by no means. For one thing, she is oblivious to many events that are seemingly obvious to others, namely the romance that begins with her brother and Isabella. She also has some trouble expressing herself in the earlier parts of the novel, but as time wears on she becomes more assertive and mature. Also, her love for novels can be seen as a weakness because she tends to over dramatize and fantasize about them--this seems to be Austen's way of lightly poking fun at reading novels, something you have to admire from a great writer. Over all though, she is a character that is fun to read about and follow around in her adventures.While the story does have moments where it may drag a little, it still is a fun and adventurous read and is a must for Austen fans. This review is in reference to the Dover books version of the novel."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"I do not like the title since only part of the story takes place in the Northanger Abbey. The novel has some fame as a parody of Gothic novels, but that is not the primary focus of the novel. This is a novel written by Jane Austen at least a decade before her famous novels. It is similar to the later novels but it is less sophisticated, shorter, and it seems fragmented - as I discuss below. It was sold for publication in 1803. It is her earliest work but it was not a success. She bought back the rights and it was published after her death in 1818.As background information, I have read all of Austen's novels, and I have read various analyses of Austen's work. Jane Austen's formula for success was to write a novel about of a financially disadvantaged young woman who meets and marries a wealthier man. The exception is her novel \\"Emma\\" where the protagonist has her own means. There are no axe murders in an Austen novel or any nasty elements. Her stories take place in small English towns and they all have a variety of characters including a few willful women and usually one male rogue.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Jane Austen's finest novel. That book is the perfect balance of story, prose, structure, and interesting characters. It evokes many emotional responses in the reader. That novel is among the greatest novels of all time on par with for example Flaubert's \\"Madame Bovary\\" or Tolstoy's \\"Anna Karenina.\\" From a strictly literary point of view, \\"Mansfield Park\\" is the most complicated and sophisticated literary work penned by Austen.So, where does that leave \\"Northanger Abbey\\" among her works? All of her five mature novels share a certain fixed writing style and a common structure, or the Austen formula as mentioned above. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters. This is her sixth major work but written earlier. That Austen formula is partially present in the plot and structure. The first half of the novel is good. Catherine is a sympathetic protagonist and John Thorpe is a suitable rogue. Her love interest, Henry Tilney, seems a bit weak or enigmatic. The story is good for about half the novel. When the action moves to the Abbey it seems to become very fragmented and disorienting for the reader. But the Abbey section is not too long, and then story returns to more what we would expect from Austen near the end.Most Austen fans will find the piece to be interesting but a bit confusing in parts and not her best."},{"Title":"Northanger Abbey: A novel (The select library of fiction)","review":"Northanger Abbey is a classic in several senses of the word: It's pure Jane Austen; it's set in the early 1800s, mostly in a Gothic abbey; it's dramatic and overwrought and wonderfully written. Any Austen fan who has not yet picked up this little gem of a novel should do so immediately because you are sure to be delighted!Catherine Morland, aged 17, is expanding her horizons by visiting Bath with her neighbors, The Allens. While there, she becomes entangled with the Thorpe family, who are not quite what they seem to be, and the Tilney family, with whom she forms a sincere attachment that leads her to visit their family home, Northanger Abbey. Catherine has spent a good deal of time reading novels, and she allows her imagination to run wild once she finds herself in the dark corridors of the abbey; the appearance of Henry, her hopeful love interest, helps quell her theatrics a bit but she still finds herself drawn into situations she doesn't understand. Classic Austen includes misunderstanding and love, and this novel has both in abundance.This is a slim novel, and from what I gather, one of Austen's earliest. The characterizations are not perhaps as finely tuned as some of her other works, but overall this is a satisfying read with the delights of the time period. Sit back, curl up, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Army Ants: The Biology of Social Predation (Cornell Series in Arthropod Biology)","review":"Some scientists can write for other scientists and still produce a book laymen will enjoy. E.O. Wilson is a shining example. Unfortunately, Dr. Gotwald doesn't live up to Wilson's standard.This book is written for other scientists. It never gives a clear view of the big picture for any of the numerous species of Army Ants discussed. Instead, it covers topics like \\"behavior\\" or \\"parasites\\" for all the numerous species of ants discussed. Ants are always referred to by their scientific names, and I found myself befuddled trying to keep track of which genus of ants was which, or even which genus lived where. Nowhere in the book is there a clear picture of \\"Species A behaves like this, it lives here, it makes a living by doing X, it's most common food items are Z, it is most commonly predated or parasitized by \\"B, D, and D, and the routine cycle of their existence is ______\\".As an example, early on in the book, I learned that a great many army ants make their living by traveling and living underground, and preying primarily on other ant species' larva. This was mentioned very early in the book, yet after completing the book, I'm not sure which ants these are, where they live, or (most importantly) how do they find and attack other ant nests. The closest thing to a description of this activity described another ant species attacking a termite nest.I'd rate it a \\"2\\", except that there just isn't any competition for a modern adult book on these ants. You will learn a lot from the book, you'll just have (if your experience is like mine) a tough time putting the pieces together."},{"Title":"Army Ants: The Biology of Social Predation (Cornell Series in Arthropod Biology)","review":"This book brings to mind the great kickass movie, Starship Troopers. Instead of humans, army ants kick ass with worms, arthropods and other insects but in an equally violent fashion. Falling rain is the sound the author likens to terrorized prey fleeing army ant swarms.I wanted to learn more about army ants after a recent birdwatching trip to Honduras where a cabin at my lodge was the site of one kick ass battle between two species of ants, probably one being army ants. The guests, who had to vacate, described the walls and ceilings as covered with ants locked in battle and falling to the floor entangled.Also as a birder, I was aware of the numerous and confusing species of antbirds, antwrens, and antshrikes that follow army ant swarms.This book was just full of juicy facts. Like their bivouacs at night where they just all clump up in one big mass. I especially liked all the early interest of 19th century naturalists including missionaries. Naturally with such a dominant species, lots of animals join their entourage other than birds. Particularly interesting are the interlopers who give out calming secretions, beetles that have morphed to look like ants, grooming beetles, and a small wasp with a handle on its thorax for easy carrying by army ants.Plus the author is a good writer. The technical jargon was a little cumbersome but easily figured out or unimportant to the main message. This book achieved its goal of illuminating me about army ants in an entertaining fashion."},{"Title":"Hold fast the dream (Forever romances)","review":"I just finished this book and I loved it.

The novella had a lot of information chunks thrown at me. This is alright for the bible, but not okay for a fictional story, even if it is based upon the bible. At least in my mind.I also wasn't very fond of Caleb. He had an air of superiority. No one could satisfy him, while he acted as if he was above it all. He just seemed a little to perfect in his mind for my liking. What happened to struggling with right and wrong? For Caleb, the struggle seemed to be lacking. His biggest concern was trying to sway everyone to his way of thinking. Honestly, with Caleb so sure of himself and his way of thought, the overall story lacked conflict. I had nothing to look forward to.Although Caleb was above many of the struggles, the other characters were not. Even though I knew the story, it still broke my heart to see the children of Israel learn and accept after the consequences were in place. For example, one of Caleb's brothers said, \\"I thought, perhaps, the Lord had forgotten about me, and I might sneak into the Promised Land among my sons and grandsons...\\" Even thinking about it now brings tears to my eyes.Other lines made me reflect on life in general. For example: \\"And like this morning, they prayed the same prayers they prayed every day, and then went off to live life on their own terms.\\" Isn't that so true sometimes? It's like the Natalie and Phillip Larue song where they sing, it's not right to be a Christian \\"One Day of the Week.\\"So in my opinion, the overall message was wonderful, but the presentation was lacking."},{"Title":"The Warrior: Caleb (Sons of Encouragement Series #2)","review":"The condition was excellent, it arrived within the week of ordering.

I don't know how much truth it was in the book. But a few of the same facts were used from the first book that did not make me question how accurate they were. That helped me separate fiction from facts.The best way to understand things from the bible, I would recommend to start with the first book of the series.After reading the first and second book of the sons of encouragement series, I can say with confidence that Lineage of Grace series about the women from the bible were better reads except for the last book of that series, \\"MARY\\" which was preposterous.

I haven't found another of hers that I liked as well, yet I keep trying. For this story, the potential is there to weave the story and engage her readers. Yet there are a few bumps that interrupt this.Caleb was too perfect. He didn't seem like he ever did anything wrong - except to defy his family and move in with the Israelites (which turns out was the right thing to do). He was seen as more holy and influential than Moses or Aaron. Caleb was always right, and telling others that he was right. He was a Gary Stu. It got a bit tedious for my taste. Rivers seemed to use her Caleb character to preach through him. I'd rather see the characters do Godly things than hear them say Godly things.There were some fine parts to the story and some interesting things to think about.

She'd already finished THE PRIEST, with THE WARRIOR (Caleb) as the second in a series of five.These were real men who lived on the edge but had the courage to take risks. They were not perfect; no one is, and sometimes made big mistakes. The books are termed historical fiction as she created dialogue, internal motivations, action which were not listed in the accounts of these men in the Bible; in some case, she created additional characters. Our local historian does the same, but don't tell him I revealed the secret of his popularity; he knows how I feel.I have read some of Francine Rivers' novels prior to 1985, which she calls for 'the general market.' She has another series out about Enduring Grace. In her books the past ten years, she has preached and used a lot of Bible verses. But the audience she is appealing to at this point will bypass these books without more promotion. The others are not listed in the titles available on Amazon.com, so I can't remember which I have read without a bibliography. A person who aims at nothing has a target he can't miss. (C Southcott)"},{"Title":"The Warrior: Caleb (Sons of Encouragement Series #2)","review":"The Old Testament heroes have often been overly sanitized in Christian circles, but author Francine Rivers reminds us in her gritty novella, THE WARRIOR --- her second installment in the planned five-book \\"Sons of Encouragement\\" series --- that the lives of Old Testament men were full of violence, heroism, sexual encounters, and passion for God.Drawing from the books of Numbers, Joshua, and the beginning of Judges, Rivers takes us through scriptural events through the eyes of Caleb. The story opens as Caleb, or \\"Kelubai\\" as he is known, is convinced that the God of the Hebrews who is smiting Egypt and Pharaoh with plagues is the true God. Convincing his family to join forces with the Hebrew slaves, they become part of the exodus to the wilderness. There, they wandered for more than 40 years, waiting for God to deliver them to the promised land.Through Rivers's vivid imagination, we glean new insights into the person of Caleb. He was not fully Hebrew, descended from the line of Esau, she writes. He was a farmer, a slave, who had been born in a mud hut and lived on one small plot of land. She chronicles Caleb's emancipation and the unfolding of his life as a nomad, traveling great distances and assuming the role of soldier. \\"Freedom was not the simple matter he had dreamed,\\" writes Rivers. \\"As a slave, he knew what the day would hold and how to get through it. Now, he didn't know what the next morning would bring.\\"He was courageous, yet Rivers ably portrays Caleb's conflicting emotions as he pleads with God: \\"I am as afraid as any man to go into Canaan and walk among the giants who live there. But I fear more not being counted among Your people. Do not allow them to set me aside. Please don't reject me, Lord. Purify my blood. Make me a son of Israel!\\"Children's Sunday school flannelgraph stories tend to gloss over a lot of Old Testament scripture, and Rivers bravely tackles some disturbing aspects of Caleb's story. However, even mature Christians will find themselves uneasy --- not with Rivers's depiction of Caleb's life, but with the Biblical violence. In the name of the Lord, thousands of men are killed in battle. Endless gore is spilled. Captured kings are tortured to death. Rivers depicts in one scene how every person and animal in a conquered city is put to the sword, including women, children, and babies. Cities are left in ruins. When lives are spared, young virgin girls are given to men as spoils of war. Caleb, in his eighties, is the recipient of two such young girls.The Israelites' enemies are not the only ones who meet violent ends. In one chapter, 24,000 Israelites are killed in a plague by God after sinning against him with the Midianite women. In another story, an Israelite sins, and he, his wives, his children, and his livestock are all stoned to death. In yet another scene, God opens the earth and two hundred and fifty Levites are francine struck by fire, then swallowed into a precipice when they rebel. And so on, and so on. As a movie, Caleb's story would be lucky to squeak by with an \\"R\\" rating.Rivers handles the gore and sexual situations with sensitivity, but they will shock the reader nonetheless. However, as C. S. Lewis once admonished Christians, \\"...we must never avert our eyes from those elements in (our religion) which seem puzzling or repellent, for it will be precisely the puzzling or the repellent which conceals what we do not yet know and need to know.\\"Rivers is a good storyteller, but the reader may find that, because of the short length of this novella, characters are not as developed as might be desired. Transitions are sometimes missing, and the passion that characterized her series \\"Lineage of Grace\\" is notably absent. Perhaps most disappointing is that the brief study section at the end of the novella fails to address the more disturbing questions raised in a reader's mind: Why would God order so much bloodshed? What was the place of women in this Eastern time period? How does Christ's sacrifice in the New Testament change any of this? Readers may discover that this plunge into an Old Testament story is less entertainment than it is theologically challenging.--- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby. (...)"},{"Title":"The Warrior: Caleb (Sons of Encouragement Series #2)","review":"THE WARRIOR by Francine Rivers is the second of a five part series. I was a little disappointed with the first book in the series, The Priest, but volumes 2 and 3 (yes, I read them out of order) have been extraordinary and a welcome return to what I've come to expect from this very gifted writer. This one follows the story of Caleb, the half-breed from the tribe of Judah who, after the death of Moses, would become not only the greatest warrior of the twelve tribes of Israel, but I believe also God's most dedicated servant of a generation.Caleb undoubtedly possessed the most unwavering faith among the Jews and this book closely chronicles his struggle, not just with his own sin, but with his inability to sway the people who, over and over, so quickly turned away from their Almighty deliverer. Caleb spent his life, when not destroying the idol-worshippers which infested the promised land, desperately reminding the people of God's grace upon them. Caleb's was a life surely mired in frustration as he watched not one, not even two, but three generations turn away from the Lord God.Though Joshua is so often the one remembered of the generation of Jews delivered into the land, it was Caleb who was the strength of the people, often standing alone on the side of God. And though even his twelve sons would disappoint Caleb, near the end of his life it would be his one daughter who would give him hope for the future of the Jews.Once again, Francine Rivers takes the reader through the stories of the Bible in intricate detail, adding narrative, but never venturing from the details.Pastor Monty Rainey"},{"Title":"The Warrior: Caleb (Sons of Encouragement Series #2)","review":"Another wonderful illustrative book by Francine on the life of a biblical character and the conditions in which he lived. I always appreciate her research into the culture and personal climate of the subject she is writing about.While the book seemed a little slow in the beginning, I was rewarded with a stunning reminder of how easy it was for the Jews of that era (as well as us today) to loose faith. God often uses the experiences of the Jewish people of the bible to illustrate the tendancies of humanity in general...our lack or loss of faith despite amazing miracles, the febleness of our minds in rembering what God has done for us, etc. (FYI, I am very pro-Jew as they are God's chosen people).I loved this book because it was a great reminder that God is bigger than ANYTHING and that great faith and obedience is rewarded by God's unfailing faithfulness. It is also inspiring to read about people who, because of others' lack of obedience to God, face major bummers and still perservere.Lastly, I would like to respectfully beg to differ on a point brought up by another reviewer. God tells the Jewish people to completely wipe out all of the inhabitants of the promised land. This is because they are riddled with ungodliness in their idol worship, sexual practices (which I thought Francine gracefully tiptoed through), and other wicked and vile traditions and God didn't want them infiltrating the Jewish camps and cities and corrupting them. God also reveals that disobeying His command to annihilate these peoples completely would result in their being a thorn in the Jew's side for generations. This is mentioned several times.I would recommend this book to anyone who is old enough to understand it."},{"Title":"The Warrior: Caleb (Sons of Encouragement Series #2)","review":"The Warrior by Francine Rivers continues her biblical men of faith series--Sons of Encouragement. I have read all Francine Rivers' books and have never been disappointed. I was delighted to learn \\"The Last Sin Eater\\" is in feature-length film production.The hero of our current story is Caleb, warrior of God. The first paragraph--\\"Run!\\"--hooked me and I reluctantly inserted my bookmark when other duties called. Kelubai's--Caleb's given name--belief in God begins when in the throes of one of the disasters rained down on Egypt because Pharaoh wouldn't let God's people go. \\"The God of the Hebrews could turn water to blood and call forth frogs... Here was a God he could worship.\\" He runs to the Hebrews, led by Moses, and asks for acceptance for him and his family to exit Egypt with them. But the Hebrews, just beginning on their journey into the desert, look down their nose at him and tell him no, since he is but a half-breed and descended from the lineage of Esau. When asked his name and he replies, \\"Kelubai,\\" they jeer and call him Caleb -- dog. Not taking \\"no\\" for an answer, he and his family tag along on the fringe of the huge exodus. Finally accepting the name Caleb, his love for God and following His commandments eventually earn him a standing in the community.When the Jews reach the Jordan River, Caleb is chosen to represent the tribe of Judah to spy out the land with a member of each of the other eleven tribes. Also among the twelve is his young friend, Joshua. For forty days the spies surreptitously inspect the land of Canaan and its people. When returning, they all say how wonderful and fertile the land is; the magnificent crops--some of which they've carried back as witness to the rich fertileness of the land. But ten say the people are too big, too well defended and there is no way they can take the land from them. Caleb and Joshua, however, say God has given them this land; they must fight for it and drive out the Canaanites. They must obey God. But the people don't listen and God returns them to the desert to wander for almost forty years because of their unbelief, disobedience, and complaining. The only two of the current adult generation who will be allowed into Canaan are Caleb and Joshua--the entire adult population dies during the forty years of wandering in the desert.Francine Rivers has penned a marvelous and poignant story of one man's desire to be all that he can be for God. She's taken the scriptures and brought them alive. And she's done it beautifully. One can't miss the parallels of our own lives and Caleb's, nor God's call to respond to Him as Caleb did. Absolute obedience, no matter the cost."},{"Title":"The Warrior: Caleb (Sons of Encouragement Series #2)","review":"The story of Caleb is over 3000 years old, but Francine Rivers brings it to life in a way that helps the reader really understand the depth of Caleb's faith and relationship with God. She adds detail, not found in the Biblical account, that helps the reader to understand the struggle he faced in convincing the nation of Israel to boldly enter Canaan. I have always loved the story of Caleb but she made the story a new one to delight in."},{"Title":"The Warrior: Caleb (Sons of Encouragement Series #2)","review":"I enjoyed the women's novella's by Francine Rivers. When she began to write Sons of Encouragement I was thrilled! The Warrior paints a vivid image of Caleb as a man stuggling to keep his focus on God in the midst of doubt and sin. This is the struggle of many Christians who will truly identify with Caleb's frustration. An amazing read."},{"Title":"The Warrior: Caleb (Sons of Encouragement Series #2)","review":"Francine Rivers continues her series on male Biblical heroes, though ones overshadowed by larger figures. Here is the story of Caleb, often overlooked in favor of Joshua. I especially like the prayers Rivers writes, which I copied them into my journal; I was startled that Caleb's words to God seemed to echo thoughts I've had. Rivers writing is uncomplicated and full of Scripture, and her books are uplifting."},{"Title":"The Warrior: Caleb (Sons of Encouragement Series #2)","review":"I am an avid reader of Francine Rivers books. She weaves a gripping story with powerful spiritual lessons. She is my favorite Christian novelist because her books have so much 'meat' to them unlike other Christian novelists whose books comes across as trivial.However I was disappointed with THE WARRIOR. The storytelling wasn't as tight and the story wasn't a pageturner. Usually I can't put one of her books down, but this one took me a while to read because it didn't compel me. The spiritual lesson wasn't as strong either.It was an okay read, but I know Francine can do better."},{"Title":"The Warrior: Caleb (Sons of Encouragement Series #2)","review":"I love anything she writes, but these books add so much insight to what we already know about the characters from the Bible.

This is my first Ludlum novel and whether ghost written or co-authored, whatever, I found it a good read in the thriller genre. Intelligent, knowledgeable and well crafted are few among many choice words to describe this tale. Paul Janson, a seasoned ex-operative tormented by his own capabilities, is brought full circle back to the source of his nightmares - a man Janson thought he saw killed, a man that has since grown exponentially more dangerous and sinister. Then again, should it be surprising to Janson? There are many people that apparently this expert agent witnessed executed only to be surprised when they spring back into action at a later date (whether they were killed or it was their double). Jessica Kincaid, the remarkable assassin, that takes on an affinity for Paul Janson, her assigned \\"unsalvageable\\" target, plays a critical rule in helping him unravel the enigma of the death of Peter Novak, a man on a such a worldly scale that perhaps only a Citizen Kane could hope to surpass. Wonderfully written scenes include the park in England, the attempt to rescue Novak from the Caliph, the streets of Greece, well, you get the picture. This story takes you around a world the author has been many times before. As my first Ludlum book, an interest kindled by my enjoyment of the Bourne Identity motion picture, I am excited about the prospects of late nights with Ludlum's classic stories."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"There is nothing to say against Ludlum's storylines. The same pattern, however he always manages to turn it into something exciting and unpredictable. Not so this time. Taking off to a great start, he is painting the picture of a great Hungarian philantropist, who resembles the real life, well known financial tycoon G. S.From there on however, any seasoned thriller reader can easily predict the turn of events. Even more, the writing is sloppy, commercial, and unmotivated. Where Ludlum used to paint a picture for all of his characters, making them unpredictable, he does only the minimum necessary to fulfil his page quota. His hero's picture is more ellaborate, but one would imagine, that R.L. can come up with some new character profiles.Why do I give two stars? Well, I have seen worse than this: The Covert-One series."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"Amazon.com provided a detailed synopsis of Ludlum's latest posthumous offering, so I'm going to forego providing my own.Besides I don't want to give away a sentence of plot, as hopefully many people will read this excellent thriller based on the author's hard-earned reputation as master of the spy thriller. Some speculation admittedly if this was a novel written by Mr. Ludlum or by someone else, I claim it matters not, this is by far his best novel since The Bourne Identity. The book is long but every page is packed with suspense, thrills, chills, and even romance. The plotting is as familiarly paced ( i.e. fast paced) as one has come to expect of a thriller bearing Mr. Ludlum's name. Some may be disappointed which is there perogative, personally, I felt his characterization and general technical background was deeper than in some of his recently published novels and as a whole The Janson Directive is an action packed page turner (cliche but true.)"},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"While this is far from being Ludlum's best is is a very entertaining and action packed. With Robert Ludlum you don't need spy movies cause his novels are a lot better. The character's are a little dry cause either thy are too good or to bad, but Ludlum makes up for it with a lot of action. There is a lot of twist and surprises in this novel and that just what we expect from a Ludlum novel. It is sad that he has died, but he has left us a lot of good books to remember him by."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"This is the best thriller written by Ludlum since 1982's &quot;The Parsifal Mossaic&quot;. He manages to grip the reader's interest from the start and, at last after so many years,manages to keep it up the rest of the way. The plot seems fresher and the twists make sense.To me, he reached his peak with &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;, kept it with Parsifal, but began losing his magic since. Of all the books in the interim, &quot;The Icarus Agenda&quot; was first class Ludlum for the first third of the book, then went steadily downhill: the rest were all major dissapointments. Here he (or whomever!) went back to his former glory.This is high praise from me, as I consider &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; to be the greatest &quot;thriller&quot; I ever read."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"Philanthropist Peter Novak is kidnapped by the Caliph well known and feared terrorist.

Buy it and read it."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"I really wonder how many people who've been writing reviews about The Janson Directive have read any other Ludlum books. This is not vintage Ludlum. It was certainly not written by him. First, the dialogue is too fresh, and that points to a younger writer. Secondly, after around page 200 or so, after the plane blows up, the story goes downhill. Up to 200, it may have been Ludlum. But after that it just goes down. The suspense of the book died then, replaced by action, too much detail on the technology of the guns or cars being driven, and the angles each shot came from. After the plane exploded, there was only one twist, at the end, that just about anyone could have seen coming. From any other author, this would be a four or a five, but if you put the name Robert Ludlum on a book, I'm expecting something better."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"As of late every book I have read has been mediocre. I keep waiting for something to spark my interest and make me feel my time has not been wasted. Finally!!! This book has been the very best book I have read in the past few years. I am ready for another. I truly hope Ludlum has other notes and manuscripts to be unveiled."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"A friend lent this to me and I am really grateful. I'm sorry Ludlum didn't live long enough to develop Janson into a Bourne-type series character, because he's just as interesting and complex. I liked the action, the international settings and the technology, but most of all the characters. This is one fast-paced thrill-ride with a lot of depth to it that you won't put down. Like I said, I only wish there could be more.In a nutshell, Paul Janson, a retired spook, comes back into the game to help out an old friend who's been kidnapped, and then the plot takes off from there. No constraints, no subtleties. If you like raw bones thrillers, this is your bread and butter."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"Being a fan Lublum I felt this book was just a little too long as well as over the top unbelievable. How many times can Janson possibly escape instances where only one or two people in the world can? The twist and turns were interesting but like I stated just a little too long with the fininshed product."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"This book that was released after Ludlum died truly feels like a real Ludlum. I was wondering if it would have the same nuances of his other books completed when he was still living or be entirely in the voice of whomever pieced it together post Ludlum. The only slight difference between Ludlum's earlier work and this is the extensive detail placed upon military weaponry and background. It also feels like Ludlum in that the plot is really pretty silly when you get down to its bare bones. I think I have read a dozen Ludlum's in my time and all but the first Bourne book deal with a cabal or figurehead intent upon taking over the world. Nothing is new here. Once the story starts to congeal into a structure where the reader begins to understand what is going on, very predictable plot threads start to come to life.My main complaints here are the dozens of times that Janson escapes getting shot or killed by the best of the worlds hired killers. Bullets are constantly narrowly missing the guy or he is rescued from out of left field by his friendly version of the Calvary. The evil dude here is so predictable when it comes time for him to enter the book that it was groan-able. So in essence, this is a pretty stupid book. If you take offense to my calling this a stupid book, I recommend that you try some thrillers by other authors with more capable hands. It's obvious that you have not yet read enough of this genre. Some early Tom Clancy books are definitely better, or Jim Harrison and Dashiell Hammett's work. But I think that you might enjoy Denis Lehane's books even more if you give him a chance. Start with Mystic River and go from there.Ludlum is always enjoyable on a certain level, and if you are able to suspend disbelief and work around characters that show absolutely zero personality, this would be a fine book. I sort of think of Ludlum as writing comic books for adults and there is nothing wrong with that from time to time."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"If I give 5 stars to the Bourne series, I would have to give this book 2 stars.- Length: Way too long- Detailes: too many irrelevant ones. I had to skip many paragraphs.- Action packed: Not really. Atleast not compared to Bourne series.- Ending: Huh?!- Is it worth reading: not really- So whats next: I think I will close the book on Ludlum after reading the new Bourne book. It seems that all of his works, carry the same story line. It gets boring after a while. So why am I either going to bother with the new Bourne book, even though it is not written by Ludlum? To just say that I have read all of Bourne books and plus the first 3 were awesome."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"This book could have really been great!Great storyline.For the most part, well-developed characters.But, the writing is NOT vintage Ludlum.I do not have any insight into the history of this particular writing. However, I do know that the author of this story (or at least the final chapters) must have written steamy romance novels in a past life.The protagonist, Paul Janson, is all man for 2/3's of this story. Then, without warning, he becomes a melodramatic sap. For instance, in a closing chapter, he rants and shouts at the remaining members of a secret US power-sect [a group that includes the President of the US] like a forsaken lover in a sappy love-novel.There are hints of a slowly-weakening character change throughout the story. As I venture further into the plot I hope I'm proven wrong in my assessments .Instead, I end up disappointed.What of our Protagonist? Not only is Paul Janson weak; he's a raving, feminized fool. He stares down the bad guy in what should be a mind-shattering climactic explosion of student vs. mentor. Instead, Janson blanks out and goes shopping for yesterday's memories. It sunk to the point where I started to reach for a tissue to hand to the dear boy.Sorry, but I don't like my spy-heroes sounding like refugees from a pulp love novel.As stated earlier, Great story with nice plotting. Lukewarm character development of Paul Janson. This guy goes from ruthless protector of the USA to a whiny fool towards the latter stage of the story.I couldn't wait to finish it.**Want vintage Ludlum (with help from Gayle Linds)?

Reading the flap I thought, \\"Will I get lost and confused in the plot?\\" For surely, this has happened in the past with Ludlum books. My fears were allayed when I began to read and immediately became caught up in the story. It reads almost like a compendium of up-to-the-minute knowledge, wrapped around a classic Ludlum plot.

With a reported 90% of the manuscript completed, Messrs. Morrison and Kahla rounded out a gem in THE JANSON DIRECTIVE; this book rings true to the REAL Ludlum as opposed to the \\"Covert One\\" series carrying his name. This storyline has the same content, feel, flair, and panache as Ludlum's classics (PARSIFAL MOSAIC, THE MATARESE CIRCLE, The BOURNE series...), which makes sense in that he wrote the vast majority of THE JANSON DIRECTIVE. I guess true Ludlumites will be hoping Mr. Ludlum left behind several more uncompleted manuscripts to quench our endless thirst for his works. Regardless, THE JANSON DIRECTIVE certainly was a nice surprise.For those unfamiliar with Ludlum, the basic premise of most of his thrillers is to create an arguable hero, a villanous cabal or individual, and place our hero against impossible odds. The price of failure? The fate of the world.Our hero in THE JANSON DIRECTIVE is Paul Janson, a legendary superspook retired from the clandestine covert agency where he made his career. His taste for brutality and violence bitter, the loss of his wife and the desire to live a solitary existence, Janson joins the ranks of the entrepreneur and hires himself out as an industrial consultant. The peaceful life takes a turn south when he is contacted by a representative of the Liberty Foundation, a private organization devoted to peace and democracy throughout the world. The Foundation's founder and nobel prize-winning laureate, Peter Novak, has been kidnapped and is scheduled to be publicly executed...by the same terrorist group responsible for his wife's death. Janson has another reason to consider reactivation; Novak was personally resonsible for saving Janson's life many years ago and Janson is not one to forget a debt owed. Without hesitation, Janson assembles a team of star operatives to rescue Novak.The mission, against incredible and overwhelming odds, is a success until, moments after Janson bids farewell to his team and Novak, the escape helicopter explodes into a fiery ball of flames as Janson watches. His team, his friend and star pupil, and Novak-gone in a flash. As Janson tries to piece together WHY?, he finds himself marked for death in nearly every city he passes through. Janson believes it must be operatives of the terrorist group seeking revenge for his part in the daring rescue of Novak. However, Janson soon realizes his would-be assassins are American! As the storyline builds, Janson saves one of his latent assassins from rape and certain death. This act creates doubt in the assassin, Jessica Kincaid. As soon as Janson realizes that Kincaid works for the same agency from which he retired, his peerless instincts kick in, making Jason an inexorable opponent for his former agency.As with most TRUE Ludlum novels, the plot devinely twists and turns keeping the reader absorbed in the storyline until the final twist at climax.While the Covert One series maintains the broad brush \\"ideas\\" of Ludlum, these books are not true Ludlum books. Do not be mistaken, the Covert One authors, Gayle Lynds and Philip Shelby, are fine writers and understand the mechanics of the spy/mystery genre. However, those of us who grew up reading Ludlum know the Covert One books are a mere shadow of what was. Lynds and Shelby lack the characterization and panache of the master; we can only hope they continue to aspire to his literary summit. Kudos again to Messrs. Morrison and Kahla for briefly quenching an insatiable deire for more of Ludlum's gems. Here's hoping there are more."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"Suspense - Action - Intricate Plotting - Wonderful Intrigue - All the things which Robert Ludlum provided the reader in his most successful books are contained in THE JANSON DIRECTIVE. This is an action adventure thriller to rival the Jason Bourne trilogy, and fans will hope that a sequel for Paul Janson was also conceptualized before Ludlum's death.Paul Janson, a retired field operative from the covert agency Consular Ops is clandestinely recruited to attempt an exfiltration of Peter Novak, a billionaire and Nobel Peace Prize winner who has been kidnapped by nationalist rebels on the island kingdom of Anura and is to be executed in three days time. After being informed of the details of the mission by Marta Lang (head of Novak's philanthropy - the Liberty Foundation), when Lang thanked him for providing she and her associates with hope Janson remained silent but concluded that \\"perhaps false hope was better than none at all\\". And indeed, on the verge of apparent success a terrible tragedy occurs as Part One ends. For reasons totally unknown to Janson or the reader, a \\"beyond salvage\\" is then issued by Janson's former agency and he is targeted for death.The remaining eighty percent of the book involves unraveling the intertwined mysteries of the life of Peter Novak, the Vietnam wartime experiences of Paul Janson, the role of the secret ops of the U.S. government, the disappearance of Marta Lang, and the continuing role of the masterful Anuran rebel leader, the Caliph, who has also a fateful link with Janson's past.The intricate nature of the conspiracy as it unfolds rivals the best books of this nature that I have read, and the characters are well drawn, especialy Jessica Kincaid, the young sharpshooter of unbelievable ability (literally, her achievements were a bit too good) who is on the team chosen to pursue Janson, but also several of the bit characters as well including the Russian Grigori Berman. I was especially intrigued by Peter Novak, who Ludlum clearly seemed to model on George Soros in many details. However, Novak chooses to achieve his goals through an activist \\"directed democracy\\" rather than Soros' methodology of simply promoting \\"Open Society\\". Nevertheless, the existence of Soros as a real life model for the accumulation of such vast wealth makes Novak's character more believeable.As most of Ludlum's books, this displays deep cynicism regarding the actions of our government, and great understanding of the arrogance of power. I found Janson's contempt for \\"the best and the brighest\\" and his analysis of their faults truly refreshing. Several things argue against this being written (rather than plotted) by Ludlum. Most noticably, the contemporary idiom relative to his other books, as well as the more graphic and detailed violence. I was repulsed by a few of the descriptions of torture, as was undoubtedly the intent given their context. However, the fact Ludlum stepped out of character to write THE ROAD TO GANDOLFO and THE ROAD TO OMAHA keep me from reaching a firm conclusion regarding the extent of his role in the preparation of this manuscript. But is is good enough so that the publisher should have informed its readers concerning whatever collaboration occurred in its preparation and provided appropriate credit, as this would not have detracted from its appeal."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"Initially published one year after the death of Robert Ludlum, the nearly finished manuscript to this action-packed novel of government deception and cover-up was reportedly completed by his editor.If not for his legendary Jason Bourne character, the main character in this novel - Paul Janson - could have been the Ludlum franchise in movies and successful book sequels.And it is more than eliminating the first \\"n\\" in the last name for the misunderstood hero to be like Jason, as there are a number of close parallels; he is a Vietnam veteran who survived the sadistic manipulations of a commander, worked in a government covert agency that ultimately will try to eliminate him and is haunted by scenes from his past, including the murder of his pregnant wife by a terrorist organization.The hunt for Janson is started when an \\"off-the-books\\" rescue attempt of a billionaire philanthropist goes terribly wrong, which leads to friends becoming enemies in a fast-paced game of searching for answers in the shadows between fact and disinformation.Meticulous details and patented Ludlum plot twists make this novel more than a summertime read. This recent reissue clearly shows that Ludlum was moving in a direction to produce another seminal hero in the thriller genre."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"If, like me, you have been waiting for that one spectacular posthumous work from the immortal master of international intrigue, then your patience has been richly rewarded. Since his death in March 2001, the first few offerings bearing his name were of the poor-to-bland variety. However, THE JANSON DIRECTIVE is pure, unadulterated, vintage Ludlum.Security consultant Paul Janson, a retired Consular Ops covert operative, is suddenly thrown back into his former role when he is called upon to rescue Pete Novak, an international businessman, philanthropist and diplomat. Janson's mission eventually goes terribly wrong, and soon he is being targeted for death by the very same people who were once his allies, his former prot&eacute;g&eacute; being the assassin who seeks him out. If he wants to live, and save the man who once saved him, he must unravel a conspiracy that permeates the highest government powers.What makes THE JANSON DIRECTIVE so brilliant is the myriad of detail which gives added color to the storyline. Sometimes the details were a bit to graphic for my taste, but I never once considered putting the book aside, even for a moment. It's true that the dialogue is more \\"electric\\" than Ludlum's previous work, however, the plot is just as complex and technical as any of his international conspiracies. The storyline, written prior to 9/11, is right out of the most recent headlines; a true Ludlum trademark. He always seems to know what will make tomorrow's news before it becomes news. Nevertheless, I am perplexed by the publisher's silence as to the true author of this work. Knowing who to give credit to would certainly satisfy my insatiable curiosity.According to an article (The New York Sun,10/21/2002) which quotes Ludlum's longtime agent, Henry Morrison, the late author started this book during the early months of 2000 and finished it that fall. If true, this would account for the likeness this book has to the Bourne trilogy. However, the same article states that he 'almost\\" finished it. So which is it? I guess we'll never know.Cris Cunningham"},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"The Jansen Directive is the second novel published since Ludlum's death. (With each passing book, one is left to wonder if there are any more finished or nearly finished transcripts in the pipeline or even to what degree the last two works were ghost written, at least in part.) Having read almost all of Ludlum's work, the Jansen Directive certainly felt like \\"a Ludlum.\\" This was a great book....very hard to put down.This book grabs the reader early and does not let go, leading on more than one occasion to fits of yawning in the morning because I had stayed up too late reading the night before. All in all, the Jansen Directive provides all of the action, suspense, frequent plot twists, and unexpected events that Ludlum aficionados have come to love in the conspiracy-thriller genre. This is clearly among Ludlum's best."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"\\"Ludlum's best since his masterpiece The Bourne Identity\\"- Kirkus Reviews. The Janson Directive is a covert one novel. The hero in this novel, Paul Janson is the most unlikely hero, a super assassin. He is a successful entrepreneur and former agent of the United States Covert Ops.A representative from the Liberty Foundation contacts Janson and asks him to rescue the founder of the Liberty Foundation. The founder of the Liberty Foundation is Peter Novak a billionaire and a Nobel Peace Prize winner. Novak is kidnapped by the same terrorist group responsible for Janson's wife's death. Janson agrees to rescue Peter Novak who was personally responsible for saving Janson's life many years ago. Janson finds out that Novak's execution is scheduled to be in a three days. So with only days to work he assembles an elite team of covert operatives from around the world to rescue Novak. Against incredible and overwhelming odds they rescue Novak from an almost impenetrable fortress. On the verge of success a terrible tragedy occurs killing Janson's prot&eacute;g&eacute; and Novak. Janson then goes on a quest to find out who killed his friends and ruined his mission. He goes from city to city only to find people who try to kill him in every city. First Janson believes it must be operatives of the terrorist group seeking revenge for his part in the daring rescue of Novak. Janson soon learns from a would-be assassin that a &quot;beyond salvage&quot; is issued by Janson's former agency and he is targeted for death. His expert instincts kick in, making him an unstoppable opponent for his former agency. Janson uses every resource he has while running from assassins to unfoil the plot to kill him. The rest of the book has many twists and turns and is unpredictable. It is a page-turner, which you can't put down. The plot is amazing and keeps you hooked the whole time and the use of figurative words is amazing and gives you a clear picture of what is happing. I recommend this book to everyone who likes thrillers."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"Robert Ludlum departed from this side of the veil a couple of years ago. He left a variety of manuscripts prior to his death including THE JANSON DIRECTIVE, which was about 90% completed prior to his death, and then was edited by his long time agent, Henry Morrison and his editor, Keith Kahla.Ludlum did not invent the master spy novel, but it is doubtful that the genre would exist in its present form without him. The plots are of a basic theme: take a larger than life hero and put him up against impossible odds with the price of failure being the fate of the free world. One would think that the variations on this theme would wear thin and in the hands of a less-able writer they would, and have. THE JANSON DIRECTIVE, however, is the finest of page-turners.Our hero in this case is Paul Janson, an almost-legendary super-assassin who, weary of the bloodshed and brutality that marked his career, retired from the covert agency where he made his career and hired himself out as an industrial consultant. His retirement abruptly ends, however, when he is contacted by a representative of the Liberty Foundation, a private organization devoted to the cause of peace and democracy throughout the world. It seems that Peter Novak, founder of the Liberty Foundation --- and a man to whom Janson owes his life --- has been kidnapped by the forces of a terrorist known as The Caliph. Worse, Novak has been summarily scheduled for execution within a few days. Janson, at the request of the Liberty Foundation, assembles a crack team of operatives to rescue Novak.The mission, against all odds, proceeds successfully until, within the span of a few moments, everything turns disastrous. In the aftermath, Janson is inexplicably marked for death by operatives at the highest level of the U.S. Government and finds himself on the run, unable to trust those formerly closest to him. And soon Novak finds himself pursued by Jessica Kincaid, Janson's prot&eacute;g&eacute; and an agent of breathtaking ability who knows all of his secrets and his weaknesses. There is a passage dealing intimately with the process of drowning that will leave you gasping for air. Literally every character from Janson to adversaries who pass into and out of the novel in a single paragraph, is interesting. Even the anticipation that all will end well, or reasonably so, by novel's end does not make the journey any less interesting, or compelling.THE JANSON DIRECTIVE continues Ludlum's fine tradition of suspense writ on a global scale, dealing with topics that seem to be eerily prescient of tomorrow's headlines. Ludlum, through his work and the work which he inspired, truly lives on. There is no better epitaph than that.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"Although this book doesn't differ much from Ludlum's other novels, it is still an enjoyable read. The story is actually very similar to The Matarese Circle, minus the Russian spy. It's about a retired American agent for the State Department's Consular Operations, Paul Janson. Retired from espionage and not quite enjoying his new career as a security consultant for private businesses, Janson is summoned by billionare philanthropist Peter Novak's personal assistant. She asks Janson for his help in freeing Novak from Arab kidnappers who have him confined in a palace on the island of Anura. Janson agrees to participate in the operation because of a personal debt he has incurred to Novak for saving his life. He quickly assembles a crack team of operatives to help him in the exfiltration and they set out to rescue the wealthy humanitarian from his captors. What follows is an interesting sequence of events that keeps both Janson and the reader in the dark while providing just enough information to entice the reader to keep reading.Without divulging too much of the book's secrets, the high points include the many action sequences that showcase Janson's ability to think quickly and the occasional flashbacks to his days as the leader of a Navy SEAL counterintelligence team in Vietnam. The reason I say this book is similar to The Matarese Circle is because both protagonists have been disavowed by American Intelligence and both have a price on their head; a price being pursued by teams representing more than one interest. The action that follows Janson trying to elude his assailants, while simultaneously trying to find out more about the odd sequence of events that followed the rescue operation, fills much of the novels pages. Therein lies one of the book's letdowns. Almost the entire middle of the book (approx. 275 pgs) is rather uneventful and dull. The beginning and the end are both filled with revelation after revelation but the middle lacks that same development. The occasionial pursuance of Janson by professional killers is interesting but does not make up for the fruitless trials of Janson to discover more about who is after him and who HE needs to chase. That, coupled with the fact that Janson seems to elude death by mere inches one too many times, is my motivation for docking this book by one star. Still, the clever and elegant plot(which is more powerful than it appears on the surface) is what makes this a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"I used to look so forward to the publication of a new novel by Robert Ludlum and when I saw The Janson Directive on the book shelves that excitement was renewed. However, The Janson Directive is only a parody of prior works.The premise is the same of most of almost every other Ludlum novel - the reluctant hero who is forced to save the world from a super secret government agency or billionaire. At lease in this case it was not Nazi's trying to establish the Fourth Reich. Add in a female heroine, who the hero saved form being raped, and one has a formula that has been successful. The Janson Directive adopts this formula lock, stock and barrel.It would have been a more entertaining book, notwithstanding the predictable nature, if it had been 100 pages shorter. Unlike earlier Ludlum book, the author at times discusses ad nauseam the details of certain of the events so that even the action loses its impact. Ludlum is still better than most other action writers and I am glad that I read the book because it was entertaining. However, it was not one his best."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"I wasn't really expecting a whole lot going into this book, but I was pleasently surprised. A page turner for sure, I was through the book in a couple days and enjoyed it thoroughly. I would recommend this highly, up there with his best work. Whoever finished the book is to be commended as well."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"The story was very creative and unique like most of Ludlum's novels. The action sequences were really good but the reason this didn't at least get a four-star was the exhaustive descriptions. They frequently took away from the pace of the story. During an intense action sequence, there is no need for excessive details. This was a great story that could have been reduced in number of pages."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"this was an excellent thriller, page turner, can't wait for the next one.

Overall, a good read.If you crave adventure stories, you might also tryThe Golden Catch, a thriller/adventure novel where the action unfolds in the stormy Aleutian Islands.Roger Weston, author of The Golden Catch"},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"I have read several of the books written by Robert Ludlum and this one is one of the best.

If you are looking for an exciting, well written book that you cannot put down, this is the one you should buy."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"His myriad of fans know him. They relish his hot chases and around-the-world in 400 pages adventures. In the Janson Directive we have a vintage Ludlum.Paul Janson is a former Covert Operations specialist, now a successful security consultant with no cares in the world. That is until he is summoned on a mission he cannot refuse: He has been employed to extricate Peter Novak from captivity by a terrorist group.He goes on this mission because some years ago, Novak, a billionaire philanthropist, eerily dissimilar to Bill Gates, had negotiated his release as a hostage. His nightmare starts when Novak is killed after he has successfully aided in his escape. Worse still Janson has now been branded as a traitor. The next 500 pages are spent showing us how he attempts to untangle the web he has found himself in.The book is action soaked with the blood of a thousand men felled by the unflinching marksmanship and sangfroid of Janson; violence and betrayal seem the stock-in-trade of these players of hide and seek.I must admit in the previous decade I found Robert Ludlum one of the better masters of intrigue; now that knowledge has been tempered with the realization that Ludlum never outgrew the characters which made his novels popular.Indeed this novel seems a collection of some of his earlier works. We have the man-who-is-not-what-he-claims-to-be, culled from the Sigma Protocol and the Bourne Identity; the puppet master who ostensibly controls global affairs from behind the stage, as in the Matarese Circle.Moreoever, when Janson starts dodging bullets (or would it be bullets dodging him?) with increasing frequency I encountered the cloying feeling which comes with over-indulgence. I must have read it somewhere!In this thriller, rabid fans will be too blind to admit his flaws, expectant newcomers will be too enamored of his legend, while disinterested readers will admit that the Janson Directive displays that Ludlum is not as great as claimed to be."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"It seems that Robert Ludlum's best work has been left for publication after his death. This is a classic Ludlum thriller, with all the usual elements: a hero caught in a game where the rules are unknown to him, a beautiful woman with whom he eventually bonds, an evil villain intent on taking over the work, and also the usual travelogue of many and varied scenic cities and places around the world. Ludlum's heros are always like James Bond: you know that they will eventually surmount the challenges around them and triumph, but you're with them every step of the way. So its hackneyed, but we true Ludlum fans love it! I can only hope that there are more of these works around somewhere, so that we won't have to go into \\"Ludlum Withdrawal\\"!"},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"I know, I know ... but 'he' hasn't written this tightly, this edge-of-the-seat since the Bourne trilogy.

I recall that the book started far better than it finished.On the other hand, mindless pap has its place. (Recommend putting this book there.)"},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"Very disappointing after some of the fine work Ludlum has done. It reads like a poor James Bond with the hero able to always succeed at every impossible task and unbelievable bad guys who always screw up.

It's more like a parody of Ludlum."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"Although I have enjoyed Robert Ludlum in the past (Bourne Identity, among others) this is the most clich&eacute;-ridden piece of novelistic junk food I have ever had the displeasure to read -- well, partly read, since I couldn't even finish it.

I highly recommend that you do not bother to read this book: if you want a thriller, try Echo Park by Michael Connelly or Lost by Michael Robotham."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"Typical Ludlum....steroetype characters, expected unexpectedness, predictable unpredictability. Still a good fun read if you don't feel the need to think too hard.There is a directly plagiarized line from the movie Pulp Fiction which just sounds incredibly out of place. It involves a pair of pliers and a blowtorch!There are fewer \\"Dan Brown\\" type narrative errors than in most thrillers of this size, although a Corvette's bodywork is described as being made of steel at one point. Really?It would make a good movie. I think that was the idea when it was written."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"this book is legend Ludlum."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"The suspense of this novel is overpowered by the minutia. Escrutiatingly detailed descriptions of every gadget our hero uses makes one forget Janson has a directive and I, quite truthfully, found myself not cheering for him to win, but simply to get to the end of a painful book. We know Robert Ludlum knows his stuff, but in this instance, he sounds more like an encyclopedia than a novelist."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"What's to say!

The nightmares had faded as well though he still mourned his deceased pregnant wife Helene. Her death at the hands of terrorists occurred five years ago and was the impetus for his leaving Consular Operations, a covert spy unit within the State Department.The five years have been financially rewarding, as Janson is now a corporate security consultant. The company is his and his reputation allows him to be very selective about his clients. His calm and very orderly life is shattered when, while sitting in a VIP lounge at Chicago's O'Hare Airport, he hears an old operational alias of his being paged. What initially appears to be coincidence quickly turns into an urgent plea for help from Marta Lange on behalf of Peter Novak.Peter Novak is a Billionaire and philanthropist who oversees the Liberty Foundation. Winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Novak is a visionary who has achieved peaceful settlements in some of the most war torn places in the world. While brokering a peace agreement, he was kidnapped by Kanga rebels led by the world-renowned terrorist known as Caliph. They have announced that Novak is to be executed for various crimes within days.Not only does Janson owe his life to Novak because of a past situation, the very group responsible for killing Helene in a terrorist bomb attack has grabbed Novak. A debt of honor must be paid and Janson quickly assembles a team consisting of some of the most skilled operatives he has worked with in the past. For various stated political reasons, the United States government won't help and it is up to Janson, his four-member team and the resources of the Liberty Foundation to rescue Novak. But things begin to go very wrong from the start of the operation and Janson, feeling his age as well as his old skills returning, becomes aware that he is being used by forces unknown for unknown purposes. Compromised and suspected by his agents of his own government he thought were friends and allies, Janson finds himself soon on another rescue mission. In this case to save his own life and clear his name.It is extremely difficult to criticize a novel by a novelist now deceased. This novel has all the usual Ludlum elements in that it features complex storylines, plots within plots, rogue elements of the United States government, honor and debts to be repaid as well as a globe trotting spy cast adrift. But it misses the human touch that made some of his work so incredibly good.Paul Janson is a complex character full of deep emotion and pain according to the novel. And while that idea is constantly reinforced throughout the work, the novel never makes the visceral connection with the reader. There is an emotional detachment to the work, which is difficult to describe, that distances the novel from the reader and renders the repeated emotional references meaningless.Despite the usual Ludlum elements as noted above, this lack of human connection in the work makes this an average read at best and disappointing at worst. For long time Ludlum fans with a discerning eye, this novel does not reflect the grand master at his best. Rumor has it that at least one more and possibly as many as three more are in the publishing pipeline. One can hope that one of those may reflect the grand master at his writing best."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"I highly recommend this book without any reservations! Having read or listened to most of the books he had written, this book is in the top tier. It is a good believable read and the protaganist is well thought out. The hero, if you will, is Paul Janson, a less than perfect human being, just like the rest of us. He has a lot of unresolved issues about his past, Vietnam and his government work. Another scarred survivor of the Vietnam War who was good at what he did, almost too good for his own liking. The story moves along very well and has very believable, well developed characters. Ludlum is one of my favorite adventure writers, and I have listened to this book twice this year. If you like a good adventure yarn with ironic twists and turns throughout the story, you would do well to read or listen to this book."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"Whoever wrote this has done a good job. I was a bit concerned at first that it was almost a 'by the numbers' Ludlum story: Intelligence expert/ everyone trying to kill him / a secret organisation / everyone he talks to gets killed and so on. At one stage the lead character breaks into a secret HQ set in the middle of no-where and I thought I was re-reading an old book by mistake, but....There are enough tweaks and diversions to retain the Ludlum tradition but also bring in some new elements and the writing is good and the story works well.There was also a message in here about how much of the world regards America which I thought was handled in an interesting and thought provoking way.Enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"I received this book as a Christmas gift and was surprised to see it as I remembered that the author had died a year or so ago.Whether this was a completed and unpublished transcript or a partially completed transcript that was finished by an unnamed ghost is irrelevant.

Those that are Ludlum fans may enjoy it as a last hurrah, I suppose, but I was glad to finish it so that I could start a more enjoyable book."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"Paul Michael superbly narrates this story of Peter Novak, a billionaire committed to global democracy who faces a determined terrorist/executioner.

Paul Janson is a (more) realistic superhero, and the character development of him is great.

I encourage any fan of Clancy to try Ludlum as well."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"Mr. Tucker's review encapsulated my opinions very well. I also agree there there are other writers at work in this novel. First, the trade name for the neuroparalytic that was used on the limo driver was used instead of the generic which he has always used in the past. In addition, there are extraneous ad nauseum descriptions of places, people, etc. that far exceed the detail he typically provided in previous novels. Either that, or he he made it more interesting and brief. His prior novels impressed me as story driven but also managed to provide sufficient detail to keep the reality there and it was always obvious he did his research about events and places in his novels. The details provided in this novel are incredibly well done, but to an extent that I never noticed before. Especially information related to medical information. (I'm an RN, so I was well impressed). I question the use of a cholinergic to decrease sweating since it in fact increases secretions. I don't care, however, I'll take Ludlam anyway I can get him. Even if he left summaries that someone else is filling in, I can live with that. It's just taking me a little longer to force myself to read through all the unnecessary detail provided in this story. I find myself skipping paragraphs that have nothing to do with the story itself just to get to the real story. I like the way there are some flashbacks about Jansen provided about his Vietnam experience as a POW. As horrifying as they are, these things in fact happened. Not enough is said about what vietnam vets suffered whether they were POW's or not. Thanks for the great review Mr. Anderson."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"Most reviews have said what I would have had I been first. If Ludlum in fact wrote 90%, I feel I could pick out the other 10%. Some lines are plain shlock, but overall, this is good Ludlum if you don't get hung up on the lines that don't ring true (certain dialogue). There are also too many incidents where someone happens to be in the right place at the right time. I can't even meet my wife when we plan the time and place. Suspend your disbelief and go along for the ride.

When a book is this entertaining who cares? Isn't it strange that to date, some of Ludlums best work has been published posthumously? (THE PROMETHEUS DECEPTION & THE SIGMA PROTOCOL). Anything's preferable to another of those lousy Covert One novels (Gayle Lynds is a very good writer, but why does she waste her time with that third rate drivel?)The story centres around Paul Janson, a retired CIA man and now a much wanted and selective security guru after his wife is murdered by one of his nemeses. Predictably Janson finds himself reluctantly returning to the field after powerful Hungarian immigrant Peter Novak, a man who uses his power and wealth to give war torn and Third World countries a shot at democracy, has been kidnapped by terrorists and will be executed unless Janson and his hand-picked team of experts locate and rescue him in time. But the mission goes terribly wrong and Janson finds himself a fugitive on the run from his superiors and his own unit. And that is just the tip of the iceberg....Admittedly, there are long, rambling passages that readers will skim over to get to the suspense, and the story takes a while to take flight, but once THE JANSON DIRECTIVE gets going theres just no letup. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"While it's probably not a surprise that Ludlum didn't write this book (at least not in its entirety), The Janson Directive is a fast-paced international thriller that -- in typical Ludlum fashion --will keep you turning the pages until the wee hours of the morning. It's very fast-paced and loaded with action and suspense. Further, based on writing style and characterization, &quot;this&quot; Ludlum often surpasses the &quot;real&quot; Ludlum. The Janson Directive is a big book (547 pages) and lots of fun to read (although I think it might have been even better if it been 50-100 pages shorter,which kept me from giving it a 5-star rating). Hopefully, there will be more books by &quot;this&quot; Ludlum.

It was hard to put it down. The person that put this story together had or has a fantastic imagination. There were two surprises I did not see coming. The clues were there but I was blind sided. You have to admire the person that could think this story through and put it on paper.Robert Ludlum has to be a master of the English language. I don't think I have ever read a book that had so many words I have never seen before. Some examples: gestalt, menhaden, cudgel, ersatz, foppish. The list goes on and on. When I had a chance to read I did not have access to a dictionary. Yet I enjoyed the book.Paul Janson, the hero of this book, is one of those larger than life type of guys. He is more than any one man can be, kind of a James Bond without the girls."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"Ignorant or not, I'd never heard of Ludlum until I'd seen the Bourne Identity in theater. I was looking for a book to read a month ago and my wife had already read The Janson Directive, so I gave it ago. Well, I thought it was quite excellent, and I'm now a Ludlum fan. Too bad he won't be writing anymore books.Ludlum is a solid writer and his storytelling is competent. Something I particularly liked about this book was Ludlum's avoidance of going from scene to scene. By this I mean, when you're at the high point of a part in a book and the chapter ends with a gun at somebody's head and then the author thinks it would be a good time to go to a different line in the story and you get to read some dialogue between a couple of lovers, well that's very annoying. Ludlum doesn't do that. The book kept me interested from page to page, and my main complaint was that the book was not in fact longer. I hate finishing a great book!"},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"I believe one of the problems today is the lack of ethics by publishers. I do not believe this book was written by the late Mr. Ludlum and the lack of disclosure of this fact by the publishers is apalling.Why can't we have honesty here? Writen by him and another? I could take that. Written by someone based upon an idea by Mr. L.? I could handle that too, but this current trend of trying to dupe reading audiences out there is horrible.We have had on the bookshelves the last five years, suspected works suposedly written by Lawrence Sanders, Harold Robbins and Mr. Ludlum. What is next, a \\"new\\" tale of youth written by Ernest Hemingway & F. Scott Fitzgerald.So many people like this book and are reading it and I think that is great. Why, then can we not have honesty from these publishers?I hope you all enjoy the book, truly I do. I will not because I have standards. Pouring a cheap wine into an expensive wine's bottle and selling it is wrong for your local grocer to do, why put up with that same behavior from a publisher?"},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"This book, like other I have read that were issued after the death of Ludlum do not do him justice. I'm surprised his estate would have agreed to using his name on these titles. While his books were over the top and at times stretched your imagination, this book does this at every turn. Additionally, the female character is totally unbelievable. I had a hard time completing this book."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"I enjoy this book the twist and turns it took made it very enjoyable to read.

I recommend reading this for an entering action adventure mystery."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"A Robert Ludlum classic. Full of excitement and the story is engaging. A little amazing how the main character is always able to get out of tight situations but a fun read never the less."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"the good: the action is frequent and fun. The book, overall, doesn't bog down too much. It's not overly verbosethe bad: as others pointed out, the characters are VERY 'cookie cutter', even the situations and environmenst the characters are put in are cookie cutter.The lead character , Janson is like James Bond + Jason Bourne with an identity crisis. I almost think that this story would have been better served as a plot for a Splinter Cell game, though Sam Fisher is more interesting than Janson.So is it worth it? Well, yes if you want a low maintenance read to pass the time, perhaps on a beach or airplane.But as I said, it's almost as if the book was written in the hopes of making a screenplay out of it. The cookie cutter characters that hollywood loves to put in its movies are ripe for the taking in this one."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"This was my first foray into fiction. I highly recommend this book if you are starting into fiction.

You should definitely check this out if you're a Ludlum fan."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"I can't believe how great this book is, it's even better than his last living works like Apocalypse and Scorpio. Although elements of the story are very timely, I can only guess this was slightly modified from a rough draft Ludlum created back at the peak of his brilliance with the Bourne books, Parsifal, Icarus, Aquitaine. Outstanding book, furious page-turner."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"I have been an on and off fan of Ludlum's for many years. The Janson Directive is one of Ludlum's best. Not since The Bourne Identity has the reader had such an honest human character, one with faults and weaknesses as well as sometimes impossible strengths. The story take the reader across the globe, Asia to Europe to the U.S. The storyline appears simple at first, but develops well into a true spy mystery. A very good book, especially considering its post-cold war subjects. My only complaint would be that the main character, Janson, is just a bit too lucky in all of his actions -- but that's a fault of many of Ludlum's characters."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"See book description above.I was rather apprehensive when I purchased this book, but in hindsight, it was the best purchase I've made in years (as far as novels go). As far as international thrillers go this is by far the best one that carries the Ludlum name. It is truly non-stop action, and along with that you get highly intelligent dialogue and story telling. It seems to be just a step above the normal Ludlum novel.Keith Kahla was the senior editor that supposedly put this novel together. The publisher says about three quarters of the book was finished when Ludlum passed away.A truly wonderful work of suspense. I wonder if there's a chance we might see Janson and Kincaid again. That I would surely like to see.HIGHLY Recommended."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"This is my first Ludlum novel, although it is apparently \\"Ludlum by proxy.\\"The book holds your interest, and while the plot itself is nothing ingeniously new or surprising, the tale moves along nicely with plenty of action and character interaction.In numerous (if relatively brief) instances, the writer shows a doting fascination with the details of death, injury, and torture. These emphases are expressed in flavors both morbid and clinical. It can be a bit sickening, even disturbing at times; yet these kinds of things are also notorious for being interesting. Quentin Tarantino would probably have fun with parts of this book.There is also one dangling plot thread that is left completely unresolved: that is, the fate of Angus Fielding. The reader must rely on their own imagination to figure that one out. The later segment with Fielding was put in as a sort of side-show, and to further establish the nastiness of the story's main antagonist (whose villainy really needed no further defining by this point). But since the writer(s) and editor(s) neglected to provide closure on this point, Fielding's second appearance should have been left out altogether. It really is a glaringly obvious omission. Ludlum, I am sure, would never have left it up in the air like that, were he alive to finish this book.On a nitpicky note, there are a few incidences where the writer's use of arcane or pretentious vocabulary can be a little annoying. For instance, when I see a word like \\"munificence\\" repeated within 40 or 50 pages of itself, I almost have to laugh out loud. And surely, the mainstream reader can be spared words such as \\"bedizened.\\"But all in all, this is a richly crafted book. It plays out nicely."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"Robert Ludlum's latest thriller is par for the course - an amusing diversion that entertains while you read but is pretty forgettable after you're done. Even now, a mere week after reading it, I find it hard to recall exactly what it was about.Ah yes, now I remember: An ex-spy named Janson is recruited to save the life of a philanthropic billionaire who is being held by a terrorist. The rescue almost goes okay, but then goes really wrong and Janson is suddenly a fugitive. Janson - like all Ludlum heroes, haunted by the death of a relative, in this case his wife - is caught between the government and the bad guys, and often has trouble figuring out which is which.At first, this one seems like an atypical Ludlum novel. The terrorist who Janson is up against seems strictly minor league and the global conspiracy that is standard Ludlum is nowhere to be seen. Eventually, such a conspiracy does appear, but while it is a clever enough idea, the main villain - in certain ways obvious from the get-go - has achieved his power in a completely ludicrous way. The sheer dumbness of the villain's rise to power - even though recognized as such by Janson - hurts the plausiblity and quality of the book.But if this is not a great book, it is still the type of entertainment that Ludlum typically delivers. For those familiar with Ludlum, there will be little disappointment here, and even for those unfamiliar with him, this will not be a bad read. While I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this book, I wouldn't actively steer anyone away from it either."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"The &quot;Spider Writer&quot; At His Best---I have had the pleasure of reading every one of Mr.Ludlum's books, and regardless of who actually wrote this book under his name, this piece of literature is simply top shelf. Fast paced, great character building, complex story telling...it has it all. If not for the sheer complexity, this book would make for a great motion picture, (but I am sure Hollywood would goof it up). I simply can't say enough positives about this fantastic read."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"As Anderson and another reviewer have already commented, this Ludlum novel did have distracting passages that almost read like essays, and since we don't know where Ludlum left off before he died and someone else took over for him, I would like to suggest another possibility to this departure from his usual treatment. Authors who want to lend authenticity to their stories do far more research than they can actually use in a story. Often, in the first draft, they include everything -- its called overwriting -- until they are ready to revise. And then they edit back unwieldy descriptions in favor of keeping the story and pace moving forward. Ludlum may have died before he could do this, but in leaving his research in, the editor has left us with another Ludlum legacy.If we were to separate these passages from the main story line, we would have an extraordinary thesis on today's terrorists--he described their warped mindset--what motivates them, their history, their homelands, their grievances, their hopes and dreams. Ludlum provides needed insight into today's enemy, and that's always been his greatest power--his books have not only thrilled us, they have educated us about so many things--government structures we never experience, about people we never meet in our daily lives, and now at the end, he helps us see America the way terrorists see us--from the oppressed to those deluded with power, whether on the side of the enemy or within our own ranks of government and commerce. He has created characters we want to meet again, and for his last work, what a memory to leave with us if that is not the case. Paul Janson and Jessica Kincaid--today's hero and heroine--the kind our world needs in a time when trust is threatened.Ludlum did not disappoint his fans. This is an amazing book that reveals nothing until the last chapter and even then the suspense does not let up until the last page. If Ludlum has succeeded in training a few authors to complete outlines of novels he created before he died, we can only welcome their continuing contributions in his memory, and more power to their own works, but it would be nice to give these writers the recognition they so richly deserve. On that, I agree whole heartedly with a few other reviewers here."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"Good storyline. Likable characters. Lots of plot twists. This was a fun read and it's hard to put down one you start."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"I have read all of Robert Ludlums books. The Janson Directive does not read like his other books. It is as if someone else wrote this book and put Ludlums name on it. I found the story dull and very detailed."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"If this wasn't written by Robert Ludlum, I'd be surprised. It's a great book in true Ludlum style. If you enjoyed reading the Bourne series, then this book is one you must read."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"This is one of the best of the Ludlum branded thrillers. An exciting plot that keeps you guessing until the end.I listened to the 18 disc unabridged audio CDs. The story came alive. One complaint I have with the CDs: if I arrived at a destination and stopped on one of the last tracks, the CD tended to eject with a Bad Disc error the next time I started the car. This made it difficult to find my place after I reloaded the CD.Like all of Ludlum's novels, this was longer than it needed to be-perhaps I should have gone with the abridged version.Highly recommended for both thriller fans and Ludlum fans."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"I read the Bourne Identity awhile ago and enjoyed it, this book cemented my fandom for Robert Ludlum. While I only gave this novel 3 out of 5 stars, there are reasons.This is a taut thriller that grabbed and held on to my interest for the first 400 or so pages, then it began to wane. At this point I did a little research, this novel was not finished by Ludlum, he passed away in 2001 and this was the first of his books to be \\"Ghost Finished\\", I'll chalk up the somewhat uninspired ending to the ghost writer.More about the book. It is very \\"running man\\" The protagonist, Janson, is a sort of super spook, think Jason Bourne without all the memory loss, who is given a mission to save a billionaire philanthropist devoted to world peace. Janson assembles a crack team who go in to a impossible mission and succeed, only to have it all unravel at the end. Then Janson is blamed for the mistake and he traipses all over the world hunting down clues until he finds the ultimate answer, a conspiracy that would take down the entire free world. It is very well written and the characters are enjoyable, my favorite is the Russian money launderer, too bad Ludlum cannot give these characters any more adventures."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"THE SETUPPhilantropist Peter Knovac is kidnaped by rebels on the island of Anura (near Ceylon), and is scheduled to be publicly executed. Knovac's \\"Liberty Foundation\\" hires Paul Janson (a former special forces soldier, later Consular Ops operative, now working as an industrial security consultant) to rescue Knovac. Janson assembles a team and succeeds, but the plane Knovac and the team leave in is blown up, leaving Janson the only survivor. Subsequently, Janson discovers that he has been framed for the murder of Knovac.The plot is frequently interrupted with flashbacks to Vietnam, where Janson was captured by the North Vietnamese, having been betrayed by his psycopathic mentor and commanding officier, Alan Dimerest. Upon his escape he sees to it that Dimerest is executed for various war crimes. While this at first this backstory seems to just be adding color, it turns out to be a key component of the plot.VERDICT\\"The Janson Directive\\" is an extraordinarily well-written thriller. One of those thrillers which grabs you by the throat and won't let go until the last page. The book is well paced, with \\"rest spots\\" between the frantic scenes.As in all books of this genre, the plot is a bit contrived, there are implausibilities, and a few technical errors--but I gladly overlook them all.CAUTIONThe tracts on disk 6 and 7 of the original audioversion are jumbled--badly out of order. Presumably this has been fixed, but I would not buy a copy without assurance that disk 6 and 7 are updated, or full return privileges."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"If Ludlum is your thing, you'll probably enjoy this one on the plane, train or beach. Only my second read of this author, and I know now that watching movies with Matt Damon chase around amid high technology is a better investment. This plot plods along with a protagonist/antagonist plotline. Our hero Paul Jansen,an ex-elite Navy SEAL carrying psychological baggage from Vietnam, is hired by a mysterious organization to save an enigma -- world philanthropist Peter Novak from the clutches of evil. But who is Peter Novak? And who is pulling the strings? And how will the world be affected?It doesn't matter, the reader keeps turning pages to get to the resolution. Assassins galore, a sexy sniper, MacGyver-like techno-brilliance, impenetrable fortresses, Jihad promoters, torture chambers, in short all the accoutrements of classic spy versus spy are here. Enjoy it, Ludlum fans."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"This was my first Robert Ludlum novel and probably not my last. I liked the characters Paul Janson and Jessica Kincaid and I hope there are more stories on their exciting lives. The rating of three that I gave this is all for the story line, action and suspense. I found myself skim reading a lot especially in the middle when Ludlum put to much description of the surroundings in as filler; this really slowed the action for awhile. This story really picks up at the end though with a lot of action and excitment.If you like international intrique and world politics mixed with spies and terrorists,you'll like this one."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"it still is very entertaining. The one and only fault that I could find is that the book contained run on which is not characteristic of Ludlum's writing. So I zipped through those parts but they were usually short. An example is how a timed bomb works. Just give me the bottom line and I am happy. All the intricate detail is way above my pay grade.Now lets put that aside and talk about the enjoyable book. First of all this book contains quite a few twists and turns so buckle up and you will be in for a ride. Our hero, Paul Janson, is a retired operative who is lulled back for a job. A philantropist Peter Novak is kidnapped by rebels from a small country which is close to Sri Lanka. He is to be a mediate between the goverment and the rebels but instead he is captured. Novak's foundation hires Janson to rescue him but alas, everything goes wrong and Novak and Janson's men do not make it. Next thing you know is that his own agency and goverment and guns for hire are after him. It is a long chase for him to get away from the people who are after him and also to find out who and why he is being hunted.Along the way one of the people who tries to kill him, Jessica Kincaid, eventually becomes an ally and helps to find out what is actually going on. They keep on running into stone walls and sharp turns. As we go along we meet quite an interesting collection of indiviuals with the best being the Russian, Grigori Berman, who since the fall of the Soviet Union has been trying to an Englishman. The way he goes about it is a hoot.All in all the book is enjoyable from the first to the last page with no stops in between. It may not have been all Ludlum's work but it still comes out as very enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"20 odd years ago, when all I was reading was SCI-FI and fantasy, my mom insisted I read Ludlum's Bourne Identity. I remember really enjoying it and read several others of his through the years. Looked forward to and enjoyed the movies, but alas the Janson Directive, while fasted paced, offered me nothing new. Maybe it was the two recent movies with the agency's secret program always chasing someone, maybe those intervening 20 odd years of thrillers, suspense and techno thrillers made me an informed consumer.... Close but no cigar. Too many expected and predictable almost caught \`yas / barely get-a-ways / one-ups-manships between the master vs. the disciple. I think today's readers have seen more than their fair share of someone being tracked by their best pupil or for that mater dusting off some ancient Obi-won to dispatch their star gone rogue to enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"The late Robert Ludlum has put out a pretty good book, with strong characters and a story full of suspense. I would not give the plot away, though there is plenty of twist and turns, as the main character finds as he seeks the truth. A philanthropist who isn't everything he's made out to be, deception, a nefarious character called the Caliph, and more. Would make a nifty movie."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"Peter Novak, multibillionaire philanthropist, Nobel peace prize winner and head of the Liberty Foundation has been kidnapped while trying to broker a peace settlement on the Indian Ocean island of Anura. A terrorist leader there known as the Caliph has refused ransom and plans to execute Novak. Using it's vast resources the Liberty Foundation reaches out to former top Consular Operations specialist Paul Janson.Janson, now a corporate security specialist, was at one time the top covert operative in his agency. Janson was a resourceful killing machine who had spent 18 months as a POW in Vietnam before escaping. Top executives from Liberty implore Janson to rescue Novak. Janson reluctantly assembles a top notch 5 man team to extract Novak from his fortress-like prison on Anura.In the midst of this daring raid Janson becomes aware that there is some convoluted government plot behind this abduction. He learns of some secretive information that turns him from the hunter to the hunted. Janson's own government has designated him as a rogue agent marked for assasination. Janson now must use all his elaborate training to avoid the Consular Operations teams sent out to eliminate him.Ludlum's last offering before his unfortunate demise represents a nice effort in the action and adventure genre he made so popular."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"Ive only got one complaint to make and that is the kind of words this guy chucks in his book. I was almost positive he had a theasaurus next to him when he was writting it(if he did write it of course). Fair enough hes clever and has a large vocabulary and if u understand the words u would get a better understanding.Anyways, no matter all the words i didn't understand(although i had a dictionary next to me most of the time) i thouroghly enjoyed this book all the way through(especially when i learnt to ignore the words and go with the flow), it was full of action confusion and i liked the build up of suspense.Ludlums ideas of interrogation, planning, confusion and wit are really wat makes this book great to read.I would highly reccommend this book to anyone who enjoys a suspensful thriller or even a general all-round reader. Im only 15 so maybe you would understand the vocabulary better, but i look at it in a positive way, after reading this i have a whole bunch of new words logged into my memory."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"I have read many books by this auther in years passed.

Like many other fans of Mr. Ludlum his death marked a dark day for me. I considered him one of the premier writers of this century. While this book is far from being the author's best it is still an entertaining and action packed book with plenty of spins and surprises. Like all of his books the book is ten times better than the movie. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"Having read this book, and all of Lee Child's books, it appears clear to me that Lee Child is the ghost writer. Same crisp style, same use of words, same expertise with plot twists."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"After reading numerous Ludlum novels I thought I had reached a point where I just couldn't take it anymore. You can only take so many one word sentences, italics, exclamation points, and wasted pages of a conversation happening on the other side of the world.That has all changed with Janson Directive. This was a very well written book. It seemed to have more action than the average Ludlum and one hell of a main character, Paul Janson. The sniper scene reads like Clancy with all the intricate details. It's good to read a book by Ludlum that employs more of today's technology. For instance in the Bourne Identity, Jason is constantly running for pay phones. Now our hero Janson simply goes online to CNN.com to get his information.Non Ludlum readers beware, even though there is a good amount of action that moves the story along, it is still a long one. 700 pages paperback!!!I really liked it. It might be better than my all time Ludlum fave, The Matarese Circle. It's too bad Janson couldn't have had a few novels dedicated to his days with the DIA or his time on his new job with his new partner (which you have to read the epilogue to see what I mean).Janson vs Bourne. I'd take Janson."},{"Title":"The Janson Directive","review":"As a posthumous release, I was thrilled to have yet another Ludlum novel to curl up with and enjoy. But, although the plot and its development were quite good, I found some of the style elements of this book rather annoying. For example, the numerous paragraphs filled with questions to lead the reader on (What will he do?, Where to go now?). This shows a certain limitation in the writing style I don't remember seeing much in previous novels. Perhaps these were part of the 10% not written by the author himself...Also disrupting were the excessive missing words, word order inversions and typos found in the edition I read (the hardcover first edition by St. Martin's Press). This made it look like a rush order to bring this book to the public, but it also shows a certain lack of concern for quality. I would recommend waiting for a second edition to be published if you are also bothered by such details.However, the plot is interesting and I found myself immersed in Ludlum's world of espionage and intrigue once again. Although a small part of the story line is quite predictable, the author manages to through in enough spins to keep the reader guessing and turning the pages.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Sovereignty Matters: Locations of Contestation and Possibility in Indigenous Struggles for Self-Determination (Contemporary Indigenous Issues)","review":"Evo Morales is elected the first Ingigenous president of Bolivia and the Indigenous people's movement of Mexico is on the march. Around the world activists and movement intellectuals have been making history by moving Indigenous peoples' struggles to the forefront of grass-roots politics. Accompanying these developments has been a lively and challenging discussion about Sovereignty in relationship to the Nationstate, global capital, cultural production, feminism and sexuality, eco-politics and so on. English-speaking activists and movement intellectuals can now access the currents of those discussions thanks to this anthology. Bringing together writings from North America, New Zealand/Aotearoa, Puerto Rico. Samoa, etc, this book is an excellent crash course in the terms of the debates around Sovereignty. Given the recent currency Sovereignty has received thanks to struggles in Latin America as well as recent writings by philosophers like Virno, Negri and Balibar, here's a book that offers an approach to Sovereignty from the perspective of Indigenous activists and scholars themselves. This book couldn't have come at a better time!"},{"Title":"A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms","review":"The problem that I have with this book is that often the words that it defines tells me to go look up another fine. That would be fine, except that I go to the word it said to look up and discover that I either have to look up another word. This book is not helpful in that respect, and given that a lot of PCs run Windows, it doesn't really make sense to release a hypertext version for the Mac but not one for Windows. So the Windows users are stuck with a book that really isn't that good."},{"Title":"A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms","review":"Over the Christmas holidays, I traveled back east to visit my parents. I carried Lanham's &quot;A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms.&quot; One night my mom and I sat up talking about everything from Picasso to metaphysics and at some point we got to talking about Shakespeare. I tried to explain to her why Shakespeare is rhetorically reveered, and at one point I climbed downstairs to the guest room and retrieved Lanham's book. She -- like most of us -- hears the word &quot;rhetoric&quot; and thinks of politicians and empty promises, or phrasing so complicated as to render simple fact obscure.I think the first word in &quot;Handlist&quot; we got a chuckle over was &quot;chiasmus&quot; and some of the examples like &quot;It's not whether grapenuts are good enough for you, but whether you're good enough for grapenuts!&quot; And the famous &quot;When the going gets tough, the tough get going.&quot; The one that gave her the best chuckle though was an editor's advice to a young writer &quot;You're writing is both original and interesting; unfortunately the part that's original is not interesting and the part that is interesting is not original.&quot;The great thing about this book is that it gives name to a great many devices we already use in everyday speech, and for a writer this information is invaluable.

Each name is individually entered, but only the main name is defined. Each of the lesser names simply has cross references. The merely-cross-referenced names outnumber the actually-defined names by about 3 to 1. The actually-defined names should have been set in a bolder type than the merely-cross-referenced names.Chapter 2 consists of an excellent review of the divisions of rhetoric. Read Chapter 2 first.Chapter 3 takes the more common rhetorical devices and catalogs them by type, giving brief definitions. It catalogs only one name for each device, and is much more user friendly than Chapter 1. Read Chapter 3 second.My suggestion for the third edition: Reorder the chapters.

The title is both perfect and a little misleading: yes, it's a handlist, but that gives little sense of the breadth and scholarship of Lanham's work. Yes, you'll find incredibly useful definitions of the most recondite, as well as the most everyday, tropes and schemes. But embedded within his exposition Lanham gives us an argument for rhetoric: its complexity, historical richness, and value. Lanham's touch is very personal, offering a collection of definitions that are at once eclectic and definitive. If you need to buy one book on rhetoric, this should be it. If it intrigues you as much as it did me, follow up with Lanham's _The Electronic Word: Democracy, Technology, and the Arts_. There you'll see the very practical implications of the study of rhetoric framed through historical and theoretical debates.

Be warned, though, some explanations get a bit erudite."},{"Title":"A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms","review":"I had high hopes for this well-established entry in the strikingly limited field of guides to rhetorical terms. I am disappointed on several counts. Firstly, the total number of Latin terms is disproportionate to the definitions and examples on offer. On any given page approximately half the entries are uninformative redirects that pair different spellings of the same word--e.g., \\"Mezozeugma - Mesozeugma\\" I understand that the need to account for variant spellings in the book's source materials necessitates some redundancy, but for most users this type of entry is a waste of space. Second, and more serious, is the lack of consistency or precision in the way terms are defined. Take \\"prolepsis,\\" a term one would expect to occupy the core mission of such a book. Lanham has \\"foreseeing and forestalling objections in various ways\\" as primary, and \\"Propounder. A general statement is amplified by dividing it into parts.\\" followed by a block quote from Gilbert and Sullivan's Patience describing the recipe for a Heavy Dragoon. Where is \\"the representation or assumption of a future act or development as if presently existing or accomplished\\"--Merriam-Webster sense \\"a\\" never mind \\"the application of an adjective to a noun in anticipation of the result of the action for the verb\\"--Merriam-Webster sense \\"b\\"? And what has \\"Propounder\\" got to do with it? In typical fashion, the entry goes on to assimilate \\"prolepsis\\" to \\"procatalepsis\\" and invoke \\"Lewis and Short\\" and Quintilian without once supplying either of the top two relevant rhetorical meanings. Finally, there is a persistently intrusive first-person aspect to the presentation that further undermines the volume's credibility. There are many students and teachers out there for whom a reliable and informative guide to rhetorical terms would be of use.

Francis chafes at the restrictions the crown puts to the press, and his outspokenness often gets him in trouble (actually, he ends up in jail for a stint because of it). The other two main characters in the book are exiled Frenchwoman Gabrielle de Salle (who Frank is head over heels in love with) and *Riding Bobby*, Sir Robert Wilson, a highly respected soldier despite his frequent tangles with his superiors. Frank signs on as a war correspondent and follow Sir Robert during the Peninsular wars, and again to Russia during Napoleon's Russian campaign and retreat - plus he's got his beloved Gabrielle to save.I've been putting off writing a full review on this one for about two weeks and I've realized it's not going to happen, I've got writer's block and this is one of those books that is too difficult to properly review (plus this is cutting into my reading time). I did enjoy this, although it was one of those books I could put down and pick it up again when the mood struck me, so it's not a page turner. I liked using Frank's career as a newsman to give the reader a different look at historical events, especially with the battles in the Peninsula campaign - hard to explain but it's a different way for the reader to observe the battles. If you are new to this period of history, I wouldn't recommend this book as the one to get you started, but worth while for those more familiar with Napoleon's Peninsula and Russian campaigns."},{"Title":"Ride with Me","review":"Thomas Costain is always a great read! Histoical Fiction but very closeto the way it really could have been."},{"Title":"The Spanish Civil War (Harper Colophon Books)","review":"This book is a 1000+ page-turner. When I picked it up, I knew nothing about the Spanish Civil War. This book definitely remedied that. Hugh Thomas begins shortly before the outbreak of the war and tells the story through to its completion (essentially 1936-1939). It is somewhat long, but the story itself is so compelling and Thomas' writing so good that it sucked me in and moved along nicely.I have only a couple of gripes. First, if someone wants a short introduction, this may not be the book. I am sure there are other titles out there that will give you the basic facts in less time. As I said, however, reading the book was entertaining enough that I did not mind at all. As an example of an interesting factoid that emerges from this book, it seems that a substantial portion of the treasure from America that Spain won in the 16th century was given to the Soviets for safe-keeping. It is still there.Second, while the book is strong on narrative, it is a little bit weak in analysis. What is especially lacking is an understanding of the factors that led to the outbreak of war in the first place. The books starts with a short chapter describing Spain in the early 20th century and plunges directly into the events leading up to the war. While the suspense before the outbreak of the war is palpable, the basic question of why a country would degenerate into civil war is hardly touched. In fairness to the author, he may have deliberately chosen to focus on the war itself rather than its causes. On the other hand, the discussion about why the Nationalists defeated the Republicans is fairly good. Two factors stand out. First, the Republicans were crippled by in-fighting amongst the factions, a fact that is admirably discussed. Second, the Nationalists received substantial help from abroad.Author background: I am not a historian, but have read a handful of books on Spanish history."},{"Title":"The Spanish Civil War (Harper Colophon Books)","review":"This 1994 edition (a 2nd or 3rd revision of the first edition put out c. 1980 I believe) is apparently not available because a newer revised edition is coming out in November 2001 with updated information no doubt--you should pick up this latest coming edition. Understanding the subject of the Spanish Civil War has been plagued by two major obstacles: 1) The use of the Spanish Civil war as merely a prelude to WWII by historians of the English speaking world, i.e., crudely lumping in Franco and the Nationalists as just a Spanish variation of Facism; this ignores the study of Spanish history in its own right and the unique and tragic facets of Iberian history; 2) The use and abuse of the Spanish Civil War as an ideological forum for anarchists and &quot;Trotskyite&quot; anti-Stalinist communists, again, mostly from the English speaking world. The biased accounts of Anglo/American/Canadian leftists of this period (as well as Hemingway's romanticized fiction) have distorted and confused the event in the eyes of the English-speaking world. Its good to see an English scholar clear up this mess. Thomas' account clearly delineates the various factions and their goals on both sides, pointing out that lack of unity and in-fighting of the various factions of the left-of-center Republican side (if &quot;Republican&quot; is even a proper term to use by the time the Stalinists were done with it) was probably more decisive in leading to its downfall than the outside pressure of the Nationalists (who were by no means unified in ideology, but greatly more cooperative amongst themselves than the Republicans). The &quot;cowardly&quot; stance of the Democratic Western countries is made understandable and must be seen in the context of their own instability and weakness of the time. In retrospect, any aid to Republican Spain would have probably only helped the Stalinist-controlled communists complete their strangle-hold on the Republican coalition government, the other factions--especially the anarchists--being severely and savagely purged by them (my own opinion). In any case, Thomas' outstanding research and balanced account of the event allows each reader to draw their own conclusion without undue ideological bias.

I found this book, read it and it told me everything I wanted to know. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in this era of Spanish history. Very well-written and readable."},{"Title":"The Spanish Civil War (Harper Colophon Books)","review":"THe Spanish Civil war is apparently one of the most written on moments of the 20th century, and even if this is true, this book stands out as one of the best full, one volume, histories of the event, which began in 1936 and ended in 1939. The war is fascinating because it pitted so many competeing ideologies against one another. It was a war of secular versus religious. Of Rural versus urban. Of fascist versus communist. of democracies(sort of) verus autocracy. It was in some ways a popular war versus militarism. It was a 'world war in minature' and a war of 'two revolutions'. Thomas is the best chronicler of this, and his higly readable account is must read for everyone interested in the origins of world war two or Spain, or world history in the 20th century.The Spanish civil war was a defining experience not just for Spain but for the various administrations across Europe in the 30s. It saw the mass intervetnion of both Stalins Russia and Mussoluni and Hitler. it saw international brigades raised across Europe to fight for one side or another and one found in Spain German communists, having come from exile in spain, fighting against the German condor legion. Thomas's is slightly weak on his exploration of the origin of the war, perhaps because he does not weight the sheer chaos that was taking place, in part this is due to hsi non-judgemental method of writing, and he should be praised, but one wonders, why he does not give a better detail of just how total chaos had gripped the countyrside in 1936. He seems to underestimate the red terror, but in the end he is quick to see that both Franco and the Communists wanted only dictatorship in the end, their was no good in the war, only bad, and the end could only be negative. A fascinating account about a fascinating topic.The military anlalysis is good as are the character descriptions, with a fast lucid style and standard British whit, the text is good for the historian or the laymen.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"The Spanish Civil War (Harper Colophon Books)","review":"This is one of those massive, serious books you mean to read (to impress yourself as much as learn what's in it). I have had it for years on my list, but never had the courage to crack it until recently. Happily, once I started it, I simply could not put it down, even though it took me months to read.The situation in Spain in 1936, when the civil war began, was dauntingly complex. On the right, there were the traditionalists, including monarchists, staunch catholics, industrialists, militarists seeking glory for Spain in Morocco, and various fascists and authoritarians opposed to the idea of a republic. They were divided into a multitude of parties, factions, charismatic leaders, and simple brutes. On the other side was a collection even more fractious of anarchists, communists, socialists, marxists, liberal democrats, atheists, and left-leaning regional liberation movements. Caught somewhere in the middle were separatists in the Basque regions and Catalonia - the only industrialized regions of Spain - and the emerging middle classes. This added up (perhaps) to more political parties than existed in Weimar Germany, along with Italy its coeval in poorly united nations that were seeking a clear identity in the 1920s.At this time, many of the old certainties were in precipitous decline due to local historical factors. First, after the Inquisition and in spite of the many flowerings that sprung from the counter-Reformations (e.g. the Jesuits), the Catholic church had grown rigid and in many quarters was murderously despised. It could offer no leadership and little comfort in the face of the upheavals that the republic was experiencing. Second, the monarchy was decadent and incompetent, a shell that had been in decline since the apogee of the 17th C. It too offered nothing to address the increasing chaos. Third, the military was involved in a terribly costly colonial war, for some ill-defined glory of Spain, and was corrupted by bizarre notions of duty and privilege, embittered by lack of opportunity, and ignorant of the evolving society by its isolation. The enlightenment, it seems, had never taken root in Spain, nor had the popular revolution as in France.The political configuration was similar to Weimar, a Parliamentary democracy that was unable to impose order or forge consensus, yet the country was for the most part appallingly poor and underdeveloped. As the world fell into economic crisis - Spain was prosperous during WWI as a supplier not fighting - the tensions of both class and generational conflict were added to the ideological crisis, provoking the left (mostly anarchists at the time) into mob violence that reached unimaginable excesses: churches were burned down, bourgeois were thrown off of cliffs, clerics murdered and raped, dignitaries and nuns were disinterred and mutilated, etc. This rightly evoked horror among the traditionalists as society appeared to be completely breaking down; they found champions in the military, including Franco, who was a hero general in Morocco, and quickly moved into a leadership position. Nonetheless, a dazzling array of social experiments were undertaken - money was abolished in some regions, collectives established that eliminated ruling elites and even managers, marriage was abolished in favor of free love and association, etc. It is a reminder that the narrow social-political spectrum that exists today - capitalist democracy - is only one way that societies might have chosen to organize themselves, an entirely different trajectory on which to evolve; this alone is worth the price of admission.In 1936 in the name of order and traditional values, the military staged a country-wide coup, taking over about 2/5 of the country. The opposition republicans occupied the N and E of the country, with all of the industry and most of the international legitimacy. This is when Spain became a crucible testing ground for the battle of ideologies that culminated in WW II as well as military technology. The fascist powers backed the military and Franco, providing aid and, crucially, highly trained personnel. Not only did they test military strategies, refining among many techniques the Blitzkrieg (piercing lines with concentrations of tanks rather than using them as supporting supplements to infantry), but their men were \\"blooded\\", i.e. trained in killing in ways that would be applied on an industrial scale from 1939. The USSR did the same, but also required the republicans to pay with Spanish gold. As a result, both the fascists and the communists became unifying centers of power within their respective spheres, muscling out other factions and applying brutal force against erstwhile allies. Meanwhile, Britain and France attempted to stay neutral and keep the other powers from interfering in a \\"domestic\\" matter. Finally, to complicate matters, everyone was sending volunteers to fight for their causes, often arriving without clear contractual limits and hence becoming virtual slaves to their respective military establishments. The IRA, for example, sent volunteers to both the fascists and anarcho-communists!The republic, in spite of its superior resources, was at a fatal disadvantage in their anarchic disarray before the unified command structures of the rightist military. As Thomas says, it cut like a knife through butter, with steady losses of territory before a final collapse in 1939. The brutal violence, arbitrary executions, ideological proscriptions, and simple murder are as frightening as they are unbelievable to those of us used to orderly lives based on rights and law. It is a reminder of the savagery that existed in places that we see today as orderly extensions of our cultures. Social experiments accelerated, on the left of course but also as patriarchal dictatorship on the right. Many participants acted like the war was just a day job: one combatant (a pilot and machine gunner) used to eat breakfast with his family, fight until lunch, take a siesta, fight again a bit in the afternoon, then retire the the cafes for late night conversation and drinking with his companions.I had read another of Thomas' books first, Rivers of Gold, which was a great disappointment, getting lost in detail with little narrative thread and seemingly meaningless asides. This book is so much better in narrative, focus, and evocation that there is absolutely no comparison. That being said, the book is encyclopaediac and simply too long, with so many references to obscure politicians that it is hard to follow and the names just fly out of the book. Indeed, the index (mostly proper names) is 100 pages! This makes it a slog, particularly at the beginning. But there is no doubt that this is the definitive masterpiece against which all subsequent histories will be judged. The principal failing of the book, in my reading, is that Thomas does not sum up and interpret the outcome of the war, which he leaves to the reader to find elsewhere. I expected more judgment or at least perspective.Recommended as one of the most serious explorations into the 20C. This conflict, along with that in the USSR and Hitler's Germany, is absolutely necessary to study if one wants to understand the world today. The greatest thing I take away from this is that our experimentation with politico-social systems is probably far from over, even if we Americans like to flatter ourselves that we have achieved the right combination of stability and dynamism that others should emulate."},{"Title":"The Spanish Civil War (Harper Colophon Books)","review":"If all that you know about the Spanish Civil War comes from the works of Papa Hemingway or Pablo Picasso, this well researched history is for you.

He reviewed the surviving documents for both sides and interviewed many of the surviving players including Germans and Russians involved in a War which was a training ground for the European Dictatorships in preparing for World War II.Thomas lays out the causes of the war in part one. He gives us a breif history of the various parties of the Left and Right and their grievances which lead to the revolt against the Spanish Republic and Franco's Right Wing Dictatorship which ruled Spain until the 1970's.His review of the campaigns and international intrigue make for a good review of the events for non Spaniards who may not be familiar with this bloody period of European History where tanks, terror bombing, and blitzkreig were used for the first time.His discussion of European diplomacy in the book shows all the major players including the Germans and the Russians looking for a way to leave Spain without losing face and without triggering another World War before anyone was ready. In the end World War 2 nearly started a few years early and would probably been a two front war at once.He looks without judgement at the atrochities committed by both sides Republican and Nationalists which were horrendous enough to make their Nazi and Stalinist Soviet advisors cringe.A very Good History of the Period Leading to World War 2."},{"Title":"The Spanish Civil War (Harper Colophon Books)","review":"Simply put, the best account there is of the Spanish Civil War, the bloodiest ideollogical conflict of the 20th century.

Don't miss it!By the way, why do you rate some books with stars and others not? Just asking."},{"Title":"The Spanish Civil War (Harper Colophon Books)","review":"Hugh Thomas's book is a great source, but I found it a difficult read. If you need more information on various characters, this book is for you. If you want to get a greater understanding of the events and timeline, do NOT make this your first choice.He does an excellent job tracking the changing faces on the republican side, and the international diplomacy around the war. But political backstabbing and diplomatic skulduggery get tedious after a while. He discusses the more significant campaigns in passing, but almost as though this was just a backdrop for the politics and diplomacy. He covers the high points and low points of both sides' conduct, but can't keep out his pro-republican sentiments - and won't admit them, either. The republicans might round up political prisoners, and eventually execute a lot of them on trumped-up charges, but the nationalists engaged in ruthless repression, murdering their political enemies. I would say that he does try to explain to the secularist how much of a threat many Spaniards felt from the attack on the Church. He downplays many of the statements from the republican government on this issue, and he treats the Church in most of the discussions as merely another political party, so it doesn't go as far as it might. And a favorite of mine, he does go into some economic figures which are, at least in my opinion, critical in understanding many wars. He clearly demonstrates the tough times the nationalists were having with their command economy and the republicans with their hodgepodge of independent states and collectivist ventures.And there are then the quirks which I found made the book hard to read. He spells \\"jail\\" in the older English way -\\"gaol\\" - which, for an Englishman in the 1950's is understandable, but that takes a toll. He spells Hungarian names with umlauts, but not German ones, preferring the added -e. But then in footnots, the umlauts are there. Huh? He also uses some nearly-German grammar at times, with sentences like \\"on this day died Durrutti\\". He only roughly proceeds in chronological order, so one understands politics 8 months at a time, and then reads about two months of fighting, and then 14 months of diplomacy, and then the ninth month of politics. This makes for very difficult reading and understanding of the relationships between the events.And finally, the lack of insight. A reporter is someone who goes and find facts and relays them. Historians show the relationship of those events in the sequence of time to other events. He keeps saying that there is always the threat of war and various actions were made to avoid greater war, but never explains how/why wider war might have resulted -- just trust him. He clearly shows how the collectivist venture failed in Spain, but then dismisses it with a wave of the hand, because the war detracted from work. Well, did it or does collectivism fail everywhere? And how did the nationalists become 'fascists', and how did their economic policies differ from the republic's? It seemed like a golden opportunity to point out that fascism is a form of socialism, but he missed it. And that the nationalists are 'fascists' is a given, with no proof nor with any examples of decisions that ideology made them take.Overall, I'd have to say good reference, but poor reader. It really is more like a collection of newspaper clippings than like a history."},{"Title":"The Spanish Civil War (Harper Colophon Books)","review":"How can a book published such a long time ago be \\"revisionist?\\"Simply, because Hugh Thomas revised it, and in the process has made a much more complete and unbiased book. In its original form, it had a definite pro-Republican bias, but each succeeding edition corrects a number of detail and prejudices. I read it a very long time ago, and it was enthralling, and as a young student in Spain, I just gobbled up the details, which are still relevant for Spain today: I wish the current Spanish (Socialist) government could have such a balanced viewpoint on the subject. In fact, in this book neither of the sides is particularly more in the right than the other... for me the worst and most prejudiced book is Paul Preston's, which shows only one side of the story. Anthony Beevor's book is perhaps easier to digest, if you don't want to know EVERYTHING about this conflict.Just read the other reviews for the details; to sum it up, this book will help you to understand how the Civil War was a product of hundreds of years of Spanish history, and the relevancy of this conflict to more recent European and world history. In particular, this battle, and its healing by the years of the Transition here in Spain, are particularly relevant for Latin American countries which have emerged from dictatorship (an incomplete process, I fear), and even for Russia... I worked together with Gorbachov in the Madrid Conference on the Democratic Transition in Spain, and he takes an intense interest in the process.An engrossing book, requiring a bit of effort for the non-historian, but a classic which will continue to be read for years to come."},{"Title":"The Spanish Civil War (Harper Colophon Books)","review":"As the 70th Anniversary of the beginning of the Spanish Civil War is approaching this writer is reviewing some important works that militants should read in order to draw the lessons of the defeat of the Spanish revolution. The writer has been interested, as a pro-Republican partisan, in the Spanish Civil War since he was a teenager. What initially perked my interest, and remains of interest, is the passionate struggle of the Spanish working class to create its own political organization of society, its leadership of the struggle against Spanish fascism and the romance surrounding the entry of the International Brigades, particularly the American Abraham Lincoln Battalion of the 15th Brigade, into the struggle.Underlying my interests has always been a nagging question of how that struggle could have been won by the working class. The Spanish proletariat certainly was capable of both heroic action and the ability to create organizations that reflected its own class interests i.e. the worker militias and factory committees. Of all modern working class revolutions after the Russian revolution Spain showed the most promise of success. Bolshevik leader Leon Trotsky noted that the political class-consciousness of the Spanish proletariat was higher than that of the Russian proletariat in 1917. Yet it failed in Spain. Mr. Thomas' history of the period, if only indirectly, gives some answers to the reasons for that failure.When I say indirectly I mean just that. Mr. Thomas's history is strong on the main events, actions and points of the struggle. Militants, unfamiliar with the events of the Spanish Civil War can profitably use this history as a basic reader. However, if a militant is seeking to draw the lessons of the Spanish Civil War this book is not an adequate source and he or she must look elsewhere. Furthermore, Mr. Thomas makes no pretense to offer such a perspective and this writer would argue that he was hostile to any perspective but the view of high European, especially British, governmental politics. Fair enough. There is still plenty of basic information to be gleaned from this work.The Spanish Civil War of 1936-1939 has been the subject of innumerable works from every possible political and military perspective possible. A fair number of such treatises, especially from those responsible for the military and political policies on the Republican side, are merely alibis for the disastrous policies that led to defeat. Mr. Thomas' work analyzes those policies. Unfortunately, he is not sensitive to the base of society that actually fought, endured or fled the war. What Mr. Thomas does find is the furious nature of the struggle in Spanish society between the old agrarian- based economy and the newer capitalist- based economy; the religious tensions caused by the breakup of the old agrarian society and the tensions between believers and church-burners; the struggle between centralizers and federalists which formed the core of the unresolved national questions, especially in Catalonia; the intense political struggles within the broad sections that supported both left and right, especially the role of the Stalinist police apparatus; the international ideological political factors that played a role, if not as erroneously assumed the decisive factor; and, finally, the burning personal antagonisms that in a civil war pit brother against brother, family against family, town against town, etc.. With the caveat mentioned above-read on."},{"Title":"The Spanish Civil War (Harper Colophon Books)","review":"I think the two best choices for a book on the Spanish Civil War are Hugh Thomas' The Spanish Civil War, and Antony Beevor's The Battle for Spain. Thomas' book (this one) is extremely well written, and extremely informative. But it's 930 pages (in the Modern Library edition). Beevor's book is 432 pages (in the Penguin Books edition). I tried reading Beevor's book several times, but it didn't have what it takes to hold my interest. His paragraphs would quite often make me stop and think \\"What?\\" Now I'm well into Thomas' book, and it's still fascinating. But as the difference in size of the two indicates, you'll need to set aside a lot more time to finish Thomas' book. But if the size (and completeness) doesn't put you off, Thomas' book is an excellent history book. The writing is a pleasure to read (it flows smoothly and naturally), and Thomas' grasp and explication of his subject is among the best in histories I've read."},{"Title":"The Spanish Civil War (Harper Colophon Books)","review":"Hugh Thomas account of the Spanish Civil War is the most thorough version of the events written to date. His writing style makes the reader believe the entire account could be fiction. It is very easy to read and you hardly feel like you are reading history at all. The Spanish Civil War is one of the most devastating conflicts of the 20th century. It is the precursor to World War II and showcased as well as trained some of Germany, Italy and Russia's top talent. The sheer devastation of tactics involved bullied a civilian population and decimated a country. The rise of Francisco Franco and his victory over the communists was made possible by fascist intervention. The democracies of the world worked hard to try and effect a peace but they were unsuccessful against the determination of the fascists and the communists to prolong the conflict. This is a complicated conflict to understand but Hugh Thomas tries to simplify it as much as he can. This is the best start to understanding the Spanish Civil War and for those who want to understand how World War II began."},{"Title":"The Spanish Civil War (Harper Colophon Books)","review":"I picked up this book after readingThe Second Son: A Novel, by Jonathan Rabb which was set in the Spanish Civil War. My curiosity piqued, and as the subject is one of the many never mentioned in U.S. schools, I decided to learn something about it. My knowledge was pretty much limited to: comments my mother made about collecting trading cards during the 1930s with gruesome pictures from the Spanish Civil War; that Franco and the Nationalists beat the Republicans; and there were lots of communists running around somewhere.Let me tell you, this is one detailed, well-researched volume. From knowing essentially zero about this subject, I can now say that I know more than I'd ever hoped to know!Well-written in a clear and concise narrative. Thomas recounts events from the late 18th century, which led to the formation of the Republic, and the politics and events which directly led to both the Rebellion (by what became the Nationalists) and the subsequent Revolution within the Republic by Anarchists, Socialists and Communists.A very complex and highly confusing situation is rendered clear by author Thomas. Detailed assessments of not just the military struggle, but of all the parties involved on both sides, as well as those who tried NOT to become involved at all. Thanks to this book, I have a new understanding of just exactly what Anarchism is--and it's NOT simply chaos and lack of order, as the casual use of the word implies today. Details, too, on the Marxists, Communists, Liberals, Radicals, Revolutionaries, Socialists, POUM, PSUC, labor unions, Nationalists, Monarchists, Carlists, Falangists, Catalan separatists, Basques and more. The narrative documents as well, the involvement of the Russian, German and Italian governments; the \\"non\\" involvement of the French, UK, US and other governments; the role of \\"volunteers\\" in the Republican armies; naval matters; murders and reprisals; \\"terror\\"; and politics.Amply documented sources, many from first person accounts of events and some from interviews the author conducted himself. Giant bibliography, if you care to read more. Reasonably unbiased account of the events that transpired as well as reasonably unbiased characterizations of the participants in the tragedy that was the Spanish Civil War. I whizzed through this book quickly and it held my interest well. Not at all a boring tome.I give FIVE STARS to THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR by Hugh Thomas. Scholarly, yet eminently readable. The only thing that threw me for a loop was the Queen's English word \\"gaol\\", instead of the American English \\"jail\\"! ;>)"},{"Title":"The Spanish Civil War (Harper Colophon Books)","review":"i HAVE READ THIS BOOK ABOUT 6 TIMES OVER THE LAST 40 YEARS.

This is a superb text, alive, rivetting and awash with historical details and facts. I cannot see how it can be surpassed. Hugh Thomas has produced what is surely destined to be the definitive work on this tragic and heroic conflict. How the follies and foibles of man can lead to conflict and win or lose it.A definite must-read!"},{"Title":"The Spanish Civil War (Harper Colophon Books)","review":"Salvador Dali's painting, oddly titled, and appropriately sub-titled, graphically depicted the agony that would be the Spanish Civil War. It not a painting that would find a home over a mantelpiece; it is painful to study, and conveys the horrors of war even more than the works of his fellow Spaniard, Goya. Hugh Thomas has written the definitive history of this gut-wrenching war, perhaps without the required \\"distance,\\" since Franco was still very much in power in 1961. But it is difficult to imagine that it will be superseded. As for capturing what Dali foresaw, his prose is more dispassionate, but he has done an admirable job: \\"Within a month nearly a hundred thousand people perished arbitrarily and without trial. Bishops would be torn to pieces and churches profaned. Educated Christians would spend their evenings murdering illiterate peasants and professional men of sensitivity. The majority of these crimes were the work, on both sides, of men convinced that what they were doing was not only right, but noble. Nevertheless these events inevitably caused such hatreds that, when some order was eventually established, it was an order geared solely for the rationalizations of hatred known as war. And it would be quite wrong to think that there was much repugnance at this development. Spaniards of all parties leapt into the war like the cheering, bellicose crowds in the capitals of the rest of Europe in 1914 at the start of that war of which, perhaps subconsciously even in 1936, the people of Spain felt they should have been a party.\\"Thomas has written a rich, dense, detailed account. He has clearly mastered his material, and his account is not for the casual reader. The first fifth of the book addresses the social and political causes of the war; Spain was a deeply divided society, with the power of the Church and the rich upper classes threatened by the rise of the labor and the anti-clerical forces. Throughout the book he balances the accounts of military action with the shifting political forces of the numerous factions involved. The maps included in the book are excellent references which detail the advance, and ultimate triumph of the nationalist forces.As we know now, Spain was a \\"dress-rehearsal,\\" for World War II. The Western Powers, mainly France, Britain and the United States adopted a policy of non-intervention. This was not matched by the Axis Powers, Italy and Germany, who used Spain as a training ground for its men, and a testing ground for their tactics and weapons. The Soviet Union was the chief supporter, in terms of aid, of the Republican forces. Leftists in the Western democracies volunteered, forming the International Brigades, with Americans in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. Membership in the later would be grounds for suspicion, or worse, during the McCarthy era. As Thomas notes, some observers say that the sole reason for a Nationalist victory was the support from Germany and Italy, but he gives a more judicious and balanced answer, identifying five critical periods, and concluding that it was mainly the timing of outside assistance. He also indicates that much of the reason for the outcome was the relative unity of those on the Nationalist side, and the disunity and conflict of those on the Republican side.A few reviewers criticize Thomas for not being \\"balanced\\"; specifically they feel he was too \\"pro-Republican.\\" It is a difficult charge to weigh, like saying various World War II histories were not balanced because they portrayed Hitler as evil. Franco very much had fascist tendencies, but did manage to keep Spain out of WW II. Thomas's \\"tribute\\" to him was to call him \\"the Octavius of Spain,\\" a reference to the Roman emperor who managed to survive the civil wars of Rome, when virtually all others did not.Today Spain is at peace. In terms of numbers, the impact of the civil war was more catastrophic than the American Civil War. Thomas estimates that 600,000 died, out of a population of 25,000,000, whereas the numbers in America were also roughly 600,000, out of a larger 32,000,000. The higher percentage dead and the greater proximity of time may be one of the reasons that 90% of the Spanish population opposed their country's participation in the Iraq war.The civil war reverberates in numerous other ways as well. Just in terms of language, the nationalist General, Mola, gave us the term, \\"a fifth column,\\" meaning a subversive group, when he talked about how he would seize Madrid - it was from those within. Only last week the NYT ran yet another article which seemed to confirm that Capa's famous picture, of a Republican soldier at the instant of death, was faked.I started the review with a painting, and will end with another, Pablo Picasso's \\"Guernica.\\" He painted it in honor of the civilians who died there, in the first deliberate aerial attack on a civilian population, with no military motive. It was a careful, controlled \\"experiment\\" by the Luftwaffe. The painting is at the United Nations, and when Colin Powell gave his speech advocating the invasion of Iraq, with the inevitable aerial bombardments, the painting was covered up, a not very subtle tactic to erase the lessons of Guernica from our memory.Hugh Thomas carefully describes the attack at Guernica, as well as the rest of the war, so the lessons cannot be covered up. His book is a wonderful historical account, and deserves 5 plus stars."},{"Title":"The Spanish Civil War (Harper Colophon Books)","review":"I am not an historian, and only read history as a defensive maneuver against remaining forever ignorant of history. For me, filling in the gaps I have about history is a continuing and a lifetime struggle. Thus, I prefer history that is succinct and in summary form, not as literary art, as this tome seems to be.What I had known about the Spanish Civil war was what I had gleaned from all of the pre-WW-II spies and noted journalists who all ran off to Spain to fight against Franco. This of course included the most famous of them Ernest Hemingway and the notorious trio of British spies: Philby, Burgess and McLean -- all of whom spoke eloquently about the importance of the Spanish Civil War and went there as volunteers to fight.This is a 1100 page book and one either has to have a love for good historical literature, or be committed to seeing the book through to the bitter end. Neither of these were my goals. I simply wanted to ferret out enough about the war to fill-in my own ignorance, since everyone \\"in the know\\" seemed to think the war was a pivotal event in pre-WW-II history. Thus, I only read books one and two, and skimmed the rest of the book.For my purposes, I found this book well written, but was like pulling teeth to get the \\"straight skinny\\" on the causes of the war and its larger implications.What I learned about the Spanish Civil War is this:It was the European battleground and rally point for the emerging and competing ideologies of the times: namely, between Fascism and Communism. But also it was the contact point for a collection of related sub-struggles that although, they were prevalent in most other Western societies, were particularly magnified and exaggerated in Spain. And here we mean the struggle between elite and rural society; between capitalism and barter-based agrarianism; between Catholics and Protestants (and non- believers); between the national unity parties and separatists and anarchists; and finally between left and right.And thus the war was a defining experience, not just for Spain but by palpable example, for most of the rest of Europe. Like a magnet, it drew Fascists and Communists into an arena where these palpable ideological tensions clashed and got played out first through the shed of Spanish blood, and then ultimately spilled over into the Second World War.At some point, I intend to go back and read the last two books, but for now, except for fully understanding what actually triggered the war, I think I have a good feel for what the war was about.Three Stars."},{"Title":"The Spanish Civil War (Harper Colophon Books)","review":"Hugh Thomas's THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR is probably the best account of this tragic episode in Spain's history, and this revised edition hopefully expands and corrects the original edition, published in 1961. The paperback edition should make this classic readily available at a reasonable price."},{"Title":"The Spanish Civil War (Harper Colophon Books)","review":"This book also details the most history on the topic, concentrated in one place. Although sometimes billed as a \\"heroic\\" tale of many various people rising to their occasions, a better description might be a very long TV drama about what the many important personages said to each other, how they treated each other, and when. Such a story with this level of detail clearly took massive research to complete. In fact, the amount of detail could be said to come close to that of Will Durant's typical history works.The Spanish Civil War, among other things was a terribly tangled affair, especially to a Spaniard living in a disputed area at that time. Most of the time Thomas clarifies who was for/against whom. His short glossary of organizations and acronyms at the beginning of the book is particularly helpful. Sometimes, though, he tangles the relationships more. One could attribute this to the book's historical approach. Thomas tells the history as it unfolds contemporaneously, often day by day. To those who have suffered through high school texts which take a historical thread at the expense of events happening at the same time in other places (this reviewer included!), the author was scrupulous about not skipping around in time. This is a fair approach, even if it can be confusing in itself. The reader will have to keep the \\"larger historical picture\\" in mind as the pages pass.Some maps, and some pictures would have been helpful to the book."},{"Title":"The Spanish Civil War (Harper Colophon Books)","review":"Hugh Thomas succeeds in presenting the complexity of the Spanish Civil War in a single tome.

It is very effective on the political issues leading up to the civil war but a little less so on the actual battles. Many here are claiming a republican bias but I didn't see it. I felt he was very fair and gave good coverage to the Falange leaders and priests who were imprisoned or murdered without anything resembling a fair trial in republican spain. It does appear after reading this that the Italian army under Mussolini was always incompetent and that the German Condor legion could punch way above it's weight class and that Franco's victory had almost as much to do with the Germans and his loyal Moors than republican infighting and believe me this book covers endless republican infighting."},{"Title":"The Spanish Civil War (Harper Colophon Books)","review":"There's still no book like Hugh Thomas one to understand what-how and why was the Spanish Civil War, a real trainning just before II World War.

I'm finishing up my undergraduate degree and this was the FIRST book I read (and one of the most cited so far) for my senior thesis. I am writing a 110-page research paper on the Spanish Civil War (in Spanish) that will dictate whether or not I graduate.This book is amazing - it gives you all the facts, background, everything you need to know to find out what happened from before the war during the wars of succession and into the military coups of Primo de Rivera.However, this book is not for the light of heart. It was intended as a major academic work, so it's not exactly a straight narrative that will sustain you on the beach.In sum, read this book if you're hungry for knowledge, but pick something with a more narrow focus if you're looking for a more gripping narrative."},{"Title":"The Spanish Civil War (Harper Colophon Books)","review":"I very much enjoyed reading Hugh Thomas' work. He does and excellent job of sorting out the many and varied groups on both the left and the right who struggled for power during this terrible conflict.In addition, I learned many things about the war that I never knew previously. For example, I was unaware as the extent of the persecution of the Roman Catholic Church in Spain during the war. Given that Spain is overwhelmingly Catholic I assumed the church passed thru the war relatively unscathed. How wrong I was.Mr. Thomas paints a factual yet horrifying picture of how the so-called \\"republicans\\" who were in fact mostly communists, burned churches, raped nuns and tortured and executed priests. There are accounts of Catholic faithful being forced to swallow rosary beads, thrown down mine shafts and gored to death by bulls in bull fighting rings.The most awful irony I learned was that the International Brigades, so glorified in the west, were responsible for many of the worst anti-Catholic atrocities. I was especially horrified to learn that these brigades titled themselves after such great men as George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.Wherever your political sensibilities lie you will very much enjoy reading Mr. Thomas' well researched and well written book."},{"Title":"The Spanish Civil War (Harper Colophon Books)","review":"excellent history book, a lot of details.

A big proportion of illiterates, some intellectuals and a an army whose dorsal spine is colonial, accustomed to a cruel war in North Africa against the moors. Social inequality is enormous. Communism and anarchism grows up easily in the four bigger cities, Madrid, Barcelona, Sevilla, Valencia, more industrialized. Republic is the legal government but it's unable to stop, fires, murders and disorders against Catholic Church and conservative people.In the dawn of the 12 July in Madrid, tension and hate explodes: captain Jose Castillo of Republican assault police is murdered by a falangist gunman. Immediately, his comrades kill Calvo Sotelo, main leader of the conservatives: the fire of Spanish Civil War is ignited.The Republican government has had the caution to separate geographically the most suspicious generals, but these, secretly have done during months his confabulation with encrypted messages. The rebel army of Africa has to pass the strait of Gibraltar, and they get that by the aid of Italian and German planes, Savoia S- 81, and Junkers Ju- 52. Yes, at first, German minister of foreign affairs denies interest in Spanish demands of rebels nationalists, but Hitler studies the conflict and orders directly aid to Franco together with Mussolini: operation Feuerzauber is on. Republic wants to buy modern weapons from democratic France and Great Britain, but these countries are afraid of Nazi Germany and also fear an communist Spain so, they denies armament to the Republic. Only Stalin envies tanks and aircraft, so during three years in Spain ha to be a confrontation between Italian and German tanks Carro Veloce 1'3, Panzer Pz Kpwz and Panzer I against Russian TB- 26B and BT- 5. In the air, Junker Ju 52, Heinkel He 11, Savoia s- 81, Fiat CR-32, Messerschmit BF 109B, Junker Ju 87 Stuka and Savoia Marchetti will figth against Potez 540, Dewoitine 370, Hispano- Nieuport 52, CASA- Beguet XIX, Polikarpov I-15 and I-16, Tupolev SB-2 and Polikarpov R-Z. Navy is almost all in Republican hands, but high officers are killed by crew as these are prone to the rebels, and simple soldiers are unable to govern ships and over all, the artillery.Division into the Republican side between anarchist, communist and another factions drive them to disaster, unable to build an united army. Instead, rebels or nationalists of Franco are hardened troops -\\"Legionarios\\"- accustomed if necessary to face close combat with knife or bayonet in the teeth against the Moors or Rife&ntilde;os of Morocco. The legacy of this war is truly unknown but is calculated between half or one million killed.

Her co-workers still doubt her ability at times, but her straightforward approach and honesty seem to be winning them over. In this book, a young teenager, Bree O'Brien, is brutally murdered on the way to a rendezvous with her secret lover, Ignacio Yberra. Her father, who harbors a prejudice against Mexicans, immediately blames Ignacio. Mr. O'Brien is a wealthy and influential man who counts the Governor as a close friend, so Joanna has to approach the case in a careful and discreet manner. She decides to treat it as any other case, and is criticized by a local reporter for not giving it a higher priority. At the same time she is drawn into a case where illegal Freon from Mexico is being smuggled into Arizona. Eventually these two cases prove to have some common threads. On the home front, Joanna's daughter Jenny goes off to camp for the first time, with the usual angst on the part of both mother and daughter. Joanna's mother Eleanor pulls a very surprising move which leaves her a bit bewildered. I would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a good mystery with a look into the personal life of the heroine."},{"Title":"Skeleton Canyon (Joanna Brady Mysteries, Book 5)","review":"This is another great book in the Joanna Brady series by J.A. Jance. This time she throws a little romance into the mix of things as Brianna O'Brien is found murdered and her Hispanic boyfriend is the main suspect for some, while others don't believe he could kill. This teenage girl had many secrets and her boyfriend was only one of them. While investigating this crime, everyone's favorite female sheriff, Joanna Brady, uncovers more than she bargained for and has a difficult time in dealing with some of it.Again, we see some of the cast of support characters return, but others are mentioned in passing, so we know they will be back in future tomes. We're given a little glimpse of what's in store for Joanna Brady with her daughter growing up quickly and her mother's new relationship that seems to have transposed some of the former anger and has made her almost approachable.I find it interesting that Jance not only tells a wonderful story, but throws in a moral issue as well. She deals with the topic of racism in this book and does so in a very civilized way showing the prejudices of some and the extremes they will go to continue that narrow-mindedness. However, she also gives us hope for the future. She shows us that no matter what the odds some will not follow in their parents' beliefs and will, instead, have friends based on things other than the color of skin or social standing.And along with the story line and moral issue, you can always rely on Jance to paint a mental picture of the Arizona desert at it's best. Having lived in Arizona, I can remember the millions of stars in the sky that Jance describes in detail. I can remember the rugged beauty of the various wilderness areas that are similar to those portrayed. No one gives a better mental image of these things than Jance does. Having read all of the books in this series, I feel like I've actually been to Bisbee, Arizona. I'm sure if I ever do get the chance to visit that town; I'll see things as I've seen them before in my mind while reading these novels.After reading the first book in the Joanna Brady series, I didn't think Jance would be able to keep up with the standard she set. I was very mistaken. She has not only achieved that level of excellence but has surpassed it and continues to set new standards with each new book she writes.I highly recommend not only SKELETON CANYON, but any and all books in this series. They're wonderful, exciting and highly addicting! I do suggest that you read them in order to get the background on the characters - it's not mandatory, but will make for a more enjoyable read and will let your imagination run wild with possible scenarios for the future!"},{"Title":"Skeleton Canyon (Joanna Brady Mysteries, Book 5)","review":"J.A. Jance has brought us two wonderful series: J.P. Beaumont and Joanna Brady. In this book Joanna Brady, lady sheriff, once again battles not only the bad guys, but the good guys in her own department. In this book we see again how Joanna uses her own wits and common sense to beat the rest of them to the answer. Andy would be proud!"},{"Title":"Skeleton Canyon (Joanna Brady Mysteries, Book 5)","review":"As a big fan of Tony Hillerman and Rudolfo Anaya, I was looking for another author to quench my southwest mystery thirst so I came about Skeleton Canyon as my first J.A. Jance novel.Overall, the novel was entertaining. The author does a good enough job with the main character's backgrounds that you don't need to read the previous novels to understand their motivations, back stories, etc.New characters are described just as well, and the reader can really identify with these 'genuine' people and not outlandish or stereotypical cutouts.The story itself was fresh as was the mystery, though it did take a while to really delve into the mystery. For a novel that is just shy of 400 pages, it seems that the mystery aspect didn't really take off until midway through. However, the preceding setups and side stories are entertaining enough to push the novel forward anyway, keeping the reader's attention despite the lack of early mystery.The only disappointment I had was with the lack of southwestern flair I am used to with a Hillerman novel. Though the novel takes place in Arizona, near the border of Mexico, there is little reference to local culture, native American theology, a typical south west descriptors.The payoff/climax is good and there were a few twists at the end that I found debatable between a little 'convenient' and unique. The last chapter in itself had little to do with the novel, or even less of a future setup for a next book. Just seemed a bit odd in placement and context, but not bad.Overall a good read, and look forward to other Joanna Brady novels."},{"Title":"Skeleton Canyon (Joanna Brady Mysteries, Book 5)","review":"What began as a simple teenage disappearance has turned ugly with thediscovery of the murdered corpse of Bree O'Brien. Cochise County, ArizonaSheriff Joanna Brady begins to investigate the killing of the high schoolvaledictorian. The victim's wealthy parents insist that their daughter'sboy friend, Ignacio Ybarra is the killer. Joanna quickly learns thatBree's father despises anyone of Hispanic dissent, forcing his daughter toclandestinely meet with Ignacio, who is quickly proved innocent of anywrong doing.As Joanna continues to find clues, the case seems to get morecomplicated rather than closer to being solved. Joanna begins to wonderwhether the illegal smuggling of freon across the border might be linked tothe murder. Eventually all roads lead to one place: the O'Briens. Didthey murder their own daughter to maintain a lavish lifestyle thatapparently is supported by illegal means? If it is true that they murderedtheir own daughter, will they not be willing to eliminate an obstinate lawenforcement official before she uncovers the truth? If they did not do it,Joanna must return to square one wondering who did and why?The who-done-it is exciting and fun, but that is not what makesSKELETON CANYON and the previous four Joanna Brady mysteries a wondrousreading experience. It is Joanna, a lonely person, who has dedicated herlife to her deceased spouse and J.A. Jance's brilliant depiction of Arizona(including the environment, the climate, and the racial relationships).This is one series that seems to be getting better as each new talerefreshes the entire collection.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Skeleton Canyon (Joanna Brady Mysteries, Book 5)","review":"Joanna Brady is the no-nonsense sheriff of a border town in Arizona, and she is thoroughly delightful in this story of murder in the treacherous canyons near the Mexican border.The recently widowed mother of a 10-year-old girl, Joanna cannot help but be moved by the vicious murder of Brianna O'Brien, the beautiful and popular daughter of the town's most prominent family. The reader, too, is drawn into Brianna's all-too-brief life, and is there with her in Skeleton Canyon as she joyously awaits the arrival of her secret lover, Ignacio Ybarra, equally young, beautiful, and deeply in love. Brianna does not live to meet her lover--but who killed her? And why? It's up to Joanna to find out, and her job is much hampered by the arrogance of Brianna's father, whose distrust of the local law enforcement community is matched only by his racial hatred of Mexican-Americans.Brianna and Ignacio were involved in a forbidden love affair, at least by the senior O'Brian's lights. Did he find out and have his own daughter killed? It seems highly unlikely, since Ignacio is very much alive--and a suspect. But why would he murder his beloved? What secrets in the O'Brian family coalesced to cause this inevitable tragedy?While Joanna and her crew struggle to find the answers, the reader is treated to magnificent descriptions of the rugged Southwest, whose beauty masks murderous dangers such as killer flash floods. Equally interesting is the supporting cast: Joanna's friend Angie, a former hooker turned straight; two old and entertaining drunks in the bar where Angie works; Joanna's indomitable mother, who has a secret of her own; and more.This is the 5th in the Joanna Brady series, and the first I have read. It stands alone beautifully, but got me so hooked that I must get my hands on the next book immediately! Highly recommended for mystery lovers looking for a good, strong, read."},{"Title":"Skeleton Canyon (Joanna Brady Mysteries, Book 5)","review":"I believe I have read all of the Joanna Brady novels by J.A. Jance, and to me, this was the best one yet. The young love theme permeates the whole story, though there are other factors at work here. Mystery surrounds Brianna's family more than it does her in particular, as you know what happens with her and Ignacio fairly early in the story, but it is clear that things are not what they seem with her wealthy family. It almost seems that we have two stories in one here, but in the end, they do get tied together neatly. With each novel, we learn more about Joanna, and of course, if you have read some of the later novels before you read this one, as I did, you already know how some of the plotlines in this book pertaining to Joanna and her friend Marianne Meculyea develops, though they aren't played out fully in this particular story. I am not going to say more because I don't like to give away too much of the story, it will ruin it for readers who have yet to read this one, but trust me, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Skeleton Canyon (Joanna Brady Mysteries, Book 5)","review":"You may wish to buy this one in the hardcover.

Outstanding story as well as an amazing description of the American Southwest."},{"Title":"Skeleton Canyon (Joanna Brady Mysteries, Book 5)","review":"I enjoyed this one. Like other Jance books, this one takes place in the Southwest. Ms. Jance is a very descriptive writer, i.e. the land and the people, and a good story teller. The book is an easy read and like I said, it entertains, what any good book should do. This is the first of this particular series I have read and will certainly seek out and read the rest.

As usual, I started with the editor's synopsis inside the jacket, but in this one, the editor must not have read the book. No, the parents are not clamoring for Sheriff Brady to arrest the football star. The book is pleasant enough, and fast reading, but it is incredible that most of the subplots eventually tie together. That's too much of a coincidence for me. I found the climatic scene in the canyon a bit difficult to follow. It seems like Joanna Brady would have been killed had that really occurred."},{"Title":"Skeleton Canyon (Joanna Brady Mysteries, Book 5)","review":"Once I finish one of these books I almost count the days until the new book for &quot;next&quot; year is published.

I've read most, if not all, of this series and haven't been disappointed.

I love her writing and anyone buying her books needs to look at her website and read the books in order."},{"Title":"Skeleton Canyon (Joanna Brady Mysteries, Book 5)","review":"Overall, this was a page-turner. I cared about the victim, and enjoyed the other interesting characters.Some little things that annoyed me: everyone was always referred to by their full name, even when the main POV character was thinking of them, and they were close personal friends. Odd. It threw me out of the narrative. The emotional stuff was a little clunky sometimes, and repetitive. Subtlety: C+Being from Arizona, I loved the way Jance wrote longingly about the rain, about how beautiful it was, how it promised respite from the heat. Most literature associates rain with cold or gloom. Most literature doesn't fit the desert.The end was quite twisty and exciting. Overall a good read."},{"Title":"Skeleton Canyon (Joanna Brady Mysteries, Book 5)","review":"I love J.A. Jance and altho I read this back when it came out originally. I bought it to read again.

Love JA Jance's writing, and just can't put her books down once I start, makes for some late nights believe me.This book is no exception, as it builds Sheriff Brady's personal life and relationships (part of why I am reading the earlier books) it tells a gripping story that keeps you guessing \\"who done it\\" til the end.Though there is a pattern to most of her story lines, the evolving story of Joanna's life keeps each book fresh and appealing."},{"Title":"Skeleton Canyon (Joanna Brady Mysteries, Book 5)","review":"\\"Skeleton Canyon\\" was my first Joanna Brady novel and I loved it. As a consequence I went on reading more of the series as they became available, inserting earlier volumes into my reading on occasion. Finally I broke down and bought all the books I was missing and had an enjoyable feast of fine writing. Now I am writing reviews of those stories and had to reread \\"Skeleton Canyon\\". Surprisingly I enjoyed it more the second time than I remember enjoying it as a first read. I knew all the characters from the earlier novels and had a slight knowledge of what was going to happen which added to, not detract from, my enjoyment.There is the usual prologue and I knew the teenager was going to be killed. The prologue did not say so, we had to start reading the book to find out. In the beginning there was only the disappearance, not officially recognized and Joanna stuck to 'by the book' in handling it despite her intuition that the girl was dead. The father seems somewhat despicable with his bigotry on display and in his treatment of his wife. Jance has great ability in portraying her characters and she did not disappoint in this book except for Mrs. O'Brien whom I thought was not very well drawn to become a nun. Also the sadist, Alf Hastings, was given little space, but then, he did turn out to be relatively unimportant. Action in the book bounced back and forth from much to little, but with little gun play. The threat was there and often, leading to suspense but the sus pense wasnot book length, more a matter of a few pages but it was drawn on several times. Unfortunately, even though I gave the book five stars, I don;t think it truly deserved them, Jance pulled on coincidences too much, twisting freon smuggling into such an occasion as to lead to murder of a teen age girl, pearl earrings used to clear a boy from murder and also break a bigotry barrier, there are others. Still a good read and also helpful to us to see Joanna getting to understand her mother better."},{"Title":"Skeleton Canyon (Joanna Brady Mysteries, Book 5)","review":"I bought this for a dollar at a thrift shop to stash away for a rainy day. For its genre, it is just about perfect. The characters are interesting and believable, there's no dull section in the middle, and the ending is exciting and the solution makes sense. It's long enough for some character development but not so long as to be tedious. Just about perfect."},{"Title":"Skeleton Canyon (Joanna Brady Mysteries, Book 5)","review":"The 5th Sheriff Brady mystery was quite a twist. Nacio and Bree's love was heartwarming, and there's redemption of a sort in the end for Bree's father. Very well done.

I'm giving rating of 1 star soley because of the editing, which was awful. It should have been a fun read, but the errors took away from the enjoyment. I would like to compare the Kindle version with a print copy to see how the errors compare. Since this is the second Kindle version of Jance's novels with the same problem, I wonder if this common in Kindle versions?

Here, a scientist leads a small band beneath the surface of the Earth in pursuit of others abducted by an evil entity called \\"the Shining One,\\" whereupon they discover a lost civilization on the brink of war.Merritt's writing is wonderfully imaginative and extraordinarily detailed. His ideas, his places, his devices, and his underground world are enthralling. The Moon Pool does have a certain charm. And yet the writing has a lot of problems.Pacing is the most egregious issue. The book crawls in many places, and for long stretches. This shouldn't be; there's plenty happening in the story, but Merritt's writing ranges between verbose and extremely verbose. The storytelling is further hampered by a cast of flattish characters spouting corny dialogue, a great deal of which neither develops the characters in meaningful ways nor moves the story along.Merritt devotes paragraph upon paragraph to his vivid descriptions of subterranean wonders, and yet the reader's sense of place is often poor, as Merritt can scarcely ever be bothered to tell the reader where, specifically, his characters are, or where that might be in relation to the other places he's depicted.There are other issues. It's painfully convenient how quickly all the characters learn the subterranean language. Much of the mystery of the underground world isn't resolved until much too late in the book, and then by way of a massive expository dump. The book's climax, an epic clash between warring factions, should be exciting, but the resolutions are clich&eacute;d and predictable.The Moon Pool has been cited as an influence on Lovecraft's \\"Call of Cthulhu.\\" As far as horrific creatures emerging from lost cities beneath the sea to ravage humanity go, that seems reasonable. Beyond some basic thematic similarities, however, there's really no comparison.Merritt isn't read a great deal these days, and now you know why. On the whole, The Moon Pool feels like a missed opportunity, and it's too bad. As it is, there are no doubt plenty of better books in the genre.

It is a commentary on the recent demise of geometry in many curricula that 33 years elapsed between the publication of the fifth and sixth editions. Fortunately, like so many things in the world, trends in mathematics are cyclic, and one can hope that the geometric cycle is on the rise. We in mathematics owe so much to geometry. It is generally conceded that much of the origins of mathematics is due to the simple necessity of maintaining accurate plots in settlements. The only book from the ancient history of mathematics that all mathematicians have heard of is the Elements by Euclid. It is one of the most read books of all time, arguably the only book without a religious theme still in widespread use over 2000 years after the publication of the first edition. The geometry taught in high schools today is with only minor modifications found in the Euclidean classic.There are other reasons why geometry should occupy a special place in our hearts. Most of the principles of the axiomatic method, the concept of the theorem and many of the techniques used in proofs were born and nurtured in the cradle of geometry. For many centuries, it was nearly an act of faith that all of geometry was Euclidean. That annoying fifth postulate seemed so out of place and yet it could not be made to go away. Many tried to remove it, but finally the Holmsean dictum of ,\\"once you have eliminated the impossible, what is left, not matter how improbable, must be true\\", had to be admitted. There were in fact three geometries, all of which are of equal validity. The other two, elliptic and hyperbolic, are the main topics of this wonderful book.Coxeter is arguably the best geometer of this century but there can be no argument that he is the best explainer of geometry of this century. While fifty years is a mere spasm compared to the time since Euclid, it is certainly possible that students will be reading Coxeter far into the future with the same appreciation that we have when we read Euclid. His explanations of the non-Euclidean geometries is so clear that one cannot help but absorb the essentials. In so many ways, Euclidean geometry is but the middle way between the two other geometries. A point well made and in great detail by Coxeter.Geometry is a jewel that was born on the banks of the Nile river and we should treasure and respect it as the seed from which so much of our basic reasoning processes sprouted. For this reason, you should buy this book and keep a copy on your shelf.Published in Smarandache Notions Journal, reprinted with permission."},{"Title":"Non-Euclidean geometry, (Mathematical expositions)","review":"Masterful treatment of Non-Euclidean concepts, including a rare \\"tour de force\\", i.e. a comprehensive and in-depth treatment of both hyperbolic and elliptic geometries.But beware, the book is difficult, highly abstract, with almost no figures and spiced with some quaternions and tensors (which may be taken in a cursory manner...).So, it's better to absorb first Coxeter's \\"The Real Projective Plane\\" and Greenberg's \\"Euclidean & Non-Euclidean Geometries\\" , and only then tackle this book.This book is part of Coxeter's geometry SUM : Introduction to Geometry, The real Projective Plane, Projective Geometry, Geometry Revisited, Non-Euclidean Geometry... to be included in the collection of anyone interested in mathematics."},{"Title":"Better Thinking, Better Results","review":"Emiliani et al have written a very readable, easy to understand and thorough case study of the West Hartford, CT based (at that time) privately held, Wiremold Companies lean transformation.In 1991, the formerly successfull but now declining wire management products producer began a lean transformation which changed Wiremold into an acquisition machine that by 1999 was generating ten times the operating profit and eleven times the net profit of pre lean operations.

The operational and financial results that Art Byrne and his Wiremold team achieved are stunning and inspirational. This second edition also includes an update that describes what has happened at Wiremold after Legrand purchased the company. Unfortunately it's a sad story of reverting back to the old batch and queue methods and losing operational excellence.

This little book tucks nicely in my bible and helps me find those passages.As a practical matter, I wouldn't use this as my sole entry point into apologetics. The book highlights the verses with brief explanations, but not necessarily the logic surrounding them. So, for example, if you don't know that the arc of the covenant is a scriptural type for Mary, you may be confused as to what those Old Testament verses have to do with Our Lady.Get this book if you want to ENHANCE your existing apologetics learning and evangelization.

There are Cubans, Puerto Ricans and Mexicanos, all different , all Americans with a common thread, their Spanish heritage and a new found country. The collection of essays, fiction, non-fiction, excerts from novels and poetry are splendid echoes from the souls of Americans. The cultural differences aside, the homogenous nature of these offerings are in their portrayl of people who want to be recognized for what they are, Americans, who just happen to have different experiences from those in the dominant culture. These experiences give validity to the lives of many who may feel disenfranchised just because they are different. The words are so powerful, so funny, so sad, so real. This book is a favorite of mine to share with students. I read from this book yearly at a read in for middle school children and always get the class thinking, maybe reflective, but always roaring with laughter in the end. The students invariably ask me where I found the book and where could they get a copy. Mine is worn out, like an old glove that fits perfectly after years of use, it is still serviceable, full of dog eared pages but I continue to break it out yearly for the students benefit. What is nice about this book is that it can be read in sections, as the format of short stories lends itself to frequent endings. This is a great collection of writings that will not disapoint, in fact it will inspire you and make you greatful for what you have and who you are. If you are interested in the experiences of your latino friends and how they came to be who they are this book will provide insights. Written by Americans, for all people to understand why we are all different but still Americans."},{"Title":"Better To Rest (Liam Campbell Mysteries)","review":"I have commented on this series always in the extreme positive.

I wonder how on earth it got published in the first place. The setting of Alaska and characters in law enforcement seemed intriguing. But, joy in this work was not to be. While this is billed as a mystery, the mystery is completely obscured by the fact that the characters slept with each other any time, any place, any situation, including some very implausible ones.

Last I looked, the new moon is pretty dark to light up anything...I assumed you meant 'full moon.'Th conclusion was a bit rushed, and left open a number of questions about the crash & what exactly was the flight mission--I'd expected more depth into the where & why's of the flight, given the amount of text devoted to discussing it in the log book. But then, life is like that--you seldom get to know the answers. (Books, however, are seldom like thatI love the force of will shown by Liam's willingness to continue a job which requires him to fly about in tiny aircraft when he has such a strong fear of flying...there are lots of law enforcement opportunities which don't require any flying at all.The other characters are equally individual--no cardboard cut-outs.The main character is the bush itself, and it's such a large, complex and uncaring beast...devouring people without a trace, and yet sometimes they manage to make it out alive after the worst disasters. No matter how well prepared you think you are, when you're in an environment which is so extreme and volatile, things often come down to what you can do with what you've got in the few minutes before the environment kills you.People all too often love the beauty of the wilderness without considering the harsh and unforgiving nature of the environment...I remember all to well taking photos of beautiful scenery which I only properly saw when I got home--a I was too busy fighting off clouds of insects trying to suck me dry.The novels do a good job of showing the interdependence of people in extreme conditions--one of the most damaging myths of America is the Independent Frontiersman--a beast which cannot exist. Like most technological advances, the switch from dogsleds, kayaks & snowshoes to ATV's, steel hulls, snowmobiles & aircraft tends to be a one-way path. Once people stop living off of the land and depend upon outside resources, going backwards is nearly impossible. (I'm reminded of the locusts in N. Africa and the people starving because the locusts ate their crops--people who's grandparents would have looked upon the locusts as a gift, and rushed around catching as many as possible for food.)As dangerous as the environment is, the most dangerous thing in the bush is the same as everywhere else--humans. Oh, I'd much rather be elsewhere than to stumble upon a bear cub w/o momma, or Moose calve under the same conditions...but the animals are much more predictable than people--far more likely to know that even winning a fight can kill youNearly everyone in these books are rather broken people--not unusual for frontiers. I never made it out of the civilized triangle of Alaska when I was there just prior to the pipeline construction--frankly, I wasn't all that impressed--too many people, too much advertising, crappy roads and expensive so-so American beer. Much better once away from the cities.But then I'd just spent a month in central B.C. & the Yukon, which by comparison are uninhabited.Coming from Northern Wisconsin, I was initially surprised (until thought about it,) at how many people in Alaska come from my part of the world--the librarian and Ninilchik came from a small town 8 miles from me. (We raided their book sale for new material, having read everything we had at lest twice.)But then, the difference between -30 & -70 is pretty small, and a blizzard is a blizzard."},{"Title":"Better To Rest (Liam Campbell Mysteries)","review":"Dana's stories and not only suspenseful and intriguing but educational.

He shows what an unprofessional excuse for a law officer he is (zzzz)and subsequently finds himself in an even more absurd situation.

I couldn't find anything admirable about the Campbell character."},{"Title":"Better To Rest (Liam Campbell Mysteries)","review":"This is a good story, but, there is much in the story that emulates soap opera plotting. The ending seems rushed with the \\"aha\\" veiled in a rapid realization of the perp's identity. It would be best read in series since there is so much of the subplot that carries over from previous stories. Not having read the series will not hamper the reading but the reader is likely to feel ill at ease over not knowing the \\"inside\\" remarks. The author does a fine telling of Alaska land, climate and socio-economic problems. These elements are under-written but part of the fabric of the story's main plot. (And, the plot is quite interesting as well as thoroughly unique.) The relationships among the people are perhaps entirely within the social norms of the writer's experience. They are somewhat alien to my experience and seem extreme as to both alcohol usage and the sexual undercurrents. I believe that any new reader will wish to read the previous books in this series to flesh out this story.

And, Hello?

They are best read in order to follow the escapades of this interesting, entertaining, and quirky bunch of inhabitants of the Land of the Midnight Sun.

And in fact, there is a very sly reference to Kate herself--not by name, but by inference (\\"I know somebody who carries a hand-carved otter in her pocket\\")--that just thrilled me!Campbell's sweetie, Wy the pilot, is a typical Stabenow female: no-nonsense, tough, competent, and deeply in love with her man without wanting to reveal just how much.The plot was a bit thin...a glacier melts enough to expose the remains of a World War II plane and its occupants...and a myserious gold coin. The discover may or may not be related to two terrible murders in town.

He quickly distinguished himself by catching a serial killer leading to his superiors wanting him back in Anchorage.Though he would have a more powerful position with more opportunities for promotion, Liam needs to think about the offer because the woman he loves has a home and business in Newenham. He also likes the townsfolk who honor and respect him and his badge. Before he can sort out his personal life, Liam is determined to find the killer of a seventy-four year old woman who he admired and was loved by most of the locals. It's a baffling case because there isn't any suspect or even a motive yet somebody is determined to keep the truth buried as that someone tries to kill Liam before he can unmask he perpetrator.The beauty, the grandeur, and the danger of the Alaskan frontier come vividly alive through the writing of Dana Stabenow.

Interesting things about Alaska, good mystery and nice romance."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to St Paul (Cambridge Companions to Religion)","review":"This collection of essays is a fine collection, offering challenges to interpretations of Paul that have dominated Western Protestant Christendom since the Reformation. I only have one caveat to offer. Many seem to have as a particular, though implicit, target the so-called 'Lutheran Paul.' The previous reviewer writes, in a concise precis of this critique, 'Rather than preach a reductive \\"doctrine of justification\\", Paul emerges from his letters (via this book) as being someone who has a rather mystical understanding of the eucharist as union, sees salvation as pertaining to a particular community (not merely individuals), and preaches \\"justification\\" as being far more than a type of legal status: it is being brought into the family of God (via baptism) as a child of God, participating now in God's new work in the world.' There is only one problem - with a little nuance here and there, that is precisely the Lutheran understanding of Justification in its relation to the Incarnate Christ's Person and Work. In short, we would look at all that and say, yes, that's justification all right. So let this book enlighten you as to the many fresh readings of Paul that you can find out there, but realize that the putative target of many critical challenges is in fact a straw man. In fact, if you're not careful it just might make you a Lutheran."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to St Paul (Cambridge Companions to Religion)","review":"I have never taken the time to study St. Paul; having read both the letters of Paul and the deutero-Pauline letters in the New Testament, this book comes as a welcome next step in understanding him. As those who have read him know, Paul is not always the easiest to follow, especially given his intricate weaving together of different styles of thought within his letters: Pharisaic/Rabbinic, Hellenistic, apocalyptic and early Christian.This book covers what you would expect a &quot;companion&quot; to cover: Paul's life and context, historiographical issues, his letters and his purported letters (the &quot;deutero-Pauline epistles&quot;: those letters in the New Testament that most scholars do not believe were written by Paul). However, several other essays whose topics might be unexpected - such as interpretations of Paul in the second century (the most enjoyable and fascinating essay in the book for this particular reader) - also find their way into the book.While many simply see Paul as some sort of proto-Reformation-era de-/re-former (a la Luther), this book moves beyond these tired (and, it would seem at this point, largely incorrect) interpretations of Paul. Paul is not so easily reduced to a late-Medieval Roman Catholic reformer; he stands - however ambiguously and uncomfortably (for us no less than him!) - without such hermeneutical concealing. Rather than preach a reductive &quot;doctrine of justification&quot;, Paul emerges from his letters (via this book) as being someone who has a rather mystical understanding of the eucharist as union, sees salvation as pertaining to a particular community (not merely individuals), and preaches &quot;justification&quot; as being far more than a type of legal status: it is being brought into the family of God (via baptism) as a child of God, participating now in God's new work in the world. The reduction of Paul to legal[-istic?] terminology fails to see him as a member of a community who preached to and from that community; it ignores the fundamentally relational element of Paul's thought.This book is well worth the read. It is not difficult reading, but having read Paul first will greatly increase what you pull from this book. While it may be true that Paul has managed to upset just about everyone since the time of his writing, these essays are highly informative and helpful &quot;for those with ears to hear&quot;. The Cambridge Companion to St. Paul engages and mediates him well."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to St Paul (Cambridge Companions to Religion)","review":"The Cambridge Companion Series is designed to provide a solid introduction to a particular topic for new readers and non-specialists. This particular volume provides such a service by acquainting the reader with the current issues being discussed in the area of Pauline Studies. The most appropriate audience for this text would seem to be college or seminary-level students being introduced to the life and letters of St. Paul for the first time. Edited by James D.G. Dunn, this book contains articles about St. Paul from some of the foremost Pauline scholars today.Beyond simply providing commentary on specific Pauline epistles, this text offers articles which discuss topics of the life of St. Paul himself. The introduction, written by Dunn, provides key information so the beginning student will understand some of the debates in Pauline scholarship over the past two centuries. To this end Dunn briefly surveys F.C. Baur, the History of Religions School and the New Perspective.After the introduction, the book is divided into four primary sections. The first section which is titled \\"Paul's life and work\\" includes the following contributions: \\"Paul's Life\\" (Klaus Haacker); \\"Paul as missionary and pastor\\" (Stephen C. Barton). This section is primarily designed to show the reader what historical information about the life of the Apostle can be gleaned from biblical texts.The second section titled \\"Paul's letters\\" examines the Pauline epistles themselves with general commentary on the text. This section contains the following articles: \\"1 and 2 Thessalonians\\" (Margaret Mitchell); \\"Galatians\\" (Bruce Longenecker); \\"1 and 2 Corinthians\\" (Jerome Murphy-O'Connor); \\"Romans\\" (Robert Jewett); \\"Philippians\\" (Morna Hooker); \\"Colossians\\" (Loren T. Stuckenbruck); \\"Ephesians\\" (Andrew T. Lincoln); \\"The Pastoral Epistles\\" (Arland J. Hultgren).One particular area of this section which will certainly be of interest to the reader just beginning to study the Pauline epistles is the portion which discusses whether or not the Pastoral Epistles were written pseudonymously (142-143). While Hultgren, in the end, concludes that these texts were written pseudonymously, the reader is provided with the arguments, in five clear and simple to understand points, which have caused the author to hold these views. The reader is thus able to see the data supporting both sides of the argument and is able to better understand the dilemma for which there will never be an absolute solution. Rather than simply casting the opposing side in a pejorative light, Hultgren clearly shows why such a belief can be held.The third section titled \\"Paul's theology\\" includes the following contributions: \\"Paul's Jewish presuppositions\\" (Alan F. Segal); \\"Paul's Gospel\\" (Graham N. Stanton); \\"Paul's Christology\\" (L.W. Hurtado); \\"Paul's Ecclesiology\\" (Luke Timothy Johnson); \\"Paul's Ethics\\" (Brian Rosner). Since many readers of the New Testament are often puzzled by Paul's use of scripture, Segal's article will also likely be of interest to the beginning reader. In this article Segal discusses such topics as Paul's handling of scripture (e.g. Paul's use of midrash in Gal. 3:6-14) and what Paul's presuppositions may have been as a Pharisee (164-71).The final section which is simply titled \\"St. Paul\\" includes the following articles: \\"Paul in the second century\\" (Calvin J. Roetzel); \\"Paul's enduring legacy\\" (Robert Morgan); \\"Contemporary perspectives on Paul\\" (Ben Witherington, III). Witheringon's article which discusses contemporary perspectives has several facets which will be helpful to the unfamiliar reader. One such area is that Witherington juxtaposes Alan Segal's views about Paul's Jewish-ness against opponents of such a view (257-58). The debate which he singles out is the degree to which Paul was a \\"good Jew\\" (257). Other sections of Witherington's article provide broad overviews of such topics as feminist and liberationist approaches to the Pauline Epistles as well as a discussion of understanding the corpus through the lens of rhetorical criticism.Readers unfamiliar with the technical terminology used in biblical studies will greatly appreciate the glossary provided at the beginning of the text. While this text is certainly broad in focus it provides a solid foundation from which the reader is able to venture out into the larger world of Pauline studies. It seems this book would be helpful in an introductory course and would aptly serve as a supplement to a New Testament introduction text book."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to St Paul (Cambridge Companions to Religion)","review":"As expected, this short book (less than 300 pages) discusses who Paul was, the themes of his letters (including those with disputed authorship), and his theology. All articles are written without any academic pretention and yet with sufficient professional rigor. After reading it, one should no more find Paul puzzling. Instead, he is consistent and his fervor shines through."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to St Paul (Cambridge Companions to Religion)","review":"The Cambridge Companion To St. Paul is considered to be an authoritative text on the life of the apostle Paul. With detailed analyses on Paul's theology, it is a \`must-read' for all wishing to understand the man who, apart from Jesus himself, has influenced and continues to be the foremost influence in Christianity today. Paul was a controversial figure questioned not only by the Jews with whom he originally oppressed the early followers of Christ but also by Christ followers themselves with whom he later worked. While many a writer has portrayed Paul as a \`liberator' who allowed the early followers of Christ to \`shake the shackles' of Judaic legalism others such as John Dunn, editor and contributor to the book, have focused more on Paul's work as an \`integrator' who sought to include gentiles as well as Jews in his doctrine of \`justification through faith'.Biblical scripture shows us that Paul was a Benjamite Jew born in the city of Tarsus and brought up in Jerusalem under the tutelage of a rabbi by the name of Gamaliel. Paul was therefore well-educated and had as one of the strongest convictions before his conversion, to persecute and destroy anyone who professed a faith in Christ. His encounter with Jesus in a vision on the road to Damascus was the watershed event that lead to his transformation. After a subsequent visit to Jerusalem, during which he was despised by the Jewish authorities, Paul returned to Tarsus where, it is speculated, he continued with his education. It was not until sometime later that Barnabas brought Paul to the city of Antioch where, for the first time, he served as a church leader.Paul's own writings tell of his identity early on in his adult life not only as a Jew but as a pharisee who persecuted Christ followers and placed great importance on his religious zeal. This makes his subsequent conversion to Christianity ever more remarkable. As Stephen Barton points out in one of the early chapters, Paul's vision of Jesus lead him to his calling as an apostle of Christ to the gentiles. Paul thus counteracted the pharisitic tradition of the time by proclaiming that those who were not tied into Jewish law- the gentiles- could be justified through faith because of the, \\"redemptive death of Christ\\" (p.167). He recognized that in Jesus his own hope for the Messiah had been fulfilled and that the blessings of that hope should be available to all. In his own summary of Paul's life, Timothy Johnson outlines how he saw himself not only as an ambassador of God, suffering through pain and hardship as Jesus had, but also as an apostle laying down the foundations for the church. He was flogged and beaten by those who despised him. Indeed, much of his teaching would not have been done out in public but more likely in private houses where he could talk in safety, away from his enemies. Paul kept up the hope of his converts not only through his own visits but also through letters, gifts and prayers.Bruce Longenecker's treatment of Paul's letter to the Galatian church brings to light the encouragement that he frequently offered to his followers through his writing. Perhaps the most outspoken of all his letters, that to the Galatians focused on counteracting the Jewish Christians whose insistence that gentiles maintain Jewish law he found unacceptable. The purpose of the gospel was of course to bring the good news of Christ into the lives of all regardless of their background. Paul's message was clear- reconciliation and justification with God did not come as a result of following the law but through a Christ-centered faith.The establishment of the church in Corinth would have secured the power that the gospel needed to gain momentum. Corinth had after all become an important trading port between the southern Peloponese and the Greek mainland. Because of the materialistic focus of the Corinthian way of life, Paul's building of the church there could only have been seen as a great victory. But his letters to the Corinthians tell of formidable divisions between its members caused amongst other things by misunderstandings on the importance of sex within marriage, a lack of appreciation of the need to keep away from pagan ritual and a blurring of the differences between men and women. Brian Rosner has emphasized how critical was the need for the church to act corporately in all such matters so as to counter those who sought to adversely influence their teachings.Paul clearly had a vision that broke the boundaries of his initial Jewish upbringing. Indeed, as Robert Jewett notes in his chapter on Romans, one of his primary purposes for writing to the Romans was to seek help for his plans to open a church in Spain- a plan that was never realized because of his trial and execution. Part of Paul's appeal involved breaking down barriers between the different sections of Roman society declaring that Christ had died that all may live. While the Roman culture tended to focus on social status, with many a Jew placing emphasis on their higher level of spiritual righteousness, Paul once again taught how mere obedience of the law was insufficient. Morna Hooker's own discussion in the book on Paul's letter to the Philippians likewise shows his steadfast focus on Christ even as close as he was to his death.We are still not certain about the date of Paul's death although, as Paul Haacker indicates in his chronology of Paul's life, it is believed that he died in Rome in approximately 64 AD after being sent there by Festus to face trial in Caesar's court. In his chapter on the early church, Calvin Rotzeil concludes that while the teachings of Paul appear to have had little impact on several of the early church fathers after his death (neither Polycarp nor Ignatius referred to him extensively), others such as Tertullian and Iraeneus rescued his name from obscurity while fighting their war of words against the Gnostic adherent Marcion. Both Marcion and the later Gnostics such as Valentinus misinterpreted and misused Paul's writings, citing statements made by Paul to the flesh and blood as indicative of an earth totally set apart from their \`alien god of the heavens'- a claim that was vehemently dismissed by Tertullian and Iraeneus.The Cambridge Companion To St. Paul is an invaluable resource for those wishing to delve further into these and other aspects of Paul's letters. While a full understanding of the theological principles outlined in several of the chapters may not be possible for those without a formal grounding in Christian theology, the book nevertheless stands out both in its detail and its currency. It is therefore highly recommended for those wishing to read expert opinions on the man who fought for the universal accessibility of Christianity and gave millions across the world the opportunity to experience the power of a Christ-centered faith."},{"Title":"Chemistry: The Central Science","review":"I have the sixth edition of this text and find it very helpful in my Chemistry course in college.

The lesson went off well, and I got some really great writing to put on the bulletin board to boot."},{"Title":"The Island of Sheep","review":"The three stars in my review are for *this edition* of the book. The book itself is great. If you love the Sherlock Holmes stories or books by Rider Haggard, you will love this book. Buchan tells a good tale, keeps the pace moving, and has a real love of place. His characters are not deep, but several of them are very likable, and you will care what happens to them. If you've been bored re-reading the same old books and you like adventure, by all means, get this book.But not this edition. This Elibron books edition is *so badly done* that the authors should be tarred and feathered. It has been scanned in and then simply published as such. Totally cheap, with no human checking for scanning errors. They are egregious and distracting. The worst of all is the repeated phrase \\"the bland of Sheep\\" for \\"the Island of Sheep\\"--that being the title of the book! But there are many others, and sometimes they are so bad that you can't figure out what the original word was supposed to be. This makes it hard to sink into the story and lose yourself, as you're constantly being brought up short to ask yourself, \\"Is that a real word, or is it a scan-o?\\" The problem is made worse by two things: First, Buchan really does use an unusual vocabulary, including terms from hound tracking, Nordic words, terms from falconry and duck-hunting, and the like. So there are genuine additions to your vocabulary waiting here, and that makes it harder to pick out the scan-o's. Second, the scanning software they used apparently was linked to a dictionary and always fills in a real word instead of nonsense, where often if it just filled in nonsense, the original word would be easier to de-code. Example--it used \\"all\\" for \\"till\\" in one case. That took me a while of puzzling, and something like \\"tlll\\" would have been easier to figure out. \\"The\\" comes out as \\"me\\" several times. One of the funniest is \\"domes\\" for \\"clothes,\\" which is repeated every time the word \\"clothes\\" should appear.Buy this book, but buy it used and in some other edition. The editors at Elibron should be scolded and shouldn't sell another book until they can do some actual work to publish their books instead of scanning and selling without editing."},{"Title":"The Island of Sheep","review":"Although The Island of Sheep is not the last time that Richard Hannay appears in a work by John Buchan, it is the final novel where he is an actual participant in events, and in some ways it is a fitting close for the little saga that begins with the classic The Thirty-Nine Steps and then moves through Greenmantle, Mr. Standfast and The Three Hostages -- much of the focus shifts to Hannay's son Peter John, and there is a sense of passing the torch on to a new generation. (Perhaps someday someone will write pastiches with Peter John as an agent during the Second World War?) Still, while I'm giving this book four stars, though I probably would prefer to assign it 3.5 instead. For me it took longer than usual to get the plot really going, and while the story line is compelling, it's to me more compelling on a personal level rather than on an international one, and the sense of reduced scale tended to limit my interest, I think. The absence of Sandy Arbuthnot and John Blenkiron may also have had something to do with my relative lack of enthusiasm. Still, I would recommend it even for the casual reader; for Hannay fans, it is of course a must."},{"Title":"The Island of Sheep","review":"Richard Hannay and his doughty friends, including our hero's young son, take on bad men on a remote island off the Scandinavian coast (presumably the Faroe Islands)in this most readable adventure story. Buchan's stories are not complex; right is right and wrong is wrong. His writing, though, is quite poetic as he describes the Border Country of Scotland or the sea, and his stories always end with the reader's regret that the adventure is finished. His son, Peter John, is a teen-ager with interests in nature and living creatures that suggest the potential for a virtuous and productive manhood in the natural sciences. Unfortunately, this is the last of the Ricard Hannay series. Buchan died four years after writing The Island of Sheep, and his duties as Governor-General of Canada in the interim limited his writing output.In an era of moral relativism, it is refreshing to read Buchan's stories, with their hero who doubts not the nobility of his cause."},{"Title":"The Island of Sheep","review":"I'm bit surprised that Buchan's Greenmantle seems to be more popular than this little gem. I put this book as a better read than 39 steps and Greenmantle, while the latter was a study in jingoism, advertising imperialism to all and sundry and dismissive of those of us with more melanin as savages, the former is dished with a plot that is quite unbelievable and over the top, really! This one, though peppered with lots of \\"Scots are great\\" and Scotland \\"a paradise on earth\\" and full of \\"burrrns\\" and glens is still a fast-track novel quite reminiscent of Don Brown's of our times. A good time pass and an interesting plot keep your interest till the \\"lived happily ever after\\" climaxPS:Somehow I have a feeling that the writer wanted to take the story to China and maybe because of lack of time or dearth of requisite material he had to end the tale in \\"Norlands\\".

Every aspect of a 23 step international adoption process is covered with the most up-to-date and thorough information. Adoption laws and requirements for 68 child-placing countries (including Russia and China) are given in detail, as are instructions for estimating the costs of an international adoption. Of special interest is the chapter devoted to health concerns of Third World orphans. How To Adopt Internationally is enhanced for the prospective adoptive parent with Internet addresses for downloading INS forms, overseas embassies, adoptive parent support groups, travel information, and a great deal more. Authoritative, practical, comprehensive, How To Adopt Internationally is an essential reference."},{"Title":"How to Adopt Internationally: A Guide for Agency-Directed and Independent Adoptions (2000-2002 Edition)","review":"One of the things I liked best about this book is that it included samples of all of the paperwork we needed to collect or submit during the adoption process and gave detailed instructions for finding the necessary forms and documents.I also liked the step-by-step approach. In addition to making the whole thing easier and less overwhelming, breaking the process down like this, really helped us understand how international adoption works and what government agencies oversaw each part of the process. We could also really track our progress.The book was also very helpful to us in researching and choosing the right agency and the right country.I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone even considering the possibility of international adoption."},{"Title":"How to Adopt Internationally: A Guide for Agency-Directed and Independent Adoptions (2000-2002 Edition)","review":"This book was my &quot;bible&quot; as I prepared to adopt internationally. It guided me through the very detailed, step-by-step process. From finding an agency, initial paperwork, finances, social worker visits, the actual trip and first amazing meeting with your child, to issues once back - such as potential health problems, cultural issues, readopting and adjusting to life as a new family. Sample forms and documents were extremely valuable. I found this more current than other sources available. Also addressed adopting as a single-parent, which was encouraging! I had the opportunity to hear the authors speak in person, and was impressed not only with their first hand experience in adopting and raising their own children, but with their keen knowledge of international politics, and their passion and commitment to guiding others to build their family through foreign adoption. They have a wealth of experience running their own adoption agency, and clearly remain on the cutting edge when it comes to the most current information regarding international adoption. (I now have a beautiful, happy, healthy daughter whom I adopted from China.) This book is a must read for anyone considering the complicated (but ultimately wonderful) experience of adopting a child from a foreign country!"},{"Title":"How to Adopt Internationally: A Guide for Agency-Directed and Independent Adoptions (2000-2002 Edition)","review":"Frankly, I didn't know where to start when I decided to try to adopt from Armenia, a country that (at the time) didn't allow agency-directed adoptions. I read this book cover-to-cover, and realized that I would need a LOT of help in order to avoid the pitfalls inherent in independent adoptions. I found a great facilitator to handle the ideosyncratic Armenian requirements, but she didn't know the ins-and-outs of the U.S. side of the equation. This book is exactly as it claims to be: a Guide to International Adoption. It breaks the process down into sequenced steps that make sense of the bureaucratic nightmare inherent in the adoption process.If every agency was open, honest, and competent, and every country was consistent in its requirements, then books like this one wouldn't be needed. However, I feel that EVERYONE considering international adoption should be armed with the information contained in this book even if it's only used to evaluate agencies before you make your final decision. Furthermore, those choosing to adopt independantly need a guide to sort through the tons of misinformation they will encounter throughout the process.Keep in mind that ANY info contained in this guide or any other is only the latest info available at the time of printing. Every step along the way, I checked for variations and/or changes with some recent adoptive families from my network of Armenian friends. I also relied on Internet government sites for updates on paperwork requirements."},{"Title":"How to Adopt Internationally: A Guide for Agency-Directed and Independent Adoptions (2000-2002 Edition)","review":"Even though this book is marketed as the \\"2001-2002 Edition,\\" it is already woefully outdated with regard to the adoption laws and requirements of various countries. For instance, if I had taken the Erichson's information as law, I would not be sailing through the process to adopt a beautiful child from Kazakhstan right now. The Erichson's claim that Kazakhstan does not allow foreign adoptions, when indeed it has since 1999. In addition, there is misinformation regarding the adoption process for China, and these are just the two countries I know about. It is my advice to completely skip the \\"Compendium\\" section of this book (where the authors outline adoption laws and procedures for over 65 countries) - there is simply no way a print publication can keep up with the ever-changing country guidelines, INS procedures and politics that keep the international adoption process in a constant state of flux. Your best bet for up-to-the-minute information on international adoption procedures is the internet (particularly the US State Department's International Adoption page). If you place your confidence in the Erichson's book,... you could be sorely disappointed or miss out on an excellent opportunity.However, Erichson's info on preparing for the home study is quiet good. It also provides a helpful chapter on adoption medicine and health issues. The book also contains sample INS forms, although these are easily downloaded directly from the INS's website with complete instructions on how to fill them out. \\"How to Adopt Internationally\\" is a good reference to look at BEFORE you actually begin the adoption process - it's a good way to get an idea of what to expect (just don't believe everything you see in the Compendium!). Once you get going, it is vitally important that you have the most up-to-date info available to safeguard yourself from setbacks and disappointment. Your adoption agency and home study social workers will help you do the right thing at the right time, and don't forget to contact families who have recently completed adoptions in the country you are interested in to get a first-hand account of what it's REALLY like (the web is great for this!). This book doesn't provide any info that you can't find easily on the internet - I'd skip it in favor of a good web search specific to the country you intend to adopt from."},{"Title":"How to Adopt Internationally: A Guide for Agency-Directed and Independent Adoptions (2000-2002 Edition)","review":"Ms. Erichsen's updated version of How To Adopt Internationally is even better than her first version.

While most of the books I found on international adoption were either woefully outdated or tended to be a collection of heartwarming stories about adoptive parents and their journey to their child, this was the only book that explained the entire process from the very beginning to the very end. I have a paperwork phobia, so I especially appreciated all of the examples of the forms and documents the book included, the packing lists for the trip abroad, the guidelines for preparing for the homestudy and for preparing the foreign dossier.

My wife had done the majority of research while we were looking for our child, but when we found him in a Haitian orphanage, our process seemed to take a difficult turn. As Haiti is not one of the top countries for international adoption, and apparently one of the most difficult; we were extremely limited as to finding an agency to assist us, and in the end, decided to proceed independently along with the help of a parent liason from the orphanage. With a background in engineering, and years of experience developing and running our business, we weren't faced with the fear that we would not be able to handle it. Instead, my concern came from the number of sources available that only painted a partial picture or gave limited guidance. Digging deeper into the myriad of information, I began to get overwhelmed with all the questions that naturally arise while adopting... that was, until we came across your book How to Adopt Internationally. I have to admit that with such a simple title, I was thinking this would be another book to add to the already growing pile that would offer some helpful tips, but provide even more confusion. I couldn't have been more wrong.Jean, I want you to know that your book gave us the peace of mind and confidence that we could handle this process independently and successfully bring our child (now children) home. You have taken your years of knowledge and experience and so simply made it available in an easy to understand package. We can't thank you enough, and would recommend this book to anyone considering international adoption. Whether adopting through an agency or independently, this is a must read. Thank you again for your service. We wish you and your family many, many more years of changing lives.Forever Grateful"},{"Title":"How to Adopt Internationally: A Guide for Agency-Directed and Independent Adoptions (2000-2002 Edition)","review":"In international adoption, the devil is truly in the details.

However, if you are a mystery fan, than I am sure you will like it. It just seemed to be the details of a private investigator running around chasing up clues. After a slow start, the book does seem to heat up and it did a better job of retaining my interests from there. It is well written and I think that if you follow Grafton's books, you will have more of an opportunity to identify with her characters.The reason I was interested in this book is that Sue Grafton used a real life unsolved murder, which happened 30 years ago, as the basis of this story. Her desire was to bring the unsolved crime to light again in hopes of finding the murdered girl's missing family and bringing closure to the crime. Because of the book and attention it did bring to the murder, the murdered girl's body was exhumed and a forensic artist did a facial reconstruction of the victim. Photos of the reconstruction are in the back of the book. Sue Grafton states in &quot;a note to the reader&quot;, that it is her hope that someone will come forward to identify the girl. I admire Sue Grafton's intentions and hope that she will be able to make that possible by this book."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"This was my first \\"Kinsey Millhone\\" story. I found it to be a very enjoyable read. Sue Grafton hooked me right from the start. I loved the fact that I was surprised by the identity of the killer. I had gone in another direction.

I won't say much more except that I hope to see more of Stacey Oliphant and Con Dolan in R, S, and so on. Here's to hoping R comes out soon."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I first became aquainted with Sue Grafton's books in 1995 with &quot;L is for Lawless&quot;, I believe. Got hooked and went back to &quot;A&quot;. It's interesting to see how her detective, Kinsey Millhone, has developed over the years.I believe Sue is keeping her placed in the 80's before cell phones, DNA, computers, etc. I love the continuing lines about her landlord, Henry, the VW she drives, her one black dress. I cannot make a peanut butter and pickle sandwich, tho.I enjoyed this book because it is based on a true story. That the victim is still not identified does not take anything from the story. Kinsey's detective friends are funny and I was tickled at her lesson in ironing a shirt that she gave one. That's the way I iron a shirt! The fast food binges made me hungry.I wrote to Sue many years ago. She and Kinsey send a Christmas card each year and I get an advance notice about new books coming out and where Sue will be signing them. She always sends a token gift. For &quot;M is for Malice&quot; it was a key chain with the letter M encased in plastic attached. For another letter it was a letter opener and one letter had a little first-aid kit to carry in your purse. I believe this shows an author who appreciates her readers. I appreciate her work."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Subtitle this one: Kinsey and The Odd Couple. Two ailing elderly cop buddies and Kinsey team up to solve a cold case and identify the remains of a long-dead girl. As always, Grafton writes fluidly; her characterizations are solid; there's plenty of gentle humor. There's just not a whole lot of action, nor are there any great surprises. It's a perfectly pleasant book, certainly engaging, but not entirely compelling.That the narrative is based on an actual, still-unsolved, case is more intriguing than the book itself and the last half-dozen pages detailing the case make for fascinating reading: the stuff of true mystery.While Q isn't up to the level of P, it is none the less good reading--far superior to much of what's out there.Recommended."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Almost twenty years ago a girl's body was found in the Grayson Quarry in Santa Thersa, California. The body was practically unrecognizable but the police were able to determine the young woman was in her teens and they had a good set of prints. Nobody ever identified the body or caught the killer and eventually the case was put in the cold case files.Two decades later, Police Lieutenant Con Dolan is on medical leave and retired police officer Stacey Oliphant is in remission from cancer. They want another crack at solving the case and hire Kinsey Millhone to help them with the legwork and to bring a new perspective. Following up every lead and piece of information that came in when the body was discovered, the trio follow the links which takes them closer to identifying the body and hopefully, flushing out the killer.Q IS FOR QUARRY is an excellent crime thriller due in part to the good relationship that Kinsey has with her two elderly clients. Readers see step by step how an investigation is conducted and become caught up in the process. Kinsey's ambivalent feelings towards her newly discovered family are a fascinating sub-plot that humanizes the character. Sue Grafton has written a fine addition to this long running series, one that her myriad of fans will want to buy.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I have always loved the Kinsey Millhone series, they used to be fun and entertaining. But this book is different, it just can't keep my attention. The story may be authentic, but is so thin that it could have been written in 10, maybe 12 pages, at the most!The 'filler' story is boring to the point it puts me to sleep.

Q is for Quarry wasn't as good as I had hoped. I felt the pace was rather slow moving, between her &quot;partners&quot; illnesses and hospitalizations and the never ending saga of Kinsey and her new found, wealthy extended family, which I feel is being dragged out too slowly. I couldn't wait to finish the book, it seemed too long, and then all of a sudden, it was over.

The primary thing she does in this book is eat JUNK- two QP's with Cheese at a time, a whole pizza for herself, etc. This book treated us to steady descriptions of Kinsey's fast-food meals, but she is a tad slow to catch on to the killer so maybe all that cholesterol is finally affecting the blood supply to her brain...but I digress. :-)I hope one day they will discover the identity of the real-life victim upon whose case this book is based."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"This is the first of Grafton's books I've read, and it has an interesting plot idea, but wow, does she miss the mark. Grafton has a plodding writing style that leeches any suspense out of the pages that left me very disappointed. Not one I could recommend at all."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Because Kinsey Millhone is helping two old friends solve an 18-year-old murder, this mystery is more of an exercise in problem-solving than an action-packed drama. And that's OK -- we don't need to see our favorite P.I. get beaten up *every* time she questions someone, do we? As usual, the descriptions here are vivid and the characters are three-dimensional, believable, and suspicious. Our heroes try to unravel the cold-case puzzle even though Real Life Issues of their own keep interfering. What makes this episode even more interesting is discovering that the premise is based on a true crime. Sue Grafton worked with local authorities to examine evidence, pursue leads, and to have an artist create facial replicas of the real Jane Doe whose dead body was dumped in a southern California quarry in 1969. Though the author provides a plausible series of events throughout the course of the book, the actual murder remains a mystery -- as does the identity of the victim. The book ends with photos of the facial reconstruction, in the hopes that someone will recognize the young woman and come forth with information. Gosh, are we in San Jose (aka Santa Teresa), California, or Cabot Cove, Maine??? No matter.

The idea it was based on was more interesting than the story."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone series is a long-running string of private eye novels, among the first with a female protagonist. The author's been doing this for a quarter century now, and she's gotten very good at satisfying her fans, but she's only very rarely truly surprising in her plots or characters. This book is different, not because the plot itself is unusual, but because it's based on reality.A retired coroner and several police detectives in Santa Barbara presented this case to Grafton several years ago: a young woman was stabbed to death and left in a quarry below a highway. No one ever established her identity, let alone getting any serious leads as to her killer, and there's been no new information in the case in the years since.In the book, fictional characters take up the quest to at least identify the victim, if not the killer, in this case. Two retired policemen who found the body in the first place, and have been haunted by the case ever since, hire Kinsey Millhone to assist them in looking into things, but of course the two of them fade (health problems intervene) and Kinsey winds up searching for her identity, and eventually that of her killer, by herself.I enjoyed this book, and the realistic aspect of the plot, in that it's based on a real incident, was frankly a hook. I'm curious to know if they have made any progress in the case since the book was written."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I'm a big Sue Grafton fan having read all of her books but I had a difficult time getting into this one. Took over 1 year to complete Q - partly my fault but also found this to be slow moving with too many characters with little interest to me. Still, I've always enjoyed her stories and I can't wait to read \\"R\\"."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I have read all of the Kinsey Millhone books by Sue Grafton and have enjoyed every one of them until now. Maybe it's just me but in this book, Kinsey was barely likable. The whole time I was reading it, I was hoping that nobody started reading the series with this book. I was very, very disappointed. I will continue to read Sue Grafton's books because I'm a long time fan but I certainly hope &quot;R&quot; is better than &quot;Q.&quot;"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Sue Grafton is the Queen of Mystery. I've read every Kinsey Millhone novel and am looking forward to the next in the series. That being said, there are a few flaws in Q is for Quarry, but none that would cause a less than Five-Star review. For example, the issue of Kinsey's distant relatives may be picked up in the next novel, but it was left far too abruptly for this reader's taste. Until I finished the book, I hadn't realized this novel was in fact based on a real-life Jane Doe case that Ms. Grafton has taken interest in. The fictional mystery itself was paced a little slower than some of the other Alphabet series, but somehow it fit with this book, being out of Santa Teresa and Kinsey a bit out of her element. As a series of novels written in the first person, I find the descriptions--sometimes very detailed--to be an insight into Kinsey's inner-self and it feels like a friend is telling me about her surroundings. Hope the next year-plus goes by quickly for the relase of &quot;R is for...?&quot;"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I have been a major Sue Grafton/Kinsey Milhone fan since \`\`A is For Alibi.\`\`I did not think that Ms. Grafton could have topped \`\`P is For Peril,\`\` but she has.\`\`Q is For Quarry.\`\` has the wit, and heart I\`ve come to expect.

Some seem to think that it wasn't up to par. But the fact that the book is based on an actual event made it much more interesting and real to me. I enjoyed the plot twists and had a hard time guessing &quot;whodunit&quot;. Overall, it was a very good read."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"This is an ambitious book, more satisfying and daring than \\"P.\\" Kinsey, orphaned at an early age herself, is investigating the long-ago death of a runaway, the kind of girl society allows to fall through the cracks. (Was she with her birth mother? Did she run away? Does anyone who knew her care?) Kinsey was smart enough and lucky enough to build a series of surrogate families -- beginning with her neighbor Henry and now including the two elderly cops. This support system gives her a strength the young murder victim didn't have. There are other women in this story, one is a girl whose home life was also very difficult who dreamt of better, more stable future with the boy next door, another loves too well but not too wisely, a third is an adoring sister who knows more about her brother than she says. Against this backdrop, Kinsey is dealing with her own unresolved feelings about her mother, grandmother, aunts and cousins. The comparison of the lives of these women add texture and substance to the story that is unusual with books of this genre. The only reason I subtracted a star is the mystery itself. I figured out the killer's identity long before Kinsey did -- and I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer. I wish she put as much work on plot as she did on character."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"With seventeen novels to her credit, inevitably readers will like some better than others. Q is for Quarry is a new take on a familiar theme.Two aging cops, friends of Kinsey Milhone, want to solve a fifteen year old puzzle: a girl's body was found in Lompoc, California.The body was never identified and the murder never solved.Grafton keeps the suspense flowing more than she has in some books. The action doesn't stop. It's a straightforward mystery and an alert reader will pick up clues -- although not necessarily identify the killer.We learn a little more about Kinsey's long-lost family. Her two partners -- retired cops -- are fighting life-threatening illnesses and one discovers the joy of junk food. Grafton's strength comes in plot and setting. She describes everyone the heroine meets in excruciating detail. Outward appearances hold clues to personality, as we realize from the great portrait painters.Kinsey has her usual quirks: she dresses down and she lives small and cheap. Here she's totally unattached and she likes it that way. She doesn't age and she's still using a typewriter sometime in the 80's. I must admit I kept looking for anachronism: were Sauconys the shoe of choice back then? I must admit I wish the author had aged Kinsey and brought her into the present, so we could get a sense of depth by growing with her.This is a female tough detective story. We don't get into the deeper nuances of personality, as we do with heroines of Nevada Barr or Margaret Maron -- or even Marcia Muller. Spenser, Robert Parker's hero, is more sensitive. You get an old-fashioned quick read with no great lessons about life -- just the thrill of the chase and a great relief, at the end, that your own world isn't populated by the people Kinsey encounters in her frequent brushes with murder witnesses."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I have also read all of Sue Grafton's books and this is definitely on the bottom of the list! What a waste of time. It starts out slow and goes downhill from then on. I kept thinking it would get better and forced myself to read it all the way to the end and it never got any better."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"and that's where I am about the direction Grafton is taking with the Alphabet Murders series.I was intrigued to learn that she based the story on the research she did on a real cold case about an unidentified Jane Doe found over 30 years ago in Santa Barbara. I think the research added a lot to the murder plot of Q.However, I can't help but compare the most recent Kinsey outing with that of another fine author, Marcia Muller. Muller published \\"Dead Midnight\\", the 21st instalment of the Sharon McCone series, just before Q came out, and it is a terrific read. Like Kinsey, Sharon has many family problems, but her character has grown, changed and prospered over the years, and is surrounded by both familiar and new characters who keep the texture of the series updated.Kinsey seems stuck in a rut, going nowhere. The supporting characters are all of another generation, and Kinsey no longer seems to relate at all to her contemporaries. Yes, she's always been somewhat of a loner, but the direction that she's taken to isolate herself even further with only familiar senior citizens seems unnatural and false. I think Grafton has spent enough time on the murder plot of \\"Q\\" to make it realistic, but has paid not enough attention to Kinsey's character development.I hope that she gets back on track with \\"R\\". She's still on bestseller lists, but is losing some of her following with the downhill direction that the series is taking."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Q Is For Quarry by Sue Grafton is different from the average Kinsey Millhone mystery, but I found myself enjoying this book more than I've enjoyed the last few novels in the series. First off,the book takes place mostly in a fictionalized version of the southeastern corner of California [south of Blythe and west of the Colorado River] rather than the usual fictionalized version of Santa Barbara, California. Second, Q Is For Quarry is the most police proceduralesque of the novels in the series. This isn't suprising since the novel takes off from a real cold murder case and involves two retired cops as main characters. Kinsey and the cops slowly unravel and reweave the evidence concerning the murdered girl found in the quarry until they tie up the loose ends and nail the killer. If you don't like lots of detail, you probably won't like this novel. Complaints concerning Kinsey's changing personality seem unfounded to me since the changes are consistent with the evolution of the character seen in the other novels. I think that Q Is For Quarry is a very good entry in the 'Alphabet' series and I hope Sue Grafton doesn't give up on Kinsey before she reaches Z."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"It was eighteen years ago that officers Stacey Oliphant and Con Dolan, out on a morning hunting trip, found the decomposing body near the quarry. She was young, white, bound, and stabbed multiple times, and then her throat was slashed. She'd never been identified, her murderer never brought to justice, and the unsolved case has haunted Oliphant and Dolan all these many years. Now, old and sick, and at the end of their respective careers, they want one more shot at solving this Jane Doe homicide, and decide to enlist the help of Santa Teresa private detective, Kinsey Millhone. After hearing the whole story, and reading over the old murder book, Kinsey has to admit she's hooked, packs her duffle, and joins this &quot;odd couple&quot; on what turns out to be quite an intriguing and ultimately dangerous adventure in search of the truth..... Inspired by a still unsolved murder in Santa Barbara County over thirty years ago, Sue Grafton weaves a compelling and suspenseful story. Her well paced plot is filled with clever twists and turns, vivid, laugh-out-loud scenes, and witty and irreverent dialogue. But it's Ms Grafton's brilliant characterizations and delicious descriptions that really make this novel stand out and sparkle, and no one does it better. Q Is For Quarry is the seventeenth mystery in this marvelous alphabet series, and definitely one of the strongest entries. If you're new to Kinsey and company, begin at the beginning with A Is For Alibi and read them all. If you're already a fan, Q is a very satisfying and engaging read that should find itself at the top of your &quot;must read&quot; list."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"This book is essential reading for all Kinsey Millhone fans!Ms. Grafton has outdone her usual brilliance. She has taken a marvelous series and made it better by adding two new elements to her well-honed heroine and typical plot. The first new element is that you will learn a lot more about what was going on in Kinsey's family before, during and after she was born. This new information will provide the basis for many satisfying plot complications in future to expand your enjoyment. If you skip this book, the next books in the series probably won't work as well for you. The second new element is basing her mystery on an actual unsolved homicide in Santa Barbara County, California in August 1969. As a result, we can all speculate along with Ms. Grafton about what really happened. If the real case is ever solved, we can also see how close she and we came to the right answer. By including four forensic reconstructions of the real victim, readers can also potentially help identify the victim. It's one thing to make up one's own neat little mysteries. It's a much grander and exciting thing to take on the real thing. I hope that Ms. Grafton will create other reality-based mysteries in the future.As the book opens, Kinsey is about to turn 37 in four weeks . . . and is in a little more reflective mood than usual. Soon some of that's dispelled when she takes on a new role as leg woman for Lieutenant Dolan and Stacey Oliphant, who originally investigated killing of the stabbed and dumped young female victim in 1969 at Grayson Quarry on Highway 1 in Lompoc. Stacey had retired from the Sheriff's Department eight years earlier, but is back working part time on cold cases. This one?s lack of closure has always bothered him. He's suffering from a bad case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma from which the odds against recovery are long. Dolan and Oliphant have known each other for forty years, and Dolan wants to help his friend regain his zest for life. As you can imagine, Kinsey doesn't like direction from anyone and working for men of retirement age who are more than old enough to be her father is a challenge. Oliphant is 73 and Dolan is 63. To that, you can add the complications of illness and lack of physical vigor. It's a whole new set of challenges for Kinsey.There were several aspects of the story that especially appealed to me. First, Kinsey's disconnection from her family has seemed somewhat artificial to me over the prior books. How many people do you know who are so distant from most of their living relatives? By beginning to make some connections, Kinsey will become a more interesting character. For instance, what would Stephanie Plum's appeal be without her family? Second, some writers overdo family connections over time. The Amelia Peabody series seems to be bordering on that problem now. The books then become more about the family than about the story. Ms. Grafton has wisely avoided that. Third, Kinsey is working with people whom she normally would not have as colleagues. That also provides lots of new scope for her as a character and the chance to introduce interesting new characters. Both aspects of this book were successful. Fourth, part of the book also takes place in the Southern California desert, which is a rich counterpoint for the usual Santa Teresa surroundings in these novels. Having grown up near that area, I loved her treatment of desert life there. It's one of the best I have seen.After you finish this story, think about some part of your family with whom you've never had much contact or have lost touch with. Give them a call and get together. Find out what you've been missing!"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"\\"Quarry\\" is loosely based on a 1969 Santa Barbara murder with a victim who remains unidentified to this day. Grafton became interested in this unsolved case and sponsored a forensic sculptor to do a likeness of the victim, which she included at the back of this book in hopes that someone will recognize the picture. This seems to be the year for big time mystery writers to take a hands-on interest in unsolved crimes what with Patricia Cornwell's six million dollar investment in the Jack the Ripper case.Two retired detectives call in Kinsey Milhone to assist them in reopening the cold case of an unsolved murder of a Jane Doe victim. The trail leads the trio to small town Quorum CA. On the surface, Quorum is God-fearing and conservative, but appearances are deceiving, and soon Kinsey is up to her tumbled hairdo in suspects.The book is a bit of a slow start to get everyone in place. I question the wisdom of having two cohorts that are both dying. Not only is it depressing, a lot of time is spent to and froing to emergency rooms and discussing diets and the horrors of smoking. I do not object at all to Grafton's love of placing senior citizens in her stories, I just wish she would be sure their health warranted the tasks she sets out for them. Like many other reviewers, I could do without the ongoing soap opera of Kinsey's rediscovered family. \\"Quarry\\" is back in the familiar groove after a really fine departure in \\"Peril\\" where Grafton extended her scope and vision. She does her usual fine job of characterization and descriptions that add so much to her novels. The plotting is excellent, and the ending is nicely surprising. I'm just hoping Kinsey can soon find a friend who is under 65.Ms. Grafton heeded her fans. The final report is back in place, the whodunit is crystal clear with no ambiguity that might possibly make the reader think for a few minutes after closing the book, and the motives are straightforward with no complexities. This is the type Kinsey that pays the bills.-sweetmolly-[Amazon.com] Reviewer"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"She was found on Sunday August 3rd, 1969, Grayson Quarry off California's Highway 1. The woman was young, her wrists were bound, she had multiple stab wounds and her killer had slashed her throat. After months of investigation, the case remains as stone-cold as it was on the day her body was found. The police didn't even find out her name.It is 18 years later, and the two officers who found the body are now both ill and close to retirement. However, desiring one last crack at the case, if only just to give the poor woman a name, they turn to Kinsey Millhone for help. She is curious, and agrees to work with them. But what starts out as an investigation trying to find the identity of a dead woman, soon becomes a dangerous hunt for her killer.Some fans who may have been disappointed by her last effort, \\"P is for Peril\\", will feel much warmer feelings towards this novel, which is one of the best books in the entire \\"alphabet\\" series. It's complex, intriguing, written in sharp, efficient prose, with a great cast of characters. Kinsey is on fine form once again, and there are some real treats in store for constant-readers of Grafton, in the shape of more insights into Kinsey's family and background. She's a likeable, resourceful hero, and I am incredibly impressed that Grafton is still able to develop her main character with each new book, whilst lesser writers tend to burn out at around the five book mark.Grafton is adept at creating casts of likeable, essentially very normal, well-developed characters who keep her books moving and her plots flowing smoothly. The California she evokes is one of a mostly pleasant place full of people going about their usual business, but in all her books there is a subtle sense of darkness and evil lying beneath the genial faade, which often adds a good chill.Sue Grafton is one of the most reliable authors working today. She can always be counted upon to produce an enjoyable, compelling mystery, which is exactly what she has done here. \\"Q is for Quarry\\" is a high-class book with a rock-solid plot, and almost certainly one of her very best."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"This seventeenth installment in the Kinsey Milhone series is something of a departure both for Kinsey and for the author. The detective, while loyal to her few close friends, is essentially a loner, especially when she's working, but this time she's linked up with two retired cops in attempting to solve an eighteen-year-old murder. And Grafton has based her story on the true unsolved murder in 1969 of a teenage girl whose body turned up in a quarry near Lompoc, California. In fact, a picture of the victim's reconstructed face is included in hopes a reader will have information. The plot is well constructed, as usual in Grafton's work, with the story's progression revolving around the routine investigations that make up most real detective work. Kinsey seldom gets involved in a shoot-out. And right down to the last few pages, there are still several strong possibilities for the killer, so even if you think you know whodunnit, you won't be sure. Grafton is also very good at delineating the details of character development. But not everything in this book is perfect and, in fact, the author seems to be getting a bit sloppy as the series ages. As I have complained in my reviews of her previous books, Grafton habitually over-describes. Kinsey doesn't just make coffee, she takes the lid off the can, gets the measuring spoon out of the drawer, measures out the coffee, puts the lid back on, turns on the tap, fills a glass with water, pours the water into the resevoir of the coffee-maker, turns it on, . . etc. This book could have been 25% shorter -- and better -- without losing anything important if Grafton had a copyeditor willing to argue with a millionaire bestselling author."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Americans have had a long long love affair with Kinsey Millhone, private investigator. The Sue Grafton creation has graced bestseller lists since her A IS FOR ALIBI premiere 16 letters ago. While other detectives have moved on to cell phones and Internet searches, Kinsey's still hacking away on pay phones and typewriters, her life frozen in the 1980s. She's a 37-year-old PI who comes pretty close to hardboiled, if that's possible in Santa Teresa, California. She's proven remarkably durable through books that tend to blend together in a nonetheless satisfying mix.If you haven't already heard, here's the lowdown on Kinsey. Orphaned at age 5, divorced twice by her mid-20s and happily on her own these days save for dinners with her feisty octogenarian landlord, Kinsey pretty much does as she pleases. In Q IS FOR QUARRY, she accepts an assignment from a pair of near-retired police officers, Lieutenant Con Dolan and Detective Stacey Oliphant, who want to reopen a Jane Doe case left languishing for the last 18 years. Quicker than you can say \\"the butler did it,\\" Kinseys enmeshed in another adventure. The trio's legwork eventually leads them to the tiny town of Blythe, where the auto-shop-owning McPhee family becomes the center of the inquiry. Once the body has been identified, Kinsey sets about cracking the case, with another fatality to deal with along the way.Whats grown familiar about Kinsey's tales --- well, aside from her frequent forays to McDonalds, refusal to accept her recently discovered extended family and general bull-headedness --- is the utter everydayness to them. Grafton doesn't have the gift for words of a Jonathan Franzen or a Sandra Cisneros, but she'll detail them to the death. We literally watch Kinsey's every move during the seven to 10 days it usually takes her to solve a case.We're there when she brushes her teeth or brushes off suitors. We watch as she dresses for dinner or drools in her sleep. Unlike your garden-variety detective, Kinsey does laundry and \\"uses the facilities,\\" as Grafton puts it. It's about as close to a slice-of-life as you can get.The mystery element is always interesting in the Millhone books, which are clearly plot-driven. Many of the minute details Grafton includes as Kinsey observations turn out to be important; for example, the prison-standard tattoos on a lying inmate's arm. As Kinsey spends yet another few days in a strange town (she tends to frequent fleabag hotels in cities with 10 or so streets), she makes her share of friends and enemies. What helps keep this book amusing is the interaction between the introverted Kinsey and the two older detectives, both of them ill but still blustery. Their old-married-couple interaction has a true ring to it.Grafton spends just enough time cracking Jane Doe's identity, not drawing it out too long. Once we know who the girl was, the suspect list narrows, but not by much. One problem I've always had with these books is that there sometimes aren't enough clues to turn you on to the killer --- \\"clues\\" that become clear only in retrospect or were never given to the reader in the first place. Its not really unsatisfying, but it is mildly annoying. Kinsey always ends up getting her man (or woman) in a bloody, life-endangering climax. Grafton cleans up the details in the books' epilogues.What's unique about this book is that an actual corpse, an unsolved Santa Barbara homicide from 1969, inspired it. Though Grafton explains in the author's note that the characters are completely fiction, much of the material evidence is not. It's the first time Grafton's worked such a nonfiction angle in her book, and the story turns out intriguingly enough.Will Kinsey Millhone ever join the cannon of great literary detectives like Sherlock Holmes, Inspector Javert, even Spenser? Nah. But that doesn't make her any less entertaining. Q IS FOR QUARRY satisfies all the Kinsey necessities, with a neatly wrapped finish and sass in between.

I've read the entire series, and have enjoyed each and every book. It's not necessary to read every book in this series to understand the story, but if you like good mysteries, start with the first book and read them all. I guarantee you'll have lots of entertaining reading if you do.This time Kinsey works with two retired police detectives who hire her to help them investigate an old mystery that they were never able to solve. In the previous eighteen years, a young Jane Doe was stabbed to death. The mysterious woman was never identified and her body never claimed. The detectives want one more chance to find the killer and perhaps identify the woman.As usual, the author takes us into the life of private detective Kinsey Millhone, who at age 36 is set in her ways, and quite a character. She loves fast food, has a rather odd assortment of friends and lives an unglamorous, but nevertheless interesting life. Kinsey has her own kind of tomboy charm and she's still trying to figure out her life and her past.This story is loosely based on a true murder case."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Several years ago a colleague introduced me to the &quot;Alphabet Murders&quot; while we were both trapped at a Faculty Retreat. It proved to be the most long-lasting element of THAT Retreat -I confess to having read all the Sue Grafton I can find since then. In spite of my enthusiasm, I had begun to fear that Kinsey Milhone wasn't going to age well. In the last few books Grafton seemed to spend too much time with peripheral characters &amp;/or Kinsey's difficult family &amp; not enough on the actual mystery. I found myself getting very tired of the Adorable Henry, Henry's Brothers, the Mad Cook, etc. Wisely Grafton chose to ship all of the above off on a cruise for this novel and brought in two new &amp; highly appealing characters in the form of aging &amp; disgruntled police detectives intent on solving an old case that has bothered them professionally for twenty years. In a brand new spin, we find that Milhone/Grafton is actually investigating a REAL unsolved crime that had occurred near Santa Barbara years previously. It is possible that the &quot;reality&quot; of the case is what makes the first half of the book go rather slowly (reality sometimes DOES go slowly) but I didn't really mind, Grafton had given me some interesting new folks to get to know, and Kinsey was grappling more effectively with her past than it seemed she could do in earlier episodes. The second half of the book picks up the pace, perhaps a bit too much. I found the ending a bit forced (no, I WON'T tell you WhoDunnit!) and a bit too tidy, but overall I am back looking forward to R rather than wondering if I can be bothered to make it through the alphabet. A nice read for a cold snowy afternoon or a long car ride!"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Perhaps it was the research that Sue Grafton did on an actual Jane Doe case, but this book is her most compelling. One of Grafton's greatest gifts is her ability to draw characters that are both eccentric and real and this book is full of those. Her descriptions of the area, the sky, the weather, and the feelings of the era are superb. She is a wonderful writer. She's the best of the mystery writers today.My wife reads aloud by the fire as we pass the cold late fall evenings in Coastal Maine. So often, the popular mystery writers disappoint in their effort to pump out book after book. Sue Graften and her character Kinsey are always a pleasure, but this book was especially welcome. We were sad to see it end. It's Grafton at her best and she is getting better and better.Sue Grafton's closing description of the real case and what went into her research for this book was fascinating.

This is 17th book in the Kinsey Milhone series and while I adore Sue Grafton's work, this was not exactly my favorite of the series. Grafton is a master of pacing, giving both Kinsey and the reader just enough time to catch our breath in between scenes. I found this one just a tad slower than the usual pace of the books. That being said, this is still excellently crafted. The plot is complicated, with players coming and going throughout, but no end is left loose. Misdirection and mounting frustration build throughout the book until I wanted to throw it around the room (fortunately calmer senses prevailed and I didn't propel my Nook across the room.). Even if I had though, I would have picked it right up again. Only one complaint, there is a subplot involving Henry that seems a little less gracefully worked than usual. The answers are found later in the series, but it is a bit confusing if you were a first time reader. I also found myself getting a little annoyed with Kinsey and her attitude toward family. She has questions and there are living relatives to answer them. Perhaps I am projecting my own adoption issues onto Kinsey, but I wanted to tell Kinsey, stop whining, just sit down and have a talk already, it won't kill you. Fortunately, 17 books into the series, I think that Grafton has earned the right to extend her questions across books, and even let her characters while just a little bit.My review: 4 of 5 stars this time."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I find Sue Grafton to be an entertaining read Amazon verified product"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Wow, a body in the quarry. Nothing quite says murder mystery like that. And nearly two decades later Kinsey is called in to do a little of her classic and quirky investigating.It's a good, solid mystery that relies just as much on characters and conversation as action--though I admit that does get a little dull after awhile. But if one wants a good subtle mystey, this hits the spot."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Fire the editor. It's got some howlers that I think were added after Grafton was finished with the manuscript. Aside from that, and the usual Kinsey Millhone stuff, there's a surprisingly touching story or two amongst the subplots. I fear her humor is fading, though, which could spell trouble for readers like me, who don't actually care for straight mysteries. Or maybe I just shouldn't have read 17 of these in a six-month stretch."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"PI Kinsey Millhone is at it again, this time trying to solve the eighteen-year-old murder of a previous \`cold case'--an unidentified female victim.Teamed ironically with two elderly cops, the ones who had originally found the woman's body, Kinsey sets out to discover both the identity of the victim and her killer who dumped the body in an old quarry.Sue Grafton's 17th suspense novel in the \`alphabet series' is filled with unexpected twists and turns, not to mention infused with Grafton's wry sense of humor. I loved the quirky relationship between the two old cops, Dolan and Oliphant! Amidst a story of tragic death and horrific murder, they were a great addition and added definite comic relief.I would have like to see Kinsey's past delved into a bit more, but Grafton is the Queen of \`dangling the carrot'. I'll be sure to read the next one (although I'm a bit behind in my reading as I'm busy writing my own novels). It's going to be a sad day when Sue Grafton finally gets to the letter \`Z'.~ Cheryl Kaye TardifAuthor of Divine Intervention"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I just finished this Kinsey Millhone book today: Q is for Quarry. This is a relatively recent one that, like the others, takes place in the 80s.This book has Kinsey working with Lt. Con(rad) Dolan and Detective Stacey Oliphant. Stacey was diagnosed with cancer, is pretty sure he'll die before the end of the month and has given up on life. Con talks Kinsey into taking this case of an 18 yr old unsolved murder that has always bugged Stacey as a way to get him enthused about living again.While on the trail of this case, Stacey's health improves while Con ends up in the hospital from a heart attack.The plot was pretty good and even more interesting to me when I read the epilogue -- that this story was based on a true case. The real case remains unsolved but the people working on it had created a 3D model of what the girl murdered in August 1969 in California looked like and those images were included at the very end. Very chilling after reading the fictional story.This is definitely one to read!I would give this book 4 pairs of daisy-patterend pants out of 5."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Having read all of the Grafton books, I would say this is one of her better efforts. Perhaps, because it is based on an actual event. The reader will guess the culprits before Kinsey does, but she is busy learning about her own family back ground and maybe not paying enough attention to the investigation. She seems very trusting of the female characters she encounters which seems out of character for her.The two older policemen are an intersting addition to the book and very believable in their quest to close the file on this case. The book does not move as fast as other Grafton books, there is a lot of information about desert area in which the story is set, which is immaterial to the story; but interesting to know."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I have read all of Sue Grafton's alphabet series and have enjoyed reading most. However, my money was totally wasted on this one. I am halfway through Q is for Quarry and fall asleep everytime I read it due to boredom. The plot and characters are uninteresting, and the narrative is marred by constant, unnecessary repetition. This is a miss for Sue Grafton. I am going to cut my losses and go on to a more interesting book. Life is too short to spend it reading boring and unimaginative books. I hope the next in the series will find Sue Grafton and Kinsey back on track"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Sue Grafton can usually be counted on for a good read, but in this 17th. book of the series, she stumbles a bit. She uses a true story as the basis of her book, and while this sounds like a good idea, somehow it just doesn't work. Kinsey is asked by her friend Lieutenant Dolan to help solve an old murder in which he and his friend Stacey Oliphant discovered a body which had never been identified by any name other than Jane Doe. Stacey is having health problems and Dolan figures that a little police work is all it will take to pull him out of the doldrums. (Where's the reasoning there?) Grafton throws in a few scenes with the estranged members of Kinsey's family, but nothing seems to work in this slow-moving book. The characters are shallow and I never really cared whether Jane Doe or her murderer was ever revealed. I live in hope that Grafton will do better on \\"R\\"."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I enjoyed Grafton's earlier books immensely, but the last few have been kind of iffy.... some good and some bad. I was hesitant to invest in this one, but the premise sounded interesting. It could have been a good story, but I found myself struggling to get through it. I thought it was just me...maybe too many distractions just now. But after reading some of the other customer reviews, I see that I was not alone. There are the usual tedious descriptions of life's minutia common to Grafton's books, but what is worse, the entire story is flat and plodding without any spark. If this was a debut novel by an unknown author, it would go straight to the discount table in the bookstore. Only Grafton's name and past reputation are responsible for this book being a bestseller."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"So many authors write decreasingly well as time goes on, no doubt burning out from the pressure to write a blockbuster each year. Sue Grafton is *not* in this category. I thoroughly enjoyed Q is for Quarry and think it is just as good -- and probably better -- than earlier works (which for the most part I also enjoyed). This witty and fast paced book tells the story of Kinsey teaming up with two retired police detectives -- good buddies, each of whom has health problems that the other worries about -- to solve a &quot;cold&quot; case of a teenage girl found dead near a quarry. No-one knows who the victim is, let alone who killed her or why. The characterization is very vivid, particularly the emphasis on the friendship between the detectives. This is wittier than some of Sue Grafton's earlier works. The plotting is excellent, although (and perhaps I was reading too quickly) I sometimes couldn't figure out quite how they got from A to B -- although much of the plot does involve following hunches.I sent my copy on to a person who doesn't read mysteries -- I hope she makes an exception for this one."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Kinsey Milhone is up to her old tricks...eating at Rosie's, visiting with Henry and jogging in the wee hours. This time she has taken on two old &quot;gentlemen&quot; and they search for the killer of a young girl. The case is &quot;cold&quot; from 1969. The two men are a lesson plan in how not to live. Drinking, smoking and eating badly...they are a hoot. Kinsey's Aunt and cousin have entered her life and her grandmother looms large. as with all of the alphabet books, it's a delight. Kinsey is an original character and after all these years I feel she's a friend."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"This is my first Kinsey Millhone mystery in a couple of years, and a discovery I made while reading it may explain why I've kind of lost my taste for this series. Grafton is in good form here, teaming up Kinsey with a couple of retired cops working a cold case -- the murder of a Jane Doe found dumped in a quarry 18 years before. A subplot involving Kinsey's long-lost grandmother, aunts, and cousins appears promising but ultimately goes nowhere. The fact that Grafton's murder is patterned on a actual 1969 Jane Doe murder victim in Santa Barbara County adds special interest to her story. (As of July 2011 that Jane Doe remains unidentified.) But one thing really jumped out at me in this story: Q was published in 2002, but the story takes place 18 years after 1969, which means 1987, and even before I did the math the story felt dated. When I started reading Kinsey Millhone novels, she was my contemporary, and now she's living 24 years in the past. That disconnect, I think, is the source of my problem with this series. Kinsey is stuck in amber while I and the world have moved on. As a result, Grafton has robbed herself and her character of the opportunity to live the real world of today and remains mired in the far less interesting world of 1987. That's a huge missed opportunity for Grafton and her character."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I BOUGHT THESE BOOKS FOR MY BROTHER IN LAW AND HE SAID H REALLY ENJOYED READING THEM"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"As good as she always is.

It was an easy, entertaining read."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I really enjoyed this mystery. It's been a while since I enjoyed an American female writer's series...they often tend to drop off in quality of writing, and it becomes hard for authors to retain the interest in the major character/protagonist. I cannot tell how many times after about five (when you know they are going for a series) that I just barely get through the book, and I am sure the author feels that way too.This must be a lucky letter of the alphabet for Grafton. I enjoyed the dusty desert scenery I am familar with from my youth (grandparents in Mesa and we were in SF). Also the added information about Kinsey's family is a bonus.Kinsey finds it a treat working with two older cops who are both having health problems on a cold case. As per usual, stirring the pot causes things to come to a boil, but Grafton manages to weave into the storyline several different possible motives, which makes it very hard to determine who killed the young girl in the cold case. Kinsey also shows a more caring side of her in her treatment of the women in the story, one who loses a brother, one who is an alcoholic. Maybe she find a way to care about her family?Karen Sadler"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I had been saving this book for a few months, knowing that once I started it, I would not put it down until I finished and that is exactly what happened. One of the blurbs on my copy of this 17th entry into the fantastic Kinsey Millhone series says that after you finish the book, you have trouble realizing that Kinsey is not a real person and, for one of the rare times, that blurb is correct.This book is more of a police procedural than previous Grafton books. The case revolves around an unsolved murder from 18 years previously. Two cops, one retired &amp; one on medical leave, want to revisit the case to see if they can identify the teenage victim that was brutally stabbed and tossed into a quarry and to see if they can solve the crime.There is not a lot of personal advancement in either Kinsey's involvement with her family nor in Henry's life, but there are a few parts devoted to those issues and they whet your appetite enough to want more.A great read, nice ending, and nice teasing on the personal side to want the next book to come out soon."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"So many authors write decreasingly well as time goes on, no doubt burning out from the pressure to write a blockbuster each year.

A good friend of his, Stacey Oliphant, who is retired from the Sheriff's office had worked the case with him. In fact, they had actually found the body while on a hunting trip. Stacey has had cancer, and Con feels like he needs something to keep him interested in living. Solving this case would help.Kinsey agreed to help them with the case. While taking a look at the Quarry where the body had been dumped, she inadvertently found out that the property belongs to her grandmother, whom she has never met, and is not sure she wants to meet. This in turn, leads to unplanned meetings with a cousin and an aunt.There was a mustang that was found wrecked and abandoned not far from where the body was found. The car had been stolen from an automotive repair shop in Quorum, CA. The original owner decided that he did not want the wrecked car back and gave it to the owner of the auto repair place. So, Kinsey and Con Dolan went to Quorum to see if there was possibly any evidence still in the car that might relate to the Jane Doe. Upon locating the car, they discovered that it had been garaged and never fixed up since the accident. They discovered what appeared to be blood stains in the trunk, and had the car impounded.Kinsey felt the Jane Doe may have been from the area, so she began talking to dentists that had been in practice in the area at the time. She finally got a match to a patient named Charisse Quinn. A forensic specialist confirmed that her x-rays matched the teeth of Jane Doe.The prime suspect for the murder, Frankie Miracle, had actually been sent to prison for murdering his wife in a similar manner. He had been arrested not too far from where the body was found. In her investigation, Kinsey had talked to Pudgie Clifton, who had spent time in a jail cell with Frankie. Pudgie was later found dead, and Frankie was suspected of this murder as well.You will need to read to book yourself to find out exactly who did it!

Like some other reviewers, it took me almost a week to finish the fiction-based-on-fact story of a long ago, unsolved murder in Santa Teresa (Santa Barbara). I felt the descriptions were way too detailed and I, too, grew weary of descriptions of the inside of bars, houses, shops and garages. It was as if no editing took place....that every thought, word, scene was left in from the first draft.What saved this story for me was to finally find out something about Kinsey's family. Those parts, while at times tedious, were worth the effort. I hope Grafton will pursue this sub-plot in future volumes.I admire Grafton for being able to sustain a series through 16 books.

Kinsey Milhone neither wallows or whinesbecause of her solitary state but is committed to helping two oldfriends unravel the murder of an unidentified woman eighteen years ago. Her resolve is unflappable and she begins to develop relationships within her own extended family which do not threaten her independent nature. Dolan and Stacey Oliphant are new characters, one a retired officer, the other a detectivewho will ingratiate themselves with readers because of their affable bickering and bantering. Despite an abrupt climax, Kinsey is in top form and Sue Grafton continues to brightly shinein the competitive arena of detective fiction.I can't wait for the rousing \\" R\\" in the series !"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"In Q is for Quarry, Grafton returns to her character, California P.I. Kinsey Millhone. Set sometime during the 80s (I think - I've never quite been sure what decade Grafton is writing in), Kinsey is enlisted by two retired cops to revisit an 18-year-old mystery: the murder of a young Jane Doe that was never solved and continues to haunt the investigators on the case. Intermingled with the mystery are vignettes of Kinsey's private life, including her stormy relationship with her relatives, a visit with her neighbor, and personal conversations with the Con Dolan and Stacey Oliphant, the two retired police officers working the case with her.Sue Grafton has, indeed, done it again - unfortunately. I suppose it's understandable that, after 17 letters of the alphabet, the format is going to get tired, but I'm still highly disappointed in this installment of the Millhone series. The \\"mystery\\" is boring. Kinsey has become preachy. When she's not doing detective work, she's busy preaching to both Dolan and Oliphant about their unhealthy lifestyles. I could see from the beginning of the book that Dolan would end up in the hospital with heart problems - Grafton just about nailed up a neon sign that screamed it throughout the book. Kinsey's dry wit and cynical view on life is no longer amusing, and her detective skills, when compared to some other perennial favorite characters like Stephanie Plum, Goldy Schulz, and J. P. Beaumont, are no longer impressive. Kinsey, still stuck living in the 80s, has long been surpassed by far more interesting and better written books. Sorry, Ms. Grafton, I just don't know if I can stick out the rest of the alphabet with you.Note: The mystery is, in fact, based on a real unsolved case that Grafton has managed to reopen. However, Grafton's fictional solution to the case is ultimately unsatisfying and uncreative. While basing the book on a real case will help her hype factor, it does nothing for me. It only makes the book more unpleasant - I don't really like reading about a real murder victim... I can turn on the news any day and hear about those."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I used to love the alphabet series.

That's fine, but there's a concentration on junk food and health, not to mention smoking, that I don't associate with the '80s. Kinsey spends most of the book shuttling around the California desert with two old male detectives in very poor health and they go from one fast food binge to another. I couldn't get very interested in the mystery, and Kinsey seems more numb and dead-ended than usual as she, yet again, refuses to deal with her mystery family. It's getting hard to care.

I was quite disappointed to find it not nearly as entertaining as any of the previous entries. I have to agree with the other reviewers voicing the opinion that the author is feeling pressed to keep churning out these books.I thought the characters were one-dimensional and I couldn't get into the story. I read all of the other books in a day or so, but it took me two weeks to get through this one. Definitely not a page-turner. There was little involvement of Kinsey's landlord (Henry) and his sister-in-law Rosie, who I particularly like. To me, the book was flat and I got the impression that the author was just &quot;phoning it in.&quot; I will continue to read Grafton to see if the next effort is better, as I have liked her work a lot up til now."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"A body is found in a Quarry (Q, right), and is linked to a disappearance of a teenage girl 18 years previously. Kinsey Milhone links up with 2 retired police officers to track down the killer. The book is full of details that detracted, rather than helped, me as I read along. There are too many characters in the story, many of of them interlinked to each other in really complex ways. At one point, I almost had the urge to make a chart of them all and draw arrows, etc to make sense of who was who. In any event, when the identity of the killer is revealed, I was relieved....this book was beginning to sap my patience, and I was about to put it down and give up on it. This is the first Sue Grafton/Kinsey Milhone book I have read. I may just try one more book of hers, before I give up on her."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I've only read 2 books in Grafton's Kinsey Milhone series so far, \\"P is for Peril\\" and \\"Q is for Quarry.\\" I found \\"Q is for Quarry\\" to be a very entertaining read.The premise for the book is based on a real case from the Santa Barbara, CA Police Files of 1969. There was a real Jane Doe found in a quarry in Lompoc, and to this day no one has identified her. The concept of taking a \\"cold case\\" from 18 years ago and trying to resolve it was an interesting twist on the usual mystery plot. Grafton disclaims up front that although she used actual case notes and materials for her research, that the plot line and elements of the story are fiction. With that being said, you go into the story knowing this could have happened, reopening a cold case cold be done, and you could conceivably solve it.Kinsey Milhone has partners in crime solving in this book, Conrad Dolan and Stacey Oliphant, two brother officers who were around when the crime originally took place in 1969. Stacey is dying and has contacted Conrad (Con) to help solve the crime. Con seeks out Kinsey and the 3 of them go off to search out the leads that will take them to the answer of what really happened and why.In the Epilogue, Ms. Grafton writes about how they went about exhuming the remains of Jane Doe, how a forensics specialist was involved to recreate a facial likeness of the victim, and how the experience of writing a book based on a real crime affected her personally. At the end of the book there is a page with photos of the forensics artist's rendering of what the victim may have looked liked, based on the mandible and maxilla bones that were taken from the crime scene.The California desert provides a perfect setting for hiding or supressing secrets. That backdrop has been used in many books, such as Dean Koontz's \\"Odd Thomas,\\" to add an extra element of drama to the already suspensful plot. As the vast wasteland of secrets and hidden dreams, it made perfect sense for Grafton to set part of the book in one of the more remote locations of southeast California. I thought it worked well and added a nice twist to the storyline.Overall, I would recommend this book as an interesting read. If you can get past the ridiculous amount of junk food the characters consume, which seems beyond extreme, you will find this to be a good read and worth the time invested."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Q fits in just fine for readers familiar with the alphabet as rendered by Sue Grafton. There are aspects of each book that we have pretty much come to expect over time, and Q doesn't disappoint us. Or at least me.Q begins with a pair of retired- not by choice- police detectives hoping to \\"save\\" each other by reminding their friend of the good they can do. Kinsey is hired by a chainsmoking, heaving drinking Con to do the legwork on an 18 old murder case that was left unsolved by the cancer ridden Stacy. Each believes the other needs something to look forward to in order to survive- and maybe they're both right. Kinsey takes the case because the pair of \\"old guys\\" remind her of her Private Investigator Mentor/trainers and she seems to feel a little lonely for them.Kinsey almost immediately learns of a few things that were overlooked during the original investigation, or were given too much importance. She and Con are led off toward Arizona where Kinsey's intuition and persistance lead to an unexpected conclusion of the case.Some of the things we've grown to expect over the almost 20 years we've been able to read Kinsey's history are nicely present in Q. Kinsey invariably forms a rather close relationship with her employer- better if it's old guys. Her sexy landlord is on the fringes of the novel but a key part of her life, while her disappointing sex life helps keep her hands off him. Her family of origin has slowly crept in a little bit more- very slowly- but her \\"family\\" continues to be the people she chooses to be with on a regular basis. She is curious about her roots, but not so curious as to actively pursue a relationship with her cousins and aunts. She seems to have completely gotten over her two ex-husbands and is better about keeping away from temptation in the form of men who can't decide if they're committed elsewhere.As usual, the suspect is someone unexpected and Kinsey almost always risks an attack while apprehending them. Generally it's someone she has been trusting- what a heartbreak that must be for her. Even knowing this will be the case, I'm almost always pleased with the way we learn the villan's identity since there is always something sinister going on around the discovery."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I have read the entire series to date and greatly anticipate the release of each one...however I was disappointed with P. Because of that I was leary of Q...and wonderfully surprised. I felt that Q brought back the pace that I felt was missing in P. If you felt P was missing something...Q is better...trust me."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"This was quite a different Kinsey book, but I too enjoyed it. I liked the idea that is was based on a real unsolved crime, and I just hope that that crime is solved as a result of this book. Kinsey is very likeable in this book. She is much softer and more friendly. Heavens, we see her friends with her nemesis Dolan in this book, and it seems to work. There may not have been as much as non-stop excitement in this book as we've seen in others, but let's be fair - it's good to give Kinsey a little rest from bad people and life threats. Besides, she is working on solving a twenty year old crime, so how dangerous could that be? It was also good to get a good glimpse of small town America, the setting for this book. I missed her neighbour Henry and Rosie the owner of her neighbourhood restaurant in this book, but I'm sure they'll be back."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"And so is Sue Grafton after her last two books didn't seem worthy of their predecessors. Here she seems back in the swing of things and reinvigorated. Perhaps it's because the story revolves around an actual unsolved 1969 Jane Doe murder in Santa Barbara, that has haunted the author. Whatever is was, she's created an interesting and engaging case, while introducing two new detectives who seem to serve up comic relief more than anything else. No matter, the book felt familiar again and for people who felt like I have that the last couple of letters weren't the best, you might want to try this one. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I found G is for Gumshoe--then-wanted to start at the beginning....and picked up 'A---and now Q'.

County-so seeing street names of environs that are 'home' to me-even though my memory is dim just adds to the already Great webs she weaves.PLEASE! Just 'keep on-keepin' on!!'"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"For many reasons, it is always difficult for a new reader to start with a new novel in the middle of a well-established series by a best selling author. Thus it is important for readers of this review to understand that I have no background in the letters of this series from A to P. In fact, despite my wife's high praise for several of the earlier books, I had decided that I was already overwhelmed enough by the output of several other of my favorite authors writing in the mystery/dectective genre (I recommend that you sample Robert Parker and John Lescroart if you have not) and did not need to try to catch up with a series on it's seventeenth book. However, my curiosity combined with the hook of this novel being based on an actual twenty-three year old unsolved murder case (of a still unidentified victim) stimulated my interest and I decided to read the book after my wife had finished it.In summary, there was much that I liked about the book, but overall I was mildly disppointed and that is the reason for my rating. First, the positives - I liked Kinsey Millhone a lot (perhaps partly because I am a runner and fast food addict myself), and felt that Sue Grafton did a more than adequate job of providing some summary of Kinsey's character development and personal history as the series had developed but also cleverly weaving in new background info for long time readers. I also liked Lieutenant Con Dolan and Detective Stacey Oliphant, and thought that the personal detail and interplay among the characters was interesting and fun. And I thought that as a pure police procedural with all the intimate real life detail that is often involved in dectective work the book was first rate and highly recommend it to readers who enjoy such stories.So, why only three stars? First it was a little slow moving for me, not too long, just too little true suspense and uncertainty. I didn't really get involved until roughly the last one hundred pages. Usually I tend to read such books almost nonstop, my wife was amazed that I spaced this one over several days. As I realized that this was not a book that I could unreservedly and enthusiastically recommend to my friends and thought about my reaction after finishing it, I think it was more complex than the lack of action. First, perhaps my expectations were just too high and since my relationship as a reader with Kinsey was not that of an old friend, this was not a visit that I started with a lot of background comfort. But, most importantly, my conclusion and my warning to other readers is that in retrospect what most excited me about the book before reading it was in the end bound to disappoint me. That is, here is a true murder case that we all have a lingering hope can still be solved, or at the least the victim identified. Yet, of course, when you finish the book the one thing of which you are sure is that none of this speculation is what really happened; we are at the end of the story but in truth there is no conclusion. I wanted to know what really happened and I did't. I did not anticipate or initially understand this outcome, but preparing to write this review made me realize that was the case for me.Despite my disappointment, kudos to the author for her effort, and we can all hope that her publicity of the case and work with a forensic artist to provide a facial reconstruction of the actual victim and publicity in connection with a bestseller will lead to some progress in her identification. And, now I will read at least one more Kinsey Millhone book to see how much I enjoy meeting her again as she usesher detective skills to solve a fictional case where my desire for the \\"real truth\\" won't get in the way"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I have read almost all of Grafton's alphabet novels. I was worried that it took me so long to get hooked -- I was some 120 pages into it before I felt the plot really took off -- but the suspense definitely builds in the second half, and the somewhat plodding character development that dominates the first half of the book finally pays off. A worthwhile read -- just stick with it."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone is at it again. Brought into a case that is 18 years old, she tries to discover the identity of a young woman who was murdered, her body found in a quarry. But Kinsey's investigation stirs up something that no one anticipated. Two additional murders make the supposedly cold case hot again.Grafton's Kinsey Millhone is a well defined character that followers of this series rely upon for her intuition and intelligence. This is a super addition to the long line of \\"alphabet\\" murder mysteries.The only question is...what happens when Kinsey reaches the \\"Z\\"enith in her case file? Will we start over again? Or is it all over for Kinsey Millhone?"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"This novel is like a slow baseball game with two announcers, one giving the play-by-play and the other giving color commentary - in this case long descriptions of passing scenery, people, restaurant menus, etc. This is the 17th novel about private investigator Kinsey Millhone in the fictional city of Santa Teresa, California (set geographically in the location of the real life Santa Barbara). In this case, she teams up with Lieutenant Con Dolan, on medical disability from the Santa Teresa Police Department, and retired Dectective Stacey Oliphant of the Santa Teresa County Sheriff's Office.The time setting is early in 1987. Kinsey is helping out on an 18-year old unsolved murder case. Con and Stacey had been the men who discovered the body, and they are interested in closing out the case. A new look at the case reveals new evidence. The play-by-play is interesting, but the color commentary seems a bit excessive and makes the story drag. Along the way, Kinsey discovers additional information about her mother's family. A major part of the story is the rehabilitation of Con and Stacey.The novel has some motion picture potential, where the side commentary could be covered visually. As an added feature, look in the back of the book for the forensic reconstruction of an unidentified murder victim that the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Office would like help in identifying."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"After thoroughly enjoying \\"O is for Outlaw\\" and \\"P is for Peril,\\" I expected that this would be another great entry in the series. Sadly, it isn't. The \\"mystery\\" doesn't mystify us at all -- about halfway into the story, the identity of and motivation for the killer are obvious to everyone but Kinsey. (In fact, I wondered why Grafton didn't spend more time justifying why Kinsey didn't see the obvious, since she's usually at least the reader's equal in figuring out the case. Here, she's several steps behind all the way through.) Although I agree that most cases that a private detective would work on would be this simple and require just legwork (in contrast to the stories in \\"O\\" and \\"P\\" that required some top-notch deduction skills), that doesn't mean I have to like it or want to read it.In the absence of a mystery, we have a character study. OK, I can live with that, because I'm fascinated with Kinsey's complex character, and this book opens with the prospect that we may get real development on that front. Her investigation causes Kinsey to interact with her family, and she learns things that Aunt Gin never told her ... but, halfway through the book, this storyline simply disappears. I found it very hard to believe that Kinsey isn't even thinking about this any longer, especially when she has so many discussions with others about their families and choices. In many ways, this is the least-believable part of the story.The other character study is of the two aging police officers who hired Kinsey for this job: recurring character Con Dolan, now on medical disability following two heart attacks, and retired country sheriff's detective (and cancer survivor) Stacey Oliphant. These two characters are the real focus of the book, and Sue Grafton has gone out of her way to provide us with their backstory. Perhaps she intends for them to be recurring characters, since developments in Henry's life (following a cruise) may lead to Kinsey needing a new place to stay. If not, she certainly has wasted a lot of energy on these two for this to be their only appearance. (By the way, I remember LOTS of controversy in this time period about both smoking and fast food, so I think the book is pretty accurate on that count.)Overall rating: mystery: 1 star, Kinsey's development: 2 stars, supporting characters: 4 stars. 7 divided by 3 is less than 2.5, but I still gave the book 3 stars. Nevertheless, this is one of the weaker books in this series.I hope they solve the Jane Doe murder that inspired this book, but I hope even more fervently that Sue Grafton doesn't use any more \\"real\\" stories for her inspiration."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I couldn't believe some of the negative reviews on this book as I thought it was one of Grafton's better ones.This time, Kinsey is doing some investigating for two old and ill friends of hers, Dolan and Stacey. They are retired cops and never were able to solve a mystery of a \\"Jane Doe\\" that happened so many years back. Who was the girl, and above all, who killed her? Kinsey of course gets involved in this whole scenario, and pulls out all of the stops investigating every little corner.She starts with schools and dentists to try to find out who \\"Jane Doe\\" really was. As her probing continues, she gets more and more concrete facts together, and then becomes suspicous of people during her travels for these facts.Of course, toward the end, (I don't want to spoil it), Kinsey gets too close to the real killer, and just might get herself into a bad situation she may not be able to get out of without a struggle.The question is, did Justine, an old friend help in the murder? Or was it Pugee, Johnny Miracle, or Cornell? Kinsey knows it's one of the three. And one of these guys are chasing Kinsey toward the end."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I've read every novel in the Kinsey Millhone alphabet series, but this one was sub-par, at best. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great, either. The writing lacked the kick it usually has, and the setting was dull. Also, without giving away the ending, the motives behind the young woman's murder were incredibly disappointing. I was expecting more after spending 350 pages delving into the lives of such a colorful array of characters. I was like, &quot;That was it...?&quot; The ending was hastily written, too. It ended virtually mid-sentence. The facial reconstructions of the real-life Jane Done was a nice touch, though. I suppose diehard Kinsey fans will like this one, but I'm one of those diehard fans and I was quite let down. Let's hope 'R' is better."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I can hardly wait until each new offering is available. They are scooped up as they debut. My brother and sister feel the same."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Some of the other reviewers have said Kinsey's personality changed in this book, but I didn't notice that. What I did notice, however, was a lengthy story that plodded along at a much slower pace than most of the alphabet books. Kinsey did express some disgust with Hungarian cooking, for the first time.I'm sorry, but I couldn't get very excited about a couple of old retired cops re-opening an 18 year old murder case. I used to enjoy the antagonism between Kinsey and Con Dolan, but in this book, it was if they were lifelong best friends. There was little tension in the entire book until the very end, which went out with a bit of a wimper.As a side note, I sensed as I was reading the book that Ms Grafton may be tiring of writing the series, and this may be her last book. I hope not."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"So many authors write decreasingly well as time goes on, no doubt burning out from the pressure to write a blockbuster each year. Sue Grafton is *not* in this category. I thoroughly enjoyed Q is for Quarry and think it is just as good -- and probably better -- than earlier works (which for the most part I also enjoyed). This witty and fast paced book tells the story of Kinsey teaming up with two retired police detectives -- good buddies, each of whom has health problems that the other worries about -- to solve a &quot;cold&quot; case of a teenage girl found dead near a quarry. No-one knows who the victim is, let alone who killed her or why. The characterization is very vivid, particularly the emphasis on the friendship between the detectives. This is wittier than some of Sue Grafton's earlier works. The plotting is excellent, although (and perhaps I was reading too quickly) I sometimes couldn't figure out quite how they got from A to B -- although much of the plot does involve following hunches.I sent my copy on to a person who doesn't read mysteries -- I hope she makes an exception for this one."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I enjoyed this book from start to finish. Kinsey and her two pals were engaging and the plot kept me guessing to the very end. Grafton vividly captures the desert town atmosphere. She even throws in a few good laughs in here and there for good measure. Not crazy about the family stuff though. Like Kinsey better as a loner. Welcome addition to the series. Well done."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"This was my first Kinsey (and Grafton) novel and just reading the summary convinced me to give it a try. And I was unable to put the book down (I went through the whole thing in just little over 2 days)! I have read two more Kinsey novels (N and P) since and, tho I enjoyed them greatly as well, I still deem Q to be my fave. It is so much different than many of the other mysteries I've read-- for one, you don't even know who the victim is--let alone the murderer(s). Another is its basis upon a true unsolved murder (and Grafton's close work with the real detectives of that murder), which made a novel that's believable--not absurdly farfetched.I was only mildly disappointed in the part where Kinsey's family history was involved--it didn't seemed to be adequately tied in enough with the main plot, and I find myself thinking \\"C'mon already, get over this, so I can continue figuring out whodunit!\\" But otherwise an outstanding read."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Grafton starts out with a good plot and quickly loses her thread. This story is based for a moment on a true case. A body of a young woman was found dead in a quarry over 20 yrs ago. She has never been claimed or identified. Compounding the case is in this era, many young people fled their lives for a new start in San Francisco with the flower power. Sadly Grafton spends her yarn so far out, she has a hard time catching the end and wrapping up the story. Kinsey is introduced to her family again, befriends two old time cops and heads off on a road trip. This was not necessary to the story and weighed it down in unnecessary dialogue. The mystery she created around this discovery of thebody was strong and believable. It fit with the time period of the death and the results still affect people's lives today. It seems lately either when an author becomes established or the editor uses a spell check program a lot of editing is left ndone. If this book would of been stripped down to the mystery it would of been a hit. But since I had to read so many passages but family misgivings and people wanting a second chance I lost interest."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Books like this make me think &quot;If this is all it takes to become a successful writer, I am in the WROOOONG business!&quot;Plot is horrible.

Thanks for having it available."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I was puzzled by the story inserted about Kinsey's family background. It never was resolved. It was the only interesting aspect of the book."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"\\"Q is for Quarry\\" by Sue Grafton\\"Q is for Quarry\\" by Sue Grafton, is the seventeenth in her alphabetical series that began back in 1983 with \\"A is for Alibi.\\" I think I might have broken some kind of record reading through them when I first discovered her books 3 years ago. I read them as I could get my hands on them...some in sequence and some out of sequence.On a personal aside, I can't resist a little brag here. When Sue Grafton was in Phoenix on her \\"P is for Peril\\" book tour, I got the opportunity to sit in with Debbie Neckel on the interview. In her books there is a Hungarian character named Rosie who owns a little tavern and serves up Hungarian food that is often delicious but sometimes unpronounceable and scary to the uninitiated. And I, having been initiated by real-life Rosies, including my own Grandmother, thought Sue might enjoy some authentic Hungarian recipes for her next book. She really was tickled to get them and was gracious enough to mention my name in the Acknowledgements of \\"Quarry.\\" I was so excited I thought I'd die!! So that's my little aside, now back to the review.All of the Kinsey Millhone mysteries can stand alone but it's kind of fun to read them in sequence, especially once you become familiar with her close friends and not so close family. Here again is wonderful series that is a refuge for those who enjoy adventure but cling to the familiar.And, in that respect, we can indulge our favorite writers when they deviate from their familiar format and try something new...as Sue Grafton has done with \\"Q.\\" So, while we still have the comfortable ambiance and friendly companions, we have a story that is based on an actual unsolved mystery.Knowing this made me wonder if the fictional murder would also be left unsolved, in which case the reader would be left with too many questions...too many loose ends at the end. But, I needn't have worried. Grafton is a writer that you can trust; she not only lets you in on all of her clues as the case unfolds, she never pulls suspects out of thin air and always wraps up the case in a reasonable manner. I even figured out one of the clues before Kinsey did! And, since outcomes are so much easier to control in fiction than in life, in \\"Q\\" the mystery does get solved.The event that this story was taken from involved the murder of an unidentified female whose body had been found in a California quarry back in 1969. Although detectives spent many man-hours working on the case, the body was never identified, nor was the killer found. Grafton became fascinated with the idea for her new book and that, in turn, sparked a renewed interest in the case, which eventually led to the body being exhumed. Then a forensic sculpture was brought in to reconstruct a likeness of the victim's face. Photos of the girl appear at the back of the book in hope that someone will be able to identify her, which could lead to a solution of the crime.Back to \\"Quarry.\\" In it we find Kinsey Millhone once again narrating her own adventure. She has a way of drawing you in and by page three you feel like you've known her all your life! Kinsey reveals that she is now thirty-eight and while she guards her independence, she is feeling a bit lonely. So, when two old acquaintances decide to look into an 18 year old unsolved mystery, she happily agrees to join them.Con Doyle and Stacey Oliphant had been partners back when case originally surfaced; now they are both retired and eager to find something to keep their minds alive while nature whittles away at their bodies with all sorts of old age aliments.The clues take our trio to several small towns near the Arizona border where they interview folks who may have known the victim and thus the murderer. It's always amazing to watch detectives as they work backwards from the little that is known and to see the pieces begin to fall into place and the puzzle takes shape.In the process, small town secrets are exposed and old wounds are opened. Long forgotten relationships are brought back to mind, rekindling anger and raising tempers to the point where killers generally make that fatal mistake...the mistake that eventually puts them away. And it's her patient, sometimes tedious detective work that allows Kinsey to be in the nail-biting conclusion.It's at this point we even get a glimpse into what may be the dark side of Sue Grafton...not in the Patricia Caldwell sense but more in the MASH vein... no pun intended. You'll get what I mean when you read it.As always, throughout her books, fans find themselves smiling at Kinsey's quirks. She loves tiny, closed in places...she's not self-conscious...though she makes few friends, she has a fierce sense of loyalty that is often born of a childhood that suffered great loss...she eats peanut butter and pickle sandwiches...and she gave me the courage to chop unruly chunks out of my own hair when I can't get to the Cut and Curl.It's one thing to write funny scenes in a story but it's another to keep the humor and tone throughout the entire book, book after book. Grafton has that knack and she's continues to keep us hooked.If there's any read more satisfying than a well-written mystery, at this point in time, I haven't found it. And for one of the best writers in the genre, Sue Grafton can be relied upon to deliver the goods.Start with A is for Alibi and read through Q...by then \\"R\\" should be just about ready for release.Maggie Harding[]"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"It's taken me a while to cozy up to Kinsey, but I'm there now. Kinsey is sharp, but has a definite edge to her personality. I haven't always been sure I like her, but she's a great detective and, though she often finds herself in a bind while solving a crime, she manages cleverly to get herself out of what ever fix she's in.

Kinsey Milhorne, I was very disappointed in this book. There are so many characters ,I was hardly able to keep up with who was who, and why, and none of them were appealing anyway. In this book, Kinsey teams up with her old pal, Con ,from the police force.He later has the heart attack he too obviously deserves from all the overly mentioned cigarette smoking and alcohol imbibing.A third member of the ensuing investigation and a close friend and mentor of Con's, Sheriff's Dept. retiree, Stacey Oliphant, is dying of cancer. Con feels if the three of them join forces to solve an old case of Stacey's, it will pull him out of his depressed state and give him something to think about .The setting , mainly in windblown, dreary, one horse, mobile home towns with names like Creosote,AZ or was it CA? did nothing for me either.Hope Grafton can have a rest between books and rejuvenate her high spirits which are probably evident in her main character."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"In Sue Grafton's \\"Q\\", Kinsey Millhone joins forces with two retired cops to solve a twenty-year-old murder. While Kinsey works through old clues she serves as peace maker for her partners. With Millhone on the job, new leads emerge from the old. Bit by bit, a picture of the \\"Jane Doe\\" materializes, and new information comes to light. \\"Q\\" is another winner for the talented alphabet series author."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Please let me start out by saying that I do admire what Sue Grafton HAS done with this book; i.e., start a process that may finally solve an old murder and bring closure to the the parents, relatives, friends, et al of the unfortunate girl. This is very admirable.With that said, I have found that this books lacks the zest, the non-stop fast-paced plotting of many of the earlier books in the series. It took a long, long time getting going, with a lot of exposition, and the sub-plot about the continuing revalation of information about Kinsey's own family really added nothing at all to the plot. It was like a story-within-a-story, with each totally unrelated to the other.Of course when an author has a built-in following with a series as long as this one, there is a little more room for fleshing-out the tale because the pressure to come up with something that editors will find worth the money and effort to put into print is non-existant. But, unlike many of the other titles in the series, this one was definitely not a page-turner. In fact, I put it down for days at a time. There was no \\"can't wait to find out what happens next\\" element in this novel.Sue Grafton is certainly a gifted writer, and anything she puts out in certainly worth readng, so I will probably buy \\"R\\" when it first comes out in hardcover, but if it moves as slowly as this one, I'll probably wait for the subsequent books to come out in paperback."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I have read all of the Kinsey Millhone novels, but this one left a bad taste in my mouth. I think Sue Grafton needs to recharge and get back to the Kinsey we all know and love."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"This is a series well worth reading in chronological order because you then get the unfolding story of Kinsey Milhone. In this one a lot more about her origins turns up. It's set in 1987 with Kinsey now 36.The action of P is for Peril took place earlier in the same year.(A is for Alibi was published in 1982).Compared with other Graftons this is more of a police procedural, centering on discovering the identity of an unknown girl whose body had been found 17 years previously.Although I'm a devoted fan I can understand the objections of those who crtiticize her for slowness. She loves to set every scene in detail, and whenever Kinsey travels from one place to another the journey gets described. For example you get passages like &quot;I parked in the lot in a space marked VISITOR. I locked the car and trotted across the flattened grass to the entrance, pushing through the double glass doors and into the main corridor...&quot; Elmore Leonard would have had his character in and out of that building by now, but I wouldn't want Grafton writing any differently; the result of all that describing is complete and vivid realism."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"This was an excellent book. I enjoyed the addition of the two retired detectives, their interactions with each other and how they accepted Kinsey and her quirks without question. I thought I had this one figured out until the ending, which was a surprise to me. I look forward to the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I am generally an avid Kinsey fan, eagerly awaiting her next adventure. Unfortunately, she has very little adventure in this plodding, time wasting effort. The book never drew me in, and took far too much effort to describe every little detail of every place the characters were. The fact that it was inspired by a true story is not enough to make this a worthwhile investment of your time. I am a detective book freak, and have read thousands of novels, this is one that I should have skipped. However, given her track record, I am still going to give the next Kinsey novel a try, but that's a fan for you."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I always look forward to a new Sue Grafton mystery around this time of year. Q is for Quarry does not disappoint.Grafton has constructed her story loosely around a true story of a woman who was murdered and left unidentified for the last 30 odd years. She thoroughly researched the unsolved murder which she eventually evolved into Q is for Quarry. While the foundation is real, Grafton turns the case over to Kinsey at her fictional best.In Quarry, Kinsey Milhone (the barely aging private eye who works out of Santa Teresa, California) is teamed with two rather sick and elderly cops who were at the scene of a murder many years earlier. As their own careers come to an end, they would like to \\"close the case\\" on the unidentified woman from the early years of their career, and, they ask Kinsey for help.The story is a delight. The two cops who ask for Kinsey's help are like The Odd Couple with poor health. One suffers from a heart attack during the investigation and the other is waiting to die (only to be told his cancer is in remission). They are serious detectives but classically funny characters. Kinsey, always at her best, deals the deck she is given to play and works with these guys like one of their old buddies.The story is unpredictable, yet ultimately logical. Unlike its real life counterpart, Kinsey closes the case. (Sadly, the real woman on whom the story was based, continues to be an unknown victim.)I enjoy Sue Grafton's novels because of the wonderful character she has realized in her loving creation of Kinsey Milhone. Kinsey has become a comfortable friend over the years. As a reader, I feel as if she is real (quick reality check disclaimer -- I know she is not!) I know her family story, her quirks, her favorite food and her eccentricities. While not the most contemporary cop with all the latest high tech toys and tricks, Kinsey is an enjoyable and tough sleuth. I am always in the rooting box giving her encouragement to take the next step. Grafton makes sure she does.Highly recommended. If you have never read any of Sue Grafton's novels, this is as good a place to start as any. Once hooked, you can go back and enjoy 17 earlier stories that revolve around Kinsey Milhone. Go for it!James J.

If you live in California, as I do, and know the Santa Barbara area in which most of Grafton's books are situated, it makes the reading doubly interesting.One of the many neat aspects of this alphabet series of hers is that Kinsey changes over time, and characters, 'issues,' dangers, and themes recur. Milhone's character has deepened; this is no cardboard P.I.Read it - and read all the rest. Best to start at the beginning, but you don't have to slog through A thru P in order to enjoy Q.

Second, Kinsey actually is cooperating with someone for a change, in this case two retired cops. Third, Q is for Quarry is more procedure, detail, and plot based than are A thru P. This one is based on an old murder case, a dead girl found in a quarry. Kinsey has grown up a bit since we first met her in A is for Alibi, and it's all good.

However, Kinsey has regained her brains, and the novel gives us several welcome new departures, including a change of venue and deepening friendships with a couple of old, sickly cops whose odd-couple relationship is well characterized. We also learn more about Kinsey's background and family, and Aunt &quot;Gin&quot; is getting to be less likeable with each revelation.Kinsey's still too much &quot;lawn-order&quot; for my sensibilities, but I suppose that's consistent with what she does for a living. At least she acts intelligently in this book, not with the abysmal stupidity of P IS FOR PERIL, and it's a good read, with a plot based loosely on an unsolved case of the 1960s. I'm sure I wasn't the only reader who felt compassion for the unknown real-life Jane Doe, murdered so many years ago, and the family from whom she permanently disappeared."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I've read all of the Alphabet series books, and there are some I like better than others. &quot;Q is for Quarry&quot; isn't my favorite, but it's still a good read. Maybe it's me, but I'm a little tired of the ongoing theme with Kinsey's family. I like Kinsey alone and edgy, independent and brassy. I think Grafton does this genre better than any other author out there and will always read her books. She's an intelligent writer with a good sense of story who provides great characters. She manages to stay fresh with each book, something a lot of bestsellers can't seem to manage. She's tops in my book!"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Like many of the other reviewers here, I've read all the Kinsey Millhone &quot;alphabet series&quot;. I've found a couple of the more recent books a little less interesting than the earlier mysteries, but I found &quot;Q is for Quarry&quot; to be right up there with Grafton's best. Maybe you do need to read these books starting with &quot;A&quot;. This time I particularly noticed one of the things I love about Grafton's writing. She puts so many trivial but interesting details in the story, and many of them aren't there to provide clues about the outcome, just to provide background material about the characters in the story. In fact, I think Grafton is getting better and better at doing this. The result is a story line that brings you along with Kinsey, noticing the things she notices, allowing you to inhabit the story to some extent. Too many of the mysteries on the market can be figured out just by noticing which minor details the authors make a point of telling you. Grafton never does this. I'm giving this five stars, not because I think the book is the literary equivalent of War and Peace, but because I think Grafton continues to write some of the most idosyncratic and fascinating mysteries around."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I've read all of the books to date in this series and while I still enjoy reading them, they have become decreasingly entertaining. This book in particular has a very slow start and seems to get bogged down in pointless details (Do I need to know yet again that Kinsey forces herself out of bed for her 6:00am run?) I like the premise of the book, an unsolved crime, but it takes too long to get going. Overall an average read."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I really like Kinsey Millhone, and I honestly really like what Grafton has been doing with the character. It's tough to keep the interest up for as many books as she has done and I think that she really deserves credit for doing as well as she has done.If it sounds as though I'm darning this book with faint praise, then I guess that I am.I like Kinsey Millhone, I like Grafton's writing, but this book made me (for all its strengths) a little bit tired. The Millhone can't collaborate vibe is getting a little old, as is the dancing around about her family. I appreciated the change of scenery and the story was mostly interesting, but it felt a little bit like treading water to me.If you like the rest of the series, this one is worth reading.

Of over 380 pages don't think there was dialogue on 200. I felt it was a history of a lot of small towns in southern California and certainly didn't need the information about all the bars and restaurants.The same goes for the description of the characters, i.e. facial hair, etc as well as clothing and the conditons in their living quarters. The story line was weak and certainly not of the caliber of previous books. A disappointment."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Is it my imagination or is Kinsey losing her spark? Everyone she connected with in this story, every place she visited, the storyline -- was gray, gray, gray. I missed her witty asides and sardonic musings. It's like the vibrant, funny Kinsey disappeared and was replaced by a character who's just dragging herself from page to page before she thankfully, painfully gets to the end of the story. I expect the next book to find her in a nursing home room exchanging reminiscenses with her two colorless and uninteresting buddies in this lackluster story. And what's with the description of every hole in the wall she goes to -- was the author running out of enough action to propel the story and had to do something to come up with the requisite 50,000 or so words? I'm worried about what's going to happen to the aging Kinsey. She seems to be running out of steam. I'll keep checking on her as the series progresses because I've been hanging in there since the beginning; I just hope the author takes Kinsey's pulse and puts her on some vitamins for the next go-round."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"The book's premise is utterly fascinating and heartbreaking, and Grafton does a solid job of fleshing it out. The subplot regarding Kinsey's family was also enjoyable. Overall, however, the book was a bit tedious -- it was very heavy on description, some of which felt like padding. Kinsey's sidekicks -- two retired detectives who are both seriously ill -- were particuarly uninteresting and depressing. If the first five or six books in the series are 5s, I would give this one about a 3 and 1/2."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I've read and enjoyed all of Sue Grafton's alphabet series until now, but this one has broken the string. It's just plain poorly written. The plot and characters strike a totally false note, and the story never gets going. This book is simply unreadable."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Author Sue Grafton and voice performer Judy Kaye are a premium pair - both topnotch in their fields.Actress Kaye, who has recorded all of Grafton's best-selling alphabetically determined tales, unfailingly gives high energy readings, inhabiting the fast-talking, sometimes sarcastic personality of the author's heroine, Kinsey Millhone.\\"Q Is For Quarry,\\" the 17th in this series, takes its inspiration from a murder case that has gone unsolved since 1969. An unidentified white female became another in the lengthening list of \\"Jane Does\\" when her decomposed remains were found near Highway 1 in California.It is known she was young, and her hands were tied. Her throat was slashed.Thanks to Grafton's interest in the case, there have recently been renewed efforts on the part of law enforcement officials. After the exhumation of the body a forensic artist did the facial reconstruction that is shown in the closing pages of the book and on the audio editions. Hopefully, someone will see this face, remember, and respond.As with other Grafton tales this is a can't-put-down pulse pounder laced with humor provided by two retired policemen who both help and hinder the investigation. Icing on the cake is when we hear Kaye's reading it is as if Kinsey speaks directly to us.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"After a \\"perilously\\" weak outing with \\"P\\", a book with which even her ardent fans were disenchanted (mostly for the many loose ends at the conclusion, atypical of our leading lady...}, Sue and Kinsey are back not only in fine form, but maybe in one of the best stories to date of this 17-book series. A fairly straightforward plot links private eye Kinsey with two older cops -- one retired (Stacey Oliphant) and one on medical leave (Con Dolan) -- who decide as a pastime, and partially to forget about their health woes, to see if they can solve an 18-year old cold murder case, one in which the young woman slain was never even identified. Their hunt for clues, dredging up the pasts of many potential suspects, was entertaining throughout. The interactions between Kinsey and the men were quite realistic, and we notice that Millhone, at the fictional age of 37, grows older herself most gracefully -- she's still an independent \\"cuss\\", but one with failings and pressures with which we can all identify.The closer the trio got to the ultimate truth, Grafton kept piling on the suspects in such a way that the suspense built to the very final page. And unlike the end of \\"P\\", which roiled her readers, this one has the usual closing epilogue in which Kinsey \\"respectfully submits\\" all the final facts and outcomes.As great icing on the cake, \\"Quarry\\" is based on a true life Santa Barbara County (Calif.) Jane Doe that similarly 33 years ago was a murder victim never even identified. Partially with the book as impetus, and with financial support from the author, the real body was exhumed and a renowned forensics sculptor brought in to recreate the victim's living likeness. Four black and white photos of the sculpture appear on the final page, the culmination of a very appealing and cogent Author's Note, indeed \\"respectfully submitted\\" by Ms. Grafton. Well done!!In sum, one of the most enjoyable of the Kinsey Millhone stories, sure to please her old and her newer readers alike.P.S.: if you liked the general gist of this story, the Christine Bennett stories by Lee Harris, many of which feature the solution of old unsolved crimes, might similarly appeal."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Q is for Quarry is the second Sue Grafton murder mystery which I have perused. It wasn't as good as my first venture into Grafton land entitled \\"U is for Undertow.' It was still a pleasurable read on a midwinter Sunday afternoon and early evening.Grafton writes her alphabetical novels focussing on Private Investigator Kinsey Millhone. Kinsey is 38 years old, twice divorced and a fast food junkie. Her parents were killed by a boulder falling on their car when she was a young girl. KM has a difficult time with her cousins and other family members. In my opinion, Grafton devotes too many pages to her personal problems while neglecting focus on the case. And what is the case?It is that of an unknown young woman who was repeatedly murdered by multiple stabwounds in 1969. \\"Jane Doe's\\" body was left in a rock quarry near a small California town on the Arizona-California border. Kinsey with the help of two veteran policemen Stacy Oliphant and Con Dolan seeks to find answers to the cold case. Both of her sidekicks have health problems.Kinsey travels to the wasteland area of California meeting some strange characters. Especially memorable are the McPhee family.Secrets longed suppressed rise to the surface. Murder transpires and Kinsey's own life is endangered. Grafton is good on:a.Physical descriptions of the bleak desert atmosphere and small middle class California life are well done.b. her character descriptions are on target in fleshing out the characters in the novel. Unlike, for instance, an Agatha Christie, her people seem real to us.c. Numerous passages of her prose are wittily written.d. Kinsey seems realistic and is far from being always courageous, smart or proficient in her difficult profession of private investigation of crime.Grafton is a new author for me. I enjoy her work.

Having read all of the previous sixteen novels in this series, I am pleased to report that \\"Quarry\\" is up there with Grafton's best. It is witty, fast-paced and suspenseful, with a look into Kinsey's past that sheds light on her solitude and her quirky personality.Kinsey Millhone, for those of you who are new to Sue Grafton, is a private investigator based in the fictional town of Santa Teresa, California. She is thirty-seven, has had two brief failed marriages, and aside from work, her life consists mostly of jogging, eating fast food and socializing with her elderly landlord, Henry.One day, Lieutenant Con Dolan, of the Santa Teresa Police Department, Homicide Division, offers Kinsey a job. Dolan is currently on medical disability. He has had two heart attacks and he is angling for a third, being a chain smoker and a heavy drinker. Con's friend, Stacey Oliphant, is a seventy-three year old retiree from the Sheriff's Department. Stacey has been a cancer patient for years, and he has begun to lose hope that he will ever recover.To rekindle Stacey's interest in life, Dolan decides to investigate a cold case from 1969, eighteen years earlier, on which Stacey was one of the investigating officers. A young girl, who was never identified, was stabbed and dumped in a quarry. No one was ever apprehended for the crime. Dolan convinces Kinsey to help him and Stacey reopen the case and see what turns up. Kinsey is intrigued and what follows is a complex and thorough investigation, during which Dolan, Oliphant and Kinsey find out that people in small towns sometimes hide deadly secrets.Grafton develops her characters very well in \\"Quarry\\". Dolan and Oliphant are a delightfully cranky pair, and Kinsey is in fine investigative form. The mystery is fairly straightforward, but the trail that leads to the solution is twisted indeed. \\"Q is for Quarry\\" is a satisfying novel, with Grafton's trademark humor and wit adding some welcome lightness to a dark tale of murder and treachery."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"While \\"Q\\" doesn't have the blatant inconsistencies, dangling plot lines, and poor writing of \\"P,\\" the writing in this book simply isn't up to the previous standard of this series. This story could have been well-told in roughly half its 380 pages. While I don't object to scene-setting and description, Grafton's style here is too predictable: EVERY time Kinsey meets someone, there will immediately follow one or two paragraphs on what the person is wearing. The repeated health problems of her police buddies -- and the junk food ecstasies -- get old with constant repetition.Virtually every time Kinsey knocks on a door, or makes a phone call, she gets solid information from someone willing to talk with her. In real life, investigators -- much less non-police investigators -- much more frequently knock on doors and make phone calls when folks aren't home, or won't talk.This book is a pass."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"EVERY YEAR, I EAGERLY AWAIT ANOTHER ENTRY IN SUE GRAFTON'S ALPHABET SERIES, BUT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS WAIT ENDED IN DISAPPOITMENT.&quot;Q IS FOR QUARRY&quot; DRAGGED FROM THE VERY BEGINNING...IN FACT, IT WAS ALL I COULD DO TO JUST FINISH IT.

I thought it was Grafton's worst in the whole series. Sue Grafton has an unfortunate, ongoing yen for sleazy bad girls who make life miserable for a large number of regular folk before somebody gets cheesed enough to bump the little parasites off. \\"Q\\" is no different and what makes it worse is that this is the story of an old crime that nobody particularly WANTS solved, as they have all gone on with their own lives and are better off without the victim. I'm sure this would sound cold in real life, but in fiction, the worst thing an author can do is create a whole book full of characters that nobody gives a crap about, and Grafton has done it here. The desert townspeople are sullen, resentful and dull, the victim was disgusting, and Grafton falls back yet again on the Kinsey-in-danger-in-the-dark ending that has become more than a bit tiresome. Only her funny junk food excursions with the old cop keep this one from completely circling the bowl.My view is a bit slanted, because I came late to Grafton's alphabet series and read them all, from A-M, back to back. This is not always good, because it makes it much easier to spot the author's little tricks and quirks that are normally spread out in batches several years apart. Still, reading N-S as they've been published, I wish that Grafton would stake out some fresh territory for Kinsey Millhone. I'll keep reading her, because I feel too invested in the series to stop now, but I hope she can make the victims a bit more palatable starting with \\"T\\". Anybody who was as annoyed as I was by \\"Q\\" is not going to like \\"R\\" or \\"S\\" much better."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"\\"Q\\" IS FOR QUARRY was inspired by an actual unsolved murder case. The victim's body had been dumped near a quarry in Lompoc, California. Kinsey and two retired detectives take on the eighteen-year-old murder case. Lieutenant Con Dolan convinces her to take the case to help his friend Stacey Oliphant (who was involved in the original investigation) get his mind off his health problems, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.This is pretty much formulae writing except for the intermittent references to Kinsey's family problems. Her mother and father had been killed in a car accident when she was a little girl. Prior to the accident, her grandmother had disowned Kinsey's mother for marrying beneath her. Now one of her aunt's is trying to reestablishment connections. In order to add comic relief, Grafton also delves into Kinsey's relationship with her nonagenarian landlord Henry and Rosie, his friend and restaurant owner, who's been serving disgusting Hungarian concoctions, such as Pigs Knuckles and Sauerkraut, lately. Another humorous element is Kinsey's fetish for junk food. She corrupts Oliphant, who's never (would you believe?) tasted a Quarter Pounder.One thing I found irritating was Grafton's penchant for describing every single character Kinsey comes in contact with. A few deft strokes wouldn't hurt, but she goes on and on and on, working in every possible sensory detail and simile. This slows the pace to a crawl.I thought I had the killer figured out, too. I was wrong, and you will be, too. Grafton didn't give us much of a reason to suspect the eventual culprit. Also she/he is not really believable as a cold-blooded, shovel-wielding assassin. The story also comes to a screeching halt, although Grafton does splice on a little addendum in which we get a look at an artist's recreation of the murdered girl."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I like Grafton's books, and always look forward to them, but this one is full of bloopers that passed the computer spellcheck, but that are correctly-spelled wrong words. It happened at least 15 times, maybe more -- I'm a fast reader, so I finished this book in 24 hours, and these hit me one after the other -- very irritating and distracting. Somebody ought to be proofreading for diction before books go to print -- I come across this pattern of bloopers more and more frequently these days.As far as Grafton's story is concerned, the solution struck me as &quot;out of left field&quot; not only as I encountered it, but even after I finished the book. When I read the explanation for the source of the story, I realized that this was something less than Grafton's usual tightly plotted works of imagination and, instead, something tailored to a troublingly unresolved actual crime. This was a less successful book, in my opinion, than her others.I am enjoying Kinsey's journey toward reconciliation, however. I look forward to more of that."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"This one isnt quite there as past works, it is just a bit slow. The suspense is good if you like that sort of entertainment. Not a sleeper in the least but is a bit sluggish for our day and age as the time frame is before any technology and personality of this 21st century. I would not say that entirely hurts this read but it is predictable from an 80's outlook. Maybe a bit to realistic &quot;as if&quot; the story was based on such a real life happening with a bit of droll character on the part of the offender who does have impact on the way this story is written.

I've read all of Sue Grafton's novels up to this one and probably should have given a little more space between them, but they were so good that I kept plowing through them. Then the quality sort of tapered off and the wordiness crept up and I found myself looking for reasons to like them rather than just liking them.\\"Q\\" was no fun. Kinsey's prickly relationship with Dolan was fun, but now he's like a favorite uncle. He wouldn't give her the time of day when the series started. He also took on the flavor of Marino from the Patricia Cornwell books, someone who takes such poor care of himself you wonder how they are going to take another step without stroking out.I probably won't really quit reading the series entirely. I'm hooked on the B plots in Kinsey's life; her relationships, Henry, her dalliances with romance. But I'll need a little recharge before I plow ahead.A one-star rating is probably too harsh, but I'm mad right now."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"It takes a while for the plot to kick in, but once it does, this book is good. A general air of weariness infected Kinsey's new office. She is handed a cold case file by Con Dolan, the former brother officer of Stacey Oliphant, his mentor and now a dying man. A Jane Doe was stabbed and dumped in a quarry. The case is eighteen years old.The site of the quarry is near the house of Kinsey's grandmother. Old family quarrels trouble her thoughts. Kinsey's parents died when she was very young. Kinsey's mother had been the maverick of the family she learns. Kinsey meets her aunt, the youngest in the family, through her cousin.Kinsey and Con Dolan go to Quorum and find some likely evidence in a car there and have it impounded. Kinsey speaks with a retired dentist who had treated the girl. Before going to the alternative high school in an attempt to get the name of the girl, she stops at the motel for Dolan and discovers he is ill and calls 911. Kinsey and her partners work through a number of connections in the small town to come up with the identity of the dead girl.Stacey and Con Dolan are a sort of odd couple. After Con's heart attack, and since Stacey let his house go believing he would be dead, the men decide to share digs. The mystery story runs to its conclusion in the usual fashion master-minded by this very competent writer. The afterward by Sue Grafton is interesting.

Luckily, Q IS FOR QUARRY is incredibly good, confirming my hope that P was just a fluke. Kinsey is a far more enthusiastic sleuth than she was in P, teaming up with two retired police detectives to find the identity of a long-dead Jane Doe. This book is full of great procedural work, the traditional sly and deadpan Millhone quips and observations, and yes, a real ending. I took it on vacation and read it in two days, enjoying every page of this lengthy book. Now, needless to say, I'm eagerly awaiting R!!"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"This was only my second Kinsey Millhone novel, as I happened across a copy of this as well as one of the later books. I didn't find my lack of familiarity with Kinsey's previous cases (and supporting cast) to be a problem. However, I found this story dragged on too long, for very little payoff. The new information we learned about Kinsey's family was interesting as far as it went, but I can only assume it was a 'teaser' for later volumes.I can't compare/contrast or judge Grafton's writing style too much, but I thought she overdid some of the descriptive paragraphs, as well as the repeated, mundane activities(numerous fast-food meals, for example). While there's nothing wrong with fleshing out a story this way, those little 'digressions' took over the story after a while.'Quarry' just never really got off the ground. Too many 'shady, small-town' stereoypes, and nothing to really hook the reader, other than the murder being an 'old'(cold) case. Maybe tying the 1969 date to something more historically interesting(like the Manson or Zodiac murders) would have helped. Grafton should have spent more time coming up with fresher characters, rather than concocting clever fictional names for obscure desert towns.I didn't mind the two 'Statler and Waldorf' detectives, though their repeated failing health and 'hospital' references were overdone.I won't write off the 'Alphabet Mysteries' just yet...'T is for Trespass' will be my next review as soon as I finish it!"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"To write a review on a book I purchase from Amazon could become a career. I love books and I purchase many. I would not slight any other book that I have not written a review for, but how many times can you say, GREAT!Amazon always has top quality merchandise, and I can always count on a good price, and fast delivery. I really enjoy their marketplace and the discounts available. I have never purchased a book that was not in top condition, or as advertised. Story line is according to my judgement so none can be held accountable for that.Sue Grafton is a quality writer and any book you choose will be a satisfying purchase. How well you enjoy the read is up to how well you choose from her wide variety."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"We've cheered for Kinsey Millhone from the beginning. \\"Q is for Quarry\\" pulls Kinsey out of a drab, newly acquired office and out into the field of pure police work. She is recruited by Stacy Oliphant, a retired cancer victim and Con Dolan, who is on medical leave to help them with one of the original cold case files. This trip Kinsey does leave the little black dress at home and gets caught having to attend a funeral.Sue Grafton takes the reader on an extensive tour of the California desert country with slight clues that later take big steps from her 3x5 index file notes. Ms. Grafton has a fantastic grasp of description of the minute details which make her writing style both unique and compelling.Thanks for another great read from a loyal fan.Nash Black, author of \\"Qualifying Laps\\" and \\"Sins of the Fathers.\\""},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I got the book-on-tape of Q is for Quarry. And I really enjoyed it. This is the first Sue Grafton novel I have listened to or read.I really liked the fact that the story if built on a real unsolved murder mystery. For me that makes the story all the more interesting. And it is wonderful to think that a novel would do a good deed by helping to solve a murder.I totally enjoyed the character of Kinsey. She is an interesting character as she goes about investigating her leads. I enjoyed how she shows concern for the people she interviews about the musrder. And how she shows a caring attitude toward the murder victim. The two grouchy older cops she works with, Dolan and Oliphant make for interesting characters. The humor tidbits added in about all the fast food they eat really add alot to the story. All in all, I find Sue Grafton's characters very true to life.I really enjoyed this novel, and will be reading more of Sue Grafton's writings."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I've read all of these except the new one, &quot;R&quot;, at this point. Obviously, I like them. I think &quot;Q Is For Quarry&quot; is a perfectly respectable specimen of the series, if not one of the best.As is happening more and more often, Kinsey spends most of the book far from Santa Teresa, this time in a small town near the Arizona border. This location is better executed than the small California town in &quot;N Is For Noose,&quot; I think, though there seems to be less of an effort to produce a sense of local colour. There's more just a feeling of isolation, of being stranded in the desert, which works for these characters.As also often happens in these books, the last few pages, in which there is a sudden outbreak of action and danger and the perpetrator stands revealed, are not really satisfying or convincing. And there are a few scenes involving Kinsey's landlord Henry, who has a new girlfriend, and his sister-in-law the Hungarian cook Rosie, apparently intended as comic relief, which I didn't like at all. Luckily, Grafton abandons this stuff early on.The meat of the book, as far as I'm concerned, consists of Kinsey's interactions with a variety of ordinary unhappy people in ordinary American settings, credibly described. I get the feeling that Grafton can write this stuff in her sleep, but I enjoy reading it. Her friends and co-workers the unhealthy older ex-cops also provide some reasonably interesting interaction that doesn't detract from the story."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Sue Grafton's \\"Q is for Quarry\\" is a break from the usual pattern for a Kinsey Millhone (KM) novel. Usually Kinsey takes a case, finds out her client isn't who she thought they were, gets into squabbles with the police, comes upon the solution to the case, confronts her suspect alone (instead of having the police do it), tables get turned, she finds herself in grave danger, barely survives it, and closes the book with a Dragnet-esque epilogue. This book is slightly different as her client is the police, so \\"squabbles with the police\\" above should read \\"squabbles with her client.\\"Actually, there are quite a few departures from the typical KM story. Very little action takes place in Santa Teresa (the Santa Barbara of Grafton's fictionalized Southern California). Instead, the reader is treated to exotic locales like Lompoc and Blythe (real cities, and the reader would do well to follow the action with a AAA map). Kinsey's family makes another appearance, with another layer of onion skin being removed (if you like her family you probably enjoy the revelation of each new layer; if you don't care for them you probably wish Grafton would take a more \\"yank the band-aid off\\" approach instead of this delicate approach). It seems to me that Kinsey was missing a lot of her spark; given the number of people who lie to her, she remains oddly calm throughout the story (she doesn't even make a sarcastic aside about what the \\"Oceanview Motel\\" is doing in the middle of the desert). The story opens with her 37th birthday a calendar-page away, so maybe she's mellowing; the kinder, gentler Millhone isn't necessarily a bad thing, but like a lot in this book, it just feels different - a number of her quirks feel like they're thrown in just to remind us that this is a KM novel (her trademark \\"nail-scissors hair-trim\\" doesn't appear until the final chapters of the book).The mystery itself is based on a real-life Jane Doe murder, another departure from the usual fare. By no means, though, is this a true-crime story; other than the location and general condition of the corpse, there is very little similarity between Grafton's book and any current police investigation. A concluding Author's Note details Grafton's involvement in reviving the actual cold case and includes a facial reconstruction of the victim. The website www.sbsheriff.org still (end of 2003) features a link to contact them if you have any information on the real Jane Doe, but there is no information detailing any recent developments.Overall, I enjoyed this book; it's not without flaw and it is a considerable departure from the norm. If you approach it expecting things to be a little different, you'll probably like it too. If you want a novel conforming to the standard formula, this book may not be among your favorite KM stories."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"A worthy addition to Grafton's series and an interesting change of pace. Although it starts out slow, by the end of the book I was fascinated with the plot and characters and was sorry to see it end. I would not recommend this one to an uninitiated Grafton reader, but \\"A is for Alias\\" is the natural starting point anyway. The sideshow parts of the these novels such as Henry, Rosie, Diehl (when will he come back?), and Kinsey's lost family add a lot of charm and familiarity for the return reader. Kinsey Millhone continues to be an enigma that I enjoy getting to know better with each installment. I also find the historical timeline of the series very appealing. My being almost the same age as Kinsey makes the mid-eighties setting of the books and her late sixties coming of age a sentimental trip down memory lane for me."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I enjoyed this book. It isnt one of my favorites basically due to the &quot;too tidy&quot; ending. It wrapped up way to quick and easy in my opinion. I was hoping for a bit more on her family ties, yet those were left far behind about midway through the book. More will come up in her next novels, I am sure. I liked the idea of the cold case. It was interesting to go along for the ride on what little evidence they had and such a huge gap in time from the scene of the crime until present time."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I love the Sue Grafton books on tape. Judy Kaye does a wonderful job at creating the different voices of the many characters in the book. The quality of the recording is very bad. I have to return two copies of this book on tape. Both tapes had a echo effect on it, and some of the tapes you could only hear any other word. So make sure you check your tapes for these problems"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Grafton has done it again. And her style is still refreshing. Kinsey not only demonstrates she is capable of helping out someone she has a professional relationship with, she gets a little closer to her estranged family as well. Read on, you will like this one. Lets just hope Grafton doesn't fissile out before she finishes the alphabet."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I appreciate the fact that Sue Grafton was motivated by a REAL case, to write this book. It was, however, the most boring, slow paced one of the series. Grafton has been filling her latest books with lots of extraneous fluff, but this was completly over the edge. The basic premise is too far fetched as well. Reminded me of my college term papers that had to be 2000 words....so you just kept adding stuff! Also, it's nice to see a main character who isn't a perfect Yuppie....but Kinsey is turning into a SLOB.... food wise, clothes wise and personal hygiene....ICK!"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Grafton's prose can be wistfully artful and poetic. In K this is breathtakingly clear. A is another favorite that comes to mind, but Q... I just read it last week. Grafton's skill will earn her 3 stars no matter, but Q felt as though she struggled to fill the pages. What minutiae can I add to take up space. It seemed uninspired despite her author's note, which states she was inspired by a story told by her doctor friend over dinner. This is the second Grafton (that's not many considering the letter) I found myself rolling my eyes at but can't remember the other. It felt like reading long laundry lists interspersed with a story line. Made me anxious."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Kinsey Millhone is an established private investigator in Santa Teresa, California. She is finally on her own, in an office that leaves much to be desired. It is spring.Lieutenant Con Dolan drops by. Dolan is the semi-retired head of the Santa Teresa Police Department's Homicide unit. Dolan wants to wants to reopen an old murder investigation as a way of cheering up his friend and mentor, Stacey Oliphant, who is dying of cancer. The murder is one that Oliphant investigated, but never solved.Dolan himself is not healthy. He has had several heart attacks, and his lifestyle invites another.The victim was a teenage girl, whose body had been dumped down an embankment, from a highway. Her hands had been bound together with wire, her throat had been slashed, and she had been stabbed repeatedly in the chest. She seems to have been hitchhiking through town, perhaps going northward. She had remained unidentified.Kinsey agrees to help as a paid consultant, and to do the necessary legwork that Dolan and Oliphant are not healthy enough to do. There is already a very likely suspect for the murder, Frankie Miracle, who is on parole after serving time for another murder. But, Kinsey and the others can't quite manage to find the evidence that would pin this murder on him. They keep digging, and things get complicated.They find someone willing to go to great lengths to make sure that the past remains buried.In my opinion, the novel opens brilliantly. Con Dolan and Stacey Oliphant are characters that readers will care about and find interesting, and the case that they want to re-investigate is intriguing.The story develops logically. The writing, as with all Grafton novels, is interesting and often amusing.This novel contains an especially good portrayal of the deleterious effects that false information can have upon police work, and how a change in just a couple of supposed facts can completely re-orient a case. It falls mainly to Kinsey to do the constant digging, constant theorizing, and constant winnowing of new theories that is necessary to finally arrive at a theory that is not false. Kinsey is shrewd enough to do it.\\"Q\\" is for Quarry, like other Kinsey Millhone novels, is worth reading largely because of the characters, the interactions between them, and because of Kinsey herself. Especially strong characters are Con Dolan and Stacey Oliphant, and Henry Pitts, the retired baker who is Kinsey Millhone's landlord, and Henry's wacky friends.In other ways, Q is for Quarry is a letdown, especially after the excellent P is for Peril. Toward the end of the book there is a proliferation of named characters who are hard to keep straight. There are silly patches. Very few small town women, for example, would divorce their husbands after decades of marriage simply because they learned that he had not been a virgin on their wedding night.People have a remarkable propensity to confess things to Kinsey that they have not told to those closest to them, even though they frequently dislike Kinsey. Sometimes it is because Kinsey pursues the truth like a terrier, but sometimes it just happens.The novel has Kinsey's (and Grafton's) personality woven into it. Crooks who successfully work the system, or who try to work the system, are favorite objects of scorn. And as Grafton has observed elsewhere, \\"You can't save anyone except yourself.\\"This novel is based on a genuine cold case. An account of the true crime and a reconstruction of the victim's features are given after the novel in hope of inducing someone to come forward with relevant information."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"*****WARNING: THERE MAY BE A SPOILER*****First, the good things about this, the 17th outing for Kinsey Millhone:* the setting is excellent. I enjoy both the coastal and desert locales in which it is set, and, although I was about to scream if Grafton told us the colour of the desert soil once more, she did manage to capture the landscape extremely well. As well, throughout the series, Grafton has had a pretty good way with bringing to life Smalltown, USA and its inhabitants. This is no exception.* the 'Odd Couple' like characters - the two retired / medically unfit police officers. I could see Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau perfectly cast (if they weren't dead alreay).* Aspects of the police procedural.* The interesting depth added to Kinsey's family relationships in this book. A newly emerging relationship with an aunt, which has surprised even Kinsey in the way it has affected her. At last she is beginning to open up to possibilities.Now, what I didn't like:* I agree with the reviewer who says everything is over-described. Cutting down the number of adjectives and 'languid' takes on every action and place would make a tighter read.* However, my biggest disappointment and the reason for the 2 stars is that I think there is a major plotting / logic flaw in this novel. The key clue is dropped on page 19. To me, it stood out a million miles away. I spent the rest of the books getting angrier and angrier at what was to me an elemental flaw in something which was meant to be a police procedural. Surely, given the notes taken at the time a record was kept of who and where the missing person report, later retracted, came from. It would have eliminated about half the book, in hurrying the solving of the 'who was Jane Doe' part of the story.* The rather formulaic and lazy way that the investigation in Quorum is plotted. &quot;Oh, here's 2 or 3 possibilities (schools / dentists)...let's travel with Kinsey to the first two, which will be easily eliminated, although there will be a bit of a thread which we will come back to later (the school secretary/ dental records) and on the third try she will come up trumps.&quot; That's plot padding, and it's predictable. You know every conversation will be sewn with one thread of information, and I'm afraid the reader doesn't have to work very hard to pick it out.So, in summary - the character Kinsey is developing little by little, but the plotting of the mystery is getting lazy, and the padding out of the story tiresome."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Kinsey Millhone is working in her office when Homicide Lieutenant Con Dolan comes around. He's temporarily sidelined because of a series of heart attacks. His wife has passed away, so now he's alone and he is helping his old police pal Stacy Oliphant, who is currently dying of cancer and cleaning out his apartment, so no one else will be left with his mess when he passes on. He and Con have come across a cold case they want to close before he dies and they want Kinsey's help with the legwork.The case is an unsolved eighteen-year-old mystery. A young woman had been murdered and left for dead off California's Highway 1 near Lompoc. She was a \\"Jane Doe,\\" an unidentified white female, whose decomposed body was discovered near a quarry.Kinsey resolutely pursues overlooked clues that are close to two decades old. When the body was discovered, a wrecked red convertible was found nearby and that leads them to Quorum, a desert town near the Arizona border, where the red convertible had been stolen from an auto repair shop around the time of the murder.Oliphant's cancer kicks up, so he has to go back to the hospital, leaving Kinsey and Dolan on the road to Quorum without him. After a couple of days of dogged detective work, Kinsey comes back to the hotel to find Dolan in the midst of a heart attack. She calls an ambulance and now with him in the hospital, she strikes out alone after the killer. As her investigation continues she learns about Quorum's long-hidden secrets and that causes the killer to strike again.As I'm a big fan of Kinsey Millhone's, I was predisposed to like this book and I wasn't disappointed. I especially liked the two hard-boiled old cops who seem to act like an old married couple. I was saddened when Dolan was stricken ill and when Oliphant had to go back to the hospital, then gladdened when Dolan got a stint in his heart and was okay and when Oliphant's problem wasn't the cancer. These cranky, curmudgeon cops make a great pair and I hope to see more of them as this alphabet series continues. I also liked the peek into Kinsey's past and family life presented in the story."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I've enjoyed the Kinsey Millhone series over the years and read this one quickly and with real pleasure .. so for me it was a genuine page-turner. But that was a week ago and already it's fading from my memory. The plot isn't that remarkable, the characters aren't that distinctive and I can't see myself reading it again in a hurry.Perhaps this is a literary equivalent of fast food - easy to enjoy , but ultimately not long-lasting. (if so, that's ironic, because there's a running gag about someone suddenly discovering fast food late in life).One of the pleasures of detective series is that they develop a richness of character and background. So, for example, Con Dolan, who is a minor character at the start of &quot;A is for Alibi&quot;, is a major figure here. But some plot threads regarding Kinsey's family and Henry's love life are left hanging too obviously loose for the next installment.For what it's worth , Kinsey is investigating a murder case from years back - a teenage girl found murdered but never identified. The trail leads her to some small towns on the California /Arizona border, real coyote country. There is an interesting epilogue...Summary: worth reading if you are a Kinsey fan, but newcomers shouldn't start here."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Right off the bat, I want to make it clear that I am a fan of both Grafton and the Millhone series. I've read them all. Q is a quite competent, yet joyless addition to the series. The plot is serviceable and Kinsey is mellowing with age. There is some significant turns in her family relations that start up and then are left hanging. The usual cast of characters is noticeably absent in this effort as Kinsey works with Lieutenant Dolan and an old colleague of his to solve a decades old murder case. Henry, Rosie, and her other pals are barely in the book. I found there to be far too much rudimentary detail of no consequence. This book is really overwritten. At one point she describes the interior of a garage and notes that there is grease and wrenches about! What a revelation at a garage! And most importantly, there's no danger. I think a lot of the fun of this series is watching Kinsey stir up trouble and then get your adrenaline going as the bad guy(s)come calling. There were opportunities for more spinetingling episodes but no payoff. IN a nutshell, I want to see more oooph, more danger, and fewer words."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"It seems most of Grafton's fans who are complaining about this novel are basically saying they don't like the fact that she mixed non-fictional events with fiction to create this story. Maybe they can't accept the fact that Grafton has created such a believable and enjoyable \\"world of Kinsey\\" and they don't want any real-life intrusions to interupt this world. Although I can't blame them, for Kinsey's world is truly one of the most satisfying and rewarding worlds I've had the honor of visiting, I can't agree when they say this is a mediocre novel. Once again, in her extremely impressive style, Ms. Grafton has delivered another intriguing and pleasing story. This is the 17th book in the Kinsey series, and I personally find it mind-blowing that this superb author has kept this entire series in the good to great to spectacular range. I can not think of another author (no, not even King) who has written 10 winners in row....let alone 17 !!! This is truly an incredible feat. The most amazing and rewarding part is that Grafton has never once insulted her fan's intelligence. When I read the other current and popular mystery writers' work in between the Alphabet series, like Patterson, Sandford and Cornwell, I very often find myself moaning and groaning over some very silly, unbelievable and improbable situations and dialog. Grafton has never once faltered in this department, and personally, I think she deserves an \\"Author of the Century\\" award for being so consistent and showing the utmost respect for her fans. She also deserves an award for the most gifted sense of humor, out of all authors and all genres. She has never slipped into \\"silly territory\\" like so many authors do. Her humor remains fresh and truly funny. I would highly recommend reading \\"Q is for Quarry\\" to experience all of the above praises. It is indeed a great novel and clearly demonstrates that the author has enough intelligence, ideas, and gusto to complete the entire alphabet without losing one ounce of steam.

I've read every Kinsey Millhone novel and am looking forward to the next in the series. That being said, there are a few flaws in Q is for Quarry, but none that would cause a less than Five-Star review. For example, the issue of Kinsey's distant relatives may be picked up in the next novel, but it was left far too abruptly for this reader's taste. Until I finished the book, I hadn't realized this novel was in fact based on a real-life Jane Doe case that Ms. Grafton has taken interest in. The fictional mystery itself was paced a little slower than some of the other Alphabet series, but somehow it fit with this book, being out of Santa Teresa and Kinsey a bit out of her element. As a series of novels written in the first person, I find the descriptions--sometimes very detailed--to be an insight into Kinsey's inner-self and it feels like a friend is telling me about her surroundings. Hope the next year-plus goes by quickly for the relase of &quot;R is for...?&quot;"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"The 17th letter of the alphabet finally gets its due with the arrival of Sue Grafton's latest in her alphabetical mystery series, \\"Q is for Quarry.\\"Alibi, burglar, corpse, deadbeat, evidence, fugitive, gumshoe, homicide, innocent, judgment, killer, lawless, malice, noose, outlaw, peril ... These are what the previous letters have stood for for Grafton's quintessential private investigator, Kinsey Millhone.It's all counting down to her final, 26th book in the series, already titled \\"Z is for Zero.\\"A long time ago, I sat down to read all of the books in the Kinsey series. I started with \\"A is for Alibi\\" and got all the way up to \\"L is for Lawless\\" or \\"M is for Malice\\" before overdosing, and swore not to check back in on Grafton or Millhone until an interesting letter came along.In reading \\"Quarry,\\" I haven't exactly been made to regret my decision.Not that there's anything wrong with the series. It's quaint and cozy, comprised of good mysteries to snuggle down with. However, it feels as though Grafton might be holding back on the stuff that's really going to knock our socks off for the even later books, rather than taking steps to guarantee readers remain at attention at all times.\\"Quarry\\" has some of these issues. With the exception of several too-brief scenes where Kinsey hangs out with friends at a restaurant, or finally gets hold of a photo of her deceased mother, whom she has never met, we never really get inside her head.She is too consumed with the current mystery at hand, a (according to Grafton in her afterword) based-on-real life case in which an unknown girl mysteriously turned up dead years ago in a rock quarry, but could never be identified.Now, the retired cop in charge of the case is doing poorly health-wise, and a co-worker hires Kinsey to do some of her own investigating to put some spring back into his step.This puts her in the circle of some interesting characters, especially entertaining jailhouse snitch Pudgie Clifton. The Pudgie and Kinsey scenes hint at something that could have made for an even more interesting read; they crackle with tension and humor. More of this would have meant more fun for the reader.There is also a crucial case witness who admits that she lied to the officer on duty about the whole thing so that she could ask him out (the officer is now her husband).I think, at this point, people are either going to read Grafton because they've hung on this long and want to see the series through to the end, or for the sheer audacity of writing a 26-part series. There's very little to offer those who just want to read a compelling story. \\"Q\\" is decent; it just never quite makes it to \\"good.\\"So I don't feel the slightest bit guilty about checking out again until the next interesting letter comes along.\\"X is for Xenophobe,\\" anyone?"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"&quot;O Is for Quarry&quot; by Sue Grafton is an another entertaining story in this unique series. The characters are fun, the dialogue sharp and fast-pace, and, the plot exciting. A wonderful combination.John SavoySavoy InternationalMotion Pictures Inc."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Kinsey has been my favourite detective for so long that I started this one with a lot of expectation. But it failed to sway me too far this time. In fact I started another similar novel along with this one and ended up being glued to Catharine from HK Bains's Dangerous Intent a bit more tightly. i wonder why Bains chose to go POD when the book could have been a best seller with any lead publisher."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Oh my, I am on book number 17 of the Kinsey Milhone series but I don't recognize where I am. I have left the land of mischieveous, tantalizing and light-amusement to a libre-noir. Toto, we've left Kansas! I have loved each and every one of the first 16 of Grafton's alphabet but Q is for Quarry is just plain painful. Grafton describes each character's very breath with excruciating agony. Let's hope R stands for &quot;I Got it Right&quot; once again."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I'm a big fan of the series, but I think it ran out of gas after \\"H.\\" I've struggled through all of the books from \\"I\\" and beyond, but this one was the worst. Why? For 350 pages, it's a thin book - thin on plot, thin on story, and thin on characters. I can't figure out why the book needed 350 pages to tell this story. Maybe if she had a better editor (or better story)?By the end of the book, I could not have cared less about the unfortunate victim or any of the characters. Kinsey is the same (which is fine), but the mystery was so uninvolving, it took me three weeks to read this book. I have no idea where this series is going, but after all these years, it can only get better. Right?"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I am fan of Sue Grafton. However, her latest offering was so plodding, so unbearably slow that I did the unthinkable--I quit reading before the end. The book lost me, was an agony to read, and 50 pages from the end I no longer cared who killed Jane Doe. I think G was Grafton's best offering, probably because Kinsey had some real relationships going (and some romance). Give Kinsey a life! Please. She, and this fan's interest, are both dying."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I tried, I really tried to enjoy this book. I am very glad that I did not rush out and spend my money on the hardback book, I had it reserved at the library. The story based on a real life unsolved murder had the potential to grab your attention, but with the slow paced, overly detailed, boring story Grafton turned it into I was sadly dissapointed. \\"P\\" is for Peril was not up to standards either, so I'm hoping the next book in the series can get back on track."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I was disappointed - although I enjoyed the plot of the story (true Kinsey mystery) the book was too long to support it!! One reason I enjoy Grafton books is they are relatively &quot;crisp&quot; in the plot and the dialog exchanges of the people in it. This book went astray from the plot and the characters several times. I would have enjoyed a shorter version of the same thing!!"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"You'd think by the time Ms. Grafton got to the letter 'Q' in her series, she would have sharpened her craft. Earlier books in the series were much better. In this one, Kinsey tags along with a couple of old, sick and washed-up detectives on a cold case. However, she spends way too much time talking about the minutia of her daily routine. \\"I went here, did this, went there, did that, had a diet Pepsi, and . . . yada, yada, yada.\\" This book really drags, and by the time the case starts to unfold, you're practically asleep and could care less. To make things even worse, the metaphors and similes just don't work. Describing someone's tone of voice as \\"flat as a two day old can of soda\\" doesn't quite rise to her usual. And although she's going for a laugh out loud moment here and there, she never quite clears the bar. Maybe Ms. Grafton is getting tired of the whole shtick; if that's the case, she should just let us know and give it up."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I have read and loved almost all of the alphaget mysteries (with the exception of \\"P is for Peril\\"). This one was excruciatingly boring. I agree with the reviewers who've complained about too much mention of fast food. The book should have been named \\"Q is for Quarter Pounder.\\""},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I've mostly enjoyed the Alphabet series, but Sue Grafton's last few books have been darker and darker. I'm tired of the same old whining about her love life, her family, and her relationships in general. Her writing has become contrived, predictable, and frankly down right boring. I usually keep all my books, hardbound or paperback, but Q is for Quarry is going straight to my public library as a donation."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I know in keeping with the Alphabet, Sue had to think long and hard to come up with a story to revolve around a word beginning with Q. Well Q is for Quarry, is totally substandard. If you have EVER read one of Sue's Alphabet books, then usually there is humor, mystery, a little danger, and of course Kinsey having conflicts. But this book was slow, and when it did take off, it was still downhill. I look forward to the next book, because one bad book is not going to turn me sour on the alphabet books."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Yes, it has a plot, but it's an old one rekindled, with no new quirks to whet the reader's appetite. Kinsey Millhone is a private detective in California, aged 37, twice divorced. Branching out on her own - more or less - for the first time and to help and old friend of a friend - Kinsey takes on an eighteen year old unsolved murder case. Stacey Oliphant was one of the original investigating officers, but not even the victim's name ever surfaced. Now, Stacey has retired from the sheriff's department and has non Hodgkin's lymphoma. It's for Stacey that private detective Con Dolan requests Kinsey's help with the case. Both Stacey and Con had found the body originally and investigated the original case. I never quite understood why Kinsey Millhone was selected to help in this case, and I never got used to her being a woman and Stacey being a man, it confused me. This book is a quarry in itself. It's dusty, old, dry, and full of bones. Any mystery writer could dream this one overnight. What's next? R is for Read me - PLEASE?"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"Okay, it's a terrible title, but then so is the ending to Sue Grafton's latest. The killer is...pretty much who you think the killer might be. So the surprise is...nonexistent. In fact, in most ways Grafton seems to have lost the ability to surprise. Kinsey Milhone, her PI heroine may be learning new things about her family background (all of which, by the way, strain credulity) but we readers are getting nothing new in this series. There are 9 more books to go, so I'm not sure that Grafton has time to reinvent herself (and Milhone), and honestly I'm not sure that I would want her to do so. After all, the Patricia Cromwell books took a serious dive when Scarpetta went from being a local medical examiner to trying to save the world single-handedly. But some imagination and invention is clearly needed. There is still good writing and humor here (hence the 3 stars), but continuing with a beloved series should be a pleasure, not a tedious obligation."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I think Q is for Quarry is one of Grafton's best work. I did not like P and I almost gave up on the series but Q has kept me still a loyal fan. The whole time that I was reading I just kept wondering &quot;who did it?&quot;. I think that in itself made it good to me!"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I've often wondered how Ms. Grafton can consistently produce so many very good novels in a relatively short period of time. Well, in this instance I think she fell short of the mark. Usually I can't put her books down, but in this case I had to really struggle just to finish it. At least now I don't feel so bad about having taken several years to finish my first novel, &quot;The Other Part Of Me.&quot;"},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"I read a lot. I enjoy mysteries. After finally getting around to reading a book by Sue Grafton, I have to say that I'm utterly disappointed. This was my first, (and last, thank you very much), Sue Grafton novel. It was boring, contrived, and PREDICTABLE. At some point, (I'm not exactly sure, but it could have been when Grafton was trying in vain to make Kinsey's estrangement from her family a viable sub-plot), I started rooting for all of the main characters to be killed. I have never disliked 'the good guys' as much as I did when reading this novel. Hey, here's a cop that drinks and smokes too much. Naw, shucks ma'm - that's not cliche! In fact, the entire book was one, long, ridiculous cliche. Ah, but enough of this. I've wasted too much time reading this horrible book to write any more. Do yourself a favor - don't read this book."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"It took me approximately 3 weeks to get through this 350-page novel. That's because my only incentive to return to the book was to complete it.The setting is as desolate as the plot and characters. The plot is a series of back-and-forths between Kinsey's hotel room and the location of her next interview, with a too-frequent reference to a fast-food detour in between for humor (and this attempt at levity missed the mark by the third or fourth mention).Reading this book reminded me of returning to jogging after a long stretch off: it was dull and arduous and I wanted to cut it short after every 50 steps or so and in the end, I was just satisfied that I finally finished."},{"Title":"Q is for Quarry: A Kinsey Millhone Mystery","review":"This is a very boring book. Nothing happened druing the first half of the book and even it started moving the story was flat. The plot was so sketchy that a lot of pages were filled with talks of visiting fast food and main character's love of fast food. This is terrible."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Went Back in Time","review":"This is a wonderful book for all ages. For anyone who is interested in Ancient Egypt 3,000 years ago, it is a history of cats from that time period. It is a book for anyone who loves animals (particularly cats). It reaches far beyond time and transcends into a future where these magnificent creatures have lived for thousands of years and continue to grace our households today as royalty. Many of the greatest writers and poets: Charles Dickens, Ernest Hemingway have shared their households with cats. You will never look at cats in the same way after you've read this book. It is up there with \\"Gorillas In The Mist\\" and \\"Born Free\\" and is in a classification with Disney movies and books. If you want to read one book that will give you history, educate you and enthrall you at the same time, you need to read and own this book. This book also was read and highly recommended by Tippi Hedren, Actress and President of the Shambala Wildlife Preserve in California. This Preserve consists of the bigger cats. This book is in itself, a heirloom to pass on for generations to all of those who love and appreciate cats. You will not have ever read anything like it! It is indeed a very unique book that will touch the lives of those who read it. Elsa, the cat, is the hero in this book. She cared enough to help preserve her royal heritage and return the cat Goddess Bastet to the museum where she belonged. Along this journey, she makes friends with a camel in the desert and a siamese cat. She also encounters an Angel cat along the way who helps guide her on her historic and memorable journey. An evil black witch cat tries to hurt her and end her journey. Will Elsa make it in time to return the statue?

Here are my thoughts:1.) There's a section about getting in. Mostly irrelevant, but maybe helpful for the motivated undergrad. I already got accepted to Buffalo upon buying this book. They very clearly weigh out what scores/experience is important when applying.2.) The breakdown of what goes on in B-school and why you should apply and generally what to expect is accurate.3.) The description of classes, Thursday night lectures, groupwork and scheduling is described perfectly. Maybe in 2001 they were ahead of the game because now, in 2009, they're RIGHT ON. Groupwork horror stories from the book have predicted events that friends of mine are experiencing right now constantly.4.) The interviewing/networking tips are somewhat common sense, but there are some good stories and a few unique tips. Remember that MBA students are skeptics (much like JD students) and will not trust a tip/hint/suggestion unless there's a good story or example to back it up. This book provides these examples.It's funny, this book is the perfect handbook for the newly accepted B-school student...and it was written about 9 years ago. There really is no need for a new edition!****UPDATE****I just graduated, and while I still stand behind much of my review, it could benefit from a good update.

And he gives those artistic sensibilities a workout in \\"45301,\\" a stunning collection of photographs that takes the mundane surroundings of various countries, and transform them.Light is the core of \\"45301\\" -- soft light, sharp light, colorful light and light being smothered by shadows. Even color comes second to the presence of light. There are smoldering abstract images that look like they're about to burn through the page -- the pictures are that striking and that vivid. And then there then smoky, ghostly shots of what look like mountains.Mortensen's focus on the seemingly ordinary continues in this book. There are images of blurred, chaotic trees, the melancholy skyscape of \\"Hacia Mariel,\\" or the quiet, chilly movement of \\"Fototeca.\\" More color and movement is found in images like the intense glow of a dying campfire, or the dramatic image of riders silhouetted against a colorful sky.There isn't any writing in the conventional sense, unless you count the picture index. The photographs in \\"45031\\" are overlaid on examples of Mortensen's handwriting. It's often indecipherable, scribbled out and either thin and pale, or dark and sprawling. That makes it even more enticing, and an effective frame for such enigmatic photographs.And Mortensen again shows his ability to make the mundane seem magical. Horses, riders, trees, sky, clouds and houses all get the treatment, either shown in motion, shot from unusual angles, or in a strangely distorted manner. And of course, light and color are what the magic of the pictures sometimes depends on -- a strangely colored sky is all it takes to lend the photo an eerie look.Given its gritty, otherworldly look, \\"45031\\" is a strangely dizzying book to read. With entrancing abstract photos and a unique format, this is another winning collection by Viggo Mortensen."},{"Title":"45301","review":"Viggo Mortensen is a wonderful photographer. His pictures make me want to smash my camera on the ground in envy and despair and gouge out my inferior eyes and curse the Universe for not making me a photography savant. The colors in his photographs and the way he frames them make me want to look at them over and over again and study their elements. So, imagine, if you will, my excitement at receiving 45301 in the mail from a bookstore in Denmark, which, since the book is out of print, is apparently the only bookstore on the planet that actually has it in stock. It arrived last Friday afternoon, and when I got home from work I made myself a gin and tonic, ceremoniously opened the book's shrink-wrap, and settled onto the sofa to look at it and feel that sweet, burning envy.45301 has been described in one review as &quot;dense and thought-provoking&quot;, and this is correct. It is dense, in that there is something on every page, and it provoked the following thoughts: 1) What the hell is this? 2) I need another gin and tonic, and 3) I can sell this on eBay and get my money back. Most of the pictures are of indeterminate subjects, and they are mainly set against a background of illegible, scrawled notes. There are many interesting photos, but because most are printed very small and are against that heinous scrawly background, they do not draw me in and make me want to look at them. There are 13 pages of negatives, and while they DO have interestingly colored frames, they're not compelling.Here's the thing about 45301: It's not so much a photography book as it is an art book, and I can appreciate it that way, despite my initial disappointment. It's abstract photography and scrawled notes and negatives compiled together to form a piece of art, and that's great as long as that's what you're looking for. But if what you're looking for is Mr. Mortensen's less abstract photography, you should buy Recent Forgeries instead, because that book is fantastic. His Coincidence of Memory and Sign Language are also good, and if you're going to buy any of these three, you should order them directly from Perceval Press (www.percevalpress.com), because it's highly worthy of support (you will also get the books most quickly and inexpensively from them). Recent Forgeries and Coincidence of Memory contain Mr. Mortensen's poetry as well as photography, and to talk about that would be a whole other review, but in a nutshell, it had me taking off my pants. [pssst! that means it's good!]In conclusion, Viggo Mortensen is a talented photographer, but you probably wouldn't know it from looking at this book. If you want a piece of art in book form, you should consider buying it, and if you're a fan of Mr. Mortensen's acting and are obsessively collecting everything he's ever published, then I guess there's no question but that you will buy it [please seek help]. In either of these cases, it will help if you are at least semi-rich, because to buy this now will cost you anywhere from $65 (what I paid, including shipping from Denmark) to $180 (currently), and if you pay $180 for this book, my review of your financial acumen would have to be &quot;HAhahahahahahaha!&quot;End Transmission."},{"Title":"45301","review":"art is subjective so whether or not you'll like this depends entirely on your taste in art. if you're a viggo fan, then you'll have to have it. the book itself is good quality, not so huge like a lot of coffee table books."},{"Title":"45301","review":"I loved this book.

The author Matthieu Ricard is an ordained monk in the Tibetan tradition. He recently accompanied Khyentse Rinpoche on a trip to Tibet. The photographs in this book document the trip in a most vivid portrayal of a living Tibetan culture. It is amazing to see how glorious was the greeting given to this renowned lama upon his return to Tibet. We are treated to a pictorial feast of rites, costumes and throngs of devoted welcomers. The accompanying text tells not only the story of this wonderful trip but also of the life and teachings of Khyentse Rinpoche, the profound influence of which can be felt just by browsing the pages."},{"Title":"Journey to Enlightenment: The Life and World of Khyentse Rinpoche, Spiritual Teacher From Tibet","review":"I admit that much of the time since I've owned this book, when I go thru it, it is just to look at the photographs. Ricard has captured \\"Shangri-la\\": I don't know of any more evocative photographic collection. The faces, the costumes, the landscapes: all the mystic of Tibet and its Buddhism. A good reason to want to visit Tibet.If you can disengage yourself from the photographs (which I find hard to do) then there are many teachings from Khyentse Rinphoche that point to the benefits of naked awareness.The combination of amazing photos and amazing teaching may be just what we need to begin to eschew distractions and meet reality head-on. It soon overwhelms me each time I try that, but, as I get older, I wonder how often I can put off the challenge that teachers like Khyense Rinpoche present. Is it trickery or the deepest insight?"},{"Title":"Journey to Enlightenment: The Life and World of Khyentse Rinpoche, Spiritual Teacher From Tibet","review":"I have most of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche's writings! But the 1st time I ever saw his photo, it was always the impression of this Great spiritual Grandfather! With Ricard (former biochemist/molecular biology) as his attendant later in life, I got to photographically see this person thru the eyes of a Westerner, who also understood the context of this great teacher & the cultural trappings he worked through. Am probably going to give this as a gift to my humble spiritual guide who revealed he had received &#34;numerous&#34; teachings from this man!"},{"Title":"Journey to Enlightenment: The Life and World of Khyentse Rinpoche, Spiritual Teacher From Tibet","review":"The book is wonderful, photos and text alike.

It is spell binding in the fact that it keeps the reader focus as the story takes it different twists and turns.Eden resonates. Eden makes one tap deeply into his or her emotional and spiritual selves. Eden has that power. Having read it, I find myself enlightened to the ideas and conflicts of the Maddy, Faye, Fat, Chevrolet and Pip, as well as my own internal passions, conflicts, and ideas.Eden is not only about good versus evil. It's also about forgiving and forgetting. It's about sadness, loss, the irreversible passage of time, and the nature of humanity."},{"Title":"Eden: A Novel","review":"Eden is far more than a coming of age novel.The story is told through the voice of Maddy Dangerfield, a fourteen year old girl living in the deep South.Maddy may be green around the edges but she observes the world through old eyes. The town is in shock when Maddy draws a naked woman on the pages of Genesis, in fire engine red lipstick during Sunday school.Maddy feels deeply for her Mother. For her hard worked hands and tired feet from cleaning the white folks house all day.Her Father, an alcholic who gambles away every cent he earns plus what her mother makes.Her Aunt Pip, a beautiful, carefree woman known to sleep with married men (even Maddy's father). When Aunt Pip starts dying from Breast Cancer, Maddy is forced to spend the weekends taking care of her. Maddy is crushed to see her aunt crumble and weaken right before her eyes. Fat, her aunt's friend is crazy they say. She writes letters to a dead man. A dead man they found hanging from the tree in the front yard. He was hanged and uncle Sugar became a number- for raping a white woman.This novel is raw, sensual and bursting from the seams with old Southern ritual and spirituality. A wildy beautiful tale of passion, anger, love and Death.Vernon's prose will knock your socks off! Her creativity is so out of the box one might need to take a slow breath to take it all in. Highly unusual, passionately poetic. To write with such profound power and mystic is pure brilliance.Eden is top shelf with the likes of Toni Morrison.Vernon is a Diamond in the rough of literature today..reviewed by:DawnMBCN.Y./2004"},{"Title":"Eden: A Novel","review":"Brilliant book, the world she creates is one that came alive for me. Olympia Vernon is a new Black writer that everyone should read, I eagerly await her next Book."},{"Title":"Eden: A Novel","review":"Intricate, excessive metaphors with convoluted symbolism that consumes the reader. Re-reading sentences and paragraphs to comprehend the context, questioning what was read, surreal imagery. No, this is not a Toni Morrison novel but Olympia Vernon in her debut offering, Eden, will no doubt be compared to the Queen Mother of literature. This novel will more than likely be embraced by the literary community making this a crossover fiction read to please many palates.Maddy Dangerfield is a fourteen year-old black girl living on the borderline of rural Mississippi/Louisiana. Though no dates are given, the time period seems to be the late 1960s or 70s. Maddy is engulfed in despair, a fragile link in a down- trodden family that appears to be without hope or future. A degrading, embittered, alcoholic father, Chevrolet, who is also maimed, is incapable of providing for his family though he is employed because his paycheck is already owed to Jesus&#65533; the man who runs gambling in town and to the liquor his body craves. His wife, Faye totally lacking self-esteem, is a classic enabler, working herself to the bone to pay her husband&#65533;s debts. They are the town&#65533;s object of gossip and pity. There is no laughter; Maddy does not socialize with other children or hitch rides into town with friends for ice cream. She is immersed in an adult world and these adults are no prizes. Then Maddy adds fuel to the flames when she draws a picture of a naked lady in red lipstick over the first page of the Book of Genesis in Sunday School. As a punishment, she is banished to spend weekends nursing her aunt Pip, who is wasting away with breast cancer and herself banished in shame from the town and the family for committing an unforgivable sin. Maddy is drawn into the squandered life of Pip while pondering the issues of life, death, love and redemption.Racism is rampant and this novel does not escape the stereotypical elements of a gothic southern novel: an uncle in prison and his friend hung for an &#65533;alleged&#65533; rape of a white woman, the desolate alcoholic stripped of his manhood who kowtows to whites, the white storeowners who cheat blacks out of their money, the strong black mother replete with a Mammy persona who is long-suffering, forever in church praising the Lord. A cast of secondary characters including an outcast neighbor, a young casket maker from New Orleans who has his eye on Maddy and a slow-witted man who meets a mysterious death all contribute to making this a well-rounded, unique storyline.The literature of the last few years have highlighted the affluence and assimilation of African Americans touting their acquired status, this story gives us the ugliness up front and personal---, this is not reading for the faint at heart. Maddy&#65533;s obsession with vaginas is a prominent part of this novel as is blood, breasts, lizards, and superstitions steeped in ignorance and tradition. Sometimes this novel was out there, thus the Morrison reference. Well written with illuminating imagery, the author places you there--but I had to ask myself if I really wanted to be. Nevertheless, it was refreshing to read yet another new, unique voice. 2003 promises to be a stellar year with writers such as Vernon and Danyel Smith (More Like Wrestling) who are taking bold risks in what is sometimes a saturated market of uniformity. I look forward to this author&#65533;s next offering.Dera WilliamsAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Eden: A Novel","review":"This story was told in the voice of a fourteen year old girl raised in the rural south of Mississippi.

And I would like to also know if Chevrolet became a Christian and more respectful to Faye. The book is also a tear-jerker with the church scene. It was a book that was spellbounding and can be applied to everyone's life that read it. When is the next episode?"},{"Title":"Eden: A Novel","review":"Olympia Vernon has certainly marked her space on the map with Eden. The entire book sings like music. Every line, every chapter is indelible--like an ongoing paean that praises and celebrates life, love, loss, forgiveness, death, God, pain, nature, disease and the awe of body--the physical journeys it takes. I found the language as bare-boned as Hemingway. Quick, clean, sharp and vivid. Even cancer resonates as a \\"character\\" in the novel. I was enamored with the simplest \\"sharing\\" in the book and that was Maddy. Though a rift eases in between two sisters, Faye and Aunt Pip, the child is still allowed to go to her aunt. Could that in some manner be a gesture of forgiveness? The one and only frail part about the novel is plot. However, the characters, structure, language, magical-realism and overall theme of the work deems it all the more rich. I hope this young author continues to contribute good, qualified, \\"seriously imaginative\\" literature to the African-American canon. I think she will keep the map strong. Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Eden: A Novel","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked up the debut novel by new author Olympia Vernon. The title suggested to me that I was beginning a story about the concept of Eden, a place where old age ceases, evil is nonexistent, and a place of abundance. Quite the opposite was true.Maddy Dangerfield, a fourteen-year old with the weight of the world on her shoulders, lives in a place that defies Eden and all of its niceties. Maddy's mother, Faye, sends her to care for her Aunt Pip, Mama Faye's outcast sister. Pip suffers from breast cancer and the loss of her breast. Maddy learns much from Pip, and this stop in her journey to adulthood takes on an important role.There was a strong theme of missing pieces in the novel, beginning with Maddy's father Chevrolet, who was missing his arm, and ending with Maddy herself, and all of the losses she incurred. The writing spoke to me in hushed voices, Vernon allowing her words and lyricism to come to the forefront. You won't find a largely plot-driven novel in Eden, as the author allows focus to remain on her characters and their losses. A symbolic tale of coming of age and coming to grips, this was a fantastic debut..."},{"Title":"Eden: A Novel","review":"Eden truly touched me from beginning to end. Each time I picked it up to read, I didn't want to put it down. I wanted to know the characters personally, sit down and talk to them or just watch them live their lives. I felt close to them like they were taken from my past and I was now witnessing the continuing saga of their lives. The words are beautifully written. Fresh, smooth, easily digested words, phrases, references, connected me with the author. I loved that every time I read a page I could see it as if I were standing their watching. Reading Eden gives you a taste of Southern black culture that is not often seen and will have you wanting more."},{"Title":"Eden: A Novel","review":"Being a native of Pike.... Pyke County I'd have to say this book really hit &quot;home&quot;. Eden is a wonderful piece of literature. Eden has power between its pages. Powerful would be an understatement when describing this book. While submerged in Eden I experienced a WIDE range of emotions. Humor- when Aunt Pip and Fat sat around &quot;shootin' the breeze&quot; enjoying their feel-goods. Fear- when Chevorlet contemplated shooting the mutt, before Jesus drove up. Sadness- When Willie died/ or was he killed?Eden is an artwork that should get it's due respect, it's proper accolades, and the author Olmpia Vernon (whom I consider the Zora Neal Hurston of this new millenium) should be given national attention for creating Eden at a time when all of us need it the most!"},{"Title":"Eden: A Novel","review":"Eden is one of those few literary works that consistently holds your attention from the first page to the last page. The imagery conveyed in this novel makes you feel like you are actually experiencing Maddy's evolution, from the stereotypical societal notions of \\"being a woman\\" to accepting womanhood and femininity on her own terms. Already wise beyond her years, she evolves from the intelligent child to the enlightened \\"young woman,\\" who's changed view of the world results in a new found \\"realism\\" that causes her to reevaluate the accepted roles of sex, race, and religion in the world of Pyke County. This is an excellent read and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Eden: A Novel","review":"While reading Eden, I could hear Olympia Vernon's voice through her style, tuning every word like an instrument. I see strength in these characters. It is what they find their strength in that is different; this is a place that haunts them, hurts them or may heal them. Each character needs to find strength just to get by in their life walk. We can spy on them through Maddy; she is in the midst of adolescence, finding her own areas of strength to get by. She is growing up by visualizing and feeling the gut revelations that we all learn from family. Through watching the lives of those around her, Maddy sees that love, strength and truth do not always exist together in the same places. It is such a real to life revelation how family teaches us disappointment. There is also a strong sense of longing throughout Eden. Pip displays this longing. I love her name; it is like a flashback to how she used to be lively and exciting. She was once a free spirited beauty who found her strength in men. This caused her to betray her own sister Faye, and so she must live and die as an outcast from her family. What was once strength in her life cheated her by giving her loneliness. Mama Faye finds her strength in Jesus. This helps her function as a savior to her family. She needs His strength to overcome her husband's ways and heal the past hurt of betrayal. Chevrolet seems to find his strength in avoiding mama's Jesus. He gets messed up in the Jesus of the world, who seems to always be after him. He gambles with Jesus so much that his life is always on the line. Eden is a peek into rural southern living, filled with mystery and anticipation."},{"Title":"Eden: A Novel","review":"Eden was awesome. Ms. Vernon's use of words was amazing.

It left me speechless and wanting more."},{"Title":"Eden: A Novel","review":"'Eden' is the best novel anyone's written in a long time. Like many good first novels, it sits bravely on top of the thing that is out of whack in the universe, the flaw that must have been there at the Big Bang and expanded outward at the speed of light. But 'Eden' stands the whole mess on its head when it whispers in a young girl's voice, 'I am not afraid.' This novel transmutes the pain of a kid's hard luck family into a prose poetry we haven't heard since the the novels of the 1930s. I kept thinking of Henry Miller. Why? Maybe because young Olympia Vernon is fearless, as was Miller; and maybe because she perfects something almost unheard of in America: an authentic rather than fake Harvard or Yale working class voice. The novel is so perfectly the thing that it is, and so different, that it sent me scurrying to reread 'Tropic of Cancer;' both hum a great symphony right out of the bloodstream and the womb; and both novels shock with blood and sex and yet somehow ineffably distill a wondering light from what a lesser writer would report only as a scary darkness. And both are unforgetable."},{"Title":"Eden: A Novel","review":"Poetry and prose. This is one the best writers. She makes words proud to be a part of her art.

But this is a completely different viewpoint that provides a fantastic complement to the work of Deming, Weisbord and others looking at Open-systems theory.If you want to see the impact of Human Systems and the dynamics that influence an organizations ability to partner, collaborate, and move beyond the powerful vaccuum of the human behaviors that stall organizational growth, this will provide a whole new way to view the relationships of people, power, and personal leadership within open-systems.Mr. Cummings is right about the simplicity of the book in his review, it IS cartoon like at places. But let's be reminded how icons have changed the computer world and have worked to connect with people who need to remember things clearly, simply, and practically. People are visual learners and this book takes advantage of that reality. It's not written to be an IQ test - but to be clear and concise in boiling down the intricate and delicate issues, and choices, of human interaction in organizations.It focuses on helping the reader learn and apply. If that works for you - make it so."},{"Title":"Seeing Systems","review":"As a 20 year professional in Organization Development, this book illuminates one of the most frustrating elements of a change agent...the ability to have the client or target experience their own responsibility for the current situation. Without that, one is powerless to effect productive change. One can still effect change, but it will be retaliatory or not understood in the context needed to allow people to see the issue clearly and not as a result of someone elses opinion.This book clearly illustrates these concepts and more and is a must read for everyone who wants to facilitate change effectively and productively.Isn't that everyone."},{"Title":"Seeing Systems","review":"In Seeing Systems, Oshry describes how we do not see systems, and what it takes to start seeing them. The book describes in four 'Acts' our blindness to the system in favour of attributing our condition to personal qualities. In the first three acts Oshry relates to our Spatial blindness, Temporal blindness, Relational blindness, and Process blindness. Through examples and case studies from his Power Lab, Oshry reveals what it takes and means to move from blindness to sight. In Act IV Oshry describes seeing uncertainty - we are always in uncertainty, and are compelled to turn it into certainty, compromising along the way our ability to see systems and maintain blindness to systemic situations.With simple, accessible, examples Oshry successfully describes that we ARE living in complex systems, and that a simplistic view of these systems maintains our blindness. Only by shaking off our tendency to simplify our systems by making up stories can we start the journey to become better persons in our family, organization, community, society, mankind.Upon completing reading Act I, I said to myself - this is great insight, but now I have gone through less than a quarter of the book - what else can he explain in this respect and using these concepts? Am I going to be bored through the rest of the book? But Oshry surprises, and highlights the all too familiar situations we run into with additional \\"A-ha!\\" moments. By the end of Act II, I have realized that I should expect these revelations throughout the book - which I certainly have.Anyone with mild awareness to systems will easily identify himself in similar situations - as Oshry puts it - not always, not with everyone, but with great regularity.Having finished reading the book the epilogue left me with great hunger to see more of Seeing Systems. I am certain that the book and the concepts will accompany me for a long while to go, and I do hope that I will engage with the other methods and media that can be found in the book.Great book, great insight, and a very hard task ahead to improve my sight of system."},{"Title":"Seeing Systems","review":"Seeing Systems is a brilliant book; Dr. Oshry has here succeeded inrelating a set of practicable principles in a highly readable andentertaining fashion. The particular charm of Seeing Systems -- whatdistinguishes it from other books of its type -- is in its pedagogicalstyle; it is designed not only to describe, but to teach the theorieswhich are there presented for inspection. The teaching itself istwofold; the first part (which Dr. Cummings seems to think should bethe only part) consists in explaining an abstract theoretical modelfor systems thinking. The second part is phenomenological, in that itseeks to help the reader identify and sympathize with a range ofexperiences that occur in system life. To this end, Dr. Oshry employsevocative description and sympathetic re-enactment to great effect.The result is that the contents of the book are easiest to rememberwhen that of other books are easiest to forget -- that is, when one iscaught up in a whirlwind of intense experiences.The phenomenological part of the book manifests itself in thedistinctive manner of phenomenology; as winding and discursive. Thereis no remedy for it, other than to stop doing phenomenology. If itwere not phenomenological, Seeing Systems would be as Dr. Cummings hasdescribed it -- a mere shadow of \\"Systems Thinking: managing chaos andcomplexity\\". Its prosody would be direct, as direct as it was dull;its illustrations quite businesslike, and forgettable. It would neverbe lightened with something so childish and so right as a mob of blackdots at a committee meeting. It would be a primly respectable littlebook, fit to grace an executive desktop and be charming until opened.And I for one should not read it.Thankfully, Seeing Systems is not such a shadow. It deigns to staycharming even after it is opened. It is not like other books in thesame field; but those books have been written already, and by otherauthors. It is a book unto itself, and is all the better for it."},{"Title":"Seeing Systems","review":"Sorry, I have to disagree with the rest of the reviews above. A serious student of systems thinking will find this book almost childlike. It looks like it was written based on the experiences of someone in a controlled lab instead of the real world. Some concepts are valid and worthwhile, such as the way in which position in the organization determine how people see the system affecting them. But most of the rest of the book is a struggle to get through, due to it's simplistic nature. The font used is almost cartoonish in nature, and the entire book probably could have taken up 40 pages if written in normal font type-spacing.Someone seriously interesting in systems thinking should read. Ackoff, Senge' or Gharajedaghi. Not this book.My favorite systems book is &quot;Systems Thinking managing chaos and complexity&quot; by Jamshid Gharajedaghi. That is a brilliant piece of work which deserves serious study.Regards,"},{"Title":"Seeing Systems","review":"Barry Oshry provides an insight into what he terms the &quot;dance of blind reflex&quot;; those patterns of behaviors we experience in organizations or relationships of any kind. He writes in a conversational tone which allows one to observe their less-than-desirable patterns of behavior and offers a choice. He reinforces that we can change the &quot;dance&quot; but it starts with being able to see the &quot;dance&quot; first. His book is a great start"},{"Title":"Seeing Systems","review":"Before I left the corporate world, I was convinced that often our need to always remain under the reductionist hat severely limits our ability to truly understand a problem as well as secure the future. How many times have you interacted with your organization with other departments who fend only for themselves?

Seeing Systems provided me with a set of tools that make my life easier and interventions more effective.Simplistic? One might think so. But, you'd be wrong. I believe it to be a distillation of truths of organization theory. It's pure genius. The author understands organizations so well he is able to convey it to others in an understandable context. Oshry brings to life the consequences of being in different positions of power in the organization.I have taken his model and use it to look at each of my clients. It gives significant insight to understand why the organization works; why it doesn't and what to do.Read Seeing Systems atleast twice. After the first reading, go to work. What are the behaviors? How effective are the relationships? What are the outcomes? Now read Seeing Systems again. Go back into your organization. Observe the relationships. Apply the model. Predict the outcomes. You'll probably be right. Can't ask much more from a book.By the way, after reading Seeing Systems, I participated in a one-day workshop Oshry presented to the Dallas-Fort Worth Organization Development Network. I wasn't disappointed. He is, that good."},{"Title":"Seeing Systems","review":"Barry's Oshry's work demonstrates a corpus of understanding that dates back into his early works. I have read most everything he has published since 1976 and have also attended the Power Lab, the subject of another book by Doctor Oshry. This seminal text is an excellent, erudite, and unpretentious introduction to seeing systems. I agree with the 2-star opiner that the book is simplistic. However, that is its strength. Dr. Oshry's opus lacks the esoteric gravity or fluffy prose of the learned ignoramus. Instead, he elegantly, playfully, dances through systems, explaining their basics in a manner that belies their complexity.That said, from my reading and my actual experience in the Power Lab is that the book is written by Elites for Elites and has a much harder time looking through true Bottom space--the realities versus the perceptions of those on the bottom by those on the top. After all, this is a book geared more towards corporate executives than everyday Joes.This is a book worth buying and the Power Lab is a place worth going, even if it is a bit cushy by real Immigrant standards. It is a rare writer of big ideas who is impassioned and able to translate into a prosaic vernacular worthy of the wisest sages."},{"Title":"Seeing Systems","review":"I bought the Kindle edition of \\"Seeing Systems\\". My job as a coach and trainer includes work with systems (organizations, teams, companies) and I wanted to learn more about systems thinking. This book got nice reviews and started reading it with high expectations.My expectations vanished soon: book was far from being a comprehensive book about systems, especially from systems thinking perspective.Oshry describes in his book five different ways we are blind to systems1) Spatial blindness: seeing our part without the whole2) Temporal blindness: history is invisible to us3) Relational blindness: we experience pain when relations do not work4) Process blindness: we do not see ourselves clearly in the system5) Uncertainty blindness: We look for certainty and miss opportunityHe then walks through all these, illustrating those blindnesses and providing some hints how to start seeing again.For me, the most useful part was about relations: it was somehow new and probably useful. For other parts, they were not useful, or at least Oshry could now explain convincingly how the blindness could be cured. I also learned some new models to understand systems (top-middle-bottom, for example) and his stories were convincing & I could relate with Power Lab experiences.Biggest issues that I had with the book:a) Somehow it lacks scientific approach. There are observations and stories, but books language and structure are \\"non-scientific\\" which makes the message really distorted. Oshry makes conclusions based on the observations and does not provide any explanation behind the observationsb) Book's style was light and it was hopping between stories, poems, imaginary discussion; it even even had ballet notes! I find very difficult to read a bookthat hasfunny line feedsand extra emptylines in funnyplacesI was almost giving this book three stars, but at the end of the book Oshry goes on a lengthy talk about God and religion. That was the last drop: the final bit that turned my head. This book is not for me.Oshry talks a lot about human systems, interactions and how to take a role in changing the system. However, I am more leaning towards the thinking of W Edwards Deming and John Seddon: build a system that satisfies its purpose and people in it will enjoy their work (..or other role they have in system).This complete lack of system purpose was biggest disappointment in the book. Yes, relations are important, but even more important is to understand the purpose of the system.This is book about people and how to make people think their role in the system and how to change one's behavior in the system. This in NOT about systems thinking or how to create systems. This is about team work, collaboration and relationships. This is not about systems, as I understand them.This is a self-healing book, probably good read during an intercontinental flight. This is not a book for anyone who wants to understand systems (including both people and non-people parts)."},{"Title":"Seeing Systems","review":"I read this book about 6 years a go as a part of my graduate program on organizational learning. My reaction at that time was, &quot;Wow! I feel as if I was blind and Now I See!.&quot; It was like I gained a secret lens through which the organizational behaviors were making more sense to me. I felt so enthralled with the book, I called the number on the back of the book to inquire how I could explore, experience and learn the Seeing Systems concepts further. I have not done that before or since. 6 years later, I still feel Barry Oshry's teachings are one of real gems in understanding organizations and their behavior mysteries.

Ultimately, helps people see themselves and their relationships in ways that can lead to much more effective lives and relationships."},{"Title":"Seeing Systems","review":"I was really enjoying this book and getting a lot out of it. I'm relatively new to learning about how business really works, and so chose this book to learn more about Systems Thinking. The material in it is very interesting, it presents a series of studies done on a large scale where volunteers create model city systems, business and government systems, and so forth. And all are given various degrees of power and inactive observers record as much of what goes on as possible. After the studies are done, the results are analyzed and the participants are de-briefed on what happened with the power that was given or not given.This was all very fascinating to me. I enjoyed learning about the author's work in this field and the results and lessons he has gleaned from his studies. I knock off two stars because he makes a deliberate point near the end of the book of blaming organized religion for much of the dysfunction in the systems of mankind, deliberately calling it &#34;myth&#34;. That may be his personal opinion of religion, and that's fine I suppose. I don't agree. But I felt the jab at faith in God was a cheap shot, and really had no place in a book about business systems. I felt like he deliberately took an opportunity to slip in his bias against religion when it was really not relevant to the topic.That having been said, his personal prejudice at the end doesn't discount the fact that there is a lot of good knowledge and observation in this book about systems in organizations that is presented in a clear way for the relatively un-initiated. I would recommend the book to a friend or co-worker but only along with the disclaimer that I felt the author has some kind of axe to grind against Christianity/formal religion."},{"Title":"Seeing Systems","review":"Oshrey offers cogent and time-tested means by which to consider the roles we as individuals play within a larger organization whether the position is that of top, bottom, middle or customer.

So goes the classic metaphor for how our expectations and beliefs can bias our judgment and perception, and cause us to see only what we want to see.When evaluating the inherent consequences of certain data, one should make a deliberate effort to put them selves in a position to fairly weigh the evidence; thereby creating a logic flow regarding the relevant implications of such information.Some might opt for the position that a typographical error requires one to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Others would retain the relevant information regardless of the errors contained therein. A fair analysis, employs neither method.It's a true shame when expressed opinions of a book become polluted with immaturity and outright trash talk. The fact is that lies, slander and venomous insults are the debating weapons of the ignorant, and the hallmark of self-admiration, which ultimately offer nothing more than a false sense of entertainment for mediocre minds.No amount of evidence is enough to convince some of principles they'd prefer not to see; and in reply, one would expect them to remain stubborn in their disagreement.Even so, no one has the right to subject women, children, and others to supposed reviews that include cursing all manner of venomous filth. There are specific forums designated to poisonous methods of discussion; I for one do not appreciate such refuse on a review page!Despite the ramblings of those whose immaturity disallows them from accepting any position apart from their own, \\"The Quest for Truth\\" gets an honest 4 stars from me.Finally, in the words of George Orwell,\\"In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act!\\""},{"Title":"The Quest for Truth: Come now and let us reason together...","review":"It is a comprehensive book that entails science, medicine, history, prophecy, astronomy, archeaology, philosophy, religion, mathematics and apologetics."},{"Title":"The Quest for Truth: Come now and let us reason together...","review":"This book was one of the best books I have ever read.

He has memorized all of them.Unfortunately, the author took a vacation on the third book, &quot;The Torpedo Run.&quot; In the story, Scoop and Tiny are able to stop the most powerful locomotive in its day by merely standing on the tracks. There is even a picture of this. We were so impressed by the first 2 books, we did not preview this before we let our son read it. (which I doubt we could anyway, as he had such great excitement after his grandmother gave it) We spent the next week trying to explain this. We cut the page with the picture out and intend to edit that part when we read it to him and also erased that part of the tape. What was the author thinking? This is geared towards children and he's showing how to stop a train by standing on the tracks!"},{"Title":"The Torpedo Run (Great railway adventure)","review":"My 4 year old son really enjoys trains, and this book really has kept his attention and interest. It is an ideal book for a pre-schooler or young school-aged child who is interested in trains and has an active imagination.

It holds your interest from the prologue. I highly recommend it for all history buffs and all that like a good tale well told. This historical fiction novel presents factual events in the history of Florida and Southern Alabama. Since this period of history is viewed through the eyes of Champa's Spanish priest and Creek Indians, the reader gains a new perspective.Annie Champa has created characters that are strong, bold, and unforgettable. Padre (the Spanish priest), and Genesis (half Spanish and half Creek), Princess Blue Heron, and Willow (full-blooded Creeks), and Chad (the runaway slave) have been brought to life with Champa's pen. The fast-paced novel races from one adventure to another, each filled with danger, purpose, or a range of emotions. At the same time, the beauty and spirituality of the forest play into the story. The characters experience the joys and perils of living so close to nature.The author's ability to paint word pictures of this beautiful setting (the flora, fauna, and the landscapes which have been altered only slightly with time) and describe the moods stired by these pictures, was superb and right on the mark. I was born in Southern Alabama and my father's family was from the Pensacola, Florida, area, so I am familiar with the scenes described. I can only say, &quot;Well done! Brava!&quot;I believe this is an important book, one that contributes to the understanding of different cultures. Perhaps THREE NOTCHES OF DESTINY will become a classic, and the names of Padre and Genesis will be well known. If asked, &quot;Who are the most famous hunchbacks in literature?&quot; The majority of people would answer, &quot;Quasimodo and Padre.&quot; Or, if asked, &quot;Who are the most famous Indian friends in literature?&quot; They would say, &quot;Tonto and Genesis.&quot;As for me, I know that the Three Notch Road and the earliest travelers on it, as depicted in Champa's novel, will live in my memory. But the book also stirs the reader's imagination and causes one to think of the real travelers and what their individual stories may have been. This is the mark of a truly great novel and one for which the world is richer."},{"Title":"Three Notches of Destiny","review":"A great deal of historical fiction has been written about the Northeast and West, but Annie Champa takes readers down the less well-known road to the deep South in &quot;Three Notches of Destiny.&quot;Champa's reasearch into the history of Alabama and Florida forms the basis for a compelling story about the area.The story begins with a friendship that develops between a Dominican priest and the captain of a ship on which he is emigrating to America. Captain Zamora tells Padre that he has a half-Indian (Creek) child named Genesis Zamora in Florida and is bringing him the gift of a special horse. Eventually Padre and Genesis become friends and when Andrew Jackson is about to invade Pensacola, they flee to the Indian Ridge Trail (later renamed Three Notch Road) to escape.They encounter many hardships before they are captured by an Indian tribe. While they both live with their captors their differences become defined and they lead different lives. Genesis eventually joins the tribe, marries and has children. Padre becomes friendly with Princess Blue Heron who sees him through an almost fatal illness. Together they save a runaway slave, whose plight eventually affects her later actions.Lives change with time but history also changes lives. Genesis dies in a battle so does not face the plight of Creek Indians who are driven from their homes. Blue Heron has married a white man and stays, but her attempt to help runaway slaves ends in tragedy.In the end Blue Heron realizes that to continue living she must face the changing times and make a new life for herself and her children.Champa has researched the area thoroughly and a careful reader will discover many little known events that make this book so interesting. It brings to life an almost forgotten past and may well send readers to history books to learn more."},{"Title":"Three Notches of Destiny","review":"From the beautiful front cover by artist Lois Durda to the back cover, THREE NOTCHES OF DESTINY by Annie Champa is a great work of historical fiction. Her characters are vivid and life-like. They will be remembered. Padre and Genesis, fellow travelers on the Three Notch Road in the early nineteenth century, are an unlikely pair. Padre Morales is a Spanish priest in Pensacola, Florida, at the Catholic Mission. Genesis Zamora, half Spanish and half Creek Indian, is a young man with ambition. Their friendship and common goal are sealed by wearing duplicate crucifixes carved by Padre from seashells found on Pensacola Beach. Their destinies are linked as they interact with Creek Indians, Spaniards, slaves, General Andrew Jackson and his troops, traders, and others in this captivating tale of America's expansion into Southern Alabama and Florida.The author divides the story of her characters' lives into three periods - three notches - to echo the three notches blazed on the trees along the Three Notch Road. Champa's skills are exhibited in her descriptive writing and the organization of the plot, reflecting a continuity and convergence of story lines. In the late twentieth century, a Creek college student, Daniel Zamora, discovers in Southern Alabama a crucifix, which matches one handed down in his family in Oklahoma. He investigates and learns of adventure-filled stories about his ancestor, Genesis Zamora, and how the crucifixes originated and were dispersed to different areas. Through these heirlooms, later generations of Genesis Zamora were brought together. Destiny proves her influence, and makes us all aware of the forces at work in our everyday existence. Two thumbs up!!"},{"Title":"Three Notches of Destiny","review":"I am always looking for good books written by new authors. When I find one I like, I recommend it to other readers.I highly recommend THREE NOTCHES OF DESTINY by Annie Champa to all readers who like adventure, a well-developed plot and characters so real they come to life as you read. The historical detail shows very careful research and is skillfully woven into the story. The Southern Alabama and West Florida locale is the setting for the adventures of Padre, Spanish priest who left his homeland to come to the Pensacola, Florida, Catholic Mission, and Genesis, a Spanish-Creek Indian half-breed. The Three Notch Road, just an Indian trail at the time,ran between Pensacola and the Montezuma Trading Post in Alabama. Padre and Genesis's escape from General Andrew Jackson's advance on Pensacola was made on this trail. Other characters, Princess Blue Heron, Willow, Chad, and others, all encounter Padre and Genesis in a tale of their bold lives in this early period of American history.To me, the difference between a great novel and a mediocre one is how it affects the reader. Can the author stir the reader's imagination? Can the author bring scenes to life? Can the author effect the reader's perspective? Will the novel live in his memory? The answer to all these questions concerning THREE NOTCHES OF DESTINY is a resounding \\"Yes!\\"Annie Champa's skills as a writer enable her readers to visualize the setting and identify with the characters, thereby putting the reader right in the middle of the story. This book gives the reader the opportunity to be there and see things through the eyes of the characters. A reader cannot live through the story without gaining new perspective. This ranks it right up there with the best. I hope you enjoy your trip down the Three Notch Road."},{"Title":"Three Notches of Destiny","review":"THREE NOTCHES is an enchanting story with a well researched backdrop, from the political forces of the 1800's to the Catholic and Indian lore. The Padre is a vivid, quirky man, and his sidekick, Genesis an engaging half-breed just entering manhood; a Holden Caulfield of another era. I'd recommend this book to enthusiasts of general fiction, history, 'western' fiction (though this is set in Southeast, the Indian/Padre theme resonates with Westerns), or suspense stories. I hope Champa writes several more books."},{"Title":"Have I Ever Lied To You? (Political Humor)","review":"Art Buchwald works in a small airless room on the top of the Washington Monument. Subsisting on nothing but orange juice and black coffee, Mr. Buchwald writes his column in longhand on the backs of old White House press releases. They are then attached to the legs of speedy pigeons and delivered to the 421 newspapers that carry his column to every part of the uncivilized world.From his view on the top of the monument, Buchwald is able to see everything that is going on in the nation's capital. His sharp eyes pierce the curtains of the Executive Mansion, the Pentagon, the FBI, and, of course the CIA. Shy, introspective and terribly aloof, Mr. Buchwald rarely leaves his room except to buy Time magazine to see if they've put him on the cover.Despite his long years in Washington, Mr. Buchwald is still a mystery to fellow newspaperment.Some say that Art Buchwald is a pseudonym and the column is written by the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- each service taking the duty for one month.Another theory is that Art Buchwald is really Howard Hughes, which, if true, would make him the richest columnist in the world today.A third theory is that Buchwald is really Dlawhcub Tra spelled backward.In any case Mr. Buchwald is read by millions and millions of people who put their trust in him and count on him to tell them the truth about what is going on in this wicked world today. More and more, readers now say, \\"I won't believe it until I see it in Art Buchwald's column.\\" And this is even more surprising, since Mr. Buchwald deals only in fantasy.This book has to do with many of the problems America is faced with today. It deals with such varied questions as \\"How do you make money in the stock market after World War III?\\" and \\"Does the right of dissent give you the privilege of yelling, \\"Shirley Temple,\\" in a crowded movie theater?\\"It's just what everybody needs to fill his credibility gap.And it's Art Buchwald's best book to date.Have we ever lied to you?"},{"Title":"Raw Energy","review":"This book illuminates the fact that the enzymes present only in raw foods are @ least as important as vitamins &amp; minerals in the maintenance of optimum human health.

His &quot;Atomic Physics&quot; has been around since a long time, but is still the best place to find out why do we really need to replace Newtonian mechanics. This book studies every kind of phenomena which puzzled the physicsts of the early century, like thermal equilibrium of radiation, photo-electric effect, the Bohr model of the atom, specific-heat irregularities, cohesion forces among molecules, etc. Then he shows how quantum mechanics correctly describes each one of them. This is done in a pedagogically very effective way: the ideas are explained in the text, while the more formal derivations appear in a large set of appendices. These are gems of precision and concision, precious by themselves. My favorite one is the derivation of the Van der Waals forces (between molecules), which he shows to be essentially quantal, as they are due to the zero-point energy of the ! quantum harmonic oscillator. One of the great text-books of this century."},{"Title":"Atomic physics","review":"Atomic Physics is based upon a series of lectures on physics that Born gave in Germany in 1933. Since then it has been translated into English updated significantly as physics developed. This means that the book represents sound physics, and not the relatively undeveloped 1933 picture of the physics.I should note that the title of the book is slightly misleading. The original German edition was called modern physics. However, the publisher of the English version already had a book called modern physics, so the English version was renamed Atomic Physics.Born covers a wide range of topics dealing with the gasses, elementary particles, the structure of the nucleus, atoms, molecules. He has written the book in the context of describing the historical development of each topic. This is done in a flowing style by only including important equations in the text. Derivations and so fourth are placed in the 130 pages of appendices in the back of the book. This allows the text to tell a story without the burden of constant discontinuities due to equations. If you want to see the maths, just flip to the back of the book.I would classify this book somewhere between popular science and a textbook. Like a popular science it tells a story, it flows and readable. People with some knowledge of physics can read this book and learn a lot form it. Even without the appendices. On the other hand, like a text it doesn't give hand wavy, simplified descriptions of the physics. This is good hard physics.While I wouldn't call this book a text, it is far too general for that, it does give an excellent overview of the development and character of modern physics from one of the people who was there in the thick of it. I highly recommend it to any person that is acquainted with physics. Non-scientists would probably benefit more from reading something like Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe.This is a great book, it is well written, structure and relevant. It fully deserves five stars. To reiterate what other reviewers have said, I wish present-day textbooks were written this well."},{"Title":"Atomic physics","review":"When we see how much quantum mechanics pushed our civilization and how bad it became explained on 'modern' textbooks it is a relief to find out that this book is still published and affordable.

The latter is needed to understand it completely. It's probably also a wonderful book to read even if you don't have an advanced degree in math and physics, for it does actually penetrate the equations and reveal the physics hidden within them. It is telling of the calculus-centric view of its era, that the author uses Fourier transforms, separation methods for PDEs, perturbation theory, and other advanced analysis tools, without flinching, but shies away from simple algebraic methods as being 'mathematically too advanced.'"},{"Title":"Atomic physics","review":"I know this book from my student days and found it to be an outstanding primer on atomic physics.

It is a treasure that should have a much larger reading audience. Even if this is not an area you have ever had an interest in, I recommend it most highly to you.The saints used to be a big deal. Time has changed all that. Still, what is the meaning of the word \\"saint\\" in the present day? While the saints surely still serve as guides to a few, they have taken on an air of incomprehensibility for many others. Even most Christians have a hard time with what the term \\"saint\\" means.All too often when we speak of saints in modern times, images of the self-hating joyless ascetic spring to mind. The only problem is that most of the people we call saints were the furthest thing from these images.What Phyllis McGinley restores to the image of the saints is their basic humanity. These women and men were no different from you or I. Some were shockingly earthy. Some did indeed live among the clouds. All loved their Savior with great fervor.The stories contained in \\"Saint-Watching\\" are insightful and very entertaining. I recommend them wholeheartedly to you. Find a copy of this book and see for yourself."},{"Title":"Saint-Watching","review":"Although this book is out of print, I would highly recommend checking library shelves for it. The author shares delightful stories of the saints, as she knocks off the plaster casts and tells of their humanity."},{"Title":"Saint-Watching","review":"A wonderful new insight into the lives and accomplishments of many of the important (and not so important) saints."},{"Title":"Saint-Watching","review":"Phyllis McGinley was a poet who won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1961. I remember reading criticisms about her because her poetry tended to glorify, or at least put in a good light, the life of a suburban housewife. One can imagine how politically incorrect this kind of literary reflection was after her Pulitzer award. Yet a poet she was, and good one, apparently. And the great writing of a good poet is a gift that this book about saints gives to us. So it is not just the subject matter - the lives of the saints in their unadorned reality, that is, without the whitewashing that is usually provided to young schoolchildren preparing for their sacraments. No, these are the saints in the raw, so to speak, with their flaws as evident as their virtues. Sanctity does not mean, or even imply, perfection. Sanctity is a constant struggle toward holiness, a struggle because there is always falling to temptation and backsliding (as Protestants would say). But it's the struggle that makes the saint. McGinley still does make clear to us what separates the true saints from the rest of us - their literal interpretation of the word s of Jesus, for example. If Our Lord said give everything up and live for the poor, that's what they did - See St. Francis. They respond to the call wholeheartedly, even if with hesitation, although that hesitation usually comes from doubt in the self, not from doubt in the One who is calling. McGinley treats her subjects under different categories - saints according to their land origin, for example. Loyola the consummate Spaniard; Rose of Lima a product of her environment, her harsh and even violet penances perhaps abhorrent to our modern sensibilities but understandable to her contemporaries. Her categories fit neatly and aide in the understanding of each saint's success. She even has one chapter for individuals who, but for their non-Catholicism, may have been saints: Gandhi, for example. All of this captivating and motivating information presented to the reader in beautiful prose, in a form of biographical poetry."},{"Title":"Amos/Hosea/Micah: A Call to Justice (Six Weeks with the Bible)","review":"\\"Mind your own business\\" may be a common saying, but in this study guide we are shown that the message of the Bible as revealed through Amos, Hosea, and Micah is exactly the opposite. Other people's business is our business when they are suffering economic hardship ad oppression. We must pay attention to the poor, the disenfranchised, the helpless in our society.Although these three books were written about seven centuries before Christ, their message is as timely today as then. Each prophet calls people to depart from their present courses in favor of a preferred end. None of them mince words but are often blunt as they level accusations of wrong doing and predict eternal punishment for those violating God's call to justice for all. Their purpose, reminiscent of the \\"fire and brimstone\\" preachers of Colonial America, was to call people to salvation, to reform their lives and society in line with God's justice so that they might experience His mercy and compassion. Their message was crystallized centuries later by St. Ignatius Loyola when he wrote: Love consists in sharing what one has and what one is with those one loves. Love ought to show itself in deeds more than in words.These three prophets may be thought of as messengers of doom; yet, they all end on a hopeful note, promising the joy of everlasting life for those who show compassion and justice for those who most need it, salvation for those who work actively for social and economic justice.Amos in Chapter 5, verse 24 says, \\"But let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.\\" Micah succinctly sums up the message of the Old Testament in 6:8 when he gives a brief summary of what is necessary to live a godly life: \\" ...and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?\\" Hosea, often the most damning of the three, also ends on a hopeful note in 14:7-8 when he predicts \\"They shall again live beneath my shadow, they shall flourish as a garden, they shall blossom like the vine, their fragrance shall be like the wine of Lebanon.\\"The only drawback, in my opinion, to this study guide was that the complete books were not printed out in the text.. This has been done in other books in the series I have used. For this edition, you must refer back to your Bible for the complete text as the editor only used selected, albeit eloquent, passages from the three prophets. However, the well-crafted questions for application, the detailed guides to the readings, and the approach to prayer all all excellent and consistent with the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Yo, Julio Verne (Personajes)","review":"A must read; at least the introduction! No doubt about it Jules Verne was not a common writer but an author who had a knowledge that goes beyond common people. His exact and amazing \\"prophecies\\" were not a result of good luck, but a deep study and knowledge of secret sciences such as numerology. Benitez takes us by hand trough the magnificent discovery he did on Jules Verne life and death and still leaves us uncertain on how he discovered Jules Vernes' \\"confessions\\". His confessions, as Verne called them, are a complete and exact narration of his life, his personal attitude towards life, and his inner thoughts on himself. Written in 1st person throughout the hole book Jules Verne is actually telling us the story of his life and how people always had a misconception about him because even he was an extremely famous person, besides the father-son relation he had with his publisher he had nothing else. A very interesting book that shows us how nobody can go against his own destiny but accept it and live with it the best as possible."},{"Title":"Yo, Julio Verne (Personajes)","review":"The Spanish J. J. Benitez is an ambiguous writer. He certainly did an interesting work showing us what would be &quot;Verne's point of view&quot; of his own life.On the other hand, the book is full of mysterious and esoteric thinkings from the author that are (at least) hard to believe. Benitez describes &quot;amazing findings&quot; but proves no one. Maybe Mr. Benitez should not take himself as the only one that knows the &quot;hidden true&quot; of every subject and so he could give us more persuasive stories..."},{"Title":"The Leader's Brain","review":"This book uses brain centered science and art inspired practice to explain the complexities and uncertainty of leading in the modern business world. Readers may find the first few chapters heavy, as they reference many new discoveries in neuroscience. However, these forays are mostly justified and applied in practical capacity builders in the latter half of the book. The \\"Leadership Sensing Toolbox,\\" presented in the last two chapters, describe numerous activities and tools inspired from the arts (i.e. theatre, sculpting, photos etc.). These tools attempt to evoke \\"fresh eyes\\" which catalyze intuitive and creative leadership.In some respects this book qualifies an entirely different approach to what it takes to lead and succeed in the business world. If you need balanced scorecards, ROI case studies, look elsewhere. Dr. Heemsbergen focuses on what \\"mindful\\" leaders seem to do intuitively: make decisions that change peoples' patterns, leverage creativity and evolve organizations. He seems to take much inspiration from the Arts, asking if there is are synergies between an effective corporate leaders and artistic practice. The author's background lends to extensive research on the brain, from which he argues that great leaders employ non-conscious processes 'below' the spreadsheet that are similar to those leaps taken by artists in the creative process. How does an artist choose his palette? Can a CEO mimic and learn from that process? For instance, he encourages the metaphor of visualizing a blank canvas rather than a blueprint in decision-making processes.Although the book is well written and reasonably organized, it can be choppy and wide-ranging. Combining neuroscience, business leadership and the Arts is an almost Sisyphean task, which shows in the sometimes-rough prose. Those who skim may appreciate the many \\"Try This\\" breakouts, while those wanting context can delve into the science behind the ideas. Although not the easiest of reads, The Leader's Brain offers perceptive insight into many trends that are emerging in mainstream consulting (BCG, McKinsey etc.)."},{"Title":"The Leader's Brain","review":"The book is way to \\"scientific\\" in it's reading and less direct in how a \\"Leader\\" would think, analyze, or process data to arrive at the decisions he would.

B. Hart)","review":"I expect this book is quite interesting to scholars such as myself who are interested in the academic study of public opinion. The author's contribution is interesting because it predates the present period of quantitative empiricism on mass opinion yet still reflects widely held beliefs about the challenges of public opinion, representation thereof, and the operation of government.

A dazed Mrs. Jerningham, a newlywed and heiress, has stumbled onto the possibility that her husband, Dale, might be seeking to kill her. It's a fantastical notion -- too fantastical to be true. Or is it?But the novel, the fourth in the Miss Silver series, doesn't live up to that auspicious beginning. Miss Silver barely plays a role in solving the crime, and Lisle Jerningham proves to be such a fatalistic milquetoast that one hardly cares about her fate. After all, why should we care more about whether she lives or dies than she apparently does?A bad Patricia Wentworth novel is better than a lot of other authors' best effort, but The Danger Point is definitely not up to the usual standard of a Wentworth mystery.

It was a terrible blow when it was stolen with my car some ten years later,and indeed I never could bring myself to tell my dad that our precious Chomsky collection was in my trunk. So I was actually tearful when I found it available on Amazon.One must always stand in awe of the fact that this groundbreaking tome was Chomsky's Bachelor thesis. It is intimidating to me and anyone who gets past the first chapter that a college senior produced this astounding labor.He knows his subject and he knows it well.My entire understanding of syntax,surface structure and deep structure of language began from this work.It made the difference in my study of language and helped me grow from instinctive,intuitive knowledge to reasoned thoughtful understanding of how we communicate with our fellow humans."},{"Title":"Syntactic Structures","review":"Although Chomsky later changed his ideas towards linguistics in'Aspects of the Theory of Syntax', but this book is essential in understanding his relation to the Bloomfildean school and is essential for understanding 20'th century linguistics."},{"Title":"Syntactic Structures","review":"Chomsky's *Syntactic Structures* is legendary today for its being the founding document in the field of generative grammar; but this is to say that the many theses of this book are poorly understood from a distance. Originally the student of Bloomfieldian Zellig Harris, Chomsky released this work after many years in Cambridge, Mass.; and although the traditional concerns of structuralist linguistics are well-represented in Chomsky's work, here this is through an engagement with the work of Willard van Orman Quine which has to my mind never been fully extracted. Chomsky took Quinean scruples concerning the &quot;theory of meaning&quot; as a guide for syntactic theory, namely as the extent to which an adequate syntax for natural language must &quot;sin&quot; against the strictures of compositionality embodied in formal languages; and although his strategy here has had its fans, the &quot;stepwise&quot; construction of his argument and its import have to my knowledge never been fully addressed.Beginning with an immensely convincing case against the Markovian logic implicit in cybernetic analyses of communication, Chomsky sketches the extent to which various &quot;rigorizations&quot; of the communicative upshot of utterances (visions of the &quot;speaker-hearer circuit&quot; literally displayed by Saussure) fail to capture the grammatical articulation of sentences, and this in a *theoretically constitutive* way. The fate of each such &quot;fail-safe&quot; demonstrates the extent to which the &quot;story about the story&quot;, the speaker's implicit grammar, serves an empirically regulative function (i.e., is palpably part of the observable activity of &quot;reasoned&quot; discourse); and this is presented in a theoretical vocabulary so lean as to have invited further formalization beyond the &quot;core&quot; theory's subsequent refinements by Chomsky and students.In other words, this is essential reading for anyone trafficking in linguistic &quot;transitions&quot; of any kind: simply reaffirming a hostility to &quot;Enlightenment commonplaces&quot; will not relieve the researcher of the theoretical burdens imposed by the well-nigh-unavoidable desiderata of theoretical adequacy both explicit and implicit here. This is not a &quot;what-if&quot; narrative, concerning an alternate history for linguistic theory: this is just-so stuff which should constrain your understanding of what is already the case, and in no very &quot;normative&quot; way (though individuals primarily concerned with Chomsky's politics can easily absolve themselves of responsibility for linguistic theory by ignoring it). A true classic."},{"Title":"Syntactic Structures","review":"Chomsky's assertion of the creativity of sentence production derives, in part, (one must believe) from Emil Post's work in symbol production: given a finite vocabulary and a finite and small set of rules, an infinite number of \\"sentences\\" can be created. I recommend a read of Post's more rigorous mathematical treatment on linguistic creativity.Following Bloomfield, Chomsky, after rejecting the clear inadequacies of left-to-right state machine structures, adopts a transformational approach that imbeds phrase markers. The idea, computational and not entirely new, uses the axiom of replacement, with recursion, to construct and deconstruct, first syntactic words (nouns, verbs, objects, et al.), then phrases, with operators, assuring functional equivalence. In the transformational step, constants are added for plurality, tense, and mood. Later, as in Wittgenstein, context is inserted to normalize speaker and listener, conserving meaning and phonology over use.The work here, as Bloomfield states, is empirical, a re-engineering of actual languages, complete with special cases (viz., passive voice accommodations). There is more than a hint of work-in-progress, as ideas are conjectured, discarded later (we have learned), cases added, and so on. It would be remarkable if, as Chomsky later asserts, these transformational rules were nicely imbedded a priori in the mind, when the work to describe them is so heuristic.Nevertheless, with cognitive science and neurology steadily on the march, such speculation may soon seem trivial. It is unthinkable that the infant comes empty to the task of language acquisition. Who could a think otherwise, except, perhaps, a doctrinaire empiricist?Chomsky, whose primary mission seems to have been to be a success, also lands on the right and self-evident side of behavioralism (it is not so much incorrect as incomplete - which is far worse), and so has read Darwin and Freud as well as Plato."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"I don't read a lot of mysteries, so I'm hardly qualified to review one. But reading this one helped me clarify what I want out of a mystery novel. I want all the necessary and relevant facts presented to me to solve the mystery, and I want the detective to be so brilliant that she sees what I can't and solves the mystery in such a way that I go, \\"Of course! It was right in front of me all the time, I just couldn't see it!\\" That's fun reading.Maybe that's rare, I don't really know. This book doesn't have it. When the mystery is solved, the culprit turns out to be a minor character, and the conclusive bit of evidence was gathered by Wimsey outside of the story. It's really more police work than detective work, and it ultimately feels anticlimactic to me.What Sayers does do well is explore her protagonist's psyche and her complex relationship with Lord Peter. Rarely have I read a better account of grown-ups trying to figure out a relationship; this is not flowers and romance love, but it is love, and I enjoyed the complexity, subtlety, and seriousness of it. In the end, Sayers (in this book, anyway) is really more like Jane Austen than Agatha Christie, and I guess I just wish I'd known that going in."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"Although surpassed by the more tightly written Murder Must Advertise, Gaudy Night is my personal favorite among Sayers' Lord Wimsey murder mysteries for the author's amazing skill in depicting the details and atmosphere of a now bygone era and institution. Although leisurely written, the mystery itself is quite taunt and intriguing and the many complex characters that people the novel are exceptionally well-rounded and believable. Sayers clearly enjoyed creating this particular work, and her pleasure in it illuminates the book to an exceptional degree."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"Dorothy L. Sayers' \\"Gaudy Night\\" was a fun and intelligent read. The author's writing was exceptional, she creates strong descriptive atmosphere, and her character images are on par excellence. Nevertheless, many of the clues did not lead up to what I believe would classify this book as a mystery; even a quasi mystery.Overall, I liked being introduced to Lord Peter Wimsey, even though he did not show up until I was three thirds through the novel. Moreover, each of the plethora of characters had a story in their own right. The book remained me of the mysteries on PBS that I love so much.So why did I rate this four stars instead of five. Even though I found \\"Gaudy Night,\\" something I could not put down, it did meander a bit. I believe the author could have cut some of the superficial dialogue which would have pruned the book by 100 pages. In addition, the conclusion to the supposed mystery was presented too quickly and was quite unsatisfying. However, if you like well-written novels, read this book. You may be lost on why it has been classified as a mystery but Sayers writing will make you one of her fans. I look forward to reading her \\"Busman's Honeymoon.\\""},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"Dorothy L. Sayers created perhaps one of the most whimsical and enigmatic detectives when she created Lord Peter Whimsy. While many of her tales may seem a little archaic nowadays, her writing is extremely intelligent, full of allusions and quotations that demonstrate the depth of her knowledge. \\"Gaudy Night\\" while definitely light in the appearances of Peter Whimsy, is a standout in Sayers' novels, well worth its length and wandering plot.The story centers around Harriet Vane, the infamous detective writer who was accused of killing her lover, only to be cleared by Lord Peter. For the five years after that case, Lord Peter has been pursuing Harriet only to have her spurn him at every turn, yet they remainin companions. Harriet is invited to her Oxford reunion, and returns uncertain of what to expect. But once she is reunited with her old college, her desire for the days of old is magnified, especially when a disturbing mystery begins to unfold within the college. Harriet moves in, under the pretense of doing research, to investigate the person responsible for poison-pen letters and embarassing pranks. When the prankster proves too much for her, she asks for Peter's assistance, certain that he will uncover the culprit before anything fatal happens.\\"Gaudy Night\\" is a lengthy meandering story for a mystery, but that is most likely due to the fact that the mystery is the subplot to the story. For this novel truly is focused on Harriet Vane and the discovery she must go through in order to understand who she is and what she wants out of life. Sayers is a gifted writer who can make even the most stuffiest characters come to life. Truth be told, the solution to the mystery is nothing fantastic, but the journey that Harriet embarks upon comes full circle to a sweet and fitting conclusion."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"Brilliant - a grown-up book!

There is no murder; but you expect one at any moment.We start with the &quot;Gaudy Night&quot; a reunion and meeting of female graduates and present students. First there are unsettling and obscene scrawlings. It escalates to a prank in the chapel; then vandalism in a student's apartment.There are many red herrings in this novel. When you think you've got it figured out, along comes another clue!This is not a traditional whodunit in the tradition of Agatha Christie. The novel has a romantic subplot and some polemics. This does not detract from the story.I loved the character of Lord Peter Wimsey. Many writers get stuck in the mode of putting the sleuth in the character of a Jane Marple or a Hercule Poirot. Lord Peter is a unique character."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"I think it's in this novel that Dorothy L. Sayers reaches her peak as a writer. If you read all of the Wimsey novels in order, you notice a change once the character of Harriet Vane is introduced. Sayers tried to go back to writing clockwork mysteries after that, but they all fell flat (particularly that horrible one set in Scotland). Have His Carcase was as frustrating to the reader as it was to its main characters, because Sayers was still struggling and couldn't seem to figure out what was wrong. It is in Gaudy Night that she corrects the problem, and she shows it through Harriet.Harriet Vane is the main character of this novel, although Lord Peter is certainly the second lead. While Harriet is trying to solve the mystery at Shrewsbury and trying to figure out just what her feelings are for Lord Peter, she is also struggling mightily with her novel in progress. She realizes that her main character, Wilfred, is doing stupid things no real person would do just because it is what will make the mystery she has plotted work. Finally, in a relevatory discussion with Lord Peter, he tells her that she can either have cardboard characters doing stupid things to make an easy mystery, or she can have real characters do things that real people would do and end up with a novel that is not only a mental challenge to the reader, but an emotional one as well.That is what Dorothy L. Sayers finally accomplished with Gaudy Night, and why I re-read it every few years. Brava, Ms Sayers!"},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"Dorothy Sayers has frequently used autobiographical experiences as a starting point for her writing - as an example, &quot;Murder Must Advertise&quot; was set in an advertising agency and based on Sayers' own experiences in the field. Here again, Sayers goes back to her past days as an Oxford student at Somerville College and this makes &quot;Gaudy Night&quot; a unique entry in the Lord Peter Wimsey series. Harriet Vane, an Oxford alum, attends the Gaudy, which is a reunion of past students and is asked by her old professors to turn her talents as a detective writer to practical use. Someone is terrorizing the faculty and students of the college by sending vicious anonymous letters. The college is terrified of this leaking out to the press and giving education for women a bad name, therefore discretion is vital. Rather relectantly, Harriet accepts and comes down to Oxford to stay for a term. She discovers that the perpetrator is not now satisfied by just sending letters and is moving on to more serious offences like trying to burn the books in the college library, destroy the works of the faculty and eventually attacking certain faculty members. Harriet struggles with the realization that the perpetrator may be a professor as well as with the realization of her growing feelings for Lord Peter Wimsey. The actual unraveling of the mystery is fascinating by itself, but I was particularly intriuged by Sayers taking the opportunity to discuss issues such as society's view towards University education for women, and the need to maintain one's own identity, even in a serious relationship. &quot;Gaudy Night&quot; is therefore a truly feminist work and Harriet's internal struggle between her love for Wimsey and her desire to maintain her independence is something all women can identify with, even today. Although she is hard to like at times, being prickly and sensitive to a fault, we can all sympathize with her predicament. In a nutshell - absolutely fabulous and required reading for all Sayers fans!"},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"This book is most remarkable for its ability to frame the issues faceing women in the 20th century and now in the 21st.

What does the decision to marry do to the life of a woman who has been living life focused on other pursuits?Gaudy Night is the name of the reunion that Harriet Vane attends at her alma mater, Shrewsbury College. There she gets the first of what will be many menacing drawings sent to those working or studying at the College. As she tries to help the College determine who is sending these letters and causing the acts of vandalism which follow (all of which express disapproval of women's pursuing careers or education instead of families), Miss Vane must resolve her feeling about marriage, career, and Lord Peter Whimsey. Whimsey, who proposals at regular intervals, despite her uncertainity about whether they are good for each other, eventually joins her at Shrewsbury to help unlock the mystery. All the book's resolution could come a bit faster, it was a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"Dorothy Sayers reached a peak here, with this wonderfully engaging novel about a mystery writer who goes back for her college reunion and stays to continue her studies, only to find a mystery has followed her there.Lord Peter and Harriet Vane are both in full-forward-momentum mode throughout (to borrow a phrase for Lois McMaster Bujold), except when it comes to each other.

Part of the joy of reading her work is that she assumes you also have the classical, literary background of an Oxford or Cambridge scholar; part of the humbling, perhaps sometimes frustrating challenge of reading her work is that she assumes that depth of knowledge, which very few today (particularly in the United States) possess.Nevertheless, I love reading her work! It challenges me to resurrect those bits of scholarship I do possess, buried as they are under the more mundane circumstances of everyday life. It compels me to consider great and important questions: what is the place of scholarship in the modern world; what is highest goal -- scholarship, truth, or human relationships; can one balance the pull of human need and charity with the pull of utmost honesty and integrity in all arenas; can men and women of equal intellect be compatible partners in life.And yet, though philosophical issues are integral to the plot and the tenor of the book, the mystery is equally intriguing and engaging. I readily confess that I had not figured out &#34;whodunit&#34; before all was revealed. I had, however, felt that I had found two new friends in Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane. The plots and sub-plots all tie together; the world of the book is full, realistic and satisfying.A few words of warning. If you do not like British 'manor' books, you may be put off by some of the language and manners of the characters. if it frustrates you to find quotations from great books of literature thrown about in casual conversation -- and sometimes in Latin (and French) without translation; if you find it annoying to have an author assume some basic familiarity with poetry, medieval literature, scholarly argumentation, or even the schooling system of the UK; this may not be the book for you. Which, in my opinion, would be a pity, but I would rather warn you away from a less-than-fulfilling taste of Sayers than run the risk of having you tell all and sundry that you 'hate' her work because it is so 'incomprehensible and dull.'"},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"This is an old book which I read many years ago. I re-read it because Sayers is worth revisiting from time to time. It is not necessarily her best work (not enough Peter Whimsey for my taste) but is still miles ahead of much of our current writing. Harriet Vane, the protagonist, is relctantly pulled into a mystery at her college which involves theft, dirty pictures, hanging effigies and the like. The conclusion is satisfactory. My only real complaint is that the book is far too erudite, too much in Vane's head and too much of her antgst."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"This is an old favorite. Starts out kind of dry, but the romance is charming, and the mystery engaging. I like Lord Peter's life style and have made it my goal to have a &#34;valet&#34; to keep my life together too."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"I'd read and enjoyed a few of the Lord Peter Wimsey mysteries by Dorothy Sayers years ago when the PBS series was on, so I eagerly looked forward to this one when I saw it on Amazon. However, I was very disappointed. Since a whodunit has to have many characters, the problem is that the female characters, of which there are many, are barely distinguishable from one another and are rather colorless. Even the protagonist, Harriet Vane, is insipid. The only one who is at all interesting is Lord Peter himself, but he is not around for much of the novel. In addition, Lord Peter is madly in love with Harriet, so that detracts from his attractiveness. The plot itself is fairly well thought out, but I knew the solution before the end. The other problem is Sayer's feminist agenda which is a bit shrill, overtaking both plot and characters. That agenda is also rather outdated and simplistic in this 1936 story."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"Dorothy L. Sayers' GAUDY NIGHT benefits from Ian Carmichael's pointed production: his BBC background lending accent and tension to the story of an Oxford reunion which involves mystery writer Harriet in a case of ghostly murder. Tension evolves quickly as murder turns to mayhem in this thriller."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"Every time I read this book, and I have read it many, many times, I find myself discovering some new nugget of truth or insight to mull over. I cannot rest until I finish it (\\"When I am gone from it, I am dead till I be with it\\") and when I have I feel like I've been hit over the head with a saucepan. There is simply so much matter in this book, psychological, romantic, intellectual, human, and more, that one would expect it to be quite horrifically overwhelming. However, the fact that it is engrossing and, intriguing, and above all, thoroughly enjoyable is the mark of a truly brilliant writer.I have found that the main objections to this book are that it is falsely advertised as a mystery and that Lord Peter sails in at the last to reveal all, thus contradicting much of the message of the previous chapters. In my opinion, though, these are two of the features that make the book so utterly fascinating. It is, admittedly, not your average mystery. In fact, simply because it is part of a series of murder mysteries, readers assume that it will be like the others. I, on the other hand, find the contrast unbelievably refreshing. One must accept that this was to be the last Lord Peter novel, and was written to resolve the stories of Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane, the two main protagonists. In accepting this, one opens the mind to the thrilling personal quandaries raised by this book. Moreover, the fact that Lord Peter comes in at the end and somehow miraculously fixes everything is not contradictory, it simply shows how Harriet's feelings toward Peter and her psychological tangle at that time prevent her from properly dealing with the mystery. This is also shown in her work, when she has trouble \\"humanizing\\" one of her main characters, simply because she is too close to that kind of problem in real life. It is easily seen that, if one is willing to read deeply enough, this book addresses eternal conflicts and questions, which makes all accusations of its being dated null and void.So, my biggest piece of advice is to know what you are getting into. Almost all people who are dissatisfied with this book are unhappy because it did not follow the pattern they expected it to follow. One must approach it as one approaches any new book, dispassionately (as Lord Peter says) and with and open mind. Do not pick up this book if you are looking for a thrilling murder mystery. For that, I would suggest \\"Unnatural Death\\" or \\"Murder Must Advertise,\\" both by Dorothy L. Sayers. What you have in \\"Gaudy Night\\" is a psychological thriller, which is in some ways even more fascinating than a murder would have been. The plain fact that \\"Gaudy Night\\" is the only one of Sayers' mysteries that does not abide by the rules of fair play detection shows it to be a totally separate entity from the rest of the series. This is a novel about love, internal conflict, and principles. Read and read often."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"\\"It's not really a mystery story\\" is the complaint of some readers of Gaudy Night. Well, maybe not. For me, it's a lot better than a mystery novel. I love the Wimsey stories, and yes, the first time I read Gaudy Night, I was rather impatient for Lord Peter to make his appearance. Solving the mystery was never part of it, for me: I don't generally figure out whodunnit, nor do I particularly care. With Sayers's books, it's the characters and the journey, rather than the destination, that I like. And that's the clue: slow down and don't let the mystery side of it dominate. Gaudy Night has so many other things to enjoy. The discussions, the contemplations of life, scholarship, love, and philosophy are what bring me back to this book time and again. The resolution of Harriet and Peter's torturous relationship is a wonderful ending. Yes, Sayers writes for an audience largely better-educated than the current one. Yes, she uses (shock horror) long sentences. She even throws in untranslated quotations. If a reader can't handle these things, perhaps they shouldn't be reading her at all ... as it says in the introduction of some editions, she was a take-no-prisoners writer who expected her readers to work up. Very different from the expectation now that everything must be dumbed down to the lowest common denominator.Don't read this book expecting a straight mystery, or a book largely featuring Lord Peter. It's Harriet's story, it probes her mind and feelings against the Oxford backdrop, and it has some of the most wondeful passages of introspection on so many subjects, not least on love. Wonderful, wonderful writing. Take your time, read it slowly and enjoy it. This is punting on the Isis, not speeding around London in \\"Mrs Merdle\\"."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"About her book \\"Gaudy Night,\\" Dorothy L. Sayers had this to say:\\"It would be idle to deny that the city and University of Oxford (in aeternum floreant) do actually exist....\\" But, \\"Shrewsbury College, with its dons, students and scouts, is entirely imaginary; nor are the distressing events described as taking place within its wall founded upon any events that have ever occurred anywhere. Detective-story writers are obliged by their disagreeable profession to invent startling and unpleasant incidents and people, and are (I presume) at liberty to imagine what might happen if such incidents and people were to intrude upon the life of an innocent and well-ordered community.... Certain apologies are, however, due from me: first to the University of Oxford, for having presented it ... with a college of 150 women students, in excess of the limit ordained by statute. Next, and with deep humility, to Balliol College--not only for having saddled it with so wayward an alumnus as Peter Wimsey, but also for my monstrous impertinence in having erected Shrewsbury College upon its spacious and sacred cricket-ground.\\"That passage will give you a feeling for Sayers' rather grand, even lofty (by detective story standards, anyway) prose style, as well as the tongue-in-cheek, in-your-eye amusement that lurks behind her formal persona.When I first encountered Sayers and fell into a binge of reading her works, I was a teenager. With the breezy assurance of that age, I confidently ranked \\"Gaudy Night\\" as her feeblest work and \\"The Nine Tailors\\"--or maybe \\"Murder Must Advertise\\" as her best. If anyone at the time had asked me why I had done so, I would have pointed out that the mystery element was only a strand among many in \\"Gaudy Night,\\" and far from the most important one. Moreover, I'd have said, it's a Lord Peter Wimsey novel and Wimsey doesn't even turn up until Chapter IV, after which he promptly disappears for a couple of hundred pages.And yet, over the years when, for whatever reason, one of these books came to mind, I might think, \\"Murder Must Advertise,\\" yes, very clever, Lord Peter writing ad copy and all that, or \\"The Nine Tailors,\\" yes, very clever, those bells and all that. But for \\"Gaudy Night,\\" my thoughts would more likely take this sort of turn: that Harriet Vane has some very odd ideas and notions. We certainly are beyond that sort of thing today--but I know some people who share most or all of those very some ideas and notions. They are walking anachronisms and yet, here they are, unquestionably my contemporaries. On some days, I even find myself agreeing with her and concluding that the lunatics have taken over our Twenty-first Century asylum.Or consider Harriet Vane as a fictional character--amusing, humorless, witty, ponderous, brilliant, too often plodding Harriet. She is, of course, Dorothy L. Sayers (in every aspect that Sayers, herself, would regard as significant), pinned on the pages of the book like some strange sort of moth, a speciment preserved and displayed for the examination of the ages.I recently encountered a 1944, wartime edition of \\"Gaudy Night\\" in a bookshop window. On its copyright page, it proudly bore the motto, \\"Books are weapons in the war of ideas.\\" The book was published in an era of tight paper rationing and extreme austerity, but what a wonderfully sensuous volume it was with its thick, creamy paper, exquisite printing, wide margins and excellent commercial binding in dark blue book cloth. I snapped it up (how could I not?), and read it that evening. It was, I suppose, my fifth or sixth journey through the book.I am no longer a teenager (alas), and I no longer consider \\"Gaudy Night\\" to be Sayers' feeblest work. It might very well be her best: better than \\"Murder Must Advertise,\\" better than \\"The Nine Tailors\\" and certainly much better than the workmanlike (but no more) translation of Dante for which she abandoned her true literary vocation in her final years.Some mystery fans downgrade \\"Gaudy Night\\" because it is a weak mystery novel. A couple of such fans are to be found right here among the Amazon reviewers of the book. They are quite right. It is a weak mystery novel. It is, in fact, just a novel, but a very good one.The true peers of \\"Gaudy Night\\" are not such classic mysteries as Christie's \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" or Marsh's \\"A Man Lay Dying,\\" but English academic novels, the likes of Amis' \\"Lucky Jim\\" or Snow's \\"The Masters.\\" If the literary arena is widened to include plays, then \\"Gaudy Night\\" shares space with \\"The Browning Version\\" and \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\"Here is Dorothy L. Sayers again, this time as Sayers the novelist:\\"Harriet Vane sat at her writing-table and stared out into Mecklenburg Square.... A letter lay open on the blotting-pad before her, but its image had faded from her mind to make way for another picture. She saw a stone quadrangle, built by a modern architect in a style neither new or old, stretching out reconciling hands to past and present. Folded within its walls lay a trim grass plot, with flower-beds splashed at the angles, and surrounded by a stone plinth. Behind the level roofs of Cotswold slate rose the brick chimneys of an older and less formal pile of buildings--a quadrangle also of a kind, but still keeping a domestic remembrance of the original Victorian dwelling-houses that had sheltered the first shy students of Shrewsbury College....\\"Memory peopled the quad with moving figures. Students sauntering in pairs. Students dashing to lectures, their gowns hitched hurriedly over light summer frocks, the wind jerking their flat caps into the absurd likeness of so many jesters' coxcombs. Bicycles stacked in the porters' lodge, their carriers piled with books and gowns twisted about their handle-bars. A grizzled woman don crossing the turf with vague eyes.... Tall spikes of delphiniums against the grey, quiveringly blue like flames. The college cat, preoccupied and remote, stalking with tail erect in the direction of the buttery.\\"Five stars (with flower-beds splashed at the angles, of course.)"},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"This is simply the best book written by Dorothy Sayers, and in my opinion, one of the best books I have ever read (and I read well over a hundred books a year). I read it periodically when I need to cleanse my palate after some of the pap being published today; when I am sad or need something comforting and lovely to cheer me; when I am trolling my shelves for an oldie but goodie. Sadly, the setting and language have made some of my friends reject it. But for anyone who loves British literature or wants to read the thoughts of a university educated feminist of 80 years ago, this is the book. Peter and Harriet's love story is all about finding love and equality, respect, and intelligence.I admit, the mystery itself is not perfectly plotted, but is handled well, and is, besides, only the framework for this lovely comedy of manners. It might help to read Strong Poison first- then you get the opening and closing of the courtship."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"This intelligent, entertaining and captivating work has remained near the top of my personal list for many years. Here is a feminist before her time (author and character) that celebrates independent thought, academic life and romantic love, all superbly intertwined.If you are looking for gory details or grisly murders, this is not the book for you. Sayers has a way of adroitly inserting her own personal philosophy (Christian, feminist, libertarian) into her works without seeming heavy-handed. In this way Sayers resembles the brilliant English writer, Edmund Crispin, who wrote witty and technically proficient mysteries starring Gervase Fen, an English professor at Oxford.It is difficult to select the best aspect of the book - plot, character, descriptions, philosophy, romantic interplay.... As one can gather from other reviews, the writing is top-notch - the story as well-crafted as a sculpture of Tiffany cut glass.The way the tale weaves and winds back on itself is itself a work of art. Although it is helpful to have read the other books in the series, this story easily stands on its own as a classic of mystery literature."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"This is Sayers' masterpiece, and one of the top ten or so mystery novels of all time. It's literate, intelligent, consistently challenging at both an intellectual and emotional level. Harriet Vane and Peter Wimsey are 100% adult characters, who think and feel deeply, and never respond predictably. The Oxford setting is brilliantly laid out and the supporting characters are all beautifully sketched. The mystery itself is well-plotted and powerfully resolved, and works superbly as a tragic counterpoint to the story of Harriet and Peter. This book has already been described in full detail by the other reviewers; all I can say is: read it."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"This book is amazing: not only does it comment intelligently on just about every human life issue, but it does so while being a very competent murder mystery, and consistently enjoyable to boot. Gaudy Night is the novel that shows the world why Dorothy L. Sayers is the master. Her style is as beautiful as always, and this third book in the 4-book Harriet Vane/Peter Wimsey series is a fascinating piece of whodunit mystery fiction, a commentary on the single-sex environment as well as the place of women in education and education in women, a treatise on love, and a breathtakingly realistic and satisfying romance that anyone who's been following Harriet and Peter through Strong Poison and Have His Carcase will appreciate. The fourth and final book, Busman's Honeymoon, is the only thing that could possibly crown Gaudy Night, and I recommend them both.I think anyone who's pondered the very real problems in reconciling Harriet and Peter and how Sayers could approach them while remaining true to both will feel as I did--bought the book, liked it, will keep it."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"Dorothy Sayers is among my favorite authors. She writes with great intelligence and joy and humor. She is well educated and never gets lazy in her writing.

It appears to me that she expects her readers to bring as much energy to their side of the equation as she does to hers."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"Although this is a first class mystery, it is as social comment on life at Oxbridge for women in the 1920s, and as a description of a developing relationship between two very independent people that I re read it from time to time. Gaudy Night and Busman's Honeymoon, which continues the story should be read together. I must have read the two 5 or 6 times since I discovered them in my teens. I'm now downsizing and putting my favorite books on my Kindle and find that I am still enjoying these two books as I read thm again."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"'Gaudy Night,' Dorothy Sayers' penultimate novel in the Lord Peter Wimsey series, was originally intended to be the last. Unlike the rest of the series, it is Harriet Vane's tale, first and last. Lord Peter does not appear in person until the last third of the story, when he takes his place as romantic lead and solver of all things mysterious. Sayer's takes this opportunity to both reveal unexpected depths to Miss Vane's character and create a remarkable elegy of her own memories of Oxford, where she took highest honors in a world made by and meant for the male sex.Harriet returns to Shrewsbury College to take part in the annual Gaudy night, something a bit like our own college reunions, not quite sure what to expect. While renewing her friendship with both her old classmates and instructors, she brushes against the start of a mystery when she finds some very unpleasant notes expressed a vitriolic hatred for the denizens of the college. Brushing it aside as an isolated occurrence, she returns to the festivities without realizing that she has seen is only the tip of the iceberg.Several months later, Harriet finds herself called back to Shrewsbury by the Dean. The few isolated occurrences had become an onslaught and the school desperately needed help in resolving the problem without any adverse publicity. Miss Vane, a successful mystery writer, a survivor of a murder charge, and a friend of the esteemed Lord Peter Wimsey, seemed the ideal person to come to the aid of the Senior Common Room. The idea of a woman's college was still newfangled to Oxford and a scandal could become a major setback. What Harriet found was a steadily escalating attack on the sanity and safety of the college on apparent waged by a devious and hate filled mind.The tale is a psychological thriller, told against the backdrop of Oxford and the University. Sayers fills the book with loving (and sometimes not so loving) details of academic life and its foibles. Her style often mimics Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy and the novels of a century past, providing a comedy of manners as counterpoint to the grim tale of a mind gone awry. Distraught students and instructors alternate with appearances by Wimsey's madcap nephew and countless caricatures, one right after another.'Gaudy Night' is a tour de force, coupling some of Sayer's finest writing with ideas that were novel and controversial when the book made it's first appearance. It is a unique story from the first disturbing note to the last surprising twist and turn in the relationship between Lord Peter and Harriet Vane. And one that is very, very well told. Whether this novel or 'The Nine Tailors' is the better novel will be argued forever, but there is no question that 'Gaudy Night' is one of the best from a mystery writer who stands at the head of her class."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"Dorothy Sayers has frequently used autobiographical experiences as a starting point for her writing - as an example, &quot;Murder Must Advertise&quot; was set in an advertising agency and based on Sayers' own experiences in the field. Here again, Sayers goes back to her past days as an Oxford student at Somerville College and this makes &quot;Gaudy Night&quot; a unique entry in the Lord Peter Wimsey series. Harriet Vane, an Oxford alum, attends the Gaudy, which is a reunion of past students and is asked by her old professors to turn her talents as a detective writer to practical use. Someone is terrorizing the faculty and students of the college by sending vicious anonymous letters. The college is terrified of this leaking out to the press and giving education for women a bad name, therefore discretion is vital. Rather relectantly, Harriet accepts and comes down to Oxford to stay for a term. She discovers that the perpetrator is not now satisfied by just sending letters and is moving on to more serious offences like trying to burn the books in the college library, destroy the works of the faculty and eventually attacking certain faculty members. Harriet struggles with the realization that the perpetrator may be a professor as well as with the realization of her growing feelings for Lord Peter Wimsey. The actual unraveling of the mystery is fascinating by itself, but I was particularly intriuged by Sayers taking the opportunity to discuss issues such as society's view towards University education for women, and the need to maintain one's own identity, even in a serious relationship. &quot;Gaudy Night&quot; is therefore a truly feminist work and Harriet's internal struggle between her love for Wimsey and her desire to maintain her independence is something all women can identify with, even today. Although she is hard to like at times, being prickly and sensitive to a fault, we can all sympathize with her predicament. In a nutshell - absolutely fabulous and required reading for all Sayers fans!"},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"This Kindle version is not worth the money, folks.

Sayers wrote some of the best mystery novels that ever appeared in print. In fact she wrote most of them.Gaudy Night is mainly a novel of Oxford, despite its being ostensibly a mystery. Harriet Vane is the main character of this novel, though of course Sayers' best creation, Lord Peter Wimsey, plays an important part in this book. The dialogue is as clever and wonderfully piffling as ever, the story thought-provoking, and best of all it is here that Peter is finally successful in wooing his Harriet. (The punt scene! And the finale...)There never was a better mystery writer. I would suggest, before reading this, that you read Strong Poison and Have His Carcase for the full effect. Oh, and follow Gaudy Night up with Busman's Honeymoon."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"This is my favorite Lord Peter story and I was thrilled when it became available on Kindle.

It's disrespectful of Dorothy Sayers and of the reader, so I gave it only three stars, otherwise it would get five."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"I've never said this before and I don't think I'll say it about any other book: This book is perfection. The telling is beautiful, seamless and touches every emotion, the way a good book should. Lord Peter Wimsey is such a well-developed character: he has Holmes's wit, combined with charisma, charm, sensitivity, tenderness and intelligence. Earlier in the series, he hadn't figured out who he was or what he wanted to be, but now he knows: to marry Harriet.Miss Harriet Vane is an even better character than his lordship. She's believable, independent, a writer, tender inside, witty, polite and has intelligence to match Lord Peter's. The moments of affection - I hesitate to call them 'love scenes' - were breathtaking, without either party removing any clothes. Some writers today could learn from that.The suspense is high, the love is brewing and the plot is seamless and unlabored, as if it really did happen. I recommend this to EVERYONE. I may only be a kid, but I know perfection when I see it.On another note: I don't like the DVDs of the Dorothy Sayers books. They are perfect in all their literary glory; why try to improve perfection? Another thing, Lord Peter Wimsey is his best on paper, not impersonated by some silly person trying to act like an English lord, who will never come close to Sayers's Peter's immortal charm, intellect and tenderness."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"If one were allowed 10 books on a desert island, this would be one. I still re-read it several times a year, whenever I'm depressed.Apparently people were educated differently 70 years ago when the book was written--Sayers included portions of untranslated French, apparently confident her readers could decipher it. A friend has complained the sentences are too long but the work is an engrossing, majestic masterpiece which never fails to convey one to a grander time, one without TV or Internet but perhaps not suffering from those lacks.Some day I'm having a portrait of Harriet Vane done to hang in a place of honor."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"Gaudy Night is, in my opinion, the very best of Sayers's fine mystery novels starring Lord Peter Wimsey, younger (and smarter) son of a duke and jack of all trades. For two previous volumes, Strong Poison and Have His Carcase, Peter has pursued Harriet Vane, a mystery novelist whom he saved from being unjustly tried for the murder of her lover, Philip Boyce. Now Harriet takes center stage as she attempts to investigate a mysterious phenomenon which has taken over her old college at Oxford--a combination poison-pen writer and midnight poltergeist that sends abusive anonymous letters and wreaks havoc on buildings and possessions. Uncovering the culprit, however, leads to devastating revelations for her and Peter. Sayers uses the mystery genre here to explore questions of the relationship between career and relationship in men's lives and women's, the nature of love and marriage, and the value of doing one's proper work. Her language is at its richest here, and its portrait of Oxford life c. 1930 is as irresistible as any science-fictional worldbuilding."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"...and solve a mystery, too? Gaudy Night was the first Sayers book I ever read, &amp; what a find! GN is first &amp; foremost the resolution of the Harriet Vane/Lord Peter relationship begun in Strong Poison. The 'mystery' serves primarily as a pretext to contrast traditional ideas of marriage &amp; woman's 'place' with Sayers' very different &amp; 'modern' ideas on the topic. At times, it's practically an intellectual treatise on the subject, argued by woman dons at the high table. Drenched in the atmosphere of 1930s Oxford, drunk with the poetry of Donne, GN is a tour de force of intellectual seduction. Harriet is not an easy woman to love--she's been deeply hurt, she's much too independent, &amp; she's far too intellectual for her own good. There are readers who will never appreciate Harriet, or think her 'worthy' of the witty, sensitive &amp; intellectual Lord Peter; their loss. In the 1930s, women believed that they had a forced choice between matrimony &amp; a career. A large part of Harriet's reluctance to say 'yes' is the very real fear of losing her hard-won selfhood: &quot;If I once gave in to Peter, I should go up like straw.&quot; In this, she mistakes her man; Lord Peter doesn't want a 'mere' wife, he wants an equal partner! He may actually be the first male feminist in detective fiction; no wonder poor Harriet can't believe it. Such men are hard to find even today, much less in Harriet's day. This is the ultimate thinking woman's romantic mystery!"},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"The novel, of course, is brilliant; sadly, this electronic edition has a lot of obvious misreadings, and that's not including the quotations of Classical writers in the Greek alphabet. If you're going to read this novel for the first time, go to your local library and borrow the oldest, dustiest copy you can find.

Since her acquittal Harriet says no to her persistent hero Lord Peter Wimsey while feeling somewhat abashed that her dirty laundry was revealed in court but as she did even in jail and at the trial she still refuses to bow down to the nasty gossips.However, someone has a different opinion about Harriet. She receives ugly letters calling her a \\"dirty murderess;\\" each one harsher than the previous. Fearing for her life, she asks her champion Lord Peter for help as she knows a stalker walking the hallow halls of Oxford plans to execute her.The third Lord Peter Wimsey Mystery with Harriet Vane (see Have His Carcase and Strong Poison) is an engaging historical mystery that focuses on the beginning of the Depression and the bantering relationship between the protagonists more than the super whodunit. The support cast is excellent as they bring circa 1930s academia to life while making a strong case for women's rights as the female professors have less standing than male freshmen. Fast-paced, fans will enjoy the engaging Gaudy Night.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"So glad this book is now available for my wonderful Kindle. It is one of my favorite books. The mystery is intricate and the characters come alive as you read it."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"You can't find a better between-the-wars tea-sipper. Just don't expect any dead bodies. It's a different kind of mystery."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"In Gaudy Night, Dorothy Sayers clearly decided to \\"up her game\\" as a writer. Since this is a woman and writer whose \\"game\\" is considerable, you are in for a real treat. This novel is both a mystery and a masterpiece. That said, I can't recommend the book if you haven't read a good number of the other Whimsey mysteries already. Many of us, myself included, want to read \\"the best of the best\\" as our first book for an author but that won't work here. Sayers wrote each of her mysteries for a loyal following and each book assumed that you had read the previous ones. I discovered this accidently by beginning with a later mystery and being puzzled by characters that appeared with little introduction. They were, in fact, reoccurring characters who had been introduced in previous stories.In Gaudy Night we get to know the character of Harriet Vane in a much deeper way than we did in Sayer's previous two mysteries that included her. But you need to know Lord Peter Whimsey very well for this book to really work. In Gaudy Night and in Nine Tailors, Lord Peter has aged and is more subdued. However, there is little subdued about the Lord Peter in the earlier novels and his buoyancy, brilliance, energy, and self-confidence both attract and irritate Harriet. That's why you need to know Lord Peter's character, both as Harriet perceives it at the beginning of Gaudy Night, and as Sayers develops it over her excellent series of books.Unfortunately, the Sayers' mystery titles listed by Harper Collins in their paperbacks are only in alphabetical order. But Wikipedia has a good biography of Sayers where you can get all the novels' titles as they were written. Otherwise, I'd recommend that you at least read Clouds of Witness before you read the first of the Harriet Vane/Whimsey mysteries, Strong Poison, and then read The Unpleasantness at the Belonna Club before going on to Have His Carcase (optional) and Gaudy Night. Each one of Sayers' mysteries has much that delights with interesting characters, puzzling plots, and laugh out loud humor - so if you need to go back and start with the very first before progressing through to Gaudy Night, I have to say that I envy you!"},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"Gaudy Night is Sayers at her academic best. The more you read it, the more you get from it. The characters are delightful, and there is romance as well as detection. All this is brought to life by the expert narration of Ian Carmicheal. A treasure!"},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"Ian Carmichael is one of the first Lord Peter Wimsey's. There are a series of films with him as Wimsey such as \\"Five Red Herrings\\". He is a natural to be reading this recorded edition.My first encounter with Dorothy L. Sayers was the Mobile Mystery Theater series showing on PBS. Unfortunately, I did not realize that my video player was also a recorder until the \\"Gaudy Night\\" was on Mystery Theater. In that sense, I was lucky to copy the complete three hour \\"Gaudy Night.\\" I now own the DVD that came out in 2002.Naturally, the TV media cannot fill in all the details that you would pick up from reading the book, so I read the book. This added more depth and characters to the story. Dorothy not only fleshes her characters out but her side trips into philosophy and psychology make the story that much more interesting. Just when you ask what is the relevance to this conversation it is wrapped up in the final solution.It is too bad they do not make the unabridged recording of this book anymore, as the reader is Ian Carmichael the first TV Lord Peter Wimsey.This is the third of a fourth book series. Enough background information is given however to make this a stand-alone story.The notorious Harriet Vane is invited to a class reunion. She is looking forward to a quiet time with a better part of her history. Once there, she starts getting notes that carry negative connotations. The notes are pasted together from cut out newspaper words. Soon others are receiving the notes. The School authorities request Harriet to help get quietly to the bottom of this. Circumstances eventually force her once more to go to Lord Peter Wimsey for help. I am over simplifying the plot but it is better to discover it for your self. This is a five star book.Dorothy L. Sayers Mysteries (The Lord Peter Wimsey-Harriet Vane Collection - Strong Poison / Have His Carcass / Gaudy Night)"},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"Dorothy Sayers wrote ad copy, mystery novels, plays, essays on theology and translated Dante. Her fictional detective, Lord Peter Wimsey, was the toast of Europe, a more cultured precursor to James Bond. But Wimsey's success was a bit of a trial to his author. She wanted to write a serious novel about the things that really mattered. However, the bills were coming in and Sayers had to write the Wimsey mystery she had been putting off--the one in which Peter Wimsey finally succeeded in convincing Harriet Vane to marry him.Peter had pursued Harriet in STRONG POISON and courted her in HAVE HIS CARCASS. Other books had interspersed; Sayers had to wind up the romance to please her readership, but she also had something she had called her \\"Oxford project\\" in the back of her mind.So she combined them, taking Harriet Vane to Oxford for a alumni reunion, and springing a mystery into the middle of her \\"serious novel\\". The result was a classic, a sweetly evocative novel whose theme tolls through the years like the bells of Oxford: is it possible for a woman to have both a love life and an intellectual career? As Harriet hesitates between returning to academic life and marrying Peter, a poison pen poltergeist wrecks havoc in Shrewsbury College. The tension ratchets higher and higher--it is clear that the stakes are as high as murder. But what old crime triggered this harassment?Is this book more a mystery, that readers will race through to find the answer to the puzzle, or is it a fine novel that they will return to time after time, savoring the characters and finding new nuances every time? Read it and see."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"Dorothy Sayers' Lord Peter Wimsey mysteries began, I believe, as a way to earn some ready money, and they were cast (in part) as pastiches of Wodehouse. None of the earlier mysteries (though *Strong Poison* is important to understand the background of *Gaudy Night*) can compare to this wonderful book. It is, simply put, the ideal romance for literary intellectuals, and the mystery is merely the context for the romance between Lord Peter and Harriet. If you like this kind of thing, there is truly nothing better of its kind (though the sequel, *Busman's Honeymoon* is delightful in its own way)."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"Dorothy Sayers is no more \\"just a mystery writer\\" than is Josephine Tey or P.D. James. Gaudy Night is brilliant in its portrayal of the insidiousness that suspicion has in a closed community. Each reading brings a new insight, as any good piece of literature should."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"When I went through library school -- back when that meant deep knowledge about books, not online databases -- one of the requirements was several semesters of exposure to various genres of popular fiction, since you can't recommend to patrons what you aren't familiar with yourself. Mostly, when it came to mystery novels and detective stories, that meant the classic authors as they were in the 1960s: Ngaio Marsh, Ross MacDonald, Margery Allingham, John Dickson Carr, Dorothy Sayers, and especially Agatha Christie. I didn't read mysteries as a kid (science fiction was my thing) but I discovered several authors whose work I could appreciate, and I've found many more since. But I never could handle Agatha Christie. The plots were silly, the backgrounds were completely unrealistic, and Poirot and Marple were the purest cardboard. Somehow, Dorothy Sayers became tarred in my mind with the same brush -- \\"cozies for little old ladies\\" -- and I ignored her books for several decades. It really wasn't until some of her Peter Wimsey stories began to be dramatized on BBC and then repeated on BBC that I began to reconsider. Then I discovered what I had missed out on all those years.Where Christie played to the conservative, backward-looking masses, Sayers was an intellectual -- one of the first women to earn a degree at Oxford, humanist essayist, a noted translator of Dante, even a successful advertising copywriter. And she writes beautifully. Even though this late novel focuses on mystery author Harriet Vane, whom Lord Peter saved from the hangman five years before, and even though it's technically not even a murder mystery, I think it's one of her best books. Harriet has been struggling in her mind ever since the death of her lover and her brush with a guilty verdict, trying to fend off Wimsey's loyal love for her because she doesn't want to be betrayed by her own gratitude to him. She's also managed to avoid other parts of her past, including her academic career, assuming her old tutors and schoolmates will be interested only in her personal scandal, but she finally gives in and drives up to Oxford for the annual Gaudy Night reunion at Shrewsbury College (a thinly veiled version of Somerville, Sayers's own college). She's relieved to find everyone is much more interested in her professional present than her past, and that the academic world is still as congenial as she remembered. However, some unpleasantness has recently broken out in the way of scurrilous letters and drawings being sent to the dons and to a few of the third-year students. Just an annoyance, though, nothing to worry about, really. Sayers portrays the members of the Senior Common Room (what Americans would call the college faculty) in numerous dimensions; while they are all individuals, with an array of personalities and styles, they share the academic's high regard for the life of the mind and also a generally humanist view of life. Nor are they all old maids who simply couldn't get a husband, as the party line was at the time. (Younger readers, especially college-educated women, may find this societal setting a very foreign country indeed.) After Harriet returns to London and continues her writing career, however, the nuisance at the college becomes much worse and she's called upon to investigate, quietly and discretely. She ends up spending most of the following academic year as a resident researcher, enjoying her time in the Bodleian, becoming acquainted with Wimsey's slightly ne'er-do-well nephew, developing deep friendships with certain of the dons and administrators and becoming suspicious of others, and struggling all the way to figure out who is trying to destroy the college and its members through a campaign of vitriol and scandal. It's an absorbing story, especially for readers with an appreciation for the academic world. Harriet -- obviously a stand-in for Sayers herself -- also slowly comes to terms with her relationship with Peter Wimsey, who arrives three-quarters of the way through the book (and at Harriet's request) to try to solve the mystery. But this is far more than a mystery novel. It's a great piece of characterization, atmosphere, scene-setting, and (now) nostalgia. And even though it was written seventy-five years ago, anyone with experience on the faculty of a major university will instantly recognize the world and the people Sayers portrays."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"This was the best book to put myself asleep each night - the most boring book ever read. It took pages for one character to finish a thought. I don't mind period books but this was so formal, couldn't tell one character from the next.

I usually love reading British novels but this book was only good to reach for when insomnia struck."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"I saw a PBS version of this book and liked it enough to want to read the book. This is part of a series about Lord Peter Wimsey, the great detective, that includes his love interent, Harriet Vane. Peter has loved Harriet for several years, but he saved her from a murder conviction and he is a strong and well-known personality. He is also brother to a duke and invaluable to the war office. She is grateful to him yet afraid that her needs and personality will be overwhelmed by him.The book is set in Oxford, England right after WWI. Women still have a tenuous admitance to the university there. Harriet graduated from Oxford and has always felt it was a retreat from the world. She attends a gaudy there and starts thinking she might like to return and publish researched books rather than the murder mysteries she writes. She is asked back when someone starts playing dangerous pranks at the women's college.I liked how the book showed the operation and interaction of the women involved in the women's college. It is like looking at a slice of life that is totally foreign to me as an American. It included a feel for the attitudes toward and behavior of women in different parts of the college scene at the time.The best part of the story is toward the end of the book and how at Oxford Harriet is able to see Peter as a man with special talents instead of a steamroller personality. So yes, they finally get together.I enjoy this book enough to go looking for it to read and I stay up reading it even though it is past my bedtime.

As a novel is an excellent read because the plot is original, very rich in words, and situations, has good character development (College Graduate women mostly) and a fair description of the setting, (The University of Oxford in England), but if one is a mysteries fan (like me) it will only find this story amusing when the author just takes itself to write about the stuff that is related to the core of the plot, the mystery (a whodunit quiz). For a mystery novel it gets unnecessary long, and tedious, has many plots, subplots, needless diversions and an ineffective love story in the sidelines, the tale weaves from one subject to another and from a primary situation to a secondary place and then back on to the original idea so it gets confusing and wearisome to follow as this scheme unfolds from beginning to end. Generally speaking if you are a mystery novel fan you can find better options."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"In this Novel Ms. Sayers seems to be going through some midlife crisis.

Sayers. In this novel she puts her detective, Lord Peter Wimsey, into the story, as usual, but gives his girlfriend, Harriet Vane, center stage. Harriet returns to her college reunion and while having a great time with her old chums suddenly starts receiving poisen pen letters. Like her American counterparts though, Sayers is interested in the characters and what they are able to observe of the best and worst in people. However, they don't do it with the hard edged noir American style. The English style is quiet, elegant, country houses and colleges, lords, gentlemen and their ladies and then, intruding into this perfect world, The Crime and what the crime does to the people around it. Sayers remains my favorite of the British writers who either started this tradition or carry it on today."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"Five stars for a genre book is unusual, but deserved in this instance. An alternate title to this review could be Harry Potter for adults. I am struck by the leisurely pace of Dorothy Sayers and the richness and the variety of the storytelling in this work.Shrewsbury College is imaginary. Balliol College, Lord Peter Wimsey's school, does exist. Dorothy Sayers's own college was Somerville. The action of the book takes place in 1935. Harriet Vane is notorious. She has been tried for a murder. She had taken a first in English. A letter arrived entreating her to attend the Shrewsbury Gaudy.Harriet has broken all her old ties. She thought to herself when at the scene that that she had always had great affection for the Dean. The Warden greeted Harriet graciously. Miss Lydgate was the English tutor. She reminded Harriet that she always had had a scholarly mind.Even Oxford did not offer Harriet a respite from Lord Peter Wimsey and the marriage question. Harriet was questioned about his lordship. Not knowing the identification of a wrongdoer, one does tend to suspect everyone. There had been some unexplained events of nasty messages in chalk and newspaper cuttings and petty vandalism.Following the Gaudy, Harriet heard nothing of Shrewsbury until she was summoned to attend the opeing of a new library. The Dean wrote that there had been unpleasantness. The disturbances came to be characterized under the heading of the poison pen. It was learned that one of the students was being bothered with more than thirty anonymous messages. Her death while on the water was averted through quick-thinking by Harriet and others.Harriet had never connected Peter and Oxford in her mind when he showed up at chapel. An acquaintance said that Wimsey very much exemplified the Oxford manner. In a serious discussion Lord Peter admits that he has been running away from himself for twenty years. Lord Peter, being somebody, is able to give one of the female historians access to an out of the way source.Eventually a discussion at dinner leads to a consideration of false results in scholarship. Scientists do not suppress facts. They do not publish falsehoods. Historians follow a similar ethical path. The descriptions of Lord Peter are particularly telling in this scene. He is clearly brilliant, disinterested, capable of superior work. The impression one has had of him as a sort of joke is altered.There were no problems at Shrewsbury until a Miss DeVine arrived. In her former placement she uncovered a scholarly misdeed. The college servants are called scouts. The scouts and the faculty are the groups from which the wrongdoer must emerge since the students have alibis. The mystery is decoded by Harriet and Lord Peter."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"It's rare that one wishes to read mysteries over and over; the purpose is to solve the puzzle before it pops up in the text, right? This book never disappoints. Sayers' use of language, insight into a different place and time, attractiveness of the characters large and small, all make this more than a mystery novel."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"Loaned to me by a friend, this book has given me a lot to chew on. Matters of principal, academic righteousness, gender essentialism, dominance, class relations, all are brought up in this novel, a very ambitious &quot;whodunit.&quot; Some of these issues are tackled in a straightforward manner, and others only peripherally.Lord Peter and Harriet are presented as winning characters, and most of the secondary characters are fleshed out pretty nicely -- a difficult thing to do with a large cast. Still, it was too easy to get the different dons mixed up.Lastly, this is my first Sayers novel, and I don't think the reading experience was particularly marred by a lack of familiarity with the previous books. Rather, I felt disturbed by my inability to catch the literary references. Knowing your classics would serve you much better than knowing your other Sayers."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"I actually listened to the audiobook. I agree with the reviewer that said the book was anti-climactic and that it's not one of those mysteries the reader can solve from gathering information along the way. That said, it was so thoroughly enjoyable! Maybe this was due to the delightful actors in the audiobook but it was such a pleasure for me to spend time with these dear characters."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"Lord Peter is the primary character in this series of detective novels by Dorothy Sayers. In Gaudy Night Harriet Vane is the main character--Lord Peter is in Rome on a diplomatic mission for most of the tale. Harriet is the object of Lord Peter's affections but she has not accepted his frequent offers of matrimony despite the fact that she appears to be developing feelings for him.In this story, Harriet returns to her roots at Oxford for a reunion and ends up staying to solve a mystery. While at Oxford she is able to heal her wounds from her last difficult relationship and its unfortunate aftermath, as well as discover within herself a new love of life and creativity.In this new healthier phase she also discovers that she misses Lord Peter, and on one of his visits, that she has deeply passionate feelings for him. As in the quote above, she discovers in him a potential for passion in her life.Dorothy Sayers' writing is at its peak in this interesting psychological mystery. The beauty of her prose, as well as her knack for describing characters in particular setting is at its finest. Here is one of her beautiful sentences: \\"Great golden phrases, rising from nothing and leading to nothing, swam up out of her mind like the huge, sluggish carp in the cool waters of Mercury.\\" While this novel stands alone as a good read, it would probably work better for the reader if they have read the series of Lord Peter novels that feature Harriet Vane--particularly Strong Poison and Have His Carcase."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"Academia versus family life was a new dilemma for women at Oxford in early twentieth century.

The reading of this audio books fits it to a tee."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"Lord Peter Wimsey is the urbane, civilized, gourmand, bon vivant sleuth created by Dorothy L. Sayers in the 30s. Yet the Gaudy is not totally about him. It is more Harriet Vane's book. Peter comes in later and as they say saves the day.What a stupendous achievement! Twice the length of most detective stories of its day, this book boasts of no murder and keeps the interest in the book unflagging till the end. How did Ms. Sayers manage it? Simply by her wonderful writing skill, her command of the English language (next to none-puts Christie to shame)and her characters. Long before the women's lib movement, this spunky character braved public opinion, police scrutiny and nearly the hangman's noose, without losing her inflappable belief in herself. True, it reflected the author's own life but a character that Gloria Steinem would have revered.Oxford, Shrewsbury College, Sayers' own alma mater, come to life like no one city and institution in the entire history of mystery fiction. Yes, Harriet is the heroine but Oxford is the crown prince. That is what distinguishes this book. It is more realized as a novel not just a detective story. Sadly, though the quality of writing remains the same, the next and last Wimsey novel with Harriet: Busman's Honeymoon, is overwritten and meandering. But that shows that Ms. Sayers was human, too.The narration is typically British which adds to the enjoyment of this wonderful book."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"This book is amazing. It is witty, it is erudite, it is full of feeling, it has a mystery, a fantastic romance, a great heroine, a great hero...Individual lines are brilliant. The mystery is intricate and thrilling. The book stands alone, or as part of the series. No matter how you slice or dice it, Gaudy Night is great.Even with the school poltergeist creating havoc all over campus, I pretty much wished I could have been there myself, from the beginning to the end.Also: the writing is so fresh, this book has not aged at all. It is really a classic."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"\\"Gaudy Night,\\" one of the last Lord Peter Wimsey books Dorothy Sayers wrote, was the first one I read. I can't say was disappointed, especially having gone back to the beginning of the series and read the first three I think it fun to know in advance the kind of mature and together character Lord Peter will become. Sayers chooses to tell this story from the perspective of Harriet Vane, a mystery writer by profession who gets to say what her creator can't say straight out about the writing life and the reading public.Sayers is a writer who knows how to create atmosphere, in this case the inner and outer life of Harriet as she experiences a reunion weekend at Oxford with its inevitable but welcome punting along the Thames, and pondering the value of the life of the mind. Sayers also know how to make her mysteries crisp and entertaining, including here much running around with flashlights in the dark, chasing after vandals in the dark and the author of a series of poison pen letters that shake up the old maids of Shrewsbury College.Vane has been saved from a murder charge by Wimsey in an earlier book, and she has not yet forgiven him for it, especially since he can't stop proposing marriage to her since. Will he finally soften her up? It's fun to watch him try, even as he helps her solve the series of particularly sinister crimes against the campus community. \\"Gaudy Night\\" will not disappoint."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"For a recent trip to England, I decided to stock up on books by English authors and read them during the trip. I saw that Gaudy Night was set in Oxford and since I was staying there for a few nights it seemed particularly appropriate. The glowing reviews for Dorothy Sayers in general and this book in particular made me hopeful I would like it even though I had never tried her work before.Despite being part of the Lord Peter Wimsey series, this book really isn't about him. The story follows Harriet Vane as she attempts to uncover the identity of a person writing mean-spirited letters to faculty and students at the fiction Shrewsbury College at Oxford University. For a while, I expected a murder but the story meanders along with nothing more menacing than a little vandalism for virtually all of its 500 pages. The only real tension in the story comes from the bickering of the female professors with each other as they debate topics that may have been interesting 50 years ago but are wholly irrelevant today (e.g. educated women are traitors to their gender if they get married and stop working). These debates and dissertations tend to be quite lengthy and do nothing to advance the story.My biggest problem with Gaudy Night is that it is really not a mystery story at all. Murder mysteries are a well-established genre but here we have nothing more than a \\"poison pen mystery\\" and after reading it I know why that genre has definitely not established itself as a force in literature. There is no real tension, nothing at stake except the possibility of a scandal for the school and after listening to these people bicker forever and a day I found that I really didn't care if they had to endure a scandal or not. Harriet spends a lot of time chasing shadows at night but does very little real investigating and figures out virtually nothing on her own. Lord Peter comes into the story in a meaningful way only toward the end and delivers the solution on a silver platter in a deus-ex-machina ending that is wholly unsatisfying.It is obvious judging from the rapturous reviews that this book is a big hit with fans of Dorothy Sayers. I can only say that as a first time reader, I would strongly recommend other newcomers to try another of her novels as an entry point. My favorite parts of this book were those where Lord Peter was actually in the scene and her other books would almost certainly feature him far more prominently. I would recommend this book only for true fans of Sayers and Lord Peter."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"If you are a Harriet Vane fan, this is the Sayers' mystery for you. She gets the job early and we learn much more about the mystery writer and friend of Lord Peter."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"I've read this novel twice and seen a stage adaptation twice. The stage adaptation, because of its condensation, is more exciting. The story, which has Harriet Vane attending a \\"gaudy night\\" at her alma mater, introduces a snake into the garden of Eden. Because she alone can't solve the mystery of who is writing poison pen letters to the academics, Harriet calls Peter Wimsey for help. Here, in her environment, Harriet gets to know Peter better. She also comes to an important realization that will determine their future.

Today's readers will probable find the character traits and social situations unrealistic -- no one argues so politely or maintains the same level of social manners in modern settings. If written by a more recent author it would probable be a psychological thriller with a romantic interest between the two main characters. As it is, the story line is lighter, the mystery is engaging and kept me guessing (all the clues are not provided until the end), yes there is a romantic interest between the two characters.

Sayers was a very unusual person--some say eccentric, and I would not disagree with that. Her characters are finely drawn and to me, always consistent. While human, and possessing the usual spate of human foibles, Harriet Vane and Peter Wimsey are quite bright and yet not unlikable. I get the feeling that she liked these characters. It is hard to guess where the plots will end up, and with a mystery, that's a good thing. It's really not fun when you can figure this out ten pages into a mystery book. Her mysteries are not 'dumbed down' for anyone, and this one is especially emblematic of that nature.

Written in an academic style, this book was both light, entertaining and full of poetical references. Set in Oxford, during the 1930s, when women were only just beginning to gain some recognition in their chosen careers, it is an interesting look back to that time, and contains a wonderful set of characters, not forgetting a clever little plot and mystery which finally presents itself.

I'd already read one or two Lord Peter Wimsey novels and enjoyed them very much, but I wasn't prepared for the depth of this one. It's told in the point of view of his love interest, Harriet Vane. What was the best was the whole feminist perspective in 1930's England at an all-female college of Oxford. I could relate to much of it, having attended Smith College in Mass. In so many ways, the position of these intellectual, mostly unmarried women, seemed extreme (either/or between love, marriage & motherhood--or career and intellectual fulfillment), except for the fact that in Sayers' time period, it mostly was an either/or proposition. Women have come a long way since then after many battles for equality, yet it's still a challenge to have it all. Very moving, insightful story. I was thrilled to guess the 'villian' before Harriet Vane herself did--and I usually am very bad at this. Lord Peter was a darling, as usual, and Sayers' kept me guessing until the very last paragraph about whether he'd find happiness or not with Harriet Vane.

It's soul refreshing.This is one of the standout books in my opinion... after being introduced in Strong Poison, mystery writer Harriet Vane (not-so-loosely based on Sayers herself) shows up in Have His Carcase. Wimsey proposes marriage regularly to Harriet, but she resists for all her appearances and their relationship changes forever in this, her third appearance.Scholars and writers have decried Sayers' fawning over her own creation, Wimsey, but I admit that the romantic in me still finds the books charming and very enjoyable.They're well crafted and very accessible but civilized and enjoyable at the same time. I don't really mind that the world she describes is gone forever and never really existed at all.

In Harriet Vane, Sayers produced perhaps the most nauseating wish fulfilment figure in the whole of crime fiction. She makes Jemima Shore look like something out of Dostoyevsky.

For the modern reader, however, she presents difficulties. Books from this era always seem dated. Sayers, by reason of her erudite language and profound immersion in the intellectual culture of the day, dates more severely than the others of the era.If you are already a fan of Agatha Christie or John Dickson Carr, then you should definitely read Dorothy Sayers. But if you have so far only read modern mystery writers, Sayers is NOT the first port of call for your Golden Age experience. You may find Gaudy Night daunting with its slow pace, the quaint (sometimes near impenetrable) language of the cloistered Oxford dons of the 1930s, and the lengthy exploration of characters internal worlds as they introspectively ponder their own motivations. Viewed through modernist eyes, Gaudy Night has far too many characters, far too many words, and far too little action.On its own terms however, this book is the pinnacle of British Golden Age writing. Most agree it is Sayers' best. It is a literary novel which gives a penetrating insight into women of the era struggling with the conflict between the constraints of traditional feminine roles and the intellectual freedom (and rigor) of academia. And it presents a mystery of satisfying complexity and convincing resolution.Gaudy Night is the best of its era - when you are ready for it."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"Dorothy L. Sayers, a contemporary of Agatha Christie's, was an something of an enigma, and not unlike Harriet Vane, the heroine of this novel. A graduate of Sommerville, devout Christian theologian, and unwed mother, her few contributions to British Golden Age detective fiction are rightly deemed classics for the depth of her characterizations and for the scholarly intelligence so evident in her writing.In this novel, Sayers takes an unusually personal perspective, concentrating principally on the internal struggles of Harriet Vane, a detective fiction writer who was tried and acquitted of the murder of her live-in lover in the earlier novel Strong Poison. Sayers's detective Lord Peter Wimsey was responsible for Harriet's acquittal, and has doggedly pursued her in the intervening years. Harriet has refused his proposals of marriage but has never ended the relationship. Here, she at lasts slays her internal demons by returning to her \\"inalienable place,\\" Oxford. She returns for a reunion, finds acceptance and peace....and then evidence of a particularly vicious madness directed against educated women. As Harriet struggles to identify the mad poltergeist vandal haunting her old college before anyone is harmed, she also comes to grips with her desire to escape from the world, and the realization that each person must do her \\"proper job\\" in life, whatever that job is. Lord Peter appears rather late in the story, to assist Harriet with the investigation. Here, too, Sayers displays a new depth of character development, showing her detective as a complete and vulnerable human being. Yes, Harriet and Peter do come together at the end in a most satisfactory way.Do read the Harriet Vane novels in order to gain maximum satisfaction: first, Strong Poison; then Have His Carcase; followed by Gaudy Night; and finishing with Busman's Honeymoon."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"Dorothy L. Sayers' book _Gaudy_Night_ is one of the best mystery books ever written, if you enjoy beautiful, educated writing and brilliant, sympathetic characters, not to mention a great plot. Harriet Vane, one of the first female Oxford graduates, like the author, struggles with poison-pen letters, personal focus, and the attentions of Lord Peter Wimsey as she returns to Oxford after attending the annual Gaudy (a reunion of old students). Without a corpse in sight, the book may not appeal to many readers of grity detective novels, but this mystery is solved with wit, wisdom, and Vergil. For what more could one ask?_Gaudy_Night_ is eriudite as well as entertaining, standing up well to the passing of over six decades. The themes of academia versus business, career versus marriage, and town versus university are still alive today. The writing of Dorothy L.

It is indeed fatally flawed in many ways. Harriet is supposed to be exercising independence but the mystery plot makes her totally dependent on Peter. Peter deduces pretty early who the culprit is, but tells no one for the flimsiest of reasons and puts several people into predictable and predicted danger [well, this isn't the only mystery with that flaw.] The style is overblown and the cultural assumptions do grate or nauseate. Sayers proclaims the mutual supportiveness of a faculty that evidently is harpying itself to shreds.And yet. Sayers takes Peter Wimsey, who in her first few books was more laughable and less realistic than Sherlock Holmes, and sculpts him over time [in earlier novels, too] into an almost [well, with a big stretch] human multidimensional character. The sculpting gets remarkably fully completed in Busman's Honeymoon. Harriet was somewhat more rounded from the start, but she reflects more and more in later novels, building a relationship with Peter despite her harrowing [if not completely credible] doubts. Yes, there's no murder, but the dread that comes to afflict Harriet's college is just as threatening as a homicidal maniac, and is undermining the community of scholars in ways that a maniac probably would not.I am a professor, and am maybe too inclined to believe Sayers' epigram that 'the University is a Paradise.' Sayers comes unusually close to depicting intellectual/university life from the inside, showing its beauty and strength despite the flawed humans who pursue it, showing how a threat to intellectual culture can be as appalling as a threat to life and limb. And how intellectual values can be life-sustaining and overwhelmingly attractive.The mystery has definite twists and is baffling as it goes on--at least to me. It provoked me to reflection in ways that almost no other mysteries, no matter how well wrought, do. At least for its time and from its author, it's a marvel."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"This 1936 novel is the 12th Lord Peter novel.

During the case Peter fell head over heels in love with Harriet who was too upset to even consider romance. Their romance proceeded in this very one-sided manner for five years.GAUDY NIGHT focuses on Harriet and her detection efforts. She has been invited by an ill college friend to attend the &quot;Gaudy&quot;, and end of term celebration at their alma mater, the fictional Shrewesbury College at Oxford. Harriet reluctantly agrees and finds herself embroiled in a poison pen campaign that has been plaguing the college. She takes up residence in the college to try to get to the bottom of the problem.During her time there she makes the acquaintance of Lord Peter's nephew, Viscount St. George, and through him, begins to see her persistant suitor in a new light. When Peter himself appears Harriet finds facets of him that she had not seen before. Working together they solve to problem of the poison pen and resolve the long standing romantic issues as well.Those looking for a 'straight' detective novel like some of the earlier Lord Peter stories will probably be frustrated by this one although the mystery is challenging, in and of itself would it would justify a long short story at best. Those looking for a romance story to resolve this long courtship will be even more frustrated by the very scant amount of interaction between the 'lovers'.So just what makes this worth 5 stars? Harriet Vane finally emerges as a character every bit as complex and interesting as Peter. Do read this one and the next book, BUSMAN'S HONEYMOON."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"Sayers famously once said (to paraphrase) that love had no business cluttering up a good mystery. Yet the love story in this novel, the climax of the Harriet Vane-Lord Peter Wimsey affair*, forms the meat of this intelligent, witty, and still fresh mystery. Set in 1930's Oxford, Harriet must help her former college solve a mystery while solving the mystery of her heart's desire. I can't recommend this novel too highly. * You may wish to read Strong Poison and Have His Carcase first."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"The very best of the Wimsey books! When a nasty, anonymous note is slipped into the sleeve of Harriet Vane's gown when she attends the Shrewsbury College Gaudy, she thinks it is a reference to her personal history. But it soon turns out that the animus is directed at the College, and Vane is asked to investigate. In the course of so doing, she begins to wonder if she should return to the scholarly life.Sayers' great strength as a mystery writer, particularly apparent in the Wimsey-Vane books, was her ability to write about relationships. The working out of Harriet and Peter's relationship is crucial to this book. It is not that the mystery is secondary; indeed, it is in the unraveling of that mystery that Harriet is able to confront her concerns about Peter and is also learns more about him than in all the time she knew him.But the crux of this book is the importance of intellectual honesty in the face of personal considerations, of the need to do work that matters to you. It is about women's struggle for a recognized place in the public realm, as well as the private.There are wonderful by-ways here as well. Harriet's life as a writer, both of mysteries and scholarly works, is described in fine detail, with the addition of a humorous description of the 30's London literary scene. Oxford itself, both town and gown, is a character in the book. How lovingly it is drawn!"},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"This is one of the Harriet Vane mysteries, a very strong story with lots of local Oxford colour. The problem I had with this edition Is that it uses American spelling, apparently randomly mixed with some of the original British spelling. Personally I found this very distracting, especially as the English setting is so important to the flavour of the novel. Great story, but I'm sticking to my paperback copy until a proper British ebook is available."},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"I've been desperate for years to get all of Dorothy L. Sayer's mysteries on my iPhone (only her first two are pre-copyright dates and thus available in the public domain), so that I can keep rereading them without having to track down my yellowed and tattered paperbacks. Now, to my delight, I see that the next-to-last, and arguably the best, is already here on Kindle!! Just saw it a minute ago and have already downloaded it with glee.Sayers is, if you will, an earlier-generation version of Amanda Cross (in case you've read any of Cross' Kate Fansler books). Also an academic (though at Oxford, not Columbia), Sayers brings much the same sort of literary sensibility and what for the time was a strong feminism to her delectable stories of Peter Wimsey, duke's son and member of the literati, who fulfills his noblesse oblige by helping the police solve various grisly murders. Four books in the series also feature Harriet Vane, a mystery writer and fellow Oxford grad propelled into actual detection Wimsey-style when she's wrongly accused of murder (in Strong Poison, where she first makes her appearance). The tension between these two educated but troubled characters makes these books far more than mere mysteries. Similar to Amanda Cross's books, they're almost Jane Austen-like novels of manners, in this case of Britain between the two World Wars, with a mystery interwoven through the fabric. Sayers wrote of smart women's interactions with smart men from her own knowledge (she was one of the first women ever to gain a degree from Oxford and invested much of her academic scholarship in researching medieval Italian manuscripts held by the Roman Catholic Church). These are convincing and entrancing reads.Gaudy Night, the third in the series with both Wimsey and Vane, is often cited even by non-mystery-afficionadoes as a refined and elegant novel, focused more on the love story and period piece than the criminal plot (though the plot's good, too). There are many delectable minor characters, including some college guys with more charisma than is good for them, several harried female professors trying to figure out how a woman succeeds in a man's world, and an English butler right out of the pages of P. G. Wodehouse. The mystery revolves around college pranks gone haywire but isn't solved without a few side forays involving Wimsey's second volunteer job with the Foreign Office in the gathering storm before World War II. Played out across nobility, middle class and the laboring poor, the novel draws us into the lives of complex characters with strengths and weaknesses at all social levels.It's a remarkable book, and I'm thrilled to have it electronically at last. Excuse me while I go read it again for the umpteenth time!"},{"Title":"GAUDY NIGHT (A LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERY)","review":"I listened to this on audio a full-cast dramatisation by BBC audio.Fast pace story and many twists and turns.The story centers around Harriet Vane, the infamous detective writer who was accused of killing her lover. Lord Peter cleared her name but for the next five years he has been pursuing Harriet for her hand in marriage.Harriet hesitates between returning to academic life and marrying Lord Peter. Academic life for her seems to be winning.Harriet is invited to her Oxford reunion, and returns uncertain of what to expect. But once she is reunited with her old college a disturbing mystery begins to unfold within the college. Harriet moves in, under the pretense of doing research, to investigate the person responsible for poison-pen letters and embarassing pranks.The destruction to part of the new library with library books strew everywhere and red painted wording appears on the walls only 1 hour before its offical opening.

The main character of the novel is partly the writer of detective novels Harriet Vane, and through her realtionship with Lord Peter Wimsey we get a new and both human and realistic picture of the man behind the arrogant face and the posh manners. This book is more than just another whodunit, it is a psycological view into a writer with a past, a sensitive aristocrat and the end of a romance.

The book was amusing; however, it has an ulterior motive, i.e., to cast a doubt on the deity of Jesus Christ. How in the world was the author so lucky to find 3 people (from her two books) in her vicinity around Arkansas, that lived with, knew, or was a niece of Jesus. How come she had not found someone that knew, walked, or was a niece of Mohammed (Muslim), Buddha, or the like? The only reason is because satan is working through her to cast a doubt on the truth! Do this to the Muslims and see what the repercussion would be. A piece of advise to the readers - It's better to be wrong about whom Jesus was than to be sorry. If we Christians are indeed wrong about Jesus, at least we still have (according to author's belief) a \\"series of lives\\" to correct our belief. If however, our present belief as Christians is right and we let this kind of fictitious work confuse us, we may be sorry at the end and have no further chance to correct our error. In short, I would rather be wrong in this lifetime than to be sorry forever!"},{"Title":"They Walked With Jesus: Past Life Experience With Christ","review":"Another great effort from Dolores Cannon. This book details two hypnotically regressed past lives that were touched and inspired by Jesus, the man.The first subject had a much shorter, but still inspired contact with Jesus that left a &quot;glow&quot; in its aftermath. The other subject shared a more in-depth involvement, which included objective yet heart warming observations of the man with a heart of Go(l)d who cared for the uncared. The regresee, in her own inspirational manner, learned and took up the meaning of Jesus' teaching to love and be compassionate to the less fortunate. This book gives little known glimpses of Jesus' mission and destiny in that incarnation, not so much as the &quot;Son of God&quot;, but as man relating to his fellow-man.This book does not market religion or any brand of religion.

Delores Cannon's work connects with me more than the Bible ever did. Read for yourself the life of Jesus from two eye-witnesses who could see the light around Jesus and the darkness around the 'religious' leaders of the day. Jesus taught that you didn't need a special place or offerings to find God that he was right inside all of us. In fact we are all cells in the body of God. Talk about making the priests angry. What Jesus was teaching would put these guys out of a job and they'd have to let go of the good life they were living.Cannon again introduces us to a whole new way of seeing the past, especially such important events as when Jesus walked the Earth. Seen through the eyes of her two subjects, Cannon brings Jesus to life. This makes the crucifixion seem even more horrible than we see it through the words of the Bible. Experience for yourself the wonderful story of the Messiah through the eyes of two women who loved him.\\"He never spoke his name. I never asked. But he was of the light. He was a son of God. He had higher understanding than any of us have reached on earth at this time. It's as if he was the embodiment of all the mysteries that I have been taught.

It depicts the story of Jesus as a human being who expanded consciousness, but feeling himself one of us. The two girls under hypnosis who walked with him report Jesus was a loving being, with an extraordinary radiance who healed or not the sick according to their own path of Spiritual enlightenment. In this, he valued and respected free will. Even when being nailed on the cross, he was not feeling pain at all, just peace. Interesting to say that Naomi (his niece) stated that there were others like him, but the difference was that he decided to go public and reach all humanity, or better said, all the ones who were in hunger of Spirit. He really wanted humanity to care one another and for each individual to express his talents to the fullest; living in a loving communion with God within. However, he realised humanity was not ready and decided to leave his human body through the Cross. Needless to say that in the meantime political and organized religion saw a threat in him and his message of God Within (and not in the Temple of Jerusalem with the Rabbis) and set up a way to \\"kill\\" him.

I was disappointed that Jesus' true name (Yeshua ben Joseph) was never used, which is further proof to me that this information, no matter the level of truth, is still being filtered by the knowledge/biases of Dolores and her 20th century hypnosis subjects.And... about the Jesus story. It is interesting that all of Dolores' sources, even the supposedly \\"high\\" ones, basically confirm all the religious Sunday school stories we have been told about Jesus' life up to his crucifixion and rising from the dead. But is this story what actually happened? If you want to shake your tree, try Michael Morgan's \\"Pontius Pilate's Gospel of Jesus\\" and round that up with \\"The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ\\" by Levi. These books contain more truth about the Jesus story than any I have read. It is in these books that I discovered more of who Jesus (Yeshua) was and what the term \\"Christ\\" really means.All in all, a good effort for Dolores Cannon, but seriously lacking in many aspects. I would caution any reader to maintain an open-minded, yet questioning and inquiring mind when reading this material, and avoid taking anything at face value. (I would say that for any book, not just this one.)"},{"Title":"They Walked With Jesus: Past Life Experience With Christ","review":"\\"They walked with Jesus\\" is the incredibly boring and slow-paced sequel to \\"Jesus and the Essenes\\", a book I haven't read. Dolores Cannon is a New Age regression hypnotist who claims to have the ability to make people remember their past lives. In this book, she interviews two women who claim to have walked with Jesus in their previous lives.The stories aren't even remotely convincing. They sound like typical New Age fantasies: Jesus is a pantheist, he talks about \\"heart chakras\\", studies with the Essenes, and doesn't suffer on the cross. Nor is there a bodily resurrection, since the soul of Jesus gets separated from the body. The body was probably stolen from the empty tomb, etc. (Why can't a New Age sage be resurrected? Do these people have some kind of hang up over physical resurrections?) At one point, Dolores quotes the notorious forgery \\"The Archko Volume\\" to back up a point made by one of her regressed subjects. The village of the lepers mentioned by the second subject could be inspired by \\"Ben Hur\\". A kind of ultra-mushy form of Sunday School Christianity is also visible in all the stories about Jesus being kind to children, constantly glowing with a white light, etc. He's nice to turtle doves, too.I think it's obvious that the two regressed subjects, Mary and Anna (note their Biblical names!) are really enacting some kind of private psycho-dramas. Mary is a single, thrice-divorced woman in her late thirties. Is it really a co-incidence that her meeting with Jesus sounds subliminally sexual?Anna is a Jew who has been interested in Jesus since childhood, something her parents and peers apparently took strong exception to. In her \\"past life memory\\", she is a young girl who meets with parental disapproval when she attempts to join Jesus as a disciple. Cannon claims that Anna's recollections are very reliable, since Anna never read the New Testament, nor had any other kind of knowledge about Jesus. This is silly. Are we to believe that an American adult living in a big city *never* had any exposure to the Christian message, never saw any Christian symbols, etc? At one point, Cannon is surprised by the fact that a Jew has heard of the Sea of Galilee. This surely tells us something about Cannon's prejudiced opinions about non-Christians...Try again next week, Dolores!In reality, Anna is spinning her story from memories of \\"Ben Hur\\", the New Testament and Catholic iconography. At several times, she claims that Jesus had a literal halo, or that light emanated from his heart. That's not Biblical, but I'm sure it's on display everywhere in LA, Anna's place of residence before moving elsewhere. But OK, I admit that Anna's knowledge of the Christian scriptures needs some honing. At one point, she refers to Jesus' disciples as Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel! But then, how many Sunday Christians can name more than two or three of Jesus' disciples?In addition to the above, there's apparently a whole story surrounding the portrait of Jesus on the front cover of this book. It's based on a vision by Nanette Crist Johnson. Visions in Medjugorje, South America and Colorado is said to have confirmed that Jesus really did look like this. \\"The Archko Volume\\" and (I presume) Anna's recollections also confirm them.And then, maybe not.I think \\"They walked with Jesus\\" tell us more about a certain New Age/cultic subculture, than it does about the purported subject of the conversations.One star.But yes, he looks beautiful..."},{"Title":"They Walked With Jesus: Past Life Experience With Christ","review":"In this book Cannon describes her regressions of two subjects to past lives where they knew Jesus.First, Mary is regressed to a life as Abigail, who serves at the Temple in Jerusalem, playing with and teaching children. Here she meets Jesus (though not aware of his identity), and provides us with a moving description of him. He has white light all around him and has an overwhelming depth of understanding in his eyes. They had \\"no end to them. They just went straight on - straight on inside\\". Jesus, who is talking to people in another part of the Temple, senses Abigail's presence and comes over to her and the children.Abigail has a pain in her head caused by her not being able to share her knowledge (that of the Essenes) andJesus spontaneously heals this pain. Abigail and the children had a special experience when Jesus approached them. She felt that they were \\"very expanded in the light\\" and \\"just glowed\\". She felt that they were \\"out of time\\". Though unaware of Jesus' identity, she knew he was \\"of the light\\" and a \\"Son of God\\".In the second and final regression Anna returns to a life as Naomi, who is the niece of Jesus, or the Nazarene as he is called. Her father, Joseph,is half-brother of Jesus. Naomi cuts her hair, disguises herself in boys' clothes and is finally allowed by the Nazarene to \\"walk with him\\" and his other followers, spreading the teachings of the Essenes and helping those in need.The Nazerene is tall with hair \\"the colour of wine\\" and blue eyes. He is \\"deliberate and grave\\", has not been seen to laugh but on the contrary to \\"weep\\". (This description is cited from an article by Jack Anderson, which appeared in Parade Magazine.) Naomi sees a golden light around his heart, his head and his hands. She too describes Jesus' eyes as going \\"beyond this world\\". This golden glow \\"fills up any emptiness inside you and -- makes everything feel warm and loved.\\" He differs because of his sensitivity, understanding and lack of fear.Naomi accompanied the Nazarene to a leper village, where she helped attend to the lepers and relieve their pain. She explains that, though he relieves the pain of many of them, he cannot heal everyone, not if the illness was a part of the afflicted person's karma and destiny. And if someone didn't believe he could be healed, it would not happen.As regards the teachings of Jesus, Naomi explains that when you learn that there is God in you connected to an all-encompassing God, you know that you can heal yourself and others. What is important is to live through the heart, to be of service and care for each other. We are all here to be of service to one another, and should treat each other as we would want to be treated. You must become aware that you ARE this \\"loving God-essence\\". It is an \\"all-encompassing feeling of warmth and love and knowing that it is alright to be you\\". You are perfect as you are.Naomi talks of John the Baprist, who was actually called \\"John of the Water\\". The ritual he performed was to cleanse the spirit - a symbolic cleansing and a ritual of dedication to God.It was important to Jesus that his gatherings were like a brotherhood or fellowship, where everyone was on an equal level. No-one was higher than another. He tried to teach that we are all brothers and sisters. He knew that it was his time to ascend, and that he was needed on other levels to continue his work. He left Naomi with the message that she should walk in love, follow the path of the Light and struggle against fear. \\"The only truth is love and light\\". If you cast aside all fear, you will keep yourself healthy in mind, body and soul. It is fear that creates all diseases and ailments.The Romans had tried to kill the Nazarene by putting him into a crate and rolling it into a ravine, but he survived.Jesus chose the time and manner of his death. On the cross he was calm and in no pain. Naomi did not herself see this, but was told of it. After the crucifixion, where Jesus died after a short time, he appeared to Naomi on the road. He had a new gown on and talked to her with his mind. He told her he loved her and would always be with her, and that she should continue to help those that cannot help themselves.This book presents an extremely moving and inspiring tale of Jesus, shows how he really was, and gives us the true essence of his teachings. The descriptions are such that we almost feel we are there ourselves, see Jesus, feel his love and see his light. We are taught his simple teachings of love and helpfulness.I thoroughly recommend that you read this book."},{"Title":"They Walked With Jesus: Past Life Experience With Christ","review":"This is a must read for those interested in humanity. It opens our eyes to see Jesus in a different , more human light."},{"Title":"They Walked With Jesus: Past Life Experience With Christ","review":"This book was truly amazing!! I got it about 2 weeks ago and can't put it down. It brings new light to Jesus the one true king and the one who helped humanity in ways we can't image. The book teaches that you too can be great like Jesus with the desire and intent. Just like Jesus achieved a greatness that can't be measured by today's success. This book is priceless for anyone who wants to be something more then what the world has to offer. Anyone who wants to become that which legends are made of, should get this book. The book teaches things that have been lost for years which is now found by powerful gifts that Dolores Cannon has."},{"Title":"They Walked With Jesus: Past Life Experience With Christ","review":"I gave away about dozen of copies of this fascinating book. I had one time experience with regression and this made me highly prejudiced. The book was siting on my table for many month. One day I open it and discovered who Jesus really was as a person. His intent was to abolish religion as an institution that deceives people. One can only serve God when he serves his brother. The service to others is described by an eye witness of Jesus pilgrimages. I had never hear this information before. The two women, who met him, say exactly what they saw. They had one on one encounter. The best book I read in years. PK Nesbit"},{"Title":"They Walked With Jesus: Past Life Experience With Christ","review":"This book by Dolores Cannon contains material that you certainly will not find in any of the gospels! This book touched me deeply because it gave me a \\"sense\\" of the real Jesus, a human being, not the son of God. Many of the scenes are extremely vivid covering the temple at Jerusalem, the leper colonies, high drama around the crucifixion etc. For those of you who believe in past lives (and I for one certainly do), I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"They Walked With Jesus: Past Life Experience With Christ","review":"I found this book fascinating. I started with Dolores Cannon's later books, which cover a lot of material that is difficult for me to relate to--very esoteric, beyond my day-to-day experience--although very interesting. I am actually finding her books about past Earth lives more compelling, because there is something to which I can directly relate. I read \\"Jesus and the Essenes\\" and \\"They Walked with Jesus\\" over a couple of days--not necessarily just in that order, or without jumping from one to the other, as I tend to do. So much of this resonated with me. I had long rejected the stories of Jesus that were taught to me in my childhood. I couldn't accept that he was a \\"God\\" different from the rest of humanity. That didn't make any sense. What was the point of the crucifiction in that case? Why not just wave the magic wand and make everything better? My best--and only--understanding of the crucifiction had come from a Buddhist perspective: that Jesus was a Master who died a horrible death to demonstrate once and for all that nothing we could do could kill the light (the eternal God-spark) within. But Jesus' detractors, those who would destroy this message to maintain control of the rest of humanity, had a quick and easy fix. They would make Jesus a \\"God\\", like the Roman gods, virgin birth and everything. That way nobody else could follow his example, because they weren't as powerful as he was--after all, he was the ONLY son of God. Done and over with. It amazed me how through the centuries people bought this story, willing to give up their own spark-of-God identity, because Jesus was the ONLY son of God. They even attacked people who believed otherwise, just as the Romans and Jewish leaders were willing to attack Jesus who dared to suggest that everyone had the power within. These \\"Christians\\" could just go on in their selfish ways, and as long as they claimed to be followers of Jesus, he would save them in the end and lift them up into Heaven, destroying everybody else with his mighty sword. Now, finally, a first-hand view of the life of Jesus that makes sense, that holds together. Thank you, Dolores, for your willingness to carve your own professional path and bring us these fascinating life histories. What a boon to mankind."},{"Title":"They Walked With Jesus: Past Life Experience With Christ","review":"Discerning readers will see that religion, as we know it in conventional society, has lost its way to a large degree. This book takes you back to the fundamentals of religion and what's really important as opposed to the apparent futility of modern-day religious rituals and ceremonies, and, in fact, beliefs. It returns us to the philiosophy of spirituality. This is an excellent read for all those really interested in why we are here and what lies ahead. Besides this it tells us what Jesus was really all about. I would submit that if he were here now, he would give a good review as well!"},{"Title":"They Walked With Jesus: Past Life Experience With Christ","review":"I first read Jesus of Essenes and now this one. This is fascinating information.

She is able to reach far back in history to interview people who lived it as though they were living then at the moment, and describing their life at that time. These books are taken from the tapes of each session, so we get their actual words as history was in the making.In this book, you can actually feel what it was like to know Jesus while he walked the earth and sense the goodness and healing he exuded wherever he went. We learn that there were many people in power in that day that feared him. It reminded me a lot of the situation we are in today where the power hungry disrespect the lovers of freedom and peace. This brings out Jesus' true message, that the most important thing we can do is to love and respect our neighbor; not kill those with whom we disagree."},{"Title":"Stanley's Africa,","review":"Stanley's Africa is about Africa as it has been formed by events following Stanley's explorations there. Lively, quick-moving, this book unfolds about what Stanley encountered, as the last of the great explorers in that mysterious continent, and the relation of these discoveries to current events (1944), without overburdening the reader with geo-graphical facts or historical data. Far-sighted, modern beyond his time, Henry Morton Stanley, newspaperman, realized the tremendously important part Africa might play in world history, urged a spiritual conquest of its natives. \\"We need the cooperation of these fine people\\" he declared - but it took fifty years for this simple idea to take shape in the minds of others. Rafaello Busoni, author of Stanley's Africa, was for a long time fascinated by the story of the reporter-explorer, considered him a remarkable man. yet when he said as much to experts on Africa, they dampened his enthusiasm, calling Stanley unreliable, far too popular and altogether scientific. \\"I could not share their disdan\\" Mr. Busoni says. \\"Our time has taught us to believe in the amateur, to emancipate ourselves from prejudice. Many of our important achievements are the deeds of amateurs who approached their tasks in an unorthodox manner.\\""},{"Title":"Stanley's Africa,","review":"Beautifully illustrated throughout[by the author]this book gives a solid interpretation of Stanleys journeys in Africa.His initial meeting with Livingstone ,as well as months spent trekking thru uncharted jungles,rivers,etc.The book then goes on to plainly show how white man came colonize Africa.I feel far more informed now about Africa and its culture 'before and after'. We are all in this 'future oriented' flow of progress and Africa is and was no exception."},{"Title":"UC_Runner","review":"Runner (2005) is the first SF novel in this series. It takes place at least a million years in the future, at a time when technology is slowly failing. The Techno Society has been trying to reestablish the star gate system to replace the failing AI starships, but are finding little support for their efforts.In this novel, Jak Rebo is an interstellar runner, riding the starships between planets to deliver messages and other items.

She can see and hear spirits of the dead and can channel them to communicate with the living. However, channeling means being possessed by the spirit.Jevan Kane is an operative of the Techno Society. He was a favorite of Milos Lysander, a deceased scientist and former head of the Techno Society. Now the society is being run by Omar Tepho, a normal human who had been born with a spinal deformity and other defects.

He asks the monks provide a double for the boy to cover his departure. He also asks the monks to deliver him to the local runner headquarters in an unobtrusive way.Norr needs money to hide herself for a while.

Of course, the party finally reaches CaCanth, but not without close calls. Enjoy!Highly recommended for Dietz fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of adventurous quests, religious wisdom, and on/off romance.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"UC_Runner","review":"In the distant future humans have traveled throughout the star systems using interstellar portals, but over time the technology became lost. Antiquated ships deliver cargo and passengers between planets, but are slow and no major inter-galaxy travel exists anymore. Runner Jak Rebo delivers a package that he carried for two years to a customer's wealthy brother on planet Anafa, colonized over 10,000 years ago. Not long afterward, Brother Sua Qwa hires him to deliver a special golden child Tra Lee to the holy city of CaCanth on planet Thara where the lad will be proclaimed as the Norm Maa. Qwa warns the runner that a rival black hat sect has their own candidate and will try to assassinate the boy.Sensitive Lanni Norr reads individual energy fields that enable her to speak with the dead. During a performance, deceased scientist Milos Lysander using a metal man as his source tries to take over Lanni's body. She manages to escape, but has to flee. Lanni and Jak meet when separate people try to harm them; they unite while people chase after them and his cargo Tra Lee.Runner is an exciting thriller that sort of places Tibetan Buddhism in outer space at a time when civilization is imploding. The background comes alive as readers will believe they are at a time when earth is so distant a memory that the planet is considered by most as the mythos home world. Jak and Lanni are an interesting duo as they escort Tra Lee while another sect provides not only another heir contender, but attempts to kill the trio because they feel so strongly that they have the next Norma Maa. William Dietz is at his best with this strong science fiction tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"UC_Runner","review":"This is the first Dietz book i have read. I enjoyed the book very much. in reading some of the other reviews i can see the author writes another style of book that is a lot more \\"bang,bang,bang\\" style. I do not like that style.This story featured a very unique setting and i have learned that in Sci fi \\"Setting\\" is everything. often the world the story is set in is the most interesting element of the story. For example the world and music of \\"blade runner\\" is far more interesting than the story line.In the world of \\"Runner\\", technology has decayed to the point that man cannot even repair the ageing technology it uses ,much less invent new tech. as a result only a few planets have electricity and transportation is on foot or animal. High rise buildings are vacant except the first five floors because that is how high it is acceptable to climb stairs.A Runner ,Jak Rebo is employed to deliver a young monk to a nearby planet to see if he is the reincarnated leader of \\"The Way\\". That is the whole premise and the rest of the book takes them on an adventure in this world of specially bred humans. of course there are bad guys trying to stop them.Jak encounters sentient AI space ships,\\"heavys\\"(hoggles), \\"sensitives\\"(noor),star gate seeds,bad guys(Kane), ghosts(lysander)and a rude AI master computer named Logos. Funny thing is that logos is in the form of a ratty old overcoat.Now that combination of characters and events make for an entertaining read. If you are prepared to entertianed by a brave new world and interesting characters, you will enjoy \\"Runner\\"."},{"Title":"UC_Runner","review":"I was ultimately dissappointed with Runner, many of the reasons of which have been mentioned in previous reviews. One of the review quotes on the book claim that Rebo is one of Dietz's most fully realized characters. This is misleading, as mentioned in a previous review, the characters in this book are rather cliche. They are all reminiscent of characters we've seen in a dozen previous science fiction movies and novels and thus fail to set themselves apart. I could substitute Rebo with Hans Solo and essentially have exactly the same novel. The same can be said for all the other characters.The cliches arent just reserved for the characters, but the settings as well. One of the first planets we are introduced to in the novel is a desert planet full of arabesque characters run by villainous royalty. Apparently deserts can only be occupied by arabian people, and if so, they must be corrupt. I suggest that future writers read (Reel Bad Arabs: How Hollywood Vilifies a People) so that they can start avoiding this cliche.Lastly, if you are a fan of hard science fiction as I am, you shouldn't expect anything from this book. There is nothing particularly thought provoking and nothing to satiate our political, scientific, or cultural brain cells in its pages."},{"Title":"UC_Runner","review":"A very entertaining read. This is the first book I've read by the author, but just finished it and ordered the sequel. It's a sci fi book that feels more like a fantasy quest novel.
