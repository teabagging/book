He knows his stuff and he covers a lot of ground, including the Internet. I feel like I've learned a lot of information from him and I don't regret reading this book.Too often, however, he veers off into \\"this is why me and my group and wonderful and have to face a whole bunch of idiots.\\" Like in the section on sadism where he never gets around to giving the example he promised, but rather discusses problems he had with a jurist from another jurisdiction.Overall, the tone is quite juvenile, and I had to keep reminding myself this was a man in his fifties, not early twenties. He comes off as a bit of a puppy. The name calling gets tiresome after a while. I'd also rather he not talk down to the reader. I didn't need him to clarify that no, dead bodies don't sit up and give statements to the police, thanks.Those last two points are what keeps the book from getting 5 stars. It's a good book; it could have been a great book."},{"Title":"How to Stop a Stalker","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend. I have been the victim of a stalker. She was a woman from my husband's past who's anger turned into obsession. I went through everything from being followed by car, her calling my workplace, constant drive-by's past my house, her sending friends to my workplace to harass me, she's even approached my children trying to befriend them! Above the real-life stakling, she cyber-stalked me on myspace without my realizing it until a few months ago. Last year, she became so brave as to start coming to my house on a regular basis to harass me...that is until I got the police involved. Bringing criminal charges against her slowed her down, but didn't stop her all the way. Come to find out that this gal had been charged with stalking and harassment by an ex-boyfriend a few years back, so I was not her first victim. Scary stuff!!!This book helped me to understand the sickness and obsession that is behind the mind of a stalker. It gave me ideas on ways to protect myself and my family.I think that we all need be aware of our surroundings, what we do, what we put on the internet and make sure to have the knowledge to protect ourselves from these sort of people.Do yourself a favor; buy the book, read it, and share it with someone you love!"},{"Title":"How to Stop a Stalker","review":"This book is a must read for anyone working with victims of stalking or domestic violence.

Mike gives the reader some cold hard facts about stalking,profiles stalkers and offers genuine advice on working with the difficulties in reporting stalking activities as well as gathering hard evidence. His experience with California police departments,specifically working stalking cases, gives the reader an excellent look at the system in place,for arresting and adjudicating these individuals.Mike Proctor also makes recommendations on the do's and dont's of activities for a victimas well as security measures that should be taken.I have experienced a stalking issue in my own life and found thisbook extremely helpful in many aspects."},{"Title":"How to Stop a Stalker","review":"How to Stop a Stalker / 1-59102-091-3My edition of this book was published in 2003, and I don't believe there is a more recent edition currently available. So keep in mind that a lot has changed in the realm of online stalking since this book was published - changes that I certainly don't fault this book for failing to predict and account for. Having said that, if you're buying this book to gain insight on how to protect from online stalking, you'll find very little here - the three cyber-stalking cases presented here are of the \\"meet online and then in person\\" variety. There is little to no discussion of the non-physical, yet still destructive, types of cyber-stalking and cyber-harassment; again, not the book's fault, but if that's the information you need, this book won't supply it.As far as old-fashioned physical proximity stalking goes, this book definitely does deliver on the safety and vigilance tips. The section on home security alone is deeply comprehensive, and I strongly recommend it for anyone - even if you aren't being stalked physically, there's a lot of good home defense information here that you may never have thought about. (For instance, how sturdy is your front door?)If there's anything I dislike about this book, it would be the overall tone and presentation. The author has a very snitty tone and seems to think very highly of himself - there's a certain tone of \\"what was this idiot thinking?!?\\" in some of the anecdotes that didn't sit well with me. I'm firmly of the belief that authors should be able to write however they please, but considering that many of the target audience for this book will be victims or intended victims of stalkers, it seems a little cold (and potentially triggering) to berate victims for being too trusting. For that matter, the author gives a few too many details, in my opinion, in his anecdotes - when describing how a woman met up with an internet stalker and was attacked, why not just leave it that she was assaulted? It seems...strange, somehow, that the author is so careful to detail how many times she was raped, or which of her teeth were knocked out (and forced to swallow!, he adds). What's the point of that? Again, it's triggering and seems to focus less on \\"how to stop a stalker\\" and more on \\"there's a lot of scary people out there, and you need me to protect you\\".If you can get past the horrific anecdotes and their strangely specific level of detail, this is a useful book on home security and physical vigilance. It's a niche book, and it could have been written better (and more tightly edited), but if you have the need, this book will help.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"How to Stop a Stalker","review":"Since I suffer from this problem, I was very interested in the subject. Mr. Proctor was a detective with the Orange County Police and has experience in this area. I was more interested in how to obtain evidence that will hold up in court.

I was trying to go with a private investigator and he didn't think that was a good idea.

This book was and is invaluable for my and my co-workers work. Up to now we have order seven of this books.This book can easily act as introduction and reference to struts. Ted Husted gives you an precise idea of the MVC concept and the struts control flow. He describe the multiple &quot;parts&quot; of struts and how they interact with each other. Within the whole book it get's crisp clear what matters within software development and particular web application development: it's about architecture. This book gives you examples of good programming practice with struts and guides you to establish a layered design throughout your application.I have read Programming Jakarta Struts and some german books, but no one has the depth of infomation than &quot;Struts in Action&quot;.If you need an in depth look (and soon or later you need it when working with struts) this one is clearly for you."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"A book from the author of Struts, can you possibly go wrong?

It is better than the documentation in Apache's website but still far away from being a 5-star book. ... If you are new to Struts, you will still have to spend a lot of time to figure out the details yourself.

Gladly and thankfully this book left a quite different impression, it explains the Struts innards really well, marking out the differences between V1.0 and V1.1, building the foundation thru detailed idiot-proof examples, and then gets down to the goodies.I agree with some other reviewers in that the number/density of examples go down as you get along, and I disagree with them in that that's a bad thing. Remember, unlike many other books where you can decide to read chapters in any order, this book would add most value if chapters are read sequentially from start, they are already logically organized and one builds on another, and once you really go thru the first few chapters understanding them thoroughly, I mean not by only reading them but by writing your own code along with, you would NOT need the idiot-proof examples to grasp the meat of the later chapters, once you got the foundation right you can easily get the feel of it. This is not a 'for idiots' book and I would like to thank the authors for keeping it that way, you have enough information in the book to understand the Struts framework (and then some) pretty well, but you gotta take your hands outta your pockets and write some code!I liked the way Tiles, Validator and Velocity has been explained, keep up the good work Ted!"},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"This book did a great job explaining to me not only *what* Struts is and *why* I should use it but also *how* to use it. This is something I found lacking in the O'Reilly book, Programming Jakarta Struts. In addition to the coverage on Struts, this book extends into areas like proper MVC and Layered design principles that are very important to apply if you wish to get the most out of the Struts framework. Of course a full treatment of MVC, layered design and other enterprise web engineering best practices are outside of the scope of this book but the authors have plenty of references so you can fill in gaps in your knowledge as necessary.

IBM highly recommends this standard for Java application development for Websphere. And if you want to acquaint yourself with that framework, this is a good book to get you there.The book starts out with a quick sample application that you can download so that you can see a representative Struts-style application. Most of the details are glossed over, but it's only temporary. It's followed by a chapter that goes into the architecture, explaining how it works and why the pieces fit together. From there, another simple application is developed, this time with more explanation as to what is going on. The rest of the book then goes into each part of the Struts framework, with copious code examples and illustrations.The authors assume a fair amount of previous experience on the part of the reader. The assumption is that there is a familiarity with HTML, JSP syntax, JavaBean conventions, and similar technologies. The reader should also be familiar with URLs, web application archives (WAR files), and other concepts surrounding web application development. By assuming these pre-existing skills, the authors can spend more time and space on Struts information. So if you are just starting out in web application development in Java, you may struggle a bit with this information.The authors also assume the use of Tomcat for the web application server. Since I'm working with IBM's Websphere Studio Application Developer (WSAD), I've had to make some mental adjustments on how to get things to work in that environment without the author's direct instruction. Because of this, I'd recommend that you be familiar with WSAD before using this book.The style of the book is very readable, and the concepts are easy to grasp. You may have to read over the material a couple of times to get it, but that's not a fault of the writing. New technology and concepts can be difficult to grasp. Struts is no exception. I can say that I'm understanding the material more quickly than I expected, and that's always a good thing.ConclusionIf you're looking to learn Struts, you would be well-served to get this book and dig in."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"I've been programming with Struts for 2 years now (and Java for 3) and I wish I had had this book when I started. Even though I now know Struts to about the 75% level, thanks greatly to this book which helped me in the upgrade from version 1.0 to 1.1, Struts never ceases to amaze me - what it can do, the work that it can save a web programmer, its robustness and its elegance too.The down-side is of course the steep learning curve, and the sticking points that I still come across where I have programmed or configured something wrong and can't work out why. In both these areas this book is invaluable.In the first case if someone needs to learn Struts, this covers the basics and provides a good grounding, and secondly I found the contents page and the indexing always lead me straight to the point in the text where I need to be when I've just created a bug in my code or I don't know how to approach a problem.Struts in Action is well written with flowing text and clear explanations, even to the point where I sometimes find myself reading the whole chapter after looking up and finding a little snippet of info - you never know what else you might learn."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"Still the best!Yeah sure there are errors.

It's the one that gets used.As of Aug 29th 2003, this is the best all around book on Struts on the market.The Tiles framework coverage is not so good, but neither is anyone other Struts book.If you are new to Struts, get Mastering Struts.If you are a Struts veteran, get this book (and the Orielly book).Used, Used, sometimes Abused... but still the one that gets used.Oh yeah, Ted Husted is a committer on the project (he has a lot of good insight)."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"I read this book cover to cover and found it to be the best book written on the Struts MVC framework by far.

Each chapter slowly goes into more detail, and before you know it, you understand how struts works.I highly recommend this book to anyone who needs to create web applications. It also has many notes about Struts 1.1, which most Struts books are too old to mention."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"I very much enjoyed the first eight chapters of this book with the first four being the meat of what Struts is all about. The remainder, however, seemed a bit disjointed and haphazardly put together. My biggest criticism of this book is the 18 pages of errata available on-line which itself has some errata. I would have expected a more polished tome of this detail and length."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"This book will definitely help you get started building Struts applications. It goes into great detail when explaining the config files and each of the struts components. It also gives good design approaches to help you create a good Struts app.It doesn't give you that many examples about the tag libraries but this book isn't about tag libraries.I will definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn and build Struts applications."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"This book explains how Struts works in great details. It explains the bolt and nut of each component, the Action, the Form and the tags about how it interacts with one another. It also talks about each attribute of the struct-config file and why they are there. Other books would just list it and follow through. In one Chapter, it 'dissects' an application with step by step explaination. Down to the details of what happens when each line of the programs executes. It helps me understand why I need to do something, why I should not and what the alternatives are. Another good thing about the author is that he can look at a problem with different propectives so he could anticipant what questions you may have and answer it at the right moment.On the other hand, you could be annoyed and find it verbose if you are familiar with Struts or you just want to set up Struts and just make it work."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"These guys put together a wonderful book, I've read it twice and find it not only an excellent reference to Struts 1.0,1.1 and Tiles, its also a great introduction to using web app frameworks in general, and general J2EE framework design and best practices. You start out with a high level overview of Struts, then drill down all of the topics that make up the framework, Actions,ActionForms,Struts-Taglibs etc...Lets face it, every web app framework you come across is gonna basically boil down to the Command pattern, this book is a great way to kickstart your understanding of Struts and the topic in general, which you can then use to bridge out from into any framework you come across, webwork,turbine,custom in house, whatever.In short: A great book on Struts and frameworks in general,in a style of writing that makes it a fun read."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"I've been struggling with Struts for many months now and I finally am understanding. I'm making progress on my first struts app and I couldn't be happier.The book includes best practices along with a description of the technology, so that you know how to use it and how to use it well. It also gives you options, for example when dealing with View components. First it shows you how to use JSP with Struts taglibs.. then once you have that, it shows you how to use Tiles.. then once you have that it shows you how to use Velocity. Good stuff.It is a rare gem of a geekly book that is as helpful as Struts in Action. Most geekly authors forget that not all aspects of their technology are implicitly understandable... this book doesn't have that problem. I often find when I'm reading the book that I will think to myself.. &quot;Hmm.. I wonder if that means I can do *blah*&quot; and then I read the next sentence and it almost says, &quot;You may be wondering if you can do *blah*...&quot;I really feel like I'm having a dialogue with the authors instead of reading a book. I cannot recommend this highly enough."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"This book is woefully out of date with respect to both struts and the extension packages that the author created and published. Most if not all are deprecated and standard struts components are available to replace them. I made the mistake of developing code for Struts 1.3 using this book as a reference and will end up rewriting the application as a result. There was probably a time where this book made sense and it may have value as a historical reference, particularly to the author's extensions. But there is no good reason to have this book as your Struts reference."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"I've read it over and over and I can't understand anything. Struts Html Tags are glossed over without examples. Just 2 lines on how to use the tags but the object/bean that it refers to is left to your imagination. If you understand the javadoc that comes with Struts then this will be clear to you but then you don't need a book. The O'reilly book is 1000 times better.Serves me right for buying a book without browsing and just relying on the reviews."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"These guys put together a wonderful book, I've read it twice and find it not only an excellent reference to Struts 1.0,1.1 and Tiles, its also a great introduction to using web app frameworks in general, and general J2EE framework design and best practices.

For one just starting to work with Java technologies I found use of the book detrimental to learning Struts. (I had been told it was not a bad reference.) I would have given it a lower rating had the review interface allowed it."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"A great read, cover-to-cover. Detailed, well-explained examples outlining every why, what, and how of struts and web app architecture in general.

I had already bought another book, but felt it had many gaps. I borrowed Struts in Action, read a couple of chapters, and was very impressed. The examples are great - nice and simple to start out with - and the Struts Framework is covered clearly and in detail. I've ordered my own copy, and I showed the book to a co-worker who then bought one too. All in all a great book."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"I've looked over the other reviews and all they find to do is to complain about the lack of examples. They are correct. If you learn only by example, don't buy this book - you'll find it pretty tough. Fortunately for some of us, there are other methods to learn things than by seeing them done by someone.This book is excellent if you need to quickly get a big picture view of what Struts is and how/when to use it. Unlike so many other IT books which get bogged down in details from the first few meaty pages, this book follows the simple and mature but oft-bypassed &quot;pyramid principle&quot; of laying out first the big picture, then the first layer of details, then the next, etc. It's refreshing for a change, to have an IT book written by someone who knows who to explain things clearly.Other reviewers referred to the encyclopedic nature of most of the book. What they miss here is that Struts (as shown by the first few chapters) is not very complicated at all (at least after reading this book). What else could the author write once Struts is explained, except for an in-depth description of the parts? Once you know how Actions and ActionForms and Forwards and all those fit together, you gotta get to the nitty gritty details of how they work internally, and that's what the author does.Overall, this book was one of my best buys (in the IT books category anyway)."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"I've been developing (on and off) web applications for the last five or six years. I sincerely wish this book had been available when I got started with Struts a little over a year ago; it would have saved me a lot of ramp-up time. The author explains the theory and benefit of MVC architecture and how Struts implements it better than anyone else I've seen. I guess that's not surprising since Mr. Husted is one of the contributors to the Struts development project. This well-organized book has provided me a clearer understanding of how Struts works and provided much insight into how to build effective and robust Struts web applications."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"As other reviewers have said this book starts out great with a couple examples that lay out the main features and advantages of a framework like struts. I personally like to learn by example (is there another way?) and did like these examples even though I am no big fan of frameworks ( I prefer to start from square one so that I am sure I understand 100% of what I do and also feel that everything I do is exactly like I want it).Unfortunately the book soon changes in an encyclopedic-stylereview where examples are scarce to non-existent, explanationsvery confuse ( I could check this lack of clarity and method looking at the presentation of concept that are absolutely familiar and clear to me like MVC or Tag Extensions or JSTL ..well the book explanations were horribly dull and confusing )and often to understand the subject presented you should haveknowledge of matters presented later in the book.In conclusion I think this bok might be marginally useful to someoone starting out with Struts .. so if you find it on your colleague's desk open it.. but as for shelling out the $$$ to buy it.. you would be better off investing in ice-creams..."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"I need to learn struts asap... this book while being highly recomended by professionals who have previous experience with struts, is of no use for the begginer. it takes you into a great deal of details while not giving you a quick example for you to start coding... jakarta struts for dummies was the most helpful to me. it had small segments of code and line by line explanation."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"Struts in Action is a good book that has some flaws. I had this book pre-ordered on Amazon from the minute I heard about its publication. The lead author Ted Husted is very active in the Struts development community and still manages a great Struts resource site.I read the book right away and spent a few weeks going over all the examples in the book. My overall feeling is that this is a good book but it suffers from a lot of the same thing that affects other Struts book. These books were published right around the release of Struts 1.1 and so they are on the fence where they talk about Struts 1.0 and 1.1. Since I had used Struts 1.0 before, the sections that described the changes from 1.0 to 1.1 was very helpful.Like other books, there is some mention of JSTL but not any details. The section on tag libraries is extensive and well written.I just went through all my Struts books again as I had to teach a 6 week class on Struts. I went through the five Struts books I owned and I settled on 'Programming Jakarta Struts' by Chuck Cavaness as my finalist. Struts in Action is really a good book but I felt the Chuck Cavaness did a better job of acting as a tutorial. So if you only want to buy one Struts book, I would recommend the Chuck Cavaness book. However, if you want more than one, I would highly recommend this book as your second book on Struts."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"I purchased Struts in Action because the web contains horribly incomplete and obtuse information about struts. I have to search through three or more sites to find what I'm looking for, and then test and wonder if I got it right.After reading the reviews I thought this book thinking would be right on the mark, and after reading the first couple of chapters I was going to write a glowing review but....So close. It's a great book with 1/3 of the information missing. The big picture is here, it's just not explained fully, or pieces are left out. Struts in Action starts beautifully, explaining the struts-config files, the details behind the struts-basic app, and an excellent later chapter about struts-tiles. This book just falls flat extending and scaling this knowledge in any depth. I was hoping for DETAILS about the struts taglibs, and I was let down by how it glosses over even some of the less granular points, such as what are the important and more oft-used attributes for each tag, and multiple examples of these tags in use (i.e how does the html:text tag use labels? How do I set a static checkbox to selected? Why was the html:form tag left out of the appendix?). It seems that the author just assumes that once you know the basics and go over the code, you can do anything. Well, that's why I was reading this book, because I expected it to be full of examples and code. He does such a fabulous job with the config file, and then loses focus.Still, out of the current Struts books, Ted's is BY FAR the most detailed, authoritative, and useful, and for these reasons worthy of an extra star.I'd still recommend this book, but unfortunately it's only as complete as the typically incomplete information on the Jakarta site. If you know nothing about struts, this will get you going. If you already know something but want to extend your knowledge in breadth and depth past the struts-config, you may be let down."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"That's what I love the most about this book, it doesn't just talk about how to configure and develop with Struts. It's a web application manifesto. Anyone can write a book about how to use Struts to build a web application. That's not the point. This book is ~8 people-years worth of first-hend developer knowledge (4 authors x ~2 years of working on the Struts project) condensed down into 630 pages. It doesn't just teach you how to use Struts (and Velocity and Taglibs and Tiles), but why you should use them. That's the most important thing this book has to offer. If your project is looking at using Struts &amp; other Jakarta technologies, you need this book. If your project is currently using Struts &amp; other Jakarta technologies, you need this book"},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"The book abounds with incorrect examples. Since the book puports to guide the user to a greater understanding of Struts through the liberal use of examples, the books lack of accuracy is unforgivable. Spending time attempting to work through examples which simply do not work is rather frustrating. One of the selling points of the book is the use of the &quot;free&quot; private website where users can interact with the author who is allegedly a &quot;Struts expert&quot;. Contrary the the books pronoucement, I've noticed that most messages go unanswered. In a few rare cases, the author actually answers a question. Mostly he simply instructs users to subscribe to the Struts mailing list. I would like to remind both the publisher and author(s) of section xxxii in the chapter entitled &quot;About This Book&quot; where it is stated, and I quote &quot;Purchase of Struts In Action includes free access to a private web forum run by Manning Publications where you can make comments about the book, ask technical questions, and receive help from the lead author and from other users.&quot;"},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"Overall this is a pretty good book for someone who slightly worked on Struts. I enjoy the first couple of chapters where it gives a very good overview of Struts and various configuration files. However, as you start to go deeper into the book, it starts to lack good examples and was throwing too much detailed information at you all at once. I don't see a lot of people able to remember all these details after reading the book and apply them to their day to day works. I am ok with it since I am already somewhat familar with Struts. But I can't imagine someone new to Struts to be able to read this book and understand the materials the book presents. So unless you have worked on Struts for several months or been looking at Struts code for a while, you might want to read a beginner book first and come back to this to acquire more advance information."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"I am not sure if the most recent reviewers read the same book that I read. Struts in Action provides the gamut of simple to detailed information about the Struts framework. Additionally, the goal of the book is not to provide complete examples but to use pieces of code to actually show examples of the information that Mr. Husted is conveying. There comes a point where being spoon fed is something different than learning.For those who need a complete application for an example might I suggest \\"Professional Struts Applications: Building Web Sites with Struts, Object Relational Bridge, Lucene, and Velocity\\". That book builds a complete web app as its premise. Again, the goal in Struts in Action is to provide the details of how to approach the MVC way of doing things using Jakarta Struts. The use of additional toolsets like Scaffold comes from the experience of the author (as evidenced by stuff in the Struts mailing lists and Resources page).I keep going back to this book over all the other Struts books simply because it provides information and examples of details that I am trying to figure out while building apps. As with all things in the open source world things change and fluidity is a beautiful thing. To refute one reviewer in particular I must point out that when this book was published Hibernate was not industrial strength code. I am using Hibernate now on some apps but don't blame Ted for not giving every solution to every problem..."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"I've used this book for the last 6 months on my 1st Struts project, and am using it for my 2nd. I've now read it three times. It gets clearer every time, but should I have to read it three times before it makes sense? This can't be your only Struts book. You'll need other references.My biggest complaint is that the examples in the beginning of the book constantly use Struts tag libraries instead of plain HTML that a non-Struts programmer already knows. The problem is that the book doesn't get around to explaining the tag syntax until chapter 10, so I had an awful time trying to understand what the early examples were doing. Hence the necessity to read it multiple times. It didn't help that there are many, many errors in the examples. (If you get this book, go get the errata and pencil them in BEFORE you read it. That will save a lot of head-scratching.)I also think the authors tried to cover too many subjects outside of Struts, such as Tiles and Scaffolds. For a programmer buying this book to learn about Struts, these additional frameworks just add layers of confusion. They would have done much better to stick with pure Struts and Java and leave these Struts &quot;add-ons&quot; to another book.Finally, this book, like almost every programing book on the market, suffers from a lack of drawings. Sometimes a simple drawing showing process or data flow, or even a screen shot of what a rendered jsp page looks like, will save pages of verbage.On a positive note, I really liked the first half of the book where different aproaches were presented along with the pro/con of each. Also, the writing is fairly &quot;friendly&quot;, sentances are kept short and to the point and the layout is easy to read."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"Though the book does cover the basics, it failed to be clear and concreate, when it gets into details. There is a huge gap between the &quot;Simple Application&quot; of Ch.3 and the &quot;Artimus Application&quot; of Ch. 15. And these are the only two examples in the entire book. Infact to add more to the confusion, the authors started referring to &quot;Artimus&quot; in bit and pieces in the earlier chapters themselves. While the reader doesn't have any idea at all.There is no simple example, which explains the use of a Database. Rather the authors resorted to the so called &quot;Commercial-grade application, The Artimus&quot;. Well it may be of commercial-grade, but doesn't help the developer to start quick.And best of all, it uses Scaffold tool set, which you can find, no where else other than the authors' website. In the Jakarta site, it is yet to be released and right now in &quot;Sandbox (Not-Yet-Proposed) Components &quot; category. God knows what the authors' had in mind. Looks like they wanted to emphasise more on there own tool sets (like scaffold) than struts actually. Rather it would have been much better, if they have used quite matured DAO like Hibernate, etc.Hope they come out with better examples with more clear explanations in the next edition of the book."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"When I needed to learn Struts, I went first to the online doc, but found it wanting. I then went to the O'Reilly book on the subject, assuming it would be as good as other O'reilly material, but it just wasn't. I did my due diligence and picked Ted Husted's Struts in Action, and I haven't regretted it at all. It covers what needs to be covered, in a methodical logical fashion. Sadly, this is more than I can say for most tech books, not just the ones on Struts. Virtually every Struts book I looked at covered some things I didn't want to know about and left out stuff about things critical to me. Struts in Action was a valuable learning tool and continues to serve as a great reference."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"After reading the O'Reilly Jakarta Struts book I started reading this one. I have about one year of Struts experience so I am not quite starting. The difference between the two books is striking. This book gives you all the nuts and bolds and puts the whole Struts framework in the conceptual context it deserves. O'Reilly's book is a good book for starters but does not really leave the surface. So it is good to start out with but you really should move to this book to get the work done!"},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"I bought this book when I started a new job. I had used other frameworks, and wasn't familiar with struts.I started off reading through 1st and 2nd chapters. It seemed like there was a lot of detail on the things I already knew about (the html for the page), but it seemed to take a while for the author to get around to explaining the things that I bought the book for (the actual xml for struts config). But hey, I could always use the code examples directly, and it didn't bother me *to* much.After I started my job, though, I needed to be able to reference stuff, especially less common stuff, and there this book absolutely falls on it's face. It's often very difficult to find stuff, and when you do find stuff the description is often to vague and lacking the needed details to be helpful, or you just can't find a reference to it.For example, I just needed to look up how to tie a form select element (the drop down box) to a collection. So I looked in the index for \\"select\\". Nothing - no entry at all. So I looked for \\"form\\". Again - nothing. What struts book doesn't have a \\"form\\" or \\"forms\\" listing?? So I look up html (you know, as in html:select). There's no html select, but there's an html:form. So I go to that page - it's an extremely basic section about creating a basic form. No mention of select.On other topics, even if you can find the section it's so so vague it's useless. Take the struts cancel button, for example - the book mentions it, but doesn't describe how to use it at all. The one code example that they give is actually wrong - it's lists javascript that struts automatically puts in (you shouldn't type it in).Overall I'm very, very dissapointed in this book."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"I purchased this book a while ago and its been my primary source for all Struts related questions. I've purchased other books on Struts, this is by far the best one. It has comprehensive examples and makes a great reference."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"Although the book has lots of information and has many details, there's really no substitute for actually programming a MVC application with Struts. Struts is simple enough that most of what it offers can be learned by writing applications and looking at the API, which is open-source. The fine grained minutia is not in the book and has to be discovered manually. But, if you own his book, you can just ask Ted!Also, before embarking on a trip with Struts as the framework, it is vital to understand the MVC pattern. That pattern has its advantages and its disadvantages."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"After wadding through a few on-line examples and having dealt with another struts book which I found to be poorly organized, I recently turned to Eclipse in Action.This is the book for me! I found it to be tight enough on information that you don't fall asleep as you work your way through book, but also well organizd enough to be useful. It contains some surprisingly dense sections masquerading as a long series of small examples. The tiles chapter comes to mind as a good example. In what appears to be an idiots guide to converting a non-tiles page to tiles page he manages to visit several possible patterns for using JSPs and struts from no-struts at all to subclassed definitions in the tiles.xml, stopping along the way and &quot;spoon-feeding&quot; the difference between all of the confusingly similar tiles tags. Such apparently simplistic lines such as &quot;rename the &lt;tiles:insert&gt; to &lt;tiles:put&gt; elements&quot; serves the beginner, but also serves as well as any bullet list of differences for the more experienced developer. This is particularly the case, when you are looking in your books to help you debug an apparently valid, but non-functional use of something obscure like a tiles tags which you pasted but forgot to change, or in which you accidently used the wrong attribute.Reading this book, you could tell that the authors were very familiar with the material enough to discuss various choices, providing useful explanation for their particular designs. They also, did not bother to list ever possible choice and XML attribute choosing instead to explain how to use the important bits and assuming you can use the terse on-line documentation yourself for other more obscure bits.Despite the fact that in one chapter I realized I was reading something by one of the co-authors, because it was sufficiently different than the other chapters, I think some credit is due the editors at Manning. Recently they seem to have produced, not the thickest books on a subject, nor the most encyclopedic or pedantic, but certainly well organized and very readable and thus very useful books.Overall, I recommend this book for general learning and reference. Sure I might suggest you wade through the shorter but much less readable O'Reilly book, if you really find some compelling need to write your own RequestProcessor, but if you want to learn how to use Struts as it was intended from some of the folks who have been using it, I'd recommend picking up a copy of Struts In Action."},{"Title":"Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework","review":"Many other reviewers have said it, but I'll say it too: This book is not as polished as it could be. My biggest gripe is that the contents are not organized in a way that makes for easy reference. The lack of a substantive index is a SERIOUS problem. Ted's insitance on cutesy catchphrases instead of meaningful section headings means that one has to decipher the headings. That in turn makes finding stuff harder.The section on Validator was a huge disappointment, because it is just as terse as the official dox: Plenty on how to do the fancy stuff, but next to nothing on how to do the basics! And most of David's earlier Validator stuff is now in the Jakarta-Commons project, where it's virtually completely undocumented. I was hoping for something beyond what's on the Struts web site.That said, the info is (almost) all there and mostly correct (allowing for the fact that software evolves faster than books ;-&gt;) There is very little fluff.I started using Struts 'round about the same time Ted did but was called away to other things and recently needed to catch up with 1.1. I have not read any of the other Struts books around, so I don't have a very good basis for comparison. Bottom line: I recommend the book as a good tutorial, but look elsewhere for a reference work.

The first-hand tales of Henson's Arctic exploits are told in straightforward prose, full of personal touches. One can almost see the twinkle in Henson's eye as he related these stories to listeners to whom the Arctic was as remote as the moon.Henson was a key player on one Peary expedition after another from 1892 through 1909. He went with Peary virtually every step of the way on every expedition after Peary's first crossing of Greenland. Henson built sledges and other equipment, handled the dog teams, took his turn out in front by a day or more breaking trail, and, most importantly, developed a close working relationship with the Eskimos, whose assistance was the key to reaching the North Pole. Henson is not shy about his own contribution, and that view is supported by the three introductions to Dark Companion by Peary contemporaries MacMillan, Freuchen and Stefansson. These testimonials alone are reason enough to buy this book. MacMillan, a tenderfoot on the 1909 Peary expedition to the Pole and an Arctic explorer in his own right in later years, readily admitted that Peary took Henson to the pole because, with all of his experience and abilities he was the best man for the job. And Henson's courage -- whether pushing ahead with Peary despite lack of supplies, relying on hunting skills to avoid almost certain starvation, or facing constant danger from moving, crushing, and suddenly parting ice, or fighting walruses from kayaks -- is indisputable.These Arctic accounts are available in other sources, including Henson's own book, a Negro Explorer at the North Pole, and books by Henson's fellow travelers, Peary, Bartlett, MacMillan and Borup. But only in Dark Companion can one read Henson's account of survival in another inhospitable environment -- late 19th and early 20th century America.The Arctic was a place where Henson could contribute his full potential. Not because Peary or his white companions were civil rights crusaders, but because the environment of the north simply demanded too much to afford the luxury of limiting any person's contributions on arbitrary racial grounds. By contrast, Henson's life outside the Arctic was a struggle against diminished expectations and unspoken slurs at best and outright racial hatred at worst. But in telling the story, Henson focuses on the exception, the kindness of the sea captain who tutored him and taught him to read, as the defining influence in his life.Upon returning to America after Peary's expedition to the pole, Henson's contribution went largely unrecognized. In fact, critics openly attacked Peary for taking a Negro on the final leg of the North Pole dash. Early on, the argument, by Cook supporters, was raised that Peary must have taken Henson because he didn't want a \\"credible\\" witness. This, the argument goes, would leave Peary free to make phony claims, since Henson would presumably be either too stupid to contradict Peary, would not dare to contradict him, or would be ignored.Henson continues to be caught in the crossfire of modern Peary critics. To discount the possibility that Peary might have chosen Henson on merit, critics routinely have referred to him as Peary's manservant or valet. Yet Peary listed Henson as an assistant. Henson was only a \\"valet\\" once, when surveying in Nicaragua prior to 1892. Some recent critics disparage Henson's lack of \\"full literacy\\" and analyze his every statement looking for inconsistencies to prove him a \\"liar.\\" Henson's recounting of his adventures to Robinson, some 40 to 50 years after the fact, does, to be sure, contain some inconsistencies in the details. Still, one wonders why some critics readily excuse what might charitably be called far greater memory lapses in the accounts of Frederick Cook, a \\"white man,\\" while branding Henson's mistaken recollections as lies. But Henson never wavered on the essentials: Henson, with all his expert sledding experience, was confident that the expedition had covered the necessary distance from the last navigational observation to the Pole.One cannot find fault with Robinson's editorial decision to let Henson's recollections speak for him. The opportunity to get Henson's detailed story, under oath, subject to cross examination, while it was fresh in his mind, was passed up when Congress, in its investigation of Peary's claim, did not bother to call Henson as a witness. History will never recover from that shameful oversight, and Robinson could not repair the damage.This book is not about whether Henson actually stood at the pole, or only 5 or 20 miles from it. It is about one man's decision to be shaped by what was positive in his life. It is about having the courage to face every conceivable danger to participate in a great enterprise on an even playing field. It is about the satisfaction of seeing one's talents and experience put to good use, and of being the one called upon when the need was greatest -- in short, a hero. It is an inspirational story."},{"Title":"Dark companion;: The story of Matthew Henson, (A Fawcett premier book)","review":"Hi.My name is Aviaq Henson from Greenland.I believe that Matthew Henson had wrote that book because all he said was true, why would a black man lie to write that book while there was still much of racism in societies.

I've always been fascinated by polar explorers (especially the early ones) because of the privations they suffered, and for nothing but recognition and desire to see what hasn't yet been seen.Juxtapose the sub-plot of a noted Naval navigator, driven to make his mark in the world, forming a relationship with a black man (very free-thinking in those days) that made both men stronger than they would have been on their own, and you have a truly a fascinating story.It's too bad that so much has to be made of the fact that Henson was a black man, but it mattered then, and sadly, it matters now. If Peary didn't think it was issue 80 years ago, why is race still an issue? This is the question that forms an undercurrent to the story in the book.

I wish that I'd read it as a kid because it portrays the enormity of the challenge in a way that astounds the reader.That Mr. Robinson had the blessing and resources of Mr. Henson really adds to the authenticity of this work. It reads really well. Mr. Robinson assembled the memoirs with great craft and thought without leaving you feeling that the writer was in the way.Instead, he wrote a compelling story of an amazing feat that brings the reader right inside the story. Honestly, there were so many instances when the descriptions were so perfectly written that I felt that I was there.From Matt's running away as a child to his tutelage on the sea on to Central America and Greenland.Matt's early days with the natives of Greenland. Their acceptance of him as a lost brother (ancestral memory of the African Diaspora?.. who knows?) His learning their ways. The bear hunt was incredibly invigorating to read.There are so many chapters that boggle the mind. The chapter where Peary's toes get frostbitten, and how Matt saves him. This was November in the Arctic. Pitch black; unimaginable cold. The hardship was palpable. And when Matt broke through the ice, I had no idea how he could've survived.An extremely compelling read. Whether you're 8 or 80, this book is a Great Adventure and I can't imagine anyone having written it better. When you're done, don't forget to visit the website which is a wonderfully rich resource.

Morrow Author"},{"Title":"Dark companion;: The story of Matthew Henson, (A Fawcett premier book)","review":"This book, first published in 1947, was the first biography of Matthew Henson, the long time associate of the arctic explorer Robert E. Peary, who claimed to have reached the North Pole on April 6, 1909. According to the publisher, the author worked \\"in close collaboration with Henson\\" to tell his story, and the story he tells is the stuff of legends-literally. Much of the circumstantial substance of the book is simply at odds with all existing documentary evidence.On its way to building up Henson's role in Peary's expeditions to an unwarranted degree and at others' expense, including Peary himself, ultimately insinuating that Henson should be credited as the discoverer of the North Pole, Robinson leaves a trail of howlers along the way. In his account of Peary's 1891-92 expedition, Henson builds Peary's winter headquarters nearly single-handedly, when it was really a largely prefabricated building designed to be thrown up in a few days. We learn that expedition member Eivind Astrup, who was barely 5'9\\" and weighed 170 pounds, was a \\"broad shouldered giant\\"; poor Langdon Gibson, divided into two different people as \\"Gibson \\" and \\"Langdon,\\" goes off in different directions in search of his lost companion, John Verhoeff. When it is done, Robinson has the expedition returning to New York instead of Philadelphia, as it truly did. These amazingly elementary gaffs show that Robinson didn't even bother to read Peary's published record of the expedition, Northward, Over the \\"Great Ice,\\" but rather relied on the aging Henson's faulty memory of events already 50 years in the past.Robinson's account of Peary's 1898-1902 expedition is hardly better. He has a circumstantial account of a meeting between Peary and his rival, Otto Sverdrup, aboard Peary's ship, which, in common with many other circumstantial accounts in the book, was an event that never happened. He even allows Henson to claim credit for saving Peary's life when Peary froze his toes on a journey to Fort Conger in 1899. Actually, Peary's surgeon was with Peary on this journey and attended to his injuries, but Henson claims the surgeon never left the ship.Dark Companion also contains \\"facts\\" that would be a surprise to the scientific literate. For instance, Henson's observation that \\"in the Arctic, the sun at its peak of ascension is rarely more than 10 degrees above the horizon,\\" or that \\"longitude cannot be determined above the 80th parallel.\\" He also learn that Henson lost 60 pounds on his journey to the Pole and back. Considering Henson only weighed about 130 pounds, that is a pretty amazing statement in itself.Even events of a personal nature that could only have come from Henson don't ring true. Although Robinson states that when Henson met Lucy Ross in 1905 \\"he was in love for the first time in his life,\\" according to Henson's leading advocate, S. Allen Counter, Henson had in fact been married previously to Eva Flint in 1891 and divorced by her in 1897. And Henson gives Robinson an account of his childhood that is circumstantially incompatible with the account he had given in his own 1912 autobiography A Negro Explorer at the North Pole. In Dark Companion Robinson quotes the kindly old sea captain who took Henson from the wharves of Baltimore to be his cabin boy as saying to him: \\"Promise me you'll [never lie]. Lying is a bad thing.\\" Evidently, Henson didn't take the Captain's advice. He told conflicting tales about his himself at every turn, and the older he grew the taller they got.As for the writing style, this book might easily be mistaken as one for pre-adolescents rather than aimed at an adult audience. (The New York Times Book Review compared its style to that of the Rover Boys juvenile novels of the 1900s). But for any level of audience, any author who presents his work as biography has a moral obligation to stick to documentary truth. But this book is full of fantasy. Even S. Allen Counter, who once accepted this book as truth, now calls it a \\"biographical novel.\\" One can easily sympathize with the neglect of Henson's real accomplishments in exploration and his real contributions to Peary's expeditions in the past as a result of racism. However, righting the wrongs of the past cannot justify writing fiction and presenting it as history.Fiction, too, is Peary's claim to have reached the North Pole with Henson and four Inuit sledge drivers. Instead, all the evidence (or lack of it) contained in Peary's voluminous papers points to it having been the greatest scientific hoax of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Dark companion;: The story of Matthew Henson, (A Fawcett premier book)","review":"Why doesn't someone write an adult book about Matt Henson?

The forming of such a complex story from start to completion could only be accomplished by a writer with an excellent grasp of the craft. It is evident throughout the story that the author has researched her subject matter and has incorporated details of character development, location and overall presentation with this research in mind. May I say, \\"Well done, Ms. Foster.\\"The story of forbidden love is set in the year 999. We meet Thorgunna Vagndottir, Lady Jar, mistress of the Isle of Tiree. A young, beautiful widow captured in the clutches of the evil self-named god, Loki, who lusts after her beauty and the power she possesses as the mistress of Tiree. He is determined to rule and reign over her and all her kingdom.We are introduced to Lerf, son of the ruler of Greenland who is shipwrecked on her island on his way to Norway, where he hopes to open the lines of trade between the two lands, and whom is destined to become one with Thorgunna.Thorgunna is gifted with what she calls 'The Second Sight.\\" The story whirls around her visions as she battles the evil villain, Loki, for control of her soul and her island. We watch her struggle against the love she cannot control for the beautiful Viking that hungers for her, yet must continue on his journey and the quest that is set before him. Little did he know he would hold the secret to Thorgunna's freedom.\\"Love's Second Sight\\" is brimming with supernatural events, demonic inspired turmoils and the search for the one thing that will end the terror and the evil plot of the self-made god, Loki. That can only be accomplished in the acceptance of the White Christ who has authority over all. Unfortunately, Thorgunna must battle her own fears, doubts and hatred that has been instilled in her from previous self-made demonic gods, before she would ever be able to trust in the true God, a God she cannot see. Her journey and that of Leif's causes one to wonder if theirs will always be a forbidden love. Wonder if she will ever open her eyes to the only God who truly can transform her life and still the storm within her. The answer to that you will have to find out yourself.The only drawback that I had with this work was the strong sexual content that fills the pages. If you are not comfortable with detailed sexual experiences then you will not want to read this work.Final analysis: Superb writing, top-notched storyline, heart-stopping conclusion, but for me the explicit sexual content definitely took away from an otherwise outstanding read.Shirley Johnson/Senior ReviewerMidWest Book Review"},{"Title":"Love's Second Sight","review":"\\"Love's Second Sight\\" is a great, imaginative story based on stanzas contained in medieval Icelandic texts \\"The Vinland Saga, the \\"Greenlander's Aga\\" and \\"Saga of Erik the Red.\\"Thorgunna must rule an island as a woman in an era where men are in charge.

If she worships him as her God and gives him her virginity, Loki will protect her people. But Loki is a liar and a trickster, which Thorgunna knows. She must be cautious when dealing with Loki but she doesn't know who else can protect her people. The King of Norway wants the beer Tiree produces and with him comes the new ChristianityThorgunna has a second sight. With it she sees that she will never meet the man she is married by contract to, instead the man she will eventually fall in love with will arrive at her island. The deal she makes with Loki prevents her from making love with this man though. If they make love, Loki will kill both of them as well as the people of Tiree.Leif is traveling to Norway when his ship was wrecked in a storm. Once there, he hopes that King Olaf will recognize Greenland so that traders will come, bringing wealth to the land. He arrives at Tiree to make repairs to his ship. Leif and Thorgunna are attracted to each other and spend time together. As the days progress Leif's desire for Thorgunna grows. Thorgunna too desires Leif and when he asks why she holds her self back she tells him of her pact with Loki. At first Leif keeps his distance from Thorgunna but his need for her is too strong.Thorgunna and Leif have many obstacles in their way. Along with Loki's wrath, Leif must leave Tiree to make a life for the people of Greenland and the people of Tiree need Thorgunna's leadership so she must stay on there. They have no future together and yet their love and desire for each other deepens and they consummate their relationship. Loki will not allow this though and he causes chaos to ensue on the island.The time comes for Leif to leave Tiree. After meeting with King Olaf in Norway, Leif is baptized and converted to Christianity. When he arrives back home in Greenland with the help of his mother, they begin to erect a church. Proclaiming Greenland a christian land. If Christianity is brought to Tiree, Loki will be furious and war between the Gods will rage forth.Love's Second Sight is a very profound and intense story with the romance often being bittersweet. Thorgunna and Leif are separated and long for each other and while away Leif is faithful in his love, he wanders a bit. This is a very sexual story that is often mixed with violence. It's not for the faint of heart. Love's Second Sight is fascinating, dark and sensual. It will take you on an unforgettable journey.NannetteReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"},{"Title":"Love's Second Sight","review":"This is one well written, fast paced story !

The title is right. Humankind doesn't let nature alone in Bagdad by the Bay. We have been filling walls with our color and figures since the walls have stood in the City. That most curious of monuments, Coit Tower, brimming with the muscular WPA murals, tells California's story in paint. The murals in the Haight vibrate with psychedelic counterculture; those of the Mission and Western Addition not only deliver the messages of the Latino and African American neighborhoods but have become identified as centers of the communities. People meet at a mural in San Francisco, just as they might meet at a fountain in Rome. Of course, the book records the outstanding art across the Bay and down the Peninsula, but for me the best part of the book was its putting together city maps and pictures of murals so that a reader can experience the favorites. The fancy semiotics, art techniques and materials are all here, conveyed by a recognized authority, but the author is wise enough not to get in the way of the always revolutionary, ever traditional mix of color, lines, architecture and geography.

If we had listened in 1993 there would of been no trial in 2005 and several kids would of been saved from the King Of Pop. To the Fans of Michael Jackson grow up and listen to the cries of little children, their tears are real."},{"Title":"All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up","review":"After reading this book and hearing the Uncle interviewed, I believe that Michael Jackson was a pedophile. It hurts to say that because I was a lifelong fan of Michael Jackson. I've decided that while I still love him for his tremendous talent and music he gave us and honor that, I don't love his other, darker side. There were many points in the book that rang true for me. One being, why would any normal man want to live with a mother and son and sleep in the bed with the son while there is an empty room available night after night? Where there is smoke, there is fire. The highly trained experts that interviewed Jordie believed his detailed story. I put a lot of stock in that. It is sad how the father Evan ends up being crucified, but to me, he was the hero for fighting for his son to get out of that unhealthy situation and put a stop to it. He then fought again not to give him back to the mother and Michael. It took a lot of guts, integrity and guts to my mind given what he was up against."},{"Title":"All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up","review":"Jordan was the second of three child molestation charges Michael Jackson received. The son of one of Michael's maids was the first one.If Michael didn't want these accusations to come about, he would have done better to stop sleeping with other people's sons. Many concerned friends and family warned him that it didn't look good when middle-aged men can't stop sleeping with boys.I expect rabid fans will consider it all lies, or make excuses for Michael's behavior.Read Jordan Chandler's statements on the internet, make up your own mind as to what might be the facts.Jordan did not ever recant his story, that was a rumor that was spread after Michael's death."},{"Title":"All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up","review":"I love how this guy tries to get attention by using these unfounded allegations. These people are so quick to complain about what MJ did, but they weren't as willing to go to court & testify were they? They just cashed in as much as they could."},{"Title":"All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up","review":"I love Michael Jackson, but who the hell thinks it's o.k. to sleep in bed with little boys? There is more to it than that. This book is a good look behind the scenes in Michael Jackson's life, from the point of view few fan's, other than little boys, get to see. To Michael Jackson fans--Just read the book with an open mind, don't be a fool to overlook who Michael Jackson really may be. If he is a nasty pervert, like he would want anyone to know, right?"},{"Title":"All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up","review":"Another great book that has MJ fans screaming. You can always tell a good and truthful book on MJ by the lack of stars that reviewers give it. MJ fans basically spend much of their time going on to Amazon and reviewing the MJ books. I\`d go so far as to say that many real life pedos get on here too and defend MJ\`s sick personal lifestyle. They give 5 stars to the MJ books that promote the cover up of MJ\`s crimes, and they give only one star to the MJ books that try to get the truth out to the public about MJ\`s sick personal lifestyle. This book\`s written by Jordie\`s uncle, so i\`m sure he knows more than what MJ fans know. Oh, that\`s right, the Chandler family are just cashing in and are after MJ\`s money. Even if they were just after MJ\`s money, it doesn\`t mean that they\`re lying now does it? They obviously must have some sort of hard evidence against MJ to risk taking to court the biggest and most powerful pop star. And if they were just cashing in and wanting lots of money then they\`d write positive stuff about MJ in this book because they know that it would sell more copies if they please MJ fans. But it\`s more important to the chandlers that they get the truth out despite massive pressure from MJ\`s army of fans. I highly recommend the public to read this book and then make up their own minds about who/what MJ was. Buy and read this book before MJ fans try to have this book suppressed. As you can now see, this book\`s already becoming very hard to get and it will almost certainly be near impossible to come by in about 5 years time if MJ fans get their way. Never mind the victims and their families speaking out and having their say. In MJ fans eyes, MJ\`s image as a nice hetrosexual man must be kept at all costs."},{"Title":"All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up","review":"This book is not worth the poor trees that died or it.The Chandlers are con-artists and bullies. Save your money and seek the truth."},{"Title":"All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up","review":"ok, those of you who are giving this book good reviews are really just buying into sensationalism. look @ one important fact, jordan chandler DOESN'T speak to his family anymore!! and he hasn't spoken to any of them since he was 15!! why?? he didn't even show up for the trial...if he was truly molested, why didn't he want to put a criminal away?? why did jordan chandler leave the country?? and also, why is raymond chandler trying to sell his book NOW?? 12 years later?? you know why, he has absolute no contact with jordan who's the undeserved cash cow of his family, and raymond is just riding the tabloid book gravy train. and again, before you stereotype that all michael jackson fans are crazed lunatics...I'M not a person one who sets people up, I'M not a person who would conspire to make money off of someone unethically...I'M not someone who writes scathing and untrue tabloid books/stories just to make myself a star, I'M not a person who would celebrate if that other person was harrassed by law enforcement and again, last but not least...i may be a fan, but i'm not crazy.

If you asked me it sounds like the kids uncle is sexually attracted to the boy.And isnt it kind of weird that this mans story changes everytime he tells it. And let's be real, if a weirdo supperstar did this to your son you'd take him to court an expose him for what he is, not take a giant settlement, that only says two things. 1. money is more important then your childs well-being, 2. he really was telling the truth, he must have cut them off, cause in the book it says that the dad knew something was going on, but he didnt do anything, he only chose to do something when Michael cut him off.

Raymond Chandler, the uncle of the victim and brother of the victim's father, narrates this tale for the reader. He shares conversations, feelings and even encounters, both positive and negative, with Michael Jackson fans.Is this book biased? Of course it is. It is told from a family member and insider. But knowing this, All That Glitters gives a perspective on this settled case that has been missing for many years.You don't need to interested in the Jackson allegations to enjoy this book. In fact, the one person who finally bought their own copy after reading mine had no interest in Jackson at all. This book is, more than anything, a sad saga of how the possibility of riches and stress of a possible criminal trial tore apart a family being held together by the thinnest of strings. It illustrates how those on the opposite side of the table used father against mother, victim against parents, and so much more. In the end, there were no winners.It is on my must-read list, and not because its about Michael Jackson, but because it is about humanity."},{"Title":"All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up","review":"The book is all nonsense. Want to read a book about Michael? Read Letters to Michael Jackson."},{"Title":"All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up","review":"Finally the facts behind the original molestation charges against Michael Jackson come out in a book written by lawyer, Raymond Chandler,who is also the boy's uncle. Written by one who observed it all, Chandler gives a fascinating but fact driven narrative of how the events played out in 1993. The facts: from the sleepovers, the Jesus juice, the almost near possession of the boy by M.J. to the powerful negative media blitz by the Jackson PR team against the family. This sounds all too familiar 12 years later.Great page turner with the facts to back it up."},{"Title":"All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up","review":"The byline on this book should be: Apologist to an extortion. The book is clearly written in direct response to Mary Fischer's GQ article and uncle Ray tries his best to refute the months of research done in preparation for that article. The main problem with this book is that Raymond Chandler had very little contact with the \\"characters\\" about which he writes. Clearly, his greedy brother did not share any of the money with him so Ray decided to write his own book from an insider's perspective. However, Ray had very little to offer in that regard. He knows that his brother is a money-hungry pig so he can factually write about his experiences on that issue. However, he had no contact with Jordie and could not describe anything that occurred there. It is important to note that Ray Chandler has repeatedly stated over the years that he felt bad about the impact that the allegations had on Michael's career. Does that make sense to anyone if he truly believed that Michael had molested his nephew?More importantly, while many interviews were not published, Evan Chandler spoke to anyone who would listen to his tale. His conversations with others contradicted those included in uncle Ray's book. Uncle Ray does one very interesting thing: he makes a number of carefully disguised admissions that show it was an extortion. I believe that was the true intent of the book."},{"Title":"All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up","review":"This book is full of tabloid lies and speculation. If you really want to know what happened in 93' the book to read is \\"Redemption\\" by Geraldine Hughes. Raymond your book is garbage and you know it. You and your entire family are money hungry greedy people going after MJ to destroy his legacy. The facts about the 93' case are out there you just need to seek them. Here is a list of reads and visuals to start with:1. \\"Was Michael Jackson Framed?\\" 1994 GQ article by Mary Fisher2. \\"Redemption\\" by Geraldine Hughes about 1993 case3. \\"Michael Jackson Conspiracy\\" by Aphrodite Jones bout the 2005 trial4. \\"The Untold story of Neverland\\" DVD by Larry Nimmer5. \\"The Visual Documentary\\" by Adrian GrantIt is really sad that the media controls people the way they want too. Wake up America the media is keeping the \\"TRUTH\\" from you by not giving you the whole story."},{"Title":"All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up","review":"I found this book to be interesting. I have read books from all across the spectrum about Michael Jackson (guity, not guilty, biographies). What bothered me about this book is that the author created actual conversations at meetings and situations at which the author was not present. At best, he must have gotten an account of them from his brother, and that is called hearsay. Rather than saying, \\"My brother told me...\\" he actually recites conversations as accurately portraying what took place.Regardless, I was rather apalled that the book seemed to confirm that Evan Chandler saw the alleged molestation of his child as an opportunity to get money,(and the largest amount amount possible) rather than to obtain \\"justice\\". The re-created conversations between attorney Larry Feldman and Evan Chandler show two men gleefully plotting and strategizing how to get the most money out of Jackson. While there are some feeble attempts to justify this, they do not ring true. Actually, this book and Diane Dimond's \\"Be Careful Who You Love\\" did more to convince me of Jackson's innocence than most of the pro-MJ books.And note this book was written in 2004, after the 2003 accusations. If the story was so important to get out, why was this book not written in the '90s? Another person attemtping to cash in on Jackson while the interest was high? And the book was poorly edited: 'manager' being spelled as 'manger', and Jackson being referred to as being 26 on September 5, 1985, when he was actually 27. There were more errors besides, which indicates to me that this book was not carefully edited.I believe the book was intended to be an apologia for Evan Chandler. If so, it failed. If anything I was left with a worse opinion of Evan Chandler than before I read the book."},{"Title":"All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up","review":"This book is nothing but a bunch of lies written by another Chandler money grubber looking to cash in on Michael Jackson. Chandler's own mother never believed Michael abused her son and her testimony in the 2005 trial only helped the defense (Michael). It came out at the trial that even though she was the custodial parent, she has not spoken to her son Jordan SINCE 1993 - the year of the settlement. She also testified that she told the DA in 1992 that Jordan's father said that Michael was a wonderful means for Jordie never having to worry again. By the way, when asked to describe Michael's genitals back then, Jordan Chandler described Michael as being circumcised, when he was in fact, NOT circumcised. Given what he \\"claimed\\" happened, he should have known. If you really want the truth, read Michael Jackson Conspiracy by Aphrodite Jones. This book was written by a correspondent covering the trial for Fox News' Bill O'Reilly. She went into the trial thinking Michael was guilty and came out realizing he was innocent because she sat in on the trial day in and day out and heard ALL of the witness testimony - including the Arvizos (the second accusers), George Lopez's, Jay Leno's, Macaulay Culkin's, Jordon Chandler's mother (the first accuser) and Martin Bashir's [(who made that twisted \\"documentary\\" that led to the initial investigation - by the way, YouTube - Take Two The Footage You Were Never Meant To See and see the real Michael. Bashir was just another money grubber out to make Michael look bad)]. Michael Jackson Conspiracy by Aphrodite Jones is based on what she personally witnessed in court and the court transcripts. It is mind blowing to say the least and proves Michael's innocence. It also proves that even though Michael was facing 60 years in prison, that Martin Bashir, whom Michael trusted to do fair documentary on him, refused to answer questions for the defense that could have helped Michael. All he had to do was answer the questions truthfully but he refused and kept asserting his right as a journalist not to answer. Not only was he willing to brand Michael a child molester - but when it got so far out of hand that it couldn't be stopped, Martin Bashir refused to help Michael by simply answering the defense questions honestly. The only victim in either case was Michael Jackson. Read Michael Jackson Conspiracy by Aphrodite Jones and learn the TRUTH. The love of money is truly the root of all evil."},{"Title":"All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up","review":"I purchased this book seeking the truth. What I got sounded more like the unibombers manifesto.It spends most of the book making Evan Chandler's excuses for his delusional behavior. It nitpicks at every remark while quoting peopel that had an axe to grind , fired employees mostly. What it does do is give a first hand report to the fact that Evan Chandler actually did plant false memories in his sons head during a dental procedure.I say if you are only interested in the ravings of a madman read it, but be sure you understand it for what it is. It is actually the confession of a father who sold his son out in an attempt to become rich.He even confesses that it took more thant an hour after the dental proceedure and the confession of lying about what he knew saying that he had the bedroom bugged to produce the desired effect of false memory. Jordan if you are out there please go to see a qualified professional to right this thing in you mind, it is the only way for you to find the peace of mind you need and become a whole person again."},{"Title":"All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up","review":"\\"All That Glitters\\" is an interesting story, but a lot of it is conjuncture and mostly speculation on the author's part. Keep in mind, the keyword is \\"story\\". Raymond Chandler admits that he had no contact with his brother (the father of the boy who made an allegation against Michael Jackson nearly 16 years ago), yet he has enough opinions and \\"facts\\" to fill up an entire book. What is questionable is even by the author's own account (and this is not a pro-Michael book) he shows how money-motivated and greedy his brother was. It was both perplexing and auspicious to read how supposedly the child's parent basically let his son do whatever he pleased and then cooked up the scheme to soak Michael Jackson out of funds. The author also details how the father was very interested to have Michael finance his screenplay which may explain why the father turned on him when it was never sold. Since the recent and tragic death of Michael Jackson reports have begun to circulate stating that Raymond Chandler's nephew denied all of the '93 allegations. I would like to know what the author thinks about this. The only thing this book proves is that Michael Jackson was too trusting as far as greedy and money-hungry people were concerned."},{"Title":"All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up","review":"I was just wondering if I could please have my money back.

I am bored of people writing crap about him all the time.I actually find it amusing that Jordy's own uncle had to go as far as to write a book against Michael Jackson just to make money. Leave Michael Jackson alone, he is innocent. People will do anything for money these days. Why don't we all just get together and write a big book of lies about Michael Jackson, sell it, and then sue the man himself for doing nothing, then we would all be rich! Raymond, using his own nephew's court case to get money is so low. Michael Jackson has been through enough already with his recent court case that was full of lies! His reputation has been degraded enough and does not need this little preppy book to make matters worse! I cannot believe this book is based on a court case that died out in 1993! People, you need to open your eyes, this book is full of lies and is not worth one penny. This book is just another anti-michael jackson book just to get money. Raymond Chandler should be ashamed of himself, trying to ruin the reputation of someone successful. When i saw this book i thought it was a joke! The money used to produce this book could have been used for charity, instead, it was used to waste paper and time. The only person i would recommend this book to would be Jay Leno because the jokes he would come up with about the book would be at the same level. Michael Jackson is a good person, leave him alone- what did he ever do to you? This book is disgusting as it demonstrates the length some people will go in order to get money. It's actually pretty funny, trying to make money by selling a fake story about Michael Jackson. Next, people will be saying that Michael Jackson molested his pet chimpanzee! i bet that will sell heaps! This book is just another anti-michael jackson book and will continue to go unnoticed like the others. I hope to never see the cover of this book again. Reviewing this book seems a waste of time as the book is a bunch of lies and is unjust. Shame on the Arvizo's, Diane Dimmond and the rest of that pack."},{"Title":"All That Glitters: The Crime and the Cover-Up","review":"This book,is, supposedly, written by Ray Chandler , brother to Evan , who initiated the accusations, eventually made against Michael Jackson, by his son Jordan .The books release date was timed to coincide with Michael Jackson's trial in 2005.Ray Chandler was all over television promoting his book and making his own accusations about having PROOF, of Jackson's guilt, at the time.I think it is an excellent read , AFTER you have researched the actual court documents , because this is the story of how the love of money , warped with greed, ambition , envy and revenge, can destroy so many peoples lives. even a decade apart..Since, Michael Jackson's death in 2009,the court transcripts from the related trial, in 2005,as well as the Chandler information have gone online and due to the Freedom of Information Act, the F.B.I. has released their files on Jackson, also. This information , now available to the general public,does NOT bode well , for the Chandlers .We see that the 2005 trial was essentially a new family,( Gavin Arvizo and family) using an old ruse, to shake down Michael Jackson ( in fact the Arvizos,continued to interact, with Jackson, as they visited civil lawyers , same as the Chandlers , and had their atty fees all worked out and signed and sealed for a pending lawsuit, all in place , same as the Chandlers,...before the police were ever called......same as the Chandlers.No surprise there , since they sought out the same lawyer, the Chandlers used .Larry Feldman..Same civil atty Larry Feldman working this deal,( Chandler/ Arvizo atty)Same psychologist Stanley Katz involved ( Chandler/Arvizo psychologist)Same ambitious, enabling , prosecutor Tom Sneddon at the helm,ignoring and /or burying exculpatory evidence regarding Jackson in favor of the accusing family, in the hopes of a show trial.( Chandler/Arvizo District Atty)And same seedy tabloid reporter Diane Dimond feeding the pigs ,(Chandler/Arvizo/ District Atty office mouthpiece)with a few other new names thrown in, like Martin Bashir .I should mention that the jurors said after trial , they actually wanted to SPIT ON BASHIR , they found him so deceitful..So,the 2005 trial DID NOT support the Chandlers accusations ,as Ray Chandler said it would on his many television appearances ,INSTEAD, it exposed their playbook , and indeed , the 1108 testimony, regarding old allegations , including the Chandler family , crashed and burned on cross examination , particularly, when June Chandler took the stand.14 NOT GUILTY VERDICTS, on trumped up charges , including no jail time misdemeanors and a note from the jury, saying they were confident in their verdicts.So much for Mr Chandlers predictions.However , the damage was done, and the bogus trial took its toll on Jackson's health , career and finances , just as it did with the Chandlers.We also see , thanks to the court transcripts that Ray Chandler . while lamenting the fact that his nephew would not testify in 2005 , neglected to tell the public , while pitching this book , that HE ALSO REFUSED to testify , because JACKSON'S side wanted him to come in.He HID behind the Ca shield law as a publisher, all the while pretending to be so self righteous, while mugging for the camera, and promoting his book.This is always worth repeating , because I think it speaks to the character of the author..The Chandler men, never will say anything under oath.Interestingly enough, while RAY Chandler is on tv with supposed proof of Jackson's guilt , the prosecutors DID NOT call him in , only Jackson's team did..Evan Chandler was NOT called in by the prosecutors either.Jordan refused to testify according to FBI files and said he would sue them if they tried to get him to come in.FIGHT it all the way..Ray Chandler said he left the country but there was photos out of him skiing in Utah, at the time of Jackson's trial ,seemingly having a wonderful time , with no worries whatsoever...Since, this is nearly 2013 , and we have more information available , on line,through court proceedings,we can access , the legal strategy for the Chandlers , which was to, refuse to go to criminal court , where they would have been subject to cross examination, and continually try these accusations through the TABLOID PRESS, which effected Jackson's endorsement deals , and brought more lawsuits for concert cancellations etc, to squeeze him into a fast settlement or be dragged through civil litigation, and depositions , for years , tying up his career..Indeed, the Arvizo family accusations, in 2003, ruined Jackson's album release, tied him up for years, and put him behind the eight ball,same as the Chandlers did.ALL THAT GLITTERS BY RAY CHANDLER is the blueprint for a story about a couple of selfish , fame hungry, divorced parents , trying to beat each other to the front of the line in Michael Jackson's life.Truth be told, neither one of them put their son's well being first,, they both continually used the boys admiration for MJ , and MJ need to try and belong to what he considered, a normal family , with people who cared about him for himself and not his money or fame, to try and remain in his life.Sadly, this is something that eluded him , his entire life, until he became a father himself..Frank Cascio , another person , who was around at this time, would say in his own book , that Jordan had told him his father, who had never had much time for him , until he became friendly with MJ and all his connections, was very jealous of MJ, and indeed, MJ was a mentor and father figure to many children..June Chandler , who initiated contact with MJ , and put MJ, on the spot, ,right in front of the boy , to please take their number and call him because he was such a huge fan,,,,,,,,,was trying to line up her next meal ticket in MJ as husband number three, inserting herself in his life, and inviting him to her home constantly for dinner and to help her child with his homework, so Jackson would feel a part of the family.It worked, because Michael truly did consider Mrs Chandler, and her two children, extended familyIn court in 2005 , she could recall trips she had made on private planes with MJ ,meeting celebrities ...ALL. the perks...BUT nothing much about their lawsuit from 93..,That, she HAD told MJ , times were tough for her , both financially and personally, and she had told MJ she was afraid she couldn't trust men in her life anymore , so naturally he made every effort to be there for her and both her children..,A very naive man , indeed, not to have seen through her....She also testified she never saw any untoward behavior..Evan Chandler didn't have as much finesse..It was attested to in court by June that Evan immediately was thrilled that his son had met Michael, because now he would be SET FOR LIFE !!Immediately started asking for MILLIONS and to have an addition put on his home at MJ expense.It would seem, Evan became angry ,when he realized, he was not going to be partners with Jackson in the 40 million dollar movie deals with Sony that MJ had, since, this would-be, screen writer, hated being a dentist and owed money , including 60 grand for child support ..He saw his new found meal ticket distancing himself too.And indeed, later MJ had told people that he was initially interested , but his business people didn't like the idea , and he believed his reneging on his initial interest , in screenplays , and avoiding Evan regarding his change in interest,was the catalyst, for these accusations...Actually , this was what Evans first negotiations were about, even before , he made the molestation accusations...Getting money for SCREENPLAYS..Evan Chandler had already started the wheels in motion , with civil attys , long before he made any accusations.This was all about a family who felt they had been exposed to the good life and felt a sense of entitlement from Jackson, and resented going back to their everyday lives..Once again , in hindsight from court documents , we find out that NONE of the Chandler men , would ever testify to ANY of these accusations in a court of law,.in 93 or 2005.THE CHANDLER MEN will NEVER say anything , under oath..Not just the son , BUT the supposedly irate father AND the Uncle, who wrote this book, AND hit every talk show promoting this book, but, at the same time, was fighting , tooth and nail to stay out of court,when MICHAEL JACKSON'S SIDE called him to testify to the very stuff he spoke so freely about with a camera in his face..This is a sad tale of the destruction of a family and Michael Jackson .....,but it had everything to do with greedy parents , who thought the end justified the means.Not surprised to hear the son, was almost killed ,OVER MONEY, in 2005 by his own father , who SUPPOSEDLY saved him from this predator , and secured him this generational wealth he has today, from that insurance settlement.( wasn't Michael Jackson's money , they got paid off with, it was an insurance policy......paid off in increments , almost as if you are paying off a refrigerator... )... ..Another interesting note is that , while Jackson died in June of 2009 , Evan blew his brains out in Nov of that year,It is reported that he had been very ill, but it is also true that the FBI files , which don't bode well for the Chandlers , since MJ is virtually cleared in every one of them, but DO show the lengths Jordan Chandler was willing to go to to stay out of court, were also COMING OUT ..and This is It was playing world wide in movie theaters ,..Michael didn't realize this would ever be shown , of course , but he certainly seemed to, genuinely, be a kind and gentle person in that documentary...I think that had just as much impact on him taking his own life at that time also..Jordan Chandler is reported to have hoped this thing would subside after his father died and was relieved , but frankly , I would think he should have been relieved ,in June, when his supposed abuser died , not when his father died..so I would guess , the person that really tormented this kids life was his own father, and indeed, no one even showed up to claim the mans body or his ashes..So much more information out there now , it is a shame this info wasn't shared by the media , because they were making money off salacious stories as well.I think everyone should check out the court transcripts and FBI files as well as the countless books now

I read it in my English class. I would recommend it to 6th graders and up. The book is a myth about a hero that doesn't think about himself as a great hero. He kills the retched monster, Grendel. Grendel kills people and eats them bones and everything. Beowulf hears about the horrid monster and goes and fights him. Beowulf doesn't use a sword. Beowulf grabs Grendel's arm and and doesn't let go. Grendel shakes and jerks his arm. Finaly Grendel's arm rips out of place. Grendels mother (whom is worse then Grendel) comes to avenge Grendels death. Beowulf speaks to her his ords so sharp they peirce her heart.

The blood and gory stuff made me like it less, it was a bit too gross in a few parts. Unferth's character was evil, but really disgusting! Beowulf annoyed me he was so perfect, (even with bad eyesight and strange looks) but was overall an OK character. Near the end, the book got slightly boring, and seemed as though it was a report instead of a story!The book is about the Danes, who are being tormented by an evil creature named 'Grendel.' He kills everything in his path! Beowulf, a Geat from Sweden, comes and helps the Danes. But, conquering Grendel takes up literally LESS than half the book. That fact got me a bit angry- that the entire 'theme' of the book (judging by the back cover)lasts not long at all...Oh well, over all, this is an average book. If I had a choice, and didn't HAVE to read it for English, I probably would get bored halfway through and throw it in my closet (no offense) only to try it again a couple of years later and probably nod off again, but it depends on what you like!"},{"Title":"Beowulf: A New Telling","review":"I don't really enjoy reading gory books, but this was an exception.

Trust me, you don't want to waste your time, or your monwy on this book."},{"Title":"Beowulf: A New Telling","review":"Robert Nye has rewritten the Beowulf saga into a nice little stand-alone fable, but it is so far from the original text that it is a disservice to new readers. Nye had his own idea of what the theme of Beowulf should be, but the original text does not support his theme, so Nye rewrote it until it did -- and then he crams the theme down the reader's throat as though it's the central point of the entire Beowulf saga. Nye's theme is that we should embrace our weaknesses and thereby make them our strengths (huh?), and he demonstrates this through Beowulf's nearsightedness and disproportionately short legs, neither of which are in the original text.Nye's liberties with the original include making the Dane warrior Unferth a villain -- in the original, Unferth is at first jealous of Beowulf's courage until he sees it first-hand, at which point his jealousy turns to respect, and Beowulf respects him in return. In Nye's version Unferth is a treacherous villain throughout -- for example, in the original it is Grendel's mother who kills the king's friend Esher, but in Nye's version Unferth stabs him in the back. According to Nye, Unferth is then killed by Grendel's mother; in the original Unferth gives Beowulf his own sword to fight Grendel's mother, and this is the scene where Unferth and Beowulf become friends. Nye took a great supporting character and turned him into a cardboard villain.I could go on listing ways in which Nye damages the saga, but I will instead cut to his most heinous crime -- Beowulf versus the dragon. In the original text, Beowulf gathers a band of his best warriors along with his friend Wiglaf to battle the dragon. When they see it, the warriors turn and run away in fear, and Beowulf attacks the dragon with only the loyal Wiglaf behind him. Beowulf succeeds at the cost of his own life, and dies at Wiglaf's side. In Nye's version, Beowulf is a part-time beekeeper, and he kills the dragon by having a bag of bees fly down its throat and sting it to death from the inside (I'm not making this up). There is no battle. Beowulf is never injured. Beowulf then simply dies on the mountain for no apparent reason other than his age.I bought this book to read to my kids, but there is no way I will ever read it to them. It is a very easy read -- Nye tells a lively little tale, and his idea of using bees to kill the dragon is smoothly set up throughout the story -- but the major points of this so-called &quot;new telling&quot; are all Nye's, and run counter to the themes in the original. Anyone who reads this and thinks they've read Beowulf is VERY sorely mistaken, and their mistake will be immediately obvious to anyone who is familiar with the original text."},{"Title":"Beowulf: A New Telling","review":"Rather than offering my own opinion of this book, I will give you a few brief quotations describing the major characters and allow you to decide for yourself if this book is worth reading. Author Robert Nye describes the character of Beowulf as \\"weak and sickly\\" in his youth and \\"below average size\\" as an adult. He also describes Beowulf as \\"short sighted.\\" He claims that Beowulf \\"admits to his weaknesses\\" and is \\"not given to boasting.\\" This begs the question: what Beowulf is Nye talking about? The real Beowulf, the one that we know from the epic 7th century poem, was none of these things. We are told that he was neither small nor weak, but rather he possessed the strength of 30 men (\\"thirty men's might in the grip of his hand\\").This is how he was able to overpower his adversary, the demon Grendel, when no other man could challenge Grendel. The original Beowulf boasted quite often. Apparently, Robert Nye has his own idea of how a \\"hero\\" should behave. Instead of arrogance in Beowulf we see humility when he says, \\"He was a better swimmer than I\\" in reference to his dramatic swimming race against Breca. The problem here is that Beowulf did not lose this race with Breca. He won! But Nye's Beowulf cannot be all-powerful and still be humble, meek and peace-loving. We know from the original story that Beowulf cut off Grendel's head after he was dead, so he could offer it to the Danes as a trophy. This action was apparently too harsh for Nye. Instead, he tells us that Beowulf cut off Grendel's head in self-defense after Grendel momentarily came back from the dead!The character of Unferth has also been dramatically altered. He is portrayed as both pathetic and evil, a drunkard full of contempt for Beowulf and his people. As such, his words carry no weight and he really serves no purpose in the story. The real Unferth was an insecure man, who was desperately afraid of Beowulf gaining more glory than him. But there is no evidence in the poem that he was evil or that he hated his own people.The depiction of Grendel's mother in this book is downright laughable. Nye tells us that she has \\"red lips\\" and \\"hanging breasts.\\" Furthermore, \\"she had eyes in her breasts.\\" We are never told why she needs eyes in her breasts, but I guess the author just liked this visual.Grendel's mother is also described as the \\"wife of Cain.\\" According to Nye, Cain had sex with Grendel's mother (an evil serpent) and the resulting offspring was the hideous creature Grendel. To someone unfamiliar with the poem, this might seem logical. But this is where Robert Nye really misses the point (or chooses to ignore the point). Grendel is a descendant of Cain - this much is true. But Grendel's evil nature did not arise because of a sinful union between Cain and his mother. Cain was already sinful after killing his brother and then being cast out by God. As a result, his offspring were evil and - over thousands of years - slowly became monstrous. This happened because Cain and his offspring were separated from God.It shouldn't be surprising, however, that Nye fails to address this point. As previous reviewers have already stated, Nye chooses to ignore the Christian basis of the poem. His Beowulf has no relationship with God. In the poem, we know that Beowulf draws strength and inspiration from God, and he thanks God for his successes in battle (\\"the deadly struggle at the start would have ended, if God had not watched over me\\") Instead, Nye tells us that \\"Beowulf's best weapon was himself. He put all his faith in that.\\" Beowulf believed in himself fully and therefore had no need for God - according to Mr. Nye. Let's not forget that this story is really about the battle between good and evil, Beowulf (God) versus Grendel (Satan). The poem tells us that Grendel came from Hell, and that he was an \\"enemy of God,\\" who \\"waged war against God.\\" Regarding Beowulf, the poem tells us that \\"Holy God has sent him to help our people.\\"If you choose to read this book you will notice that Mr. Nye wisely includes a disclaimer: \\"This is an interpretation, not a translation.\\" Perhaps this is how he justifies changing the original story to such an extent that the characters are unrecognizable. His book, therefore, is not an interpretation of the original story but an alteration of it. Instead of bringing honor to the poem, he dishonors it.There's nothing wrong with Mr. Nye writing a story about a humble, unimpressive man who manages to overcome his weaknesses. He just shouldn't have named him Beowulf."},{"Title":"Beowulf: A New Telling","review":"This is a particularly arresting retelling of one of the great seminal works of Western literature. In our Performance English Program (CRDG The University of Hawaii), we use it as an entry-level introduction to this classic at the 7th grade so that when students re-encounter the story in the more conventional translation by Burton Raffel at the 12th grade they are predisposed to enjoy it in spite of its considerably greater difficulty. Students have been known to ask if they could skip assemblies so they could continue our in-class oral reading of the Robert Nye version without interruption. Lively narration, wonderful characterizations, great imagery. This story lives"},{"Title":"Beowulf: A New Telling","review":"In many ways, this Beowulf is a lot of fun for kids. The writing is direct and clear (although there are plenty of vocabulary stretchers). The action is fun. Beowulf's heroism is unquestionable.But, I don't understand why one would publish a Beowulf retelling and stay just close enough to the original to be confusing (as opposed to John Gardner's wonderful Grendel, which told the story from the monster's perspective). The most disturbing divergence was making Unferth a petty bad guy in enamored of evil. In doing so, Nye sacrifices much of the nobility of the original.I don't know if there are other kid-friendly tellings of this story. But, I would look for one of those, first."},{"Title":"Beowulf: A New Telling","review":"This version of \\"Beowulf\\" should NOT be compared, at all, to the original text of \\"Beowulf\\". Students should not be taught that THIS story, as re-created by Robert Nye, is reflective of the \\"Beowulf\\" written about 1000 AD. The story developed and shared for hundreds of years is characterized by Christian concepts and ideals. This version, written by Robert Nye, reflects our societies overwhelming desire to rewrite history, de-Christianizing it as they go along. Robert Nye has replaced the Christian God of the original \\"Beowulf\\" with the mythological Viking god \\"Odin\\". The original \\"Beowulf\\" tale supports the historical significance that Christian beliefs and ideas had on the overall society of England and throughout Europe. Robert Nye has done a great injustice in adjusting an historical document to reflect his own convictions, or lack thereof."},{"Title":"Beowulf: A New Telling","review":"When I purchased this book I thought it would be more geared toward adults. However, its definately written in a language that aims for early teens. I think the story would be too scary for kids under 10 and anyone over 16 would find it childish. All in all though not a bad quick read."},{"Title":"Beowulf: A New Telling","review":"Beowulf, by Robert Nye is one of those books that really didn't appeal to me. In my opinion, it is a very exciting story that has been poorly written. For example, throughout the entire story, I didn't feel like the author put any effort into truly defining the characters. The way I interpreted it, the characters were either good or evil, and were never conflicted about what to do. That makes for very shallow reading. Beowulf was simply good. His character was too classically heroic for my taste. His characterization made the story seem like a fairy tale. In any form of storytelling, the teller usually adds some uncertainty in the characters to give the entire tale real meaning. For instance, I knew nothing about Beowulf, so the fact that he died just meant that I didn't have to read anymore. That generally isn't the sign of a book that has been greatly enjoyed. At the beginning of the book, the author has giving the readers a sort of genealogy rundown. That is not characterization! It doesn't really matter whom someone's mother or father is if they have no effect on the story! In my honest opinion, the piece of genealogical information gave better characterization than the whole tale put together. Unfortunately, those characters were not used, so the readers were not given something even slightly resembling character depth. Another gripe I have about this story is the gore. Normally I am not bothered by gory stories, but I find it very hard to read pointlessly bloody tales. The only thing the blood did for me was distract me from the lack of decent characters. Actually, if the blood had had some point, I would have probably loved the truly vivid imagery. This particular author seems to be very good at creating a scene, but lacks the ability to bring characters to life. I also thought that Grendel was a pointless addition to this story. All Grendel ever did was slaughter humans (there we get truly glorious, horrific imagery for the first time). And although it was a preamble to the rest of the story, I happen to think that that was the part I could actually consider somewhat akin to decent storytelling. The Grendel had no real motivation, true. But its profile was the closest thing to characterization anywhere in this story. But I continually found myself wondering why Grendel wasn't kept around longer, and why the author simply moved on to another piece of the story. Even if Grendel had to die at one point, I think that if the author had highlighted its part in the story more, the overall reading would be more pleasant. My ideal version of this book would have a more lengthy version of the battle with Grendel, and less of the creature's mother and the dragon. It isn't that the other two aren't major aspects in the story; it's just that, as I've said before, without characterization, their parts seemed pointless.During one part of this story, I was actually able to feel the full effect of decent storytelling. It was near the end, when Beowulf is combating the dragon. I liked how his own bees not only killed the dragon, but himself as well. For some reason, it seemed like a fitting end: a hero defeats one last opponent, but in the process is defeated by his own friends when they assist him. If all of the book held quality such as that, I think I would have truly enjoyed this tale. But alas, that is not the case, and I am left feeling indifferent to the entire story. Overall, I found it a slightly weak story to begin with; weakness that is only magnified with this particular author's style of writing. I am not aware if this \`new telling' corresponds with the original tale that was published a millennium ago, so I cannot truly judge the quality of the actual story. All I can judge is the telling of it, which I found quite unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Beowulf: A New Telling","review":"I used this book with my sixth grade class to explore our theme of ancient heroes. Nye's retelling kept my class totally entranced with Beowulf and his adventures. ALthough it does not follow the original it does introduce young students to the hero, and those students who were more enthralled read other versions. When Nye's retelling is compared with the orginal it opens up discussions...even for sixth graders!!"},{"Title":"Beowulf: A New Telling","review":"I love this book!!

The advantage of the book was that it was shortened and the reader does not have to sit through 300 pages of idle and boring conversation. Nye does an excellent job in shortening the renowned tale, and still keeping the magic of it.Grendel ,a beastly 'thing', is terrorizing the a king's court, and anyone who fights him using brute strength, is immediately gobbled up, but young and wise Beowulf comes to the kings court without a sword. The protagonist, Beowulf, believes that he can kill the monster by using his good. Everyone in the kings court is doubtful, and suggests that Beowulf should leave, but his determination, and confidence drives him to stay. In the night Grendel sneaks into the kingdom only to meet Beowulf face to face. Beowulf quickly grabs Grendel, and his good drains the beast of his powers, forcing him to retreat. Beowulf faces many more challenges, such as Grendel's mother, and a Fire Drake, but uses his seemingly invincible good power to kill them all.The book is entertaining and I was able to finish it without taking my eyes off the novel, but the downside, the reason it was not a five star book, is that it became repetitive, when Beowulf received no real challenge, and always was able to use his good to vanquish any evil."},{"Title":"Beowulf: A New Telling","review":"Beowulf: A New Telling is great.

This books is very interesting and exciting for most of the book. It is like a roller coaster of thrill. You're on the edge of your seat all the time. I would give it 4 stars out of 5 because it has a couple flaws. For one it seems on the cover of the book and the review on the back the whole book would be about Beowulf fighting Grendel, but that is only half of the book. Also it gets pretty dry and dull at the end. It seems that the author started using less and less detail at the end of the book. Other than that I say this is a great book and recommend it to anyone who wants to read a great book."},{"Title":"Beowulf: A New Telling","review":"The story of Troy, Alexander the Great, or the Illiad has nothing on the story of Beowulf. It has been retold by Robert Nye so that children can grasp it.

Beowulf is a young man that goes to Denmark to defeat a horrible, wretched creature known to eat men alive.

Beowulf refuses and tells the man that he is there to fight the creature, \\"Grendel.\\" The man finally accepts Beowulf's offer and takes him to the king who lives in the grand hall he built for himself. Hrothgar, the king, wonders why Beowulf thinks he can stand up to a monster with such power. Beowulf simply says, \\"I have something that those other men didn't have.\\" Read the book to find out what happens!I liked the book mostly because of the way the author described the gory deaths of all the men that faced Grendel. Other than that, the book was very boring and very repetetive. After Beowulf defeated Grendel, you thought the book would come to a closing, but it just kept on winding on with two other creatures that he defeats.I liked the book mainly because of the descriptive deaths of the soldiers. \\"The hall was a confusion of swords and blood, the brave lords hurling themselves at Grendel, and the fiend snatching them up in his claws and snapping their backs as if they were no more than toys.

I recommend this book to all people who like a good book."},{"Title":"Beowulf: A New Telling","review":"Reading this book opened up an entire new set of ideas for me. Here's the deal. On the surface Beowolf sounds like an outrageous story where the hero does things that obviously no real man could do. For example he dives under water and comes back up 8 hours later. It is easy to dismiss this as a fairy tale.Robert Nye, however, tweaks the story some and in the process gives some interesting hints about what is really going on. What if this story told what was made to appear to happen? What if there was a conspiracy to make things appear to happen when in fact what was really going on was a scam, a sting, a rip-off? A kind of ancient version of the various \\"great robbery\\" movies?Look at it this way. When you go to see a magic show you know that you are being tricked and you try to figure out how the tricks are done. If you wrote down what you saw on stage, you might write, \\"then he sawed the lady in half, moved her head and feet around away from each other, and then put her back together and she was unharmed!\\"One can look at Beowolf the same way and it makes sense! Just suppose certain people are in on it with Beowolf. Only his men, plus Unferth, are present when he \\"fights Grendel\\". Unferth's aggressive behavior with Beowolf \\"forces\\" Beowolf to tell an outrageous story about swimming for 5 days and makes sure that no one would think that Beowolf and Unferth could be in on anything together. No one sees him fight Grendel's mother and, again only his men see him emerge from the water. And only his men see him fight the Dragon, which they then throw in the ocean so no one could see the body. Could you imagine trophy hunters in Africa throwing the body away before anyone had sen it? NO!! They would want everyone to see the huge thing they killed.In this sense the story of Beowolf is like a big insiders joke. Like, \\"Look at the way we fooled these yokels!\\" \\"Look at how much can be accomplished by tricking people!\\"Interestingly he always has 12 men and one man always dies when a \\"monster\\" is killed. Is this some kind of secret society human sacrifice stuff?The payoff? The King gives Beowolf a huge treasure, \\"all\\" of which Beowolf then gives to his own king. (Or does he?) Later Beowolf gets to be king and no other tribe will attack the land governed by this \\"mighty warrior\\".I love this book. Robert Nye deserves a lot of credit for writing a young person's book with depth that challenges adults. Fairy tales will never be the same for you after this.

It is very easy to follow with the way that it is retold."},{"Title":"Beowulf: A New Telling","review":"[note: this is a review of the poem generally, not this particular translation]Beowulf is one of those Medieval works of literature that many have heard about but few have read. However, it's worth reading, if only to experience a story so different from modern sensibilities. The poem extols Beowulf's physical courage and bravery against monsters and dragons. It's an odd mix of early Christian and warrior ethos. Beowulf is not a modern hero. There's not much to recommend him to modern readers - he's boastful, relies on brawn not brains, and his search for glory ends up putting his kingdom at risk. Still, it's fascinating to read this type of story and realize how far away it is from our own times.Because this is a translation of an Anglo-Saxon poem, it's worth saying a word about the text itself. It's readable, but isn't smooth reading for the uninitiated. I'd say this - if you don't like reading English-language poetry, you probably won't enjoy reading this poem. If you do make the effort, I'd recommend really making the effort. Go slow and make sure you understand the story.

I am sorry that it is so hard to find in regular bookstores, because my kids always want to go get a copy for themselves.

I would sugjest this book to 11 year old and up for the concern of some grusome scense. it is only 94 pages, a good lengh for a bed-side book. by the way-beowulf is the guy on the horse not the monster on the cover :)"},{"Title":"Beowulf: A New Telling","review":"The story Beowulf should be like a role model for other books. This books is very interesting and exciting for most of the book. It is like a roller coaster of thrill. You're on the edge of your seat all the time. I would give it 4 stars out of 5 because it has a couple flaws. For one it seems on the cover of the book and the review on the back the whole book would be about Beowulf fighting Grendel, but that is only half of the book. Also it gets pretty dry and dull at the end. It seems that the author started using less and less detail at the end of the book. Other than that I say this is a great book and recommend it to anyone who wants to read a great book."},{"Title":"Beowulf: A New Telling","review":"I came across this little book some years ago and it spurred me to an avid interest in the Beowulf saga.First off, I must admit that this story has MAJOR revisions from the original manuscript version which is about one thousand years old and written in old English. Like a Hollywood movie \\"based on a true story\\", Mr Nye made many changes to the story.What I really liked about this story, however, is that the author has Beowulf admit that there is deception in what is being told to people. In my opinion this idea of deception is the key to understanding the original Beowulf saga. Consider...-Every battle Beowulf has is hidden from plain sight. We have only his version of events to go by.-\\"Grip strength of 30 men\\" is impossible to measure, unless we are referring to Masonic type secret grips which carry insider status power.-Unferth's confrontation served as a perfect opportunity for Beowulf to claim modesty yet brag about himself endlessly. Beowulf tells a verbal proof story about killing sea monsters that sets up the idea of him having super-human swimming powers.-After Beowulf's King is killed, and everyone but Beowulf slaughtered, Beowulf shows up on the beach back home with 30 sets of armour and a tale about killing that many of the enemy before swimming back home with the loot. Hmmm...There are many more points I could list, but I leave the rest for you, dear reader, to discover..."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome and Other Short Fiction (Bantam Classic)","review":"So depressing. It's snowing again.....cold, melancholy......a suicide attempt that is a plan to end up in heaven as angels, turns into a disabled lifetime."},{"Title":"Ethan Frome and Other Short Fiction (Bantam Classic)","review":"I believe that this book could be classified as one of those stories that you are glad you took the time to read after you finish it, but getting to that final stage of completion is more of a task than it may seem.Surprisingly, this is one of the few short stories (90 some pages) that I have ever read, that seemed to droan on for a good half of the time. Never the less, there were some profound moments in the story in which I felt I had been given some truly great moments in literature. My only qualm was that it needed to be about half (or cut it down by a fair 20 pgs) so the reader would not loose so much interest. Do remember though, it is only 90 pages long, so it is not one of the more monotonous scripts out there."},{"Title":"Political Leadership: A Source Book (Pitt Series in Policy and Institutional Studies)","review":"Barbara Kellerman gives us yet another great compilation on political leadership. This book is very comprehensive, covering almost every aspect on political leadership.

Insightful, full of good information. I recommend this book to all new and experienced users that don't already have it.

An absolute must for all Mac users."},{"Title":"Macintosh Bible, The (8th Edition)","review":"A great reference and entertaining read for any Mac user, from beginner to advanced. I'm a voracious reader of books about Mac hardware and software, and I still picked up some great tips and insights. Best of all, the book is written in a lively, friendly style. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Macintosh Bible, The (8th Edition)","review":"The Macintosh Bible series has been excellent, but this edition is wonderful. So much so that I had to buy a 2nd copy; it's heavy to take to work every day and then home every night. But the detail is what even experienced Mac users need to deal with almost every relevant topic, day after day.Virtually all facets of Macintosh operation are covered sufficiently to overcome some of the (alas) now-expected roadblocks even in my favorite computers; for example, Ms. Aker and I agree that when it comes to providing a trustworthy, loyal, helpful, accurate, obedient, friendly, and kind installer for a new operating system, the folks at Apple Computer have, as is the nicest way to put it, have made progress, but there's lots of room for growth. She ably steers you around the icebergs.The book is quite thorough for people using up to Mac OS 8.0 or 8.1; also, there's more on OS 8.5 than I'd have expected, given the publication date. Many thanks to Apple for assisting this, providing enough material on the newer OS to let her deal effectively with it.This book is not only elegant in terms of describing the use of an excellent computer; it is also written beautifully. If the author had shown it to our former College English Composition Board, she'd have scored at an enviable level. Making technically complex procedures easy is very difficult, but she succeeds admirably.The jokes, brief historical anecdotes, and other details make it a pleasure to read and use. It sets a standard, in my opinion, not only for the present present but for the future."},{"Title":"Macintosh Bible, The (8th Edition)","review":"The strengths of this book are the tips to getting yourself out of trouble.

The title of this book descibes its content. Sharon Aker is an excellent author. The book is easy to follow, covers 'every' topics , and ...its just great!. Its a great reference book: a must have !. Apple should commission Sharon Aker to write more books on its hardware and software ( how about an upto date and thorough Applescript book for starters)."},{"Title":"Macintosh Bible, The (8th Edition)","review":"I have to admit, from the outset, that I am not a Mac person. I am a PC tech trying to service one of the only Mac's I will probably work on this year. I have a copy of the Mac Bible. It is huge! That's not bad if it is useful. The problem I am having is finding what I need while I have to wade through the barrels of verbage that are useless to me. I finally had to resort to scouring the Web to find my answers. I guess I'm used to the more direct, almost cookbook approach to troubleshooting and setup. To be fair, and thats why I gave the book two stars instead of one, I realize that the different chapters are written by different authors, so the content and style will vary. Unfortunately for me the sections I needed were written by authors I would rather not consult in the future."},{"Title":"Macintosh Bible, The (8th Edition)","review":"its a good book, if you are reading this review, skip the first chapter.

It brings out the Mac's potential in a way that gave me new appreciation for its elegance and simplicity. In an enjoyable--albeit hokey--style, the author not only presents the information about hardware and software that it is expected she give, but often does the MacIntosh user's work for him. In the section on the software application QuicKeys, for instance, the are several pages of useful suggestions as to what keys the reader should assign to various tasks when using that program. That is amazing, that is not even the book's main task and it is more nuts-and-bolts, time-saving information than the very manufacturer of Quickeys supplies with their own software. The same is true in the section on how to set up an Apple menu. I just followed every suggestion the author made; it saved me time, works like a charm, and I'd never have come up with that stuff on my own. It's even a fun book (for Macheads) to just jump around in in one's free time; such browsing will almost always yield new knowledge or a useful trick or shortcut. I doubt that Windows users have this much fun learning about their OS, and I doubt that Windows could yield a book that makes such integrated sense as this one.I only have one annoyances with this book. First, the author fudges and glosses over real explanations of some of the more difficult concepts such as Apple Script and memory. It's as if she's so determined to make the book all-inclusive that she settles for doing a less than satisfactory job with advanced material that she'd have been within her rights to simply leave out of the book. In these instances, she seems to lift a lot of information out of the Mac OS's documentation, and fails to supplement those often spotty explanations. No one is going to understand how to use Applescript by reading her account of it. Also, the book supposedly comes with an interactive, &quot;readers only&quot; website, with the password to that website hidden somewhere in the pages of the book. It's so well hidden that I've had the book for 9 months and still not found it.All in all, indispensable, and I'll be buying the OS 9 version when it comes out."},{"Title":"Macintosh Bible, The (8th Edition)","review":"I have been using macs for about ten years and had read earlier editions of the mac bible and loved them. But after becoming an old mac hand (ignorance is bliss!) I had stopped feeling the need for newer editions of the mac bible. But last week my mother bought her first ever computer, a really sweet G3 Powerbook, and in preparation for flying across the country to tutor her I went shopping for some reference books to give us a hand. I bought the Mac Bible, the Mac OS 8.5 Black Book, and the Microsoft Office 98 Visual Basic Book. The Mac Bible is far and away the most helpful of the bunch. Easiest to read, most in depth and with valuable opinions, real life applications and a sense of humor. In fact I decided to return the Black Book and buy a Mac Bible for myself to take home."},{"Title":"Macintosh Bible, The (8th Edition)","review":"I got my first Mac ever about a year and a half ago, being a PC person before that. Being a book fanatic, I used this Mac purchase as an excuse to go out and buy lots of Mac books! The Mac Bible was one of the first I bought. It still remains the book I consult most often.I found it had an absolutely fabulous &quot;history of Mac&quot; section, so I was able to catch up on all the Macs through history. I was keenly interested in that, and still am. I love to read about the old LCs, and such. (Yes, I'm a pathetic geek.)But there's more to that to this book. Just lots of explanations on OS features, different kinds of problems you'll encounter, and some of the best software to use on a Mac. It has a great index, so you can find the information you need quickly. I have it by my Mac at all times. What would I do without it?I can't explain it - this book has EVERYTHING. I read it eagerly (I even had it before I got my Mac! I ordered the Mac, and read this book while waiting for it to arrive.) This book helped me adjust to the world of Mac-dom very quickly. And now, a year and a half after my first Mac, I am a full-fledged Machead, thanks in part to this book."},{"Title":"Macintosh Bible, The (8th Edition)","review":"Excellent book! Well written and superbly done. This book takes you from the very beginning user all the way through to being able to find problems. The most helpful areas are the ideas and links to products. Great tips and shortcut ideas. Super for both the beginner and the expert. A must have for anyone who plans on using the MAC. Easy to read and follow, this book is not &quot;boring&quot; like so many computer books. I would recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"Macintosh Bible, The (8th Edition)","review":"There are four major parts to this book:. Looking at the Mac, which talks about the Mac in general from an overview of the operating system to storage systems and printing.. Getting Productive which walks about common business and personal applications like word processing, databases and spreadsheets.. Getting Creative, all about graphics, web design and HTML, after all, the Mac is reknown for its capabilities in the graphical area.. Extending your Reach, reaching out for the internet, for networks and even working with Windows machines. This part also has a chapter 'Switching to the Mac from Windows.'In a bit over a thousand pages the authors have room to cover nearly every aspect of working with a Mac. This book covers the standard everyday tasks that you're likely to do on a Mac. From here, of course you can go on to more specialized programs if that's where your job lies. For instance in the graphics area, iPhoto, which is supplied with all new Macs is covered. But if you're a graphics professional you probably want some more professional. And the book talks about the professional level packages such as Adobe Illustrator & Photoshop, ACD Systems Canvas, Macromedia FreeHand, Corel Painter, and others. It doesn't cover these in detail, but at least talks enough about them to get you started on deciding which is best for your needs.This book is, as the title says, the Bible of the Mac. It doesn't contain everything there is to know about the Mac (if it did you couldn't lift it) but it certainly contains enough to get you well started."},{"Title":"Macintosh Bible, The (8th Edition)","review":"I recently had an excellent opportunity to try out this book as I made the switch from the PC to a new 15&quot; PowerBook G4. This is the type of book that very few people probably read from cover to cover. Rather they would read it as a resource book when they are having troubles or questions. As I made the change from one OS to another I found myself going to the book eleven times. Two of those times the book didn't answer my questions. But for the most part I learned what I needed to know each time.If you are about to make a switch or are having issues with your Mac I would recommend this book to you."},{"Title":"Macintosh Bible, The (8th Edition)","review":"Whether you're a beginner or an expert, you're sure to find dozens of useful tips and insights.

Particular mention is Chapter 9: \\"Why Was Paul Killed? The Epistle to the Romans as a Document of Resistance\\". To look at the Epistle as a document of resistance against the Roman Empire of the first century (C.E.) allows one to see Early Christianity from a different perspective, and the difference it can make in the urban context under the present U.S. Empire. Pick it up! You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Ai Yori Aoshi: v. 8","review":"There's something about the lovely young ladies of Ai Yori Aoshi that tugs at the heart strings. Each has their own distinctive personality; so much so that they are basically graphic representations of literary archetypes themselves.The eighth volume of the series is pretty much more of the same that readers have come to expect of Kaoru's possible love interests. Several stories revolve around Chika-chan's innocent infatuation (and her talent at extremely cute, chibi-plushies) and her eventual move to the mansion. There are also a few chapters dealing with Aoi and Kaoru exclusively. It was especially touching to see him subtly introduce Aoi to his Mother in a scene that has been played out just as well in other grand romantic series (Maison Ikkoku comes to mind).All in all, volume eight pleases in the various aspects it encompasses (cuteness, fanservice, romance, drama, comedy, etc.)."},{"Title":"Ai Yori Aoshi: v. 8","review":"As sexual tensions increase between Aoi and Kaoru, their emotional intimacy does likewise. Kaoru finally opens up to her about his mother and the fact that he no longer knows whether his memories of her are reality or idealism. Kaoru's upcoming graduate school entrance exam is raising the anxiety level in the household, and all the girls seem to have their own special formula to give him good luck. Chika, Taeko's spunky cousin, shows up on the doorstep of the mansion and declares that she's moving in!Ai Yori Aoshi is not a book to look for plot in. As I'm reading Volume 8 I sometimes question whether or not to continue the series. If it had outstanding characters, it would make up for the lack of events. I guess the reason why I keep reading is just the \\"mood\\" of the work. A mood which you could probably define as \\"sweetness and light\\". It's a love story and so it's more concerned with emotions and the displays of affection than leading the characters to revelations about the universe. But the lack of story progression in the past several volumes has led to a very repetitive manga. One that is still worth reading, at least, until you tire of it.I would also recommend the manga Aria, another manga more concerned with mood than storytelling."},{"Title":"The Saint of the Wilderness: a Biographical Novel on the Life of Robert Sayers Sheffey","review":"This book is excellent!

But nowhere was it more glorious than on the front page of The Eagle, a weekly British boys' paper, in Frank Hampson's visionary comic serial, Dan Dare. The Eagle was published from 1950 through 1969 by the Christian Publicity Society and Hampson also drew a never-rivaled story comic of the life of Jesus of Nazareth called \\"The Road of Courage.\\" As he says in an interview in this volume, Hampson wasn't religious, but he felt that \\"young people were getting a rough deal in those years so soon after the end of the war...I wanted to give them something that made the future more hopeful, in human terms.\\"Hampson gave unstintingly, creating one of the most visually arresting comics ever, until the Eagle was taken over by corporate raiders, and the job fell to his friend, an equally fine artist, Frank Bellamy. As with Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers, Dan Dare spun off numerous toys highly valued by collectors (Young, Duin and Richardson devote an entire chapter to Dan Dare in their book, Blast Off!: Rockets, Robots, Ray Guns, and Rarities from the Golden Age of Space Toys, Dark Horse Books), and in its heyday, 60,000 junior spacemen pledged their loyalty in the Eagle Club.Titan Books, UK, has launched an ambitious publishing project to reprint all the color, two-page Dan Dare cliff-hanger strips in beautiful 9\\" X 12\\" hard cover, coffee table hardbacks. \\"The Red Moon Mystery\\" was the second Eagle serial, after \\"Pilot of the Future,\\" and was originally published from vol. 2 #26 - vol. 3 #11 of the Eagle. As comic artist Cliff Claremont (X-Men) writes in the introduction, the weekly arrival of Dan Dare was one of the few things to lighten the gloom and doom of post-war Britain. As such, many now- grown fans will welcome his return. Amazon's low price makes Dan Dare the gift book of the year, and a new generation may find themselves captivated by Hampson's visions of the future."},{"Title":"Essential Sacred Writings From Around the World","review":"Mircea Eliade, the former professor from the University of Chicago, who was well known for his research on Shamanism, selected some of the basic sources from various traditions to present a solid introduction into the world's sacred writings. The book is not meant to be exhaustive, nor does it include any commentary by the great scholar - rather it is a resource of texts to enable research, study or simply the casual reading of these non-Western traditions. Eliade initially compiled this work to be used in his classes. A good source for students of philosophy and anthropology."},{"Title":"Essential Sacred Writings From Around the World","review":"Not exhaustive by any means, but if you are looking to read sacred texts from many different religions, then this is a fabulous overview. A little from here, a little from there...it can help to give a person a general idea of what was taught and help a reader to know what they may be interested in looking into further. This book is sizable too, you get your money's worth without a doubt."},{"Title":"After the War","review":"I actually bought this book before I bought the more superior &quot;A Southern Exposure&quot;. &quot;After the War&quot; is the sequel.&quot;After the War&quot; was too pat. The precocious Abby got really boring. She hooked up with a man and was on the way to getting married and leading a predictable life. She would have her own career but so what? I think she would have been more interesting single and on her own for a couple of years, traveling the world and learning about life.As in &quot;Exposure&quot;, Cynthia Baird continued to be flighty and confused most of the time. Miraculously, she was accepted to law school. Maybe she was the precursor to Ally McBeal. I don't know. She has the nerve to complain about her husband's affair ad nauseum when she was busy having her own affair(s).The gay rights movement has changed the way authors portray gay characters. Thirty years ago, the gay character would be a sad lonely man. In our thankfully more enlightened time, the gay character finds love, pretty quickly, but unfortunately this results in there being little conflict. Adams portrays the lesbian character in Superior Women quite differently - and more effectively.In any case, sequels are rarely as good as the original, so read this but also peruse &quot;A Southern Exposure.&quot;"},{"Title":"After the War","review":"After the War is a beautiful finale to the wonderful writing career of Alice Adams. In typical Alice Adams style, this novel follows the life of her main character, Cynthia Baird, and also weaves itself around the lives of other characters important to Cynthia.

Fans of Alice Adams MUST read this book!"},{"Title":"After the War","review":"First of all, I have to say Alice Adams is (was, alas) one of my favorite writers. Of short stories. Not novels. I was thrilled to have won a short story competition to be in one of her workshops. To me, almost all of her stories are perfect. I can read them over and over. Her novels, however, are a different story. Rich Rewards has its rewards and there is something intriguing about Second Chances. But all the others left me disappointed. A disaster. Which is how I saw \\"After the War\\" from page one. Ridiculous characters. A mess.

This combined with the story of Claire, a young woman who struggles with life in New York, should have made this book into a treat. However the author, which no doubt has a lot of Latin knowledge - did not deliver. The dish that came out is tedious and didactic.I assume that Lori Marie Carlson is very educated with the matter of Latin culture - and definitely has a vast knowledge about food, music and poetry. I also assume she chose this book as a means to enrich the reader with her wisdom. It is clear that a lot of research was done before writing this book; however the book does not rise above its didactic informative descriptions that seem to lead nowhere.Claire meets her Latin friends to a monthly feast called \\"Tertulia\\" which is described as a \\"gathering of confidants who share poetic musings, secret sorrows and savory treats\\". Each chapter in the book is dedicated to one such meeting while in between we read something about Claire's life - but this serves only as a smooth passage to the \\"Tertulia\\" and its different monthly subject.The main part of the book is dedicated to the different views, the diverse ways to translate life as experienced by the participants of the Tertulia: Sonia, Luna, Isabela, Pearl, Aroma, Winifred. Each one with her own philosophy. I cannot say that these women are not wise. They do have fine things to say and some of their stories can be interesting but all in all, the entire story does not get anywhere and the conversation between the women is wearisome and slow. I cannot believe that this is a true account of the way people speak. I have been in many women gatherings where one issue leads to another and a topic can be discussed with a lot of laughter and tears - but no informal conversation I have joined was ever held in a form of lecture where every woman says what she has to say in a sort of speech and then shuts up. At least, this does not happen with the women I know.The book does not allow any real development of characters - not Claire, whom the other women wish so much to \\"educate\\" and not any one of the other wiser women. The reader does not really care what happens to them next or what they have to say."},{"Title":"The Sunday Tertulia: A Novel","review":"Advice takes center stage in this story of a young New York career woman who finds companionship and support with a group of older Latin American ladies. And, as the author traces the deepening relationship growing among this unique sisterhood, readers are reminded of the rich mix of cultures in our country and the fact that human emotions know no borders. Claire came to Manhattan shortly after college because she sensed &quot;the possibility of speeding toward something powerful.&quot; &quot;I sought adventure, exploration&quot; she says. &quot;New York beckoned with its endless avenues, chance encounters, and whirlwind of people and ideas.&quot; She found that and more - she found Isabella, a wise Latina who invited the younger woman to her apartment on Sunday afternoons where she hosted &quot;festive tertulias,&quot; happy blends of conversation and lunch. To her delight and edification Claire found that the food was always good, and the company even better as topics of conversation covered the gamut from marriage to motherhood, from courage to fear, and from relaxation to work. She is befriended by Aroma, &quot;a world traveler who happens to be an excellent gynecologist and Mexican down to her purple-polished toenails&quot; and &quot;the brainy Sonia, an Argentine by birth, who never fails to entertain us with her encyclopedic knowledge of literature and history, whether or not we want to hear it.&quot; Other group members are Luna, a Peruvian chef, whose &quot;meat turnovers are remarkably succulent because she always adds a jigger of pisco liquor to the filling,&quot; Pearl, a Bolivian American painter, and Winifred, &quot;an elegant landscape architect from Chile.&quot; Sunday afternoons are laced with recitals of cherished Latin American customs, nuggets of history, smile-provoking anecdotes, and sometimes contradictory sermonettes. Through it all Claire is exposed to ideas she might never have encountered and enabled to see her struggles, problems, and successes through a greater looking glass. A bilingual Spanish/English writer and translator and married to the esteemed novelist Oscar Hijuelos, Lori Marie Carlson has penned an unassuming yet touching debut, a languid tale highlighted by the magic of words and the power of ideas."},{"Title":"The Sunday Tertulia: A Novel","review":"During the time I lived in Spain, I remember vividly tuning into the tertulias that were on every day, often featuring famous writers like Cela or Marquez commenting on issues of the day. I marveled over the fact that unlike in our American talk shows, they actually ate food, had coffee, and really got into their conversations in an in-depth manner.Thus it was with much anticipation that I picked up this book which features a group of woman who meet in a tertulia fashion to discuss everything from beauty and dating to betrayal and loss. Our narrator is the only non-Latina, but she fits right in since she speaks Spanish and relates to the culture. The others hail from various professional fields. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I was slightly disappointed. I never felt that I learned enough about any one person to care that much about what happened to her. Therefore, I found myself feeling somewhat detached even through various tales of illness and infidelity. The narrative is a bit scattered and doesn't hold together at times. There is very little in the way of real character development. A good first novel with some promising scenes."},{"Title":"The Sunday Tertulia: A Novel","review":"Because, like the author, I also have a degree in Spanish literature, I was thrilled at the prospect of the cozy revelations the title of this book promised. The tertulia is a delightful hispanic custom, and this book appeared to promise a good read providing women's wisdom with a Latin perspective. Perhaps what hobbled this book and led to its disappointing delivery was its forma, which read like dull notes taken by a stenographer who, when later going back to transcribe and summarize the proceedings of the meetings, interjected her own shallow reflections and intrusive didactic comments. The characters accordingly never came to life -- they remained flat and one-dimensional. We never really got to know them any more than we'd get to know the attendees of a board meeting by their names and summarized viewpoints in meeting notes. For all the promise the title of this book hinted, its lack of dimension and character development made it a tedious concoction that falls flat and fails to instruct or inspire. It never manages to convey the spirit of a real life tertulia where real blood and guts women share amongst themselves the vicissitudes of real life."},{"Title":"The Sunday Tertulia: A Novel","review":"I had read a positive review of this book and, as a Hispanic woman, I was excited to see a subject close to my heart treated in a novel. However, pages into The Sunday Terulia, I was sadly disappointed by the style and content of the book. While I feel the idea of capturing a conversation, especially one ongoing over many years struck me as original and exciting, the author does a poor job of rendering the story believable. Much of the dialogue between the friends seems forced and trite and not at all the way I remember the kitchen table conversations of my mother, grandmother and aunts, as I was growing up in South Texas. Moreover, the narrorator asks the reader to accept her own assertions without giving us reason. For example, the narrorator mentions and over how intelligent these women are without demonstrating it through the dialogue. The author comes closest to authenticity when the characters tell stories from their own lives but even those are somewhat strained-- one of the women always shimes in with a recollection of a friend or a friend of a friend who had a similar experience. The only two stories that seemed to &quot;work&quot; were the personal ones of poverty and marital infedelity shared by two of the women. I have experienced the connectedness, comeraderie and closeness of female friendships. I have walked away from such gatherings feeling that I had participated in something mystical and miraculous (with a small &quot;m&quot;). With that in mind, I was sadly disappointed by Ms. Carlson's novel."},{"Title":"The Sunday Tertulia: A Novel","review":"This novel was a huge disappointment. The idea--of mostly Latino women coming together to discuss the vicissitudes of life--is original, but the novel just sputters along. Part of the problem is that the dialogue is reduced to idle chatter and the narrator remains aloof and--do I dare say it--boring. The reader never gets a sense of how the advice of the Latino women influences her life in any deep way. The writing, also, is a disappointment: flat and uninspired."},{"Title":"The Sunday Tertulia: A Novel","review":"I would love to spend a Sunday afternoon with Claire and her passionate and intelligent friends.

The idea for this book had so much potential, but the novel just doesn't work. It's hard to believe or get into the voice of the narrator, Claire, an adult young woman character because she comes off girlish, shallow, and wholly boring, and the Latina characters were just too superficially written to retain my interest and were unbelievable because they lacked depth and human oddities and characteristics that make characters in literature so memorable. The women either come off too saintly to believe or stereotypical. The concept for the novel was great, but the writer fails because this novel doesn't have ironies, interesting drama, complex personality contradictions within the characters, a fresh or provocative writing style, believable epiphanies, or any treats the reader can take away with her/him."},{"Title":"The Sunday Tertulia: A Novel","review":"I was soooo looking forward to reading this book but it just didn't do it for me.

It's 128 pages; most pages are one or two photos and a paragraph narrating each one. It's a fun read filled with \\"Huh! I didn't know that!\\" moments, and references to things both remembered and forgotten.I already owned an original of this book, signed by Professor O'Malley (whose class I enjoyed tremendously). It was promoted through an alumni mailer in 2000.... just after the sad demise of Bradford. When some of us started up a Bradford Class of 1978 page on Facebook, I shared a link which everyone enjoyed. For kicks I ordered a new copy here, which Amazon let me do with the proviso, \\"We'll notify you via e-mail when we have an estimated delivery date for this item.\\" Three weeks later I have it in my hands, identical to the original except for a slightly updated masthead. So now there's a new print run and you can buy one for your own bookshelf.I also bought a used copy of the original Bradford: A New England School (amazon.com/gp/product/B0007EPWPW), which is a more academic treatment but interesting in its own right, especially in the context of contemporary events that are part of history.As Pat O'Malley signed my copy, \\"Remember!\\"Arthur FontaineClass of 1978 (AA)"},{"Title":"The Ninth Karmapa's Ocean of Definitive Meaning","review":"This is a very fine book on Mahamudra.

I have read several of Thrangu Rinpoche's works (e.g. Pointing Out the Dharmakaya and Essentials of Mahamudra) and they are all high quality works. If you want to read a book on Mahamudra, it's hard to beat him in quality, readability, sensitivity, etc. If someone asked me to recommend a Mahamudra author, it would be him. Interestingly, he has also authored (published in 2004) another book on the same text entitled: \\"The Ocean of Ultimate Meaning\\" which I have not yet read. He's also published a commentary on the 9th Karmapa's work \\"Pointing Out the Dharmakaya\\" under the same title as the original. The 9th Karmapa, one of the greatest of Mahamudra masters (maybe the greatest) wrote 3 texts.

The book unfolds on many levels, and through many readings I am still uncovering new revelations. Roger Zelazny was the best of many gifted sci fi and fantasy writers emerging in the 60's and 70's. I had the profound pleasure of meeting him at a book signing and found him to be bright, modest and interested in his readers. I still have my signed, tattered copy and can recommend this book along with Creatures of Light and Darkness, Jack of Shadows, Eye of Cat, Doorways In Sand, Dream Master et al. Other novels, including the Amber Series, A Night In the Lonesome October, This Immortal and many others, can be enjoyed, shared and collected...thank heavens for the prolific out-pouring!

They have so much reading (and thinking) pleasure in store..."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"This is my favorite Sci-Fi title and one of only two novels I have ever read twice. I'm sorry to see that it is out of print.Essentially, the tale is about a society ruled by technocrats who have taken on the aspects of gods (specifically from the Hindu pantheon) in order to maintain thier vast power, which includes a form of immortality and adulation from the very populace which they keep technologically stagnant. However, with the help of the god of Death and his own unusual attribute, one of thier number sets out to break the stranglehold.The narrative remains thoughtful and human despite the otherworldly setting. The colorful characters leap off the page. If you manage to track down a copy, I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"I first read this book the year that it won the Hugo Award for Best Novel of the Year, and my reaction was one of wonder and astonishment.Here we had the Hindu pantheon of gods introduced into science fiction, and the rather disorientating experience of starting the story in the middle of events. On first reading it takes a while to understand the background: a group from India arriving on the exotic planet Urath, and adopting godlike powers. We meet Sam, whose essence has been stored in magnetic clouds surrounding the planet before being awoken by Yama's prayer machine. He is the reincarnation of Mahasamatman, who is also known as Siddhartha, Buddha, Tathagata and Lord of Light. He finds that the mass of the population has been tyrannized and kept in ignorance.Roger Zelazny died far too early, and as with his well-known Amber series, he shows here a remarkable insight into different cultures and beliefs. In Lord of Light he demonstrates a rare appreciation of the stages of human development described in Hindu beliefs, and uses this as an essential backdrop to an exploration of the abuse of power, love, vanity and knowledge. Zelazny explores religion not just as a means on enlightenment, but also of oppression. Themes that have never been more topical."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"As an adult, I am really not in any position to evaluate this book. That is because I discovered this book as a teenager in the 60's when it first came out, and I was completely mesmerized by the story. I was a member of a science-fiction book club, which sent you a book every month, and the trick was that if you did NOT want the book you had to return it; else they would charge you for it. I got the book, didn't read it, was too lazy to return it, so I had to pay for it and finally decided to read it. I was (as most reviewers here agree) very lucky to have stumbled into this book.I don't have anything new to say about the plot or structure, except to tell a personal story about the book which might amuse those of you who appreciate its intricacies. At the time I had to choose a book for an oral book report in english. The purpose of the oral report (for all students in the class) was to emphasize plot (two other reports were to cover character and background). We had *five minutes*. I chose Lord of Light. I did not want to do a disservice to the book, so I did a (I thought) thorough summary of the important events in each \\"lifetime\\" of Sam. Needless to say, I went over 30 minutes. My fellow students were going out of their minds with boredom. My grade: B+. Teacher's comments: \\"presentation a little too long\\". YOU try summarizing the plot of this story in five minutes. Thirty five years later, I still can't."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"This is a science fiction classic, with a permanent place in my personal library.

This book I kept, and in a prominent place. Never. Never! have I read a novel that is as original as what Zelazny created with LOL. It feels like fantasy, but then a strong underpinning of &quot;hard&quot; SF emerges ... and then there is the story of humanity, with elites (the original crew) and the mortals (the colonists). I could bring up the context of the book (psychedelic 60's) but, as with all great books, I think the period influences on this book are irrelevant. Read it, and re-read it.

And, as I imagine all readers of LoL agree, it is hard to imagine anyone reading it just once. It's the potato chip of books. It's a book you not only enjoy - it's a book you like.LoL is a laugh-out-loud sci-fi adventure with a wonderful spirit. I first read LoL over ten years ago and have reread it several times since. The writing is witty and salacious and au fait and evocative. I can't recall a single dull page.Part of the genius of this work is Zelazny's incorporation of the Hindu-Buddhist antagonism into a Star Wars-like world filled with high-tech technology and potent spiritualism (e.g., the Rakasha).Each chapter opens with a quote from the Hindu Scriptures, and the novel as a whole employs the Oriential technique of beginning with the end thus creating a vague sense of circular time and eternal recurrence.Five Stars!"},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"I read this book in 1989.

Brilliant treatment of an arcane subject and the best of its kind. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"This is my favorite Science Fiction book.I hesitate to add another review to the lengthy list here. But in reviewing most of the 5-star reviews, and all of the other reviews, I was surprised that no one mentioned that this is a great 'buddy' story. If you like Aubrey & Maturin, Frodo & Sam, or Jeeves & Wooster, you'll probably like this book. The cynical word play between the two main characters (Sam and Yama -- who funnily enough are AKA Buddha and Death) is the best thing since Rick and Renault.The two main criticisms of the book seem to be that it isn't Science Fiction, and that it is confusing. I agree with the first criticism -- this would be sold as fantasy today, not Science Fiction. If you are an Arthur C. Clarke fan (a SCIENCE fiction fan), you might not like this book. My own favorite Hugo-award winners are this book, and the Doomsday Book by Connie Willis, which should probably be classified as historical fiction, rather than Science Fiction. I don't see the point of nitpicking about the boundaries of the genre. It's a good book -- who cares if it is Science Fiction?But I don't agree with the many reviews (five to one star) that say this book is confusing/difficult. The book begins with Sam's re-incarnation, and it is obvious there will be a flashback at some point. There is a *single* break in the narrative timeline. It is introduced at the end of a chapter when Sam stands \\"remembering\\" as he travels on a boat, and ends when he dies -- so it is obvious that the next chapter will return to the timeline that opened the book. Some of Zelazny's other work is more accessible (e.g., the Amber series), but some of his award-winning short stories are far, far more opaque.Finally a couple critics said the characters took themselves \\"way too seriously\\". Surely, this is just a criticism of writing in this genre (and the fantasy genre) before 1970. The characters in Heinlein, Asimov, or Herbert take themselves too seriously. And who takes himself more seriously, in all of literature, than Aragorn? Okay, it all sounds a little puerile today. But 1) it's a bit like criticizing Jane Austin for sounding high-falutin, and 2) While SF writing since William Gibson may sound more realistic and grown up, Neuromancer is (IMHO) far less fun, and far less funny, than Lord of Light."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"It was just a matter of time for SF to deal with religion. Especially pantheons like those of Greece and India. These provided fertile ground for experiments of any kind, whether in narrative or reference, or just plain food for thought fueled by speculation. And then there were sixties. Beatles, Dylan, LSD, summer of love, Woodstock and people rebelling against system. West opened the gate for Eastern spirituality, and many gurus were born preaching watered-down Brahmanism, Hinduism or Buddhism. Ancient and complex philosophy transformed itself into a new-age spirituality which was, in a way, birthplace of postmodern thought. In midst of it all, literature revived itself. New wave of Science Fiction came into existence and one of the landmarks of this generation was \`Lord of the light' written by then-unacclaimed (despite the Hugo award) Roger Zelazny. It combined all that was necessary, drawing from what was present, developing it and transforming it into something bigger. Land of mystery, which India was during that time, became closer, became full of life, and then became allegory. Zelazny used Indian mythology to create a new world, somewhere in the infinite vastness of the Universe, and through its history he told a tale about the rise of oppression, religious decadence, and subversion. Much in the same manner like Christianity came into existence as opposition to Roman religion, Buddhism came into existence as opposition to Brahmanism. Zelazny focuses his novel on the prominent figure of Mahasamatman (or just plain Sam), who, by invoking the ancient doctrine of Buddhism, tries to suppress and oppose the insolent power of self-proclaimed gods.And he did so in a way that transgressed the boundaries of the genre. Writing something that was, at the same time, fantasy and SF novel. Though much of his writing is crude and cramped, with weird syntax and sentence flow, \`Lord of light' is still exemplary novel of what SF may be. It isn't just the space-opera, or aliens invading Earth or reckless scientist endangering the world - it is a complex speculation of the history of the future, and it tries to show cyclic nature of history and rise of the power. At some point during the writing, Zelazny buckled under the weight of the new style, which resulted in large part of the book concerning itself with battle, battle plans and futuristic warfare in a one-man-army manner. These parts are somewhat tedious to read and are the weakest point of the book.Genre fiction being what it is, and much of it is rapidly aging, we have to ask ourselves can we still read this today. Answer is, fortunately, yes we can. \`Lord of light' was heavily influenced by its context, but Zelazny managed to do something that managed to defy this simplistic explanation. Context, and problems of the book are of the universal nature and they can be read and commented upon today, like they were 40 years before. Much of the novelty this book presented is gone these days, but what remains is the story about ethics, birth of religion, vanity and personal sacrifice. SF elements are prominent plot devices, setting up the stage for the upcoming battle and giving us something, by abstracting our thoughts, to comment upon but unlike hard-SF were technology of the future is the main factor, \`Lord of light' remains in speculative, what-if mode which deals with concepts rather than concrete machinery.Almost half a century after it's been published, 'Lord of light' still remains one of the best works of science fiction. One of those works that can be read by people who usually avoid SF and by being such to still remain faithful to the genre. Observe and learn from Zelazny."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Lord of Light by Roger Zelazny is one of those books that you can't give up on too soon. The first chapter was very interesting, but it took longer than that for me to really begin to enjoy the intricacies of the story and quite a while longer before I actually understood where this story was set.It was an amazing experience to find myself reading about godlike beings who had chosen to take their names from the Hindu religion. Siddhartha, Mahasamatman, Lord of Light, all are \\"Sam\\", all are the same person who had spent his time as a god and didn't relish having to be in that position again. When Sam realized that those in charge of this world are gathering more and more power to themselves through the means of the true death or reincarnation into lesser beings for those who oppose them, he must do something to stop this progression. Enter the teachings of Buddhism which begins to convert those who are followers of Hinduism.All of this played out even more beautifully when I realized that the world this all happens in is not our world, but the world of another planet. I loved the contrasts between the powerful Hindu gods with their modern technology, even technology transcending our modern world and the peaceful, non aggressive beliefs of the followers of Buddha. One of my favorite characters was Rild, the assassin who wore his weapon, the red cord, wrapped around his arm for all to see. Yet that man was changed and converted by the very man he was sent to kill. The first time I encountered the machine outside the Temple where people put in their disk, pulled the lever and received their reward was so thought provoking for me that I had to stop reading for a moment. Religion a la Las Vegas. How brilliant of Zelazny to see and reveal some of the shortcomings of modern day religions. I don't know if that was his exact intention, but that is what it made me think about. Once I realized that the chapters did not follow in a chronological order I could relax and almost treat each one as a story within a book until they came full circle and the ending was revealed.This was not an easy book to read, but it was a real pleasure for me. I sincerely appreciate having it brought to my attention and plan to read more stories by this author in the future."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"I picked this up a few days ago and have briskly read through the entire novel since then. This is undoubtedly an epic masterpiece. It is one of the best science fiction books I have read to date. The main strength of the novel is a strong story with an excellent setting. The world is one of ancient religions, literal god-like beings, and advanced technology hiding under the mask of supernatural power. I will not spoil the story but will only say that it is told on an epic Lord of the Rings type scale. The allusions to Eastern philosophy and religion is pretty awesome too. For a sci-fi novel the characters were pretty good. They weren't great like in a Dostoevsky novel, but they weren't completely one-dimensional as is the case in too many sci fi novels. In all, it was masterful. If I ever become a sci fi author, Roger Zalazny would be one of my primary role models."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"This is a story of colonists on a distant world, betrayed by the starship crew that brought them there, consigned to a medieval style life on a planet whose original inhabitants have not all been vanquished.This is a story of gods who set in judgement of mortals, rewarding the loyal and moral with reincarnation.This the story of men who have used science to hone their personal peculiarities into tools of great power.This is the story of beings called gods because their very appetites and essences are like natural forces.This is the story revolution on Earth.This is the story of war on Heaven.This is the story of a hero who never claimed he was a god.This is the story of a hero who never claimed he wasn't a god.And all those stories are the same story as Zelazny mixes epic battles and individual duels; the godtalk of high fantasy with talk of cigarettes and whores and flush toilets; idealism and cynicism; poetic language, the language of the Hindu Vedas, and Chandleresque dialogue; the story of the Deathgod's loves and hates and his friend the Binder of Demons, the Lord of Light, the Buddha.Zelazny provides enough science to rationalize the story, to remind us of the technology behind his Hinduesque gods, but not enough to become hard science or violate the tone of a wry, religious text where \\"doubt ... is the chastity of the mind.\\" It is this constant flux of the epic and ordinary, the personal and godlike, the wry and portentous that makes this book so unique and enjoyable.Those previously acquainted with other Zelazny works may find this the quintessential Zelazny novel in its combining so many of his themes: the mythological element done better here than in hisThis Immortal,eye of Cat, and Creatures of Light and Darkness; the political machinations of the Amber books; the tough guy, behind the scenes manipulator familiar fromMy Name Is Legion; the martial arts ofRoadmarks; the interest in psychology as inThe Dream Master (The Nebula Award-Winning Novel).Two slight warnings. First, don't expect any profound commentary on any of the religions that show up in this book. Second, the first chapter of this book may be tough going for some readers - particularly when the Buddha delivers a sermon. The book's momentum and comprehensibility picks up after that as there is a long set of chapters showing the back story with the final chapter resuming the action with a new understanding by the reader.This is one of those books that fully deserves its place in the canon of great science fiction."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"This is one of the greatest SF/Fantasy books ever written I more than enjoyed this book it sits up there on my book shelf alongside Stranger in a Strange Land - magic."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Some readers have said it better already.

One of my favorite authors and my favorite book."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"This novel is classic and ageless, and it reads just as well now as it did when I first read it more than twenty years ago.On a distant Earth colony, some of the original settlers decide to keep the technology for themselves, dooming their own descendants to a brutal and primitive life. Those settlers with the high tech eventually take on the roles of the Hindu pantheon and become gods, turning the world and its people into mere playthings.But not all of the original settlers go for this idea. And eventually some of them begin to fight back in every way they can, to better the lot of the humans.Zelazny tells the story in a circular fashion - it is not in chronological order - and this might be initially confusing for some readers.the chronology actually goes :chapter twochapter threechapter fourchapter fivechapter sixchapter onechapter sevenThe author also packs a lot of characters, subplots, ideas, and information into a rather short novel. Some of today's giants such as Robert Jordan and Steven Erikson would probably be able to get an 800 page novel out of each chapter. But Zelazby somehow manages to fit it all into about three hundred pages."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"I am a little bit embarrassed to admit that I have not gotten around to reading this before now. I am also a little bit embarrassed to admit that while I really really liked it, I did not love it.Like many readers, I came to Zelazny with The Chronicles of Amber. I read and reread that series many times. In the last few years I have been going back to read the other Zelazny books that I missed, largely been picking them up second hand since so many are out of print.Lord of Light is a clever and creative muse on the nature of power and caste translated into a science fiction/fantasy mix. It has laugh-out-loud witty moments and is occasionally extremely moving. As usual, Zelazny does a wonderful job at translating religious themes to the popular novel. Mahasamatman (or Sam, as he famously prefers to be called) considers his past attempts to break the spine of heaven while preparing himself for the next battle. He may not have wanted to be remembered for his anachronistic myth-making, but it is awfully nice to read.I am honestly not sure why I didn't love it. I think that something about the structure removed some of the immediacy. I also had a fair amount of trouble following the character and names for the first third of the book. Couldn't say for sure.

Zelazny's one of the greats (not necessarily including his Amber series, which IMHO isn't as good), and this book is his probably his best work, though it's difficult to say with such a superb writer.I'm not giving a synopsis of the book -- why? Read it for yourself and be surprised. Don't read spoiler reviews and come to it with preconceptions. Far future, godlike powers, Indian mythology/relgion, and it works. How often have you read a work where beings with godlike powers could make you care what happens? Zelazny pulls it off.I've read this a few times over the last 30 years, and was just reminded of it by another, lesser work. This is one of my all time personal favorites, up there with Dune, Neuromancer, Snowcrash, Ringworld, Difference Engine; though very, very different from and in its own way superior to all of them.I, uh, liked this book. Can I give it 11 stars?"},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"I'd recommend this first if you haven't tried Zelazny before. While plenty of his other novels display the wildly imaginative style he's known for, this is the richest and most entertaining. Just please don't expect to get an accurate education about Hinduism or any other religion in this book; Roger is the rebel par excellence, borrowing any way he sees fit at the moment. He clearly knew more about the Hindu pantheon than your average sci-fi novelist, but he's no Vedic scholar, and he wasn't trying to be.SPOILER ALERT ... SPOILER ALERT ... SPOILER ALERT ...In the distant future, the handful of surviving humans have settled a distant world and developed a technology so advanced as to resemble godlike powers and magic in vitually all respects. The most powerful have adopted the forms of ancient deities and have become complacent and selfish. A powerful cartel united in the guise of the Hindu Trimurti; that is, Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma, have consolidated a monopoly on all technology so humans born into their world have no chance of progress or free will, thus assuring the Trimurti will live forever as gods in an eternal ancient India.Into this theocratic dictatorship comes Sam, the one original human who refused to adopt godhood, and who raises an army of unbelievers, demons, aliens and flunkies, to renew progress and free will again. The tale of his struggle is psychedelic, anarchic, and totally irreverent of all faiths. The reader is left to decide whether he really won the war or not, and whether Sam was just a man or in fact a god himself, as well as to contemplate the nature of religion as a tool for both liberation and oppression.Roger is the classic free-thinking iconoclast, adopting novel approaches like few in any genre. In some of his books the methods he used were almost transparent enough to bother me. In his best-known books, the Chronicles of Amber, he sometimes appears to have used D&D; roleplay to outline the plot; I can almost discern the individual moves in the game as the plot unfolds. In \\"Isle of the Dead,\\" he adopts famous artworks as templates for the time and place, a method heavily used in TV dramas like Star Trek nowadays - becomes a cheap gimmick too easily! Even so, he brings on such inventive wit I find his inventiveness very stimulating. His books are big and adventuresome, pulpy and clever.So if you've never read Roger, this is the book to get. My favorite line: \\"The dawn came pink as the fresh-bitten thigh of a maiden.\\" Okay, so BTW that is one minor sample of his wit. A little bit profane, irreverent, and not the most dainty. Much like your reviewer."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"At last! A masterwork that left me speechless and breathless with its intensity, originality and pure genius.I am lucky to have picked this one to be the first of Zelazny's works to read. It proved to be the best one, too. After this novel I ran out and bought most of his other books, including the famous Amber series, but although they were all obviously written by the Master, they didn't come close to The Lord of Light.Call it sci-fi, call it fantasy, call it drama or literature or simple legend - you can get away with it all because they are all entwined into this massive ball of power, dragging you along with every paragraph, every event. Take care to read carefully - the plot goes ahead in time then back then jumps off completely but that only adds to the fascination that you'll feel once you get the whole picture.Needless to say much. Read it! I can't imagine anyone who will be disappointed by it."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"The only bad thing that I can think to say of this book is that is a bit disjointed (ok, a lot disjointed). But I'm used to reading John Barth and Philip K. Dick novels; they are good preparation for the jumpy narrative and time line. If you can stand to be perplexed for the better part of each chapter (as to exact time and character/s that your dealing with), than you'll absolutely love this book. If you're easily confused or are looking for a quick read, than you may want to look else where.With that aside, I would compare the battle scenes to a more poetic Robert Jordan. You know...back when his novels had action in them. Zelazny truly has command of the language he uses to describe fighting.I'm a Sci-Fi fan and I highly recommend this."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Rare among the works of Science Fiction are books that have achieved the masterful integration of wonderful prose language, adventerous spirit, compelling charachters and thought provoking social commentary. A study in man's ability to deal with power, as well as the ties between religion and power, Lord of Light prevails in effectively communicating its point through a truly intriguing setting. A unique premise, combined with Zelazny's engrossing language and imagination serve to create a novel that is just as enjoyable when read the tenth time as it is the first. Challenging in language, thought, and structure, the reader must be quick, intelligent and capable of inferring details Zelazny has omitted so that he could create a mood that transcends the boundaries of science fiction, fantasy and modern prose.Timeless in its ideas and brilliant in execution, Lord of Light is simply, a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"The other reviewers pretty much said it all about this book, which justly deserves its 5 out of 5 stars.The one small contribution I can make to the collection of rave reviews of this book is:You know how some books are pretty good but they lose their appeal after the first read? This book has an extremely high re-read value. It's like Neuromancer: I must have read this book 4 or 5 times over the past 15 years, and it remains as good today as it did the first time. The book is so complex and the characters are so rich, that it'll keep your interest on the 2nd reading and beyond."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"The time is the unimaginably distant future, and a group of astronauts from Urath (Earth) have used mental, physical, and biological technology to become incarnations of the Hindu Gods. Opposing them is one of their own, Mahasamatman, who prefers to be called Sam. Sam resents the physical oppression and spiritual slavery imposed upon the non-divine inhabitants of the planet. This is the central theme to the grand vision of Man's destiny put forth by the late Roger Zelazny.Touching upon many themes, including the conflict of church and state, an increasingly important subject today, who or what is divine, the blurred distinction between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil,&quot; societal engineering, and eugenics, Zelazny crafted an intensely compelling tale that won a Hugo Award when it was first published. Like many of his characters in such diverse works as the Amber series, &quot;This Immortal,&quot; &quot;Jack of Shadows,&quot; and &quot;Isle of the Dead,&quot; Sam, despite being a god/superman, by any rational definition, shows a humanity and fallibility that makes him an appealing character as he searches first for meaning in his life, and later, his place in the world/universe, all the while questioning and second-guessing his own self.From an action viewpoint, &quot;Lord of Light&quot; offers plenty as Sam, his human, and inhuman allies battle the Gods and Demigods in the battle to free the planet from oppression of the Gods. As always Zelazny's imagery is incredible and all of the characters offer a depth of personality, and yes, humanity, which makes them all complex, interesting, compelling, and immensely satisfying."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"While A NIGHT IN THE LONESOME OCTOBER may be Zelazny's most fun book, LORD OF LIGHT is probably the greatest. It's science fiction written in the vocabulary of fantasy. Basically, settlers on an alien world, using advanced technology, create a world corresponding to Hindu mythology, with members of the crew taking on the aspects and powers of Hindu deities. There is even a means of electronically providing for reincarnation. The battles between the gods are epic and the verbal depictions are as good as a mural. The ending is also some of Zelazny's most touching writing, without ever dipping into the maudlin."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"In this book, we travel to an unnamed world where men and women have developed amazing powers, called Attributes. These people pose as ancient Hindu Gods and rule over the planet below them. Essential to their rule is to keep the people in this planet at a primitive level of techology. This they do most ruthelessly.&quot;Sam&quot;, the binder, disagrees. He wants to aid the people below. With the aid of others, he lanches a multi-phased revolution against the gods. Sam develops new religions to counter Hinduism; he makes treaties with this planets natural inhabitants, &quot;demons&quot;; he actually seeks an alliance with the &quot;evil one.&quot; No, this is not Satan. Who the evil or dark one is, however, is a nice surprise.With an amazing amount of turns and twists, grievous mistakes by &quot;Sam&quot;, and interesting exposure to philosophy of all kinds, this book is Zelazny at his best. It compares in quality to &quot;Nine Prince of Amber,&quot; a classic in its own right. Highly recommended for fantasy and science ficton fans."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"&quot;Lord of light&quot; is the story of a group of people in the far future , that for centuries have pretended to be gods (the weak-humans are their offsprings).Offcourse , all this is on another planet. this group was the first settlers , and the technolegy they posses allows them to act as they please.They take the form of the gods of the Hindu religion.To further complicate the situation , each of those &quot;gods&quot; (which is immortal , though by technological edge) has , over the centuries , developed a psi-power that fits the powers of the god he's supposed to be.The hero is Sam , in short for MahaSAMatman , the original Budha.

It is one of the hardest Fantasy books you could read. So then why is it classed as Science Fiction? More about that all important point in a moment, but first let's just talk about Lord of Light. Lord of Light is a collection of stories, connected with a man/deity called Sam, the Buddha who is the Lord of Light. There are two or three brilliant stories that would have rounded the book off at about 150 pages, but some of the stories let the book down as a whole. These filler chapters maybe for very well hardened fantasy readers, or they could just as well be ultimately nothing more than stuffing pages to gel into novel size. It makes it quite a chore to get through its 300 page total without significant breaks and a needed mental push to read on until the next better story, or the end, unless fantasy, and very hard fantasy at that, is your genre of specialization. This is very much an entire world created right out of Zelazny's imagination. It is also very much bound to his own will to create lots of things, even outside of the scope of fantasy reason, because his concept is so fantastic. However sometimes he half-finishes a great narrative and wanders off into the very mediocre parts of his fantasy work which are interesting only for those who really want to know his innermost thoughts on complex subjects. Given that the timeline of events is also out of sequence makes it all the more irritating to quite find a dull, sometimes meaningless yarn, coming in out of nowhere, sometimes even bordering on the incomprehensible. One other significant problem for new Zelanzy readers is less about the stories and more behind the book's marketing strategy, and this is the important point we need to talk about. The publishers have pushed for a quite erroneous science-fiction genre classification. I accept it is their choice to do so and well within their rights. Seasoned SF readers can live with the subgenre being a quasi science-fiction/fantasy but obviously the Lord of Light seems to be have been inserted by stealth into the science-fiction section only to help bring attention to Zelanzy, who primarily writes fantasy. At the same time the Lord of Light was awarded the 1968 Hugo Award for Best Novel. It was even nominated for a Nebula Award and parts have been published in SF Magazines. Even so I can only expect that its very slim hybrid experimental nature may have been a first for its time, but it is still very thin on SF topics all the same. Explaining away a supernatural gift is done sometimes by eluding to science, but that doesn't explain the bird-like creature the size of a house with the rider on its back that suddenly turns into a cloud of smoke and vaporizes off to some Lilly pad. There is lots of magic on display. Lord of Light can be described as a collection of chapters, although the book is broken into parts, is not linear, not always focused on any one plot, but are united by the hero Sam who is involved in various campaigns against a God, or Gods or heaven. Sam's stories seem to contain some tactical moves that are akin to Buddhist theology, with Zelanzy often citing Tibetan and Hindu literature, the underlying foundation to his fantasy world based on these works where the character of a deity is often developed by using these spiritual and psychological works. Zelanzy interjects some modern phenomena such as circuits, control panels, Marxism, mind probes, and even cigarette smoking to give an extremely feathery SF relationship at times, but nothing that justifies or warrants its SF grouping. The SF in the story often appears like an after-touch required by the marketing department to at least give the book an excuse to sit on the SF shelf space. I feel more than a little duped when I would have probably looked into this book as a highly recommended fantasy novel instead. In that case I can understand why it would receive top marks. I just don't like the way it sneaked into something like #7 in the SF Masterworks series from Orion publishing, when they have a Fantasy series. There is also repetition of the same action sequences about some God who jumps in the air and calls the wind to his side and a mystery black cloud that envelopes some good guy who wakes up next to some God who begins to talk about reincarnating in some new body and how the local karma wheel operators are not working hard enough. However it is worth reading for the \\"Hellwell\\" story alone, which is an absolutely riveting tale and is the only reason why this book saved face with me. You can tell that Zelanzy has poured his heart into descriptions and creating a functioning vision of Nirvana, but it is too often at the very extreme end of Fantasy works. Also you may have seen this book described as \\"Colonists from Earth, using a mix of mental powers and high technology, have long ago subjugated the native inhabitants -- and are now making themselves into gods\\". This is just advertising that does not appear as content in the book. If you go into this with the understanding that it is Fantasy, and difficult fantasy at that, then maybe you would be better prepared. I don't want to undercut how grand this work is and how much effort went into it, but marketing ploys have simply tricked me into reading something I really didn't want to read and the book's description is not what the book is about. There is no dead Earth. There is nothing about a colony getting hold of technology. This is about Gods who fight on Earth for fame or prizes or control of the Heavens."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"I found this book tedious. I was very shocked to see it has 5 stars with 85 reviews, very overhyped."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"that this is an author who can't write very well. His ideas, as I mentioned before, are great.The story of a nonconformist who refuses to join the 'gods' on a planet populated by former Earthlings. The initial settlers have developed their technology to a point where they have godlike powers; they are capable of transmigrating when their bodies grow old, they have the power to project sadness, energy or destruction. The regular inhabitants are kept in awe of these gods, who have taken Indian names (Vishnu, Shiva) and recreated the Hindu pantheon. In comes Sam, one of the first ones, who refuses to become a 'god' and wants the regular people to share in the technological gains of the gods.I loved the world Zelazny created but found myself utterly bored by the way he tells a story. He has no sense for dialogue or character. He will describe people in list format (He had blond hair. He was good with cats, that kind of thing); then they disappear from the story. The development of the action is brilliance mixed with teenage upmanship. The dialogue is full of trivial lines that go on and on and shed absolutely no light. At the end, everything is confused and rushed, full of sound and fury - noise masquerading as climax. If I had to describe Zelazny I would call him a brilliant teenager at heart who never developed his gifts. Too bad, 'cause he could have been great."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"This book isn't really science fiction. It is actually a fantasy book (a rather good one) but it's being marketed as science fiction. The technology they employ is totally unbelievable and besides it isn't the focus of the story.The focus of the story is some superficial character interaction, some VERY basic theology (the kind used by those who don't actually study it), and some cool powers. It has no science or even a neat hypothesis, then why is it science fiction?It's fun, but let's not pretend it's deep. It's a quick read, but let's not pretend it's new; the whole idea of the Gods being humans with high tech was done over and over, but usually with Greek mythology. The whole incredible twist here is the use of Hinduism and Buddhism instead. Let's not say it takes a genius for that. Even the idea of the alien life being the demons in the world is hardly used and glossed over (and was probably the most interesting idea in the whole book).If you like fantasy and finds ultra-powered battles fun by all means read this book, but if you are expecting an original idea based on science or at least a rational insight you are not going to find it in here. The occasional use of a pseudo-technical term doesn't make it SCIENCE fiction, it takes a storyline that is based on a rational exploration of an idea. Julio Verne was wrong in much of his science, but he had the originality to propose something new and build a somewhat rational story around it. Asimov wrote in Foundation about sociology and even added some cool twists to the story. Zelazny only has the cool nomenclature of Hinduism and Buddhism."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"It just didn't hit the spot for me. I found the whole religious thing to be irrelevant. The exoctic mystical eastern religious fascination came across as being dated to me, a bit of a hippy/60s thing. And because of that, I was not really motivated to suspend my disbelief. It all seemed like magic rather than science, and therefore just a bit silly. If the story and the characters had resonated with me, maybe I would have liked all the battles and action at the end, but it all came across as a bit Bruce Willis-esque.I did like the line &quot;the fit hit the Shan&quot;, though."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"This book has an interesting premise. People have become Hindu gods. They can re-incarnate themselves. They are ruling a planet inhabited by their descendants, whom they keep in the stone age.The problem is that it's almost incomprehensible. Most of the book is apparently a flashback, but the transition to the past is confusing, and there are references to an even further past, so you can never tell what time period you are in. It appears that only the first and last chapters are the present time.Most of the characters are confusing, too. They appear without introduction or development and it's hard to remember who is who or why they relate to each other. A lot of these characters have super powers, but the powers are not well explained, so when they have battles it's hard to figure out who is doing what or why.There are quotes at the beginning of each chapter. Some of them purport to be out of Hindu or possibly Buddhist scriptures. I wondered whether they really were scriptures. If so, why does the story parallel real scriptures? The description of the book on the cover says that these are people who came from a long-vanished Earth; BUT the book doesn't say that at all. You wonder whether instead the book is hypothesizing a science fiction explanation for the Hindu religion here on earth.The connections between chapters are also confusing, so that the story line is even harder to follow.It's also hard to follow the motivations of the main character, Sam. This is possibly because it's never clear which when he is in.You have to wonder what happened to the concept of editors."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"I'm afraid that I must agree with the comments of 'Tedious' below. Apart from a wonderful idea for the theme of this novel (eastern religion meets western technology) their was not enough character or plot development to sustain my interest past the half-way mark. This book has been praised as an influence by some very great authors, but I must assume it was the theme and not the narrative itself that caught their fancy. The narative reads like a poor translation. Really bad style. A few funny moments... but overall, a very dissapointing book for me considering it's high falutin' reputation. I'll stick with Huxley, if and when I seek enlightenment."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Now maybe I'm just dumb, but I found this book incredibly tedious to read. I could live with the vague religion, the convoluted story line, the cheesezy references to &quot;old earth&quot;, even the dense and overly decriptive paragraphs that yield little in the way of plot or character devlopment. I slogged though all that and at the end of it we find out very little about &quot;sam&quot; or what he was doing this whole time except that he is fighting a civil war againist the gods. I could go on and on, but basically don't waste your money on Lord of Light."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"The first chapter of \\"Lord of Light\\" intentionally confuses the reader; Zelazny starts his novel near the end of his tale and provides little in the way of background or explanation. Mahasamatman (\\"Sam\\") is resurrected from the ether by the artificer Yama, whose technical skills at reincarnating the human form is unsurpassed among the inhabitants of this alien planet. Yama, with help from the goddess Ratri and from Tak (who is currently banished to the form of an ape), have recalled Sam from eternal peace to help them confront several gods who struggle for control of the world.From this opening, the books shifts to a series of tales, in flashback form, recounting Sam's past and explaining the history of the battles among the gods. Although these divine rulers share the names and personae of the Hindu pantheon, it soon becomes apparent that the \\"gods\\" are simply the original colonists who came from Earth millennia earlier, who keep the planet's present occupants in a sort of medieval fiefdom, and who have acquired immortality by transmigrating from body to body. But there is an ongoing struggle in \\"heaven\\" between the Accelerationists (led by Sam), who want to share technology with the rest of mankind, and the Deicrats, those gods who want to maintain their lives of luxury and oppression.Many of the earlier chapters are told in the form of disjointed legends, but halfway into the book the pace evolves into a continuous storyline. Those readers who argue that \\"Lord of Light\\" belongs to the fantasy genre more than to science fiction have a point: beyond the futuristic technology practiced by the \\"gods\\" (which is more of a sideshow than a major plot element), the novel's prose style, structure, characters, and action resemble what you'd find in many a medieval saga. (One surprising aspect, however, that distinguishes these tales from many fantasy novels is the often sarcastic and occasionally slapstick humor.) Because of its kings-and-swords plot, Zelazny's work recalls epics like \\"Dune\\" or dystopian/political works like \\"The Dispossessed\\" rather than \\"hard\\" sci-fi.As for the novel's much-hyped Hindu aspects, I think David Brin (a great admirer of this book) says it best: \\"For all of the clearly genuine empathy he finds in other cultures and conveys so well in his works, Roger Zelazny is as western as they come.... He'd be kicked out of the ashram for asking too many questions.\\" This is no primer on Hinduism; in spite of the author's fascination with Eastern mysticism, it's no coincidence that religion is presented both as a means of enlightenment and as a form of oppression. Instead, Hinduism serves as a vehicle for a futuristic parable of all-too-human foibles."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"This Hugo award-winning science fiction classic turns the usual technological approach to the genre on its head. \\"Lord of Light\\" reads much more like fantasy than science fiction, and like Frank Herbert's classic \\"Dune,\\" it's a rare example of a science-fiction novel deeply concerned with spirituality and metaphysics.It is also a difficult novel. Readers more interested in adventure or hard science fiction will find Zelazny's dense, intricate style tricky to maneuver or concentrate on. The cast is huge, and most characters either go by multiple names, or switch names and bodies as they are reincarnated. This is the sort of novel that requires focus and attention to appreciate. Those who give it the time it deserves will discover a true classic, and a strange experience unique among science-fiction books-even for Zelazny, who lead the field of the new-wave authors of the 1960s.The story follows the inhabitants of an Earth-colonized planet long after Earth has ceased to exist. The colonial leaders have developed the technology to turn themselves into god-like figures, based on Hinduism, and rule the lesser people in a metaphysical tyranny. The hero, Sam (only one of his many names, such a Buddah) returns from banishment to lead the struggle to free the people and spread technology to make everyone \\"gods.\\" He finds strange allies along the road, including the original alien inhabitants of the planet, known as Rakashas (demons) in the pseudo-religion invented by the rulers. In a short space, a great deal happens and Sam wages both war and peace against the \\"gods.\\"\\"Lord of Light\\" is definitely a trip...and milestone in science fiction, but it isn't for the casual fan. People interested in religion and veteran science-fiction readers will get the most out of it, and should definitely get themselves a copy. For somewhat more accessible Zelazny books to start with, try \\"Damnation Alley\\" or his large fantasy series, \\"The Books of Amber\\"-but you'll need to visit \\"Lord of Light\\" eventually; it's his best novel."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Lord Of Light was first published in 1967. It proceeded to win the Hugo award as best novel. In this book Zelazny demonstates his amazing gift of character creation and writing stylization that make this novel seem at times to be almost one long poetic dream on par with &quot;Xanadu&quot;. His writing style combined with the imagery set forth in this masterwork to create a totally believable tale, for it deals with the struggle of man to ovrcome his baser self as well as his opressive fellow man. As a personal note I must say that this is by far my favorite single novel by Mr. Zelazney. It's blending of hard SF with the Hindu religion is seamlessly done, and of course it was an inspired choice to set the Buddha in the role of prime antagonist, allied with Death Himself. The rich scene settings only add to the over all depth of this amazing story. This is truly one of the milestones of SF writing, a must read for anyone interested in the genre."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Occasionally a science-fiction book is written that reminds everyone why the genre is so important. A book so extraordinary, so inventive, so full of wit, imagination and intriguing possibility that it just shines out of every page.Lord of Light is such a book.Here in the UK, it has recently been one of the first books to be re-released in the 'SF Masterworks' series. Not only does it fully derve this title, it stands head and shoulders above most of the other titles on this list and indeed all of Zelazny's extensive back-catalogue.Put as simply as possible, the story is one of the way in which ideological factions diverge and conflict over the human colonisation of a distant planet,how over a long time the differences within the human society - and between humans and the indigenous inhabitants - become fossilised and reconstructed into a parody or recreation of Hindu myths, and finally how this decadent parody is challenged from within by one of the original colonists - Mahasamatman, or Sam, the Lord of Light - who takes on the form of the Buddha.Around this central tale, Zelazny manages to weave so many themes. It is a sensitive and compassionate re-imagining of Hindu mytholology, yet aware of the shortcomings and the challenge posed to traditional Hinduism by Buddhist teachings. It is a tale of technologically-facilitated decadence and moral decline, of the way in which technical abilities can become more important than the purposes for which they were developed. It is a fable about how inequality and class division emerge, are structured, fossilized and challenged. It is story of memory and forgetting, of how history can be constantly rewritten -consciously and unconsciously - by the powerful, and lost to the weak. It is a classic tragedy, the oldest story of all: hubris, nemesis and catharsis.Zelazny not only manages all these themes with seemingly effortless structural ability, but also produces lush and stylish prose entirely appropriate to the parodic Hindu world, which is a joy to read.Everyone should read this whether you think you like sci-fi or not. Lord of Light is a unique and extraordinary creation and I don't think I am exaggerating in describing it as one of the greatest and most original acheivements in Twentieth Century literature."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Hyperbole piled upon superalative. Yet even so, the reviewers barely mark the depth and narrative scope of this most meaningful of novels. Lord of Light is science fiction in genre only. A deeply humanistic novel examing the forces affecting the common man/woman, a secular novel questioning the mealy mouthed hypocrisy presenting itself as &quot;true religion&quot;, a religious novel challenging the pat truisms passing themselves off as &quot;science&quot;, it is all of these things and more.Zelazny's mastery of the written word and soul-deep understanding of the human condition vie for supremacy in this, perhaps his finest, novel. Those who have not yet read it are far, far luckier than those of us who have...maybe many times so. A joyous voyage through the subtle, textured vagaries of Zelazny's world view lies ahead. An art and artifice yet unexperienced-- a young lover's first kiss. I envy them.This is politics, religion, philosophy, comedy, tragedy, and triumph of the highest caliber. The reviewer who compared it to &quot;Dune&quot; was 100% on target. Lord of Light belongs with the greats of western literature. Perhaps I should say world literature but I am uneducated in meaningful works of other languages, thus unqualified to judge.To pigeonhole this work as science-fiction/fantasy, accurate though it may be, is equivalent to labeling &quot;Hamlet&quot; historical fiction. It is that and so, so much more.I read far to much to re-read books of fiction. I live far to little to read Lord of Light only once."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"This is one of the greatest Science Fiction books ever written. Most of the reviewers and I agree on that. I'd like to point out three areas that make this book special. 1. Characters--Zelazny gives us a range of characters that we can love, sympathize with, and suffer with. Sam, of course. For me, though, Sugata--the assassin turned enlightened one was even more real and powerful. Yama the deathgod was, in many ways, the real hero. Ever-faithful Tak. I could go on. The point is that each of these characters is fully developed and realized. This isn't a one dimensional book.(2) the plot. It's exciting yet complex. The use of flashbacks makes it hard to follow from time to time (you have to read this more than once), but it's big and it draws you in. You want Sam to win even when you know he can't.(3) the religion--the intellectual and moral battle (as well as the physical and magical battles) between Hinduism and Budhism are so compelling that I researched both religions after reading this.I just re-read LORD OF LIGHT (all right, I'm not sure what number it is any more) and it's every bit as powerful as it was when I first read it decades ago. Zelazny's best--and that's saying a lot."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Great news for Roger Zelazny freaks everywhere - &quot;Lord of Light&quot; is now BACK IN PRINT.Now you can read this 1970's masterwork saga, blurbed as one on the five best SF fantasy novels ever written, of immortal humans masquerading as gods in a high-tech Hindu pantheon, in the setting of a theme-park colonised planet.In between conspiracies, revenge, treachery and heroic battles we read of occasional touching humanitarian incidents, as we follow the adventures of the hero, Sam, the only one of the gods with a conscience. Sam uses his wits to counter the brutal destructiveness of his former colleagues and so allow civilisation and technology to take root in the benighted and medieval lives of the mortal population on the planet.I read the novel in August 1999 in the SF Masterworks series, an imprint of Orion Publishing."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"&quot;Lord of Light&quot; has been one of my favorite books since I first read it years ago. If Zelazny had never written anything else, this one novel would qualify him for immortality. It is far better and more meaningful than his Chronicles of Amber.&quot;Lord of Light&quot; follows Sam, a man (or is he a god?) who seeks to overthrow the despotic rulers of a colony world. The rulers, humans with peculiar powers who live forever by transferring their essences into new bodies, play gods in a mutated version of Hinduism. They control the means of reincarnation; those who oppose them are reborn as dogs, or worse. Sam assumes many personas in his long quest to depose the gods, and he meets fascinating characters such as Rild, the assassin sent to kill him; the death-god Yama, whose eyes drink life; Tak, the ape who is more than he seems; the goddess Kali in her many incarnations; Ratri, the goddess of the night; and Taraka, the strongest of the demons.The story is told in a long flashback, which gives Sam's quest a sense of weight and inevitability. Zelazny's style is perfectly matched to the story. Quotations from various holy texts head each chapter, offering insight into the world's culture and the religions on which the story is based.&quot;Lord of Light&quot; is a powerful story of a stuggle against tyranny. It is also a story of religion (pure and twisted), loss, love, the implications of immortality, and the meaning of humanity. I wouldn't say the book changed my life, but it gave me an understanding of holiness, of the tragedy and comedy of humanity, and of the presence of truth and beauty in seemingly unlikely places.After an incredible story, &quot;Lord of Light&quot; delivers one of the most perfect endings I have ever read; the last pages should be enshrined. The only complaints I have about the book are the typos, the comparative scarcity of female characters, and the fact that it had to end at all."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Zelazny was a very bright shooting star when he first appeared on the fantasy/SF radar some 35 years ago, a new writer of power, originality, insight, and depth. Lord of Light was his third novel, and it exemplifies all these qualities in grand style. Combining the Hindu/Buddhist mythos/religion with the science-fictional concepts of true re-incarnation via technology-enabled body swaps, set on world dominated by those who have access to the technology, and are thereby effectively real gods, this book is a powerful statement of character, philosophy, and morality.Mahasamatman, or Sam as he prefers to be called, is our protagonist for this trip through heaven, hell, and meditation, one of the original colonizing crew who has, over the centuries, fallen out of favor with the ruling coterie, who now style themselves as actually being the Hindu deities. Sam, seeing the inequitable treatment of the colonist's descendents, the forcible holding back of their attempts at technological progress, the sometimes total denigration of these people as mere objects and the cynical attitude of the ruling group towards them, decides to become a one-man army to change the status-quo by preaching the heretical philosophies of Buddha. But he finds his preaching has some unlooked-for consequences: he attracts a fanatical following and he finds it near impossible to not actually become the modern incarnation of the ancient philosopher, even though he does not totally subscribe to Buddha's philosophical outlook himself. As we delve deeper into Sam's battle with Shiva, Kali, Brahma and the rest of ruling pantheon, we are given looks at the original battle to colonize the planet, when all the crew had to develop Attributes to fight the native denizens (almost literal demons) of the planet, Attributes now part of their chosen godly character. In seeing this early period (which is highlighted by some very powerful and exciting battle descriptions), we get to see that none of these people are either totally evil or saintly, but are very human, with engaging foibles and distinctive characteristics. This is one of the main strengths of this book, as we have a large set of fully realized characters, each with their own motivations and desires, whose interactions form a complex weave of happenstance and emotional intertwinings, that give the novel a unique order and flow, and are sure to evoke multiple responses in the reader.The prose style is more than adequate to the task here, sometimes brilliantly, almost poetically descriptive, at other points understated, leaving items just slightly nebulous, ready for the reader's imagination to complete. And the religious statements will burrow into your mind, forcing little cracks of enlightenment and quiet meditation. The story is not told in linear order, which some may find a little confusing, but as each piece of the story is unfolded and wrapped into the whole, it forms a mosaic that layers in your mind, building a tightly interlocked edifice of strength and stature.Zelazny here has managed to create an archetype, a legend for modern times, with real relevance to the reader's everyday life, with a great promotion of life philosophies without preaching. Sadly, Roger is no longer with us, there will be no more of these brilliant tour-de-forces, but this will stand as one of his finest gifts to the world. A gift that everyone can enjoy and appreciate."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"\\"They called him Mahasamatman and said he was a god. He himself preferred to drop the Maha- and the -atman and called himself Sam. He never claimed to be a god, but then he never claimed not to be.\\"Lord of Light was Roger Zelazny's third novel and it won him the Hugo award for Best Novel in 1968.The story on the surface seems like diefied fantasy, based around the Hindu pantheon. Deeper in however clues are revealed as to what is truly going on. The book starts out with the introduction of Sam, or Buddha, or Siddhartha, or any of the half dozen other names he is known by. Each of the subsequent 5 chapters are flashbacks telling the story of Sam's fight against \\"Heaven\\", with the seventh and final chapter occurring chronologically after the first.Many consider this to be Zelazny's finest work. I still prefer the first Chronicles of Amber, but I can certainly see why other choose this. Once I got a grasp on how the story was being told, and began to pick up clues as to what the gods truly were the story made a lot more sense. This is a book that really makes you work.8.5 out of 10"},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"In a furturistic world somewhere in time and space, refugees from a lost Earth have established themselfves as masters of an alien planet. The original pioneers have achieved immortality of the mind through a process of thought-transference into specially grown and enhanced bodies and, over the course of centuries, have come to be regarded as Gods by the descendants of their original bodies. Only in the city of the Gods has the original Earth technology survived and progressed , while the bulk of the populace lives in a medieval world. But not all the &quot;Gods&quot; approve of the way they have chosen, and a multi-factional civil war erupts, involving Gods, men, demons (the original inhabitants of the planet) and the very forces of nature themselves. This book is one of the most riveting of any I have ever read, and I do not limit that to the Science Fiction genre. This is one of the great works of literature, and it is a tragedy that it is no longer in print. If you can find a copy, buy it, irrespective of price. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Easily my favorite Zelazny book (I've read them all) and one of my favorite books EVER by ANYBODY, Lord of Light is one of those rare books that gets better after multiple readings. Zelazny begins with a fairly standard far future society setting, and incorporates elements of Hindu mythology. The story revolves about a group of settlers on a world that have established themselves as &quot;gods&quot; above their descendants, who live in a techologically regressed state. One of these characters seeks to break the stagnation that the population is being held in by the other original settlers, each of whom has taken on the personality and aspects of a Hindu god or goddess. A rousing action story is interspersed with Eastern philosophy and religion. The story timeline is non-linear, making re-reads exceptionally satisfying"},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"There are times when reading a book you see that genius has so utterly struck the writer that all you can do it sit back and awe and marvel at how effortless it all seems. Those books unfortunately don't come often enough. This is definitely one of them. Some novels have great ideas but don't do anything with them while others have beautiful and brilliant writing but doesn't have the plot and depth of charactization to back it up and launch it into the truly masterful. Lord of Light has both. In spades. No kidding. The concept is so intrinsically SF but at the same time so radically different that fans of fantasy, world literature and who knows what else can sit down and enjoy it. Like I said, the concept is a fairly simple one at its heart: a bunch of people colonize a planet and eventually use their technology to essentially act like gods. In this case they set themselves up as the Hindu pantheon and through science give themselves powers that sure as heck seem like magic and divine abilities, switch bodies (reincarnation of course) and basically lord over everyone over the centuries. Except for one person, the one called Buddha among other things but who mostly wants to be called Sam. His quest to lay the gods low makes up the center of the book but the story isn't linear at all, which is probably where most people get stuck. Most of the story is told in flashback and they tend to jump all around, with a few clues to give the reader any idea where they might be. Some people might find this annoying, those people probably don't like books that make them think. The joy of this novel is watching all the threads unfurl slowly like petals on a flower, telling bits of the story until just when you think everything is known, Zelazny ties it all up. Just about everything about this book is perfect, from the use of the gods, to the personalities, to the sometimes achingly beautiful descriptions that stop just short of being overdetailed, to the rousing battle scenes, this is a book lesser writers would have insisted on making a bombastic bloated trilogy but he packs all the power and pathos of the concept into barely three hundred pages. Almost universally recognized as a masterpiece you owe it to yourself to at least try and discover this book. Once you're inside the rewards never seem to stop coming."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"This is the first Roger Zelazny book I read, and it's still the best. It's very complicated because of the Hindu and Buddhist names, characters and concepts, all imposed on an alien world that is both advanced and primitive technologically. To make it more confusing, Zelazny tells the middle of the story first, then the beginning, then the end (Part II, then Part I, then Part III chronologically). But it's an amazing read, with vivid characters and locations and a great story."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"I found the beginning of the book a little confusing, butit comes together very quickly. Zelazny builds a fantasticworld, without stopping to explain how this or that thingworks or came about. Only few pull this off very well (forinstance Gibson does in Neuromancer), and Zelazny isamongst them. There are some nice thoughts on mythologyand religion, plenty of action and a number of interestingcharacters all packed into under 300 pages. For thoseunfamiliar with Hinduism, it does help to look up the differentdeities in Wikipedia, although the book makes sense without it."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"I picked up the book and didnt put it down. I read it when I ate, walked, before going to bed and I would have read it while working if I could have. I read it non stop till I finished it. And even that didnt prevent me from going back to intriguing passages to read it again.This is a hyrbid work between a science fiction and fantasy. Actually contains the best of both. Being very familiar with the Hindu pantheon, it was astonishing that he did what he did with it, and even more inspiring for he brought out the best and the worst of it and still left you without a bias or a new thing to worship. I would highly recommend it for anyone with a taste for a juxtapositioning of concepts."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Zelazny successfully weaves a tale of the far-future in which a form of quasi-immortality is achieved by transferring one's mind to new bodies. The ruling elite utilizes a mindreading technology to review the quality of one's life, and this is used to reward or punish a person with either a better or worse form. In effect, science has discovered the means to mirror the Hindu concepts of karma and reincarnation.These technologies are used to solidify the power of the Deicrats, the ruling elite of the planet. Morality is secondary to how well one supports their grip on power. Those who oppose the structure are destroyed. Those who are in power, the ones who hoped to style themselves after gods, are driven by the same dark emotions that have powered mankind through history: ambition, jealosy and greed. This story is about Sam, a man forced to choose between joining with this system of power, or rebelling against it.While this is a relatively short book (by modern science-fiction standards), it is also dense reading. Slogging through the first chapter and a half is necessary before things really start to click along.This is a novel that is rich with ideas. It demonstrates the harm that can be caused by caste systems borne out technological haves and have-nots. It portrays the classic theme of &quot;absolute power corrupts absolutely,&quot; but also shows that goodness exists within a few humans to oppose corruption. It does both of these against a unique, Hindu-inspired backdrop supported by the necessary science.Your enjoyment of this book will probably be driven by the type of science-fiction reader you are. If you want something heavy on ideas and milieu, you will probably love this. If you want something that is more character-driven, this may not satisfy you as much. Despite its shortness, you may find yourself downshifting your reading-gears: dialogues often consist of a dozen or more lines of unattributed text--and characters don't speak in particularly unique voices. Some characters are known by multiple names, which I found initially confusing. Despite this, I can't imagine that anyone interested in speculative fiction could be fluent in the genre without exposure to this fascinating tale."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"This book is the finest example of what Roger Zelazny did best: synthesize fantasy and reality into something truly breathtaking in scope. Any science fiction fan MUST read all of his works, including the popular Amber series, and especially his short stories. Zelazny even 'co-wrote' a book with Alfred Bester- 'Psychoshop.'But standing as his crowing achievement is 'Lord Of Light.' I have read it over and over across the years and take something new from it each time. My most recent read left me impressed with his intentionally sketchy description of how 'attributes' and 'aspects' were developed by the colonists. So is this a novel of science fiction or fantasy? Both? It depends on how you interpret the concepts presented.The religious imagery and references are also compelling. By presenting the sole 'christian' as a fanatic dressed all in black, and casting 'demons' as allies (sometimes) of the protagonist, one is left to ponder Zelazny's own views on religion. And, of course, the casting of the Hindu religion's gods and pantheon as supremely powerful high-tech immortal mutants is a stroke of genius. You will never forget Yama, Brahma, Kali, Tak the ape, and of course Mahasamatman.This book always causes me to think about life, death, 'life after death', and the possibilities of science, both good and bad. What will humans be like in the future? Will they continue to repeat the mistakes of the past?The truth is that Zelazny presents these future humans as just that: human. Throughout the chronicles of Sam we see the workings of the more emotional aspects of human consciousness-- such as love, lust, duty, jealousy, anger, and the power of a single human will. And by the end of the book it is clear that these are the things that truly matter; much more so than high-tech weaponry and amazing mutant psychic powers.Thanks Roger."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"I first read this book in the late 60's when it came out, and was intrigued by Zelazny's blending of myth, fantasy and science fiction. I've just re-read it and it remains as fresh and incisive as it seemed then.Loosely incorporating Hindu myths and legends, Zelazny weaves the tale of a would be Buddha's revolt against an authoritarian pantheon of gods on a Terran colonized planet. Prayer wheels have evolved into pray-o-mats that take coin or plastic cards, reincarnation is achieved by bioengineering but controlled by gods, the world contains nonhuman sentient energy wraiths that are called Rakashas, or demons. While taking liberties with the originals, and providing scientific explanations for their aspects, attributes and avatars, Zelazny still manages to capture the flavor of the historical Siddhartha and early Buddhism's challenge to an aging and sclerotic religo-political hierarchy This won the Hugo when it was first published in 1967 and remains a classic."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Words do no describe the ride that is this book.Jungles. Gods. Buddhas. Demons bound below. This takes 2nd Foundation to a whole new level.Roger Zelazny demonstrates his mastery with this incredible little book. It provides a spiritual journey, among other things, and a picture of a whole world, a political battle. But there's more to it than flower petals on giant stone idols. There's action. It starts small, and builds up to momentous, incredible, panoramic.. He really takes your imagination and stretches it HARD.His characters display a certain amount of wit and brilliance. Their speech is laden with wisdom. The book is quite believeable, which is rare for a sci fi book laden with so much mysticism.

I've decided to cover all the vital books in my life, whether I actually loved them or simply found them enlightening. Not always the same case. In this case they are.Sam is the clearest example of an enigmatic Everyman that I have ever encountered in sci fi. And his allies are as cool as his enemies.On top of that the storytelling is wholly engrossing. I had to work at understanding the characters, and plot, and meaning.

It sparked an interest in mythology as well as being a good read. Zelazny's stories are brilliant"},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"What if people landed on another planet (albeit very much like India), and mastered the technology to transform into gods in the Hindu pantheon? By such skill, what if they tamed demons, nature, and other humans so as to force them into paying homage and making \\"donations\\" via slot machines, as prayer wheels made \\"pray-o-mats,\\" to perpetuate the rule of the gods and to enforce obedience by their subjects to ensure a good rebirth, thanks to \\"psych-probes\\" able to check for dogmatic conformity and karmic approval?Roger Zelazny's Hugo-award winning 1967 novel blends the fantasy of epic battles, with a great confrontation in Hellwell as the centerpiece among many contentions well-told, with a SF veneer. This sums up how machinery might advance what meditation alone might not for a cadre of Firsts, colonists from a doomed earth who build their technocracy as \\"Deicrats.\\" They repel the Marxist-tinged efforts of humanist inventors and innovators to re-invent printing presses and weapons and know-how to spur progress against the Deicrats, as dissident \\"accelerationists.\\"This slow struggle over eons, as Zelazny tells it in a dense, wry, wordy style more akin to Hindu scriptures than your typical fantasy-SF tale (even if cynical gods smoke cigarettes and crafty humans try to invent a flushable toilet), brings Sam into the tale, as a Buddhist model of rebellion against the hierarchical oppression. Yet, he's not exactly the Buddha, and his ambiguous position allows him to manipulate his mission to his own advantage and that of the humans he champions.It demands concentration, but rewards attention. Zelazny expects you to keep up with the shape-shifting antagonists who thwart Sam, who goes through his own considerable changes. Chapters flow into each other even if separated in time by immense distances; the gods keep their reign strong, as Sam tries to recruit defectors from the Celestial City to aid him in overthrowing divine despotism. I did wish for more reactions or actions from the vantage point of the humbler men and women, not to mention those Christianized zombies in Nirriti's army, an odd touch indeed. The concentration on Sam's club of Firsts does tilt the action always upward or downward to hell, and what's happening to the successors earthlings (as it were?) gets relegated to what happens to extras in a big-screen epic (the story of its attempted filming makes a great footnote to the CIA in the 1979 Iran hostage crisis).One slight drawback is that this novel is conveyed in a prose style that may discourage readers, as its elevated, verbose, if slightly mocking tone echoes ancient chronicles more than it does a typical paperback published around the Summer of Love! (Not enough to take a full star away here, but it may lessen its impact for some readers not expecting such an intricately constructed story within a book that at first glance looks short.)Still, insights prove memorable, amidst the deities bickering and plotting and scheming. Science depends on the known, fantasy on the unknowable: \\"The four points of the compass be logic, knowledge, wisdom and the unknown. Some do bow in that final direction. Others advance upon it. To bow before the one is to lose sight of the three. I may submit to the unknown, but never to the unknowable. The man who bows in that direction is either a saint or a fool. I have no use for either.\\" So says Sam early on.The Enlightened One tells Kali: \\"The religion by which you rule is very ancient, goddess, but my protest is also that of a venerable tradition. So call me a protestant, and remember--now I am more than a man.\\" With the great demon Taraka, Zelazny allows himself to enrich this character, perhaps as Milton did Lucifer: we see guilt emerge as Taraka aligns himself against heaven with Sam, and this chapter turns vivid as their perspectives merge. \\"His hell was a many-colored place, somewhat mitigated only by the cold-blue blaze of a scholar's intellect, the white light of a dying monk, the rose halo of a noble lady who fled his sight, and the dancing, simple colors of children at play.\\"In one mighty showdown, the land is ravaged by heavenly hosts, demons, zombies, and men all warring. Zelazny edges into a massive scene, and prepares us in fitting words. \\"It is said that each day recapitulates the history of the world, coming up out of darkness and cold into confused light and beginning warmth, consciousness jumbling its eyes somewhere in midmorning, awakening thoughts a jumble of illogic and unattached emotion, and all speeding together toward the order of noontide, the slow, poignant decline of dusk, the mystical vision of twilight, the end of entropy that is night once more.\\"This is a memorable narrative, and one of the only ones I can think of that takes on theological questions from a cyclical, Eastern orientation over such an immense scale of story and imaginative application of concepts. It deserves its place among SF classics, and despite its difficulty, proves a rewarding climb up its lofty heights."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"After reading mention of this book in a (ahem) B&N; newsletter, I picked up the copy from my local library to read. Lord of Light was not what I expected. But then, I don't remember reading any Zelazny that was what I expected.What I discovered was an intensely human story of a struggle for freedom from oppression. Zelazny's use of the Hindu pantheon (mostly) was interesting, although \\"the gods\\" didn't seem quite right, in the sense they didn't behave much like gods.Four of the main characters are introduced in the beginning of the story: Sam, Yama, Ratri, and Tak. They are all quite believable, at least to me. Zelazny used dialogue effectively and his mode of description is quite literate.One thing I'll warn about is that the first part of the book required me to stick with it. I believed there would be more story as I worked through the book and there was. But it took a bit of work to get there -- it was worth it. Another bit to be aware of is that the timeline is disjointed. I was well into the second part of the book before I realized there was a time shift and I didn't sleep through part of the story.If you stick with the book, though, you'll be rewarded with a fine story of human weakness, strength, struggle, and sacrifice. It's worth the effort. There are reasons why Zelazny is considered one of the elder gods of science fiction.

While it's not exactly hard-core SF, it's an entertaining read, full of surprises, epic moments, and memorable characters.I was recommended this book by a friend who said I remind him of Yama (the God of Death character in this book).

Zelazny was a master of one of the special joys of SF: the joy of figuring out what is going on. (note that in the first Amber novel, the narrator has amnesia and you are right there with him figuring out what is going on....) At first glance Lord of Light might seem a religious mish mash, but in fact is a techno/politico masterpiece (a really wild technolgy but not so unfamiliar politics...) Combined with the out of order chapters, it is easy to see how someone who had not read much science ficture could find this book incomprehensible. But it will give great enjoyment to the more experienced reader, (and re-reader.)"},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Got your Eastern Gods straight? If not, you'll find slow sledding at the beginning of Roger Zelazny's science fiction classic, LORD OF LIGHT. Once you're into it, however, you will appreciate the philosophy and the mythology equally. As a bonus, Zelazny provides some interesting battle scenes, too.In one episode, a demon possesses the protagonist of many name's (I'll use Sam here, as that's the easiest) body, giving Zelazny an opportunity to riff on the extended metaphor of our innate capacities for good and evil. The purely evil demon gets his comeuppance when Sam gives him the \\"gift\\" of guilt, which sure ruins a lot of his debauchery and drunken pleasures.Ultimately, with gods dying and coming back to life in new bodies and with everyone switching sides in the epic battle of the heavens, my interest began to wane a bit. Just a bit. But you'll like this without fail if you are a fan of science fiction and are conversant in Eastern mythologies.My hope is that the AMBER series will now be republished in ten separate editions. Presently there's a big book of AMBER with all ten novels in one tome, but it's too unwieldy and teens who love science fiction and fantasy especially are shortchanged, as they seldom take to such formats. I hope, with the new issues of LORD OF LIGHT, that the publisher will now republish the much-loved AMBER series as well, starting with the beloved NINE PRINCES OF AMBER."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"At the top of the Sci-Fi pile is Dune, some people will disagree of course, but generally, there it sits. What comes next is even more debatable, but for me there are 2 books that really stand out; Lord of Light and Tiger,Tiger (opps sorry - The Stars my Destination) by Alfred Bester (no not the Telepath in Babylon 5!).I have read Lord of Light over 30 times (easily, I 1st read it in 1974!), when I'm bored and can't be bothered to start a new novel, out it comes. It's a small gem of a book; it borders the line between Sci-Fi and Fantasy and can easily sit in both. In all this time no author has matched (imho) Zelanzy for using magic/magic like powers in novels.The idea is very simple, and follows an old adage by A.C.Clarke (I believe) concerning sufficiently advanced technology and magic/god like powers. Here some people with all the technology start believing they are gods, in this case from Hindu faith.Like many of his books the protagonist really doesn't want to get into the situation they gets into, he's happy with his world until someone decides that a change is required which of course directly affects him!!!The writing is pure Zelanzy, very direct with no excessive/ott descriptions; romantic and charming; and just plain sneaky with people change situations, alliances and it all, just works perfectly. In some respects the writing style remains me of Herman Hesse (though from a literary point of view even Zelanzy has to bow down to Herr Hesse) and unlike Dune (and like Stars my Destination) it's microcosm, (and of course relatively short).Of course other fans prefer the (excellent) Amber series, or even This Immortal, but for me it's Lord of Light followed by his take on the Ancient Egyptian gods; Creatures of Light and Darkness (when are they going to re-release this one so I can replace my coverless copy?), even more outrageous I've only read this about 20 times!

It would help if you knew something of the Hindu and Buddhist beliefs. I was suspicious at first that the author would write and write and write and then end the book without finishing it, if you know what I mean. I HATE it when a writer does that. Rest assured that Roger Zelazny finishes what he starts. If you want proof, then read his book This Immortal. It too, is a great book but way easier to read than Lord of Light. Zelazny is a fantastic writer. The images he creates in you might are nothing short of spectacular. When the book was written in 1967 motion picture special effects were not up to the task. Now though, in 2002, after Lord of the Rings, I wonder..."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"I first purchased this book in college in the late 60's. I knew nothing of the author, but the cover looked interesting and proclaimed it had won the Hugo Award. Little did I know whatan adventure awaited. If I were to make a list of my ten favorite books of all time, this would be on the list. Read and reread."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Zelazny is one of those wonderful authors who like to give you a wink and a nudge right in the middle of his science fiction musings. A version of a comedian saying, \\"Stay with me folks.\\" If you just read over the last word of chapter one, you will not realize that most of the rest of the book is a flashback. Come prepared: It would not hurt if you read up on the Hindu religion, mythology, and philosophy, since Roger assumes every-body knows these subjects. Also, there is no explanation how the characters got themselves in the ridiculous situation they are in, and who take themselves way to seriously. Zelazny's work is worth the read, especially with his breezy writing style. N.B. This book received the 1968 Hugo Award for Best Novel, something I cannot agree with, because it is so obscure in its' background, and the assumption the western reader knows much about Hinduism."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"I recently reread Lord of Light. It is even more incredible than I remembered. It left me wanting more though-- a book twice as long-- a sequel! There is so much left to be told-- that could have been told. I guess that's the mark of a great book. Everything that makes Zelazny great is in this book-the philosophy, the adventure, the fantasy, the science fiction, the gods and the humans evolving into higher states, corruption of power, Light and Death, and lots of engaging characters. I loved Sam of course, but Yama steals the show! Tak is great-- as is the wiley Ganesha. So many twists and turns and surprises await just when you think you see what's coming. After all the imitations, this book is still fresh and free and full of wonder.I think this must be his greatest book"},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"A banished charismatic rebel is sought by a small group of desperate freedom fighters. This rebel leader turns out to be 'Sam', sometimes called the Binder. The story revolves around Sam and the things he's done, or might do.Sam once failed to tear down the corrupt planetary system of government and was thrown into exile. The story really takes off when Sam is rescued and brought back by the group who want him to try his revolt again.Flashbacks and history of the rebel movement weave a compelling look at immortality, power, religion used as deception and the tyranny of secret science.The master work of Roger Zelazny is as fresh today as it was when originally written.If you love any of Zelazny's work, this book is a must for your library."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"While similar in premise to some of his other tales of worldshaking technological demigods, this book has some additional moral elements. Zelazny offers them plainly, evoking a feeling of religious historicism that makes some of the shinier platitudes more appropriate. He achieves this with decorous dialogue and a marvelous and nearly timeless portrayal of technological 'miracles' that are unfathomable to the hairy-knuckled masses. The sympathetic and chain-smoking antihero is also present, driving the archetypical story along a delineated route of demon-dealing and decadence. Zelazny's wordcraft is excellent, and this book should be well received by all but the most technophiliac of science fiction connoisseurs."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"I do not know much about Hinduism, and perhaps someone with a degree in comparative religion could find fault with this book (or perhaps appreciate it more). All I can say is that I found it highly entertaining and absolutely fascinating."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"...on a distant world, where tyrants in control of superior technologies have taken on the roles of the Hindu pantheon--until one among them resurrects Buddhists teachings to fight for independence. Marvelous, and philosophically provocative far beyond just a good sci fi read."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"It is a rare author who manages to so completely delve into all the ramifications of everything he writes about that one actually finds one's own personal philosophies called into question, deconstructed, and ultimately remade -not by the author's thoughts, nor by his words, but rather by one's own thoughts, and the struggle to fit these thoughts into words one can only find paltry. In a sense, Zelazny has already done your thinking, your self-exploration, for you, and he has done so in an often amazingly poetic fashion. With myself at least, this book, along with the Amber series and the characters therein, struck a chord, a deep one; so it was that every paragraph was accompanied within myself, not by a sense of questioning, but rather a sense of growing realization. Far from being a barrier to - or a poor representation of - actuality, his words are a perfectly transparent conduit; without attempting to impose himself, without having to shout, but also without apology, he (Zelazny-as-character) introduces and explains himself, more clearly and fully than many an acclaimed poet or philosopher. Allow your thoughts to fly off on the most wild tangents imaginable; this is what they are meant to do. If, reading this, you do not know what my next statement means, I encourage you strongly to find out: Reading this book is the closest you or I may come to setting foot upon the Pattern of Amber."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Have you read 'Dune', 'Stranger in a Strange Land', 'Shogun', 'Lord of the Rings'?

If that isn't enough to get you to start searching for this book, I don't know what is. I loved how Zelazny makes you feel the character. You experience the same experiences that Sam does. It is a shame this novel is out of print. This is a classic of not only science fiction, but of fiction. This novel inspired me to learn the Hindu religion, so I could understand the book better. It has been five years, since I last read this great novel. Final words of advice: Never lend this book out! People have a tendancy to &quot;misplace&quot; this book once they borrow it.

Don't takeoffense to the liberties Zelazny takes in the portrayals of Hinduism, Buddhism and Christianity andyou will learn much about yourself whatever your beliefs are.Oh, and it also contains the greatest play on words/pun that has ever been used.

I'm not knocking entertainment, but when it is combined with insight and intelligence, then you've really got something. I'm the first to admit that Zelazny often paints scenes with a pointilistic detail that sometimes reads more like a director talking to a cinematographer after a long night in the pub, but I'll grant him that small fault for the brilliant commentary on relgion, decadence, and the ambivalence of heros. It's one thing to give your life for a cause, but would you also give your self respect?I think this book makes its points without hitting you over the head with them. If you can find the meaning without having it spelled out for you, then you will enjoy it. If you're looking for messages in neon, don't bother.I loved this book for its contradictions. My experience of life is that it often doesn't make sense, people are not simply good or bad, and there are very few situations free from ambiguity. If you want a George Lucas style neatly tailored space yarn, this book is not for you. But if you've read Sartre, then this book belongs in your mind and your library."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Zelazny won the Hugo for this book; for once I agree the award was right. This is his most brilliant book, a terrific blend of mythos and technology.The former crew on this colony world rules the former passengers as gods rule peasants. Through technology, they have achieved many aspects of godhood, including reincarnation, terrifying weapons and psi powers by which they can kill with a look. The religion chosen for this more-than-theocracy is Hinduism.Former crew Sam, while he likes his worldly pleasures, revolts against his peers, and casts himself as Buddha against the theocracy (as well as filling prayer machines with slugs, allying himself with the indigenous creatures and engaging in enough apocalyptic battles to satisfy the most jaded Robert Jordan fan). As Siddhartha and the Mahasamatman he sows the seeds that threaten to bring down the theocracy. And he demonstrates that even the most insincere Buddha can have true converts, true believers, and that the power of religion transcends its uses.With a wonderful storyline, replete with flashbacks and plot twists, Zelazny crafts an absolutely terrific story. The book has no weak points.This was the first book to base a world on a technologically rationalized mythos. Zelazny attempted it later in &quot;Creatures of Light and Darkness,&quot; using the Egyptian mythos, but the book is much less successful. &quot;Lord of Light&quot; is the struggle of Buddhism against militant Hinduism, where technology, not spiritualism, rules. But it's the plot, the characterization and Zelazny's wonderful ironic tone that make this an exceptional book.It's great to see this book back in print. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"This is a hard book to summarize. I have read it perhaps 10 times over the years, and each time it rewards. Like \\"Creatures of Light and Darkness\\", \\"Lord of Light\\" is basically a story about gods and as such the characters are both individuals and abstract forces, the writing neatly reflecting Zelazny's tale of humans who can \\"put on aspects\\" and raise themselves up beyond any mere technological enhancement. The storyline is non-linear, jumping forwards and backwards in time, and both needs and rewards close attention. The writing is beautiful and evocative, almost poetic and more approachable than \\"Creatures\\". If there is a single weakness, it is that the book is anti-climactic. But otherwise, this is one of the best sci-fi/fantasy works ever. Just go read it."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"I've always considered &quot;Lord of Light&quot; (1967) one of the hardest of Zelazny's SF novels to follow. The story line weaves and doubles back upon itself. Gods and mortals are reborn into new bodies, and it's a bit hard to keep track of who's who, especially at novel's end. Zelazny's hero, Sam has many reincarnations and many names including Mahasamatman, Maitreya (&quot;Lord of Light&quot;), Binder of Demons, Buddha, and Siddhartha.Sam is part of the original crew from &quot;The Star of India,&quot; many of whom borrowed the names, attributes, and aspects from the Hindu pantheon of gods as the new planet was wrested from its original inhabitants. Many of the crew, not unreasonably, discover that they enjoy godhood. They build themselves a heaven and set about ruling the peasants through their priest-mouthpieces. Any signs that the lower classes are re-acquiring their technological heritage, such as the reinvention of the printing press are thoroughly squelched. The gods are in charge of reincarnation, and if someone incurs the displeasure of Heaven in his current life, he may (as one of the gods puts it) find himself reincarnated as a gelded water buffalo.Sam believes that the lower classes should be given the benefit of technology, and along with a group of like-minded gods called 'accelerationists' sets out to challenge the more conservative deities. There are several wars (which are not told in sequence) and Sam repeatedly incurs the wrath of Heaven. He responds with Promethean defiance, even as he is about to die the true death: &quot;I will hate Heaven with every breath that I draw. If Brahma has me burnt, I will spit into the flames...&quot;Finally he reinvents an old religion, borrowed from the distant memory of Earth. In order to lessen the influence of the Hindu pantheon, he becomes a monk who is understood by some to be the Buddha.Sam loses this phase of the war, too, and becomes truly disembodied.But did he really lose? The beliefs of Buddhism and accelerationism remain and thrive among men. Bifocals are reinvented. When Sam's atman (soul) is reincarnated into one final body by the death god, Yama, he renews his titanic struggle against a weakened Heaven.Zelazny's writing style tends to vary between the formal when he is deviating from the 'present,' and a livelier tone when he is narrating Sam's current adventures. When the tone is detached and archaic, such as &quot;...This is the story of how the prince did bait the one-armed receiver of devotions before the Temple...&quot; then the reader can assume that Zelazny is abandoning the straight-line narrative for a bit of history essential to the plot.&quot;Lord of Light&quot; is sometimes confusing, but this Hugo-award-winning novel is bursting with inventive detail and thought-provoking ideas on the necessity for reinventing religions. Above all it has Sam: Zelazny's eternal rebel against everything that smacks of conservatism and oppression."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"_Lord of Light_ by Roger Zelazny is one of those great sci-fi books where the author compresses his vision into one stand-alone work rather than spread his tale out over a number of serialized books in order to make more money. The result is a super-potent, literary sci-fi novel with all the makings of a great American classic. This book is clearly influenced by the 1960's eastern philosophical/psychedelic movement and it has a legitimate, scholarly view of Hindu religious philosophy. It is complex, thought-provoking, and profound, and unlike most sci-fi, it truly challenges the reader intellectually. Any fan of sci-fi absolutely MUST read this book, and I also highly recommend it to people who are not even fans of the genre. _Lord of Light_ is one of those rare books that will cross the boundries of genre and eventually be considered among the timeless classics of American literature."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"I've read a lot of sci-fi/fantasy over the years, and Zelazny remains one of my favourite authors. His style may not suit everyone: the pace can be quick and he often gives you brief allusions to things you never hear much more about. It's a part of the way he creates a world, by giving his characters a story and a history beyond that which is set down in the actual novel.Zelazny didn't always get it right - for example, I found \\"Eye of Cat\\" very hard to follow - but I think he's done it perfectly in \\"Lord of Light\\". It gives a powerful beauty and poignancy to both the beginning and the end of the novel, while the imagination and presentation of the magic/technology remains as consistent and fresh today as when he wrote the novel in the 1960s. This novel has a permanent place on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Arthur C. Clarke once commented that any sufficiently advanced technology was indistinguishable from magic. That had to have been on Zelazny's mind when he wrote this classic SF novel, in which a bunch of former space travelers play the Hindu pantheon, lording over a pre-industrial planet. Zelazny's point seems to be that the myths have power unto themselves; events play out with the force of archetype and the human/gods lose some of their free will as the old stories play themselves out. (Remember H.G. Wells 'Men Like Gods'?) The story focuses mostly on Sam, an exile from the heavenly community, who incarnates himself (they've beaten death) as the Buddha and starts a spiritual movement against Heaven. A highly original and thought-provoking work of far-future SF!"},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"What should one do as soon as he finishes reading this novel?Read it again straight away.Why should this novel be read again straight away?Because Roger Zelazny decided not to name Chapter 1 \\"6600 years after Colonization Day\\", Chapter 2 \\"4800 years after Colonization Day\\" and so forth. He has also given his colonists-turned-gods various names and nicknames, so one may get lost during the first reading and due to his attempt to follow the story, may miss the fine writing which would be a big shame.Is there a better one on one fighting scene than the one between Sugata and Yama in the middle of the novel?The fight in the book This Immortal between Conrad and the robot is perhaps the one that tops this one. Not accidentally, This Immortal was also written by Zelazny.Is the Lord of Light a novel of despair or hope?It depends on your understanding of it. Personally, regardless of the way the novel ends, I find it disturbing, because, out of the possible hundreds of thousands of possible future transmutations of the human race, the one Zelazny describes is one of the plausible ones.Why is Lord of Light not as popular, as let's say, Dune?It's not linear and as said above, it demands a second reading. However, I am pretty certain that is one of the most popular second reading novels in the world.Almost, half a century after its publication, can nowadays majority of Hugo winners and nominees be compared to Lord Of Light?This has to be answered with the initials of Zelazny's novel: LOL."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Few times in our lifetime do we get a chance to experience the depth of a book's utter visionary perimeter; few times are we allowed to actually get a glimpse a living work of art which has altered the consciousness of an entire generation. Lord of Light, by Roger Zelazny, is such a work.When I first read this book around 1969 -- an avowed SF fan of hundreds of authors -- I couldn't place why this novel had left me with such a void of expression and literal mouth gaping mezmerized astonishment. It led me to research ancient Hinduism and discover socio-political religious movements -- and even later practice Buddhist meditation itself.Yet, most of all it gave me a personal sense of caring for the Truth in organizations of men, where freedoms of action and speech are paramount; it gave me an impetus of speaking out, which stands with me today. It gave a young man a vision and articulation of what was right about the world around me and what was wrong -- and the courage to speak up against wrongs -- and the vision of poetic harmony in a work of art no less than that of a Modigliani painting or the greatest of love stories or poems. All from a science fiction novel? Such is Roger Zelazny's Lord of Light!This novel is a masterpiece of masterpieces; it has survived 43 years of printings simply because of the massive Jungian archetypical truths it evokes in us all -- and engenders in each of us as a herald, a new vision of life and living. Of acceptance. Of dealing with those aspects of life which appear to be dominating, but in fact we can turn into advantage, if we are desirous.With this novel Roger Zelazny took Science Fiction into a new era with the exploration of myth and history as it would culminate itself into the present. SF was never the same thereafter.The Novel's love story is the crux of its internal action. It is a three way power play lover story between two powerful men and a most powerful woman, all of whom are pridefully larger than life. Its backdrop is nothing less than the creation of a new planet's civilization and future.The power of this story, placed into the Past-which-will-become-the-future-of-Earth traces a path tread by the Lion in Winter merged with the full epic story of Dune series. Yet, it could very well be about you and me.The novel takes us to the epiphany of our inner-selves, our hopes and dreams and, our failures and success but, in the end, the good news is: Love faileth never.Read this book. You will be enlightened."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"In addition to being a rip-roaring good story, this is an excellent primer on Hinduism and Buddhism. (Not for strictly accurate detail, but for the feel and genius of two fine religious traditions.) The heroes are Sam Kalkin, who becomes the Buddha, and the Death-god, Yama. The villains are Brahma and his crowd, whose god-like powers have gone to their heads, and Renfrew Nirriti, the proselytizer who is willing to ally himself with anyone, no matter how evil, to force his religious views on others. (Nirriti means \\"not right.\\")This is not merely Zelazny's best, but one of the best books of the twentieth century. It ranks with Heinlein'sStranger in a Strange Land, Panshin'sRite of Passage, Butler'sParable of the SowerandParable of the Talentsand Card'sEnder's Game (The Ender Saga); and only slightly below Pangborn's Davy.watziznaym@gmail.com"},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"This is one of the best sci-fi/fantasy novels written in the 60th. The book is somewhat complicated, so here are the few plot clues for the readers who don't want to read it twice to understand the novel. First chapter of the book is really one of the last ones. Then, starting from chapter 2 is where the story really begins. The hero of the book, Sam is one of the few immortals ( the action takes place on some planet, where few people has access to long forgotten technology, which makes them rulers &quot;gods&quot; of the normal people living on the planet) who fights against other rulers of the world to allow regular people lives to be better. So, he must face the wrath of &quot;gods&quot; and survive against all odds to help people.

This story works on many levels, making it enjoyable to a wide audience. Its works as an adventure novel, a mythological fable, and as hard sci-fi with a sharp edge of social conscience. The characters are well developed throughout the story, but only late in the plot line do we really begin to understand their true motivations. And from start to finish, there's enough mystery, intrigue, and action to satisfy most anyone. In the end, the story works as a parable illustrating the greed, and lust for power common in human nature and history. It shows as well, that the true motivation of our &quot;heroes&quot; is seldom what it appears on the surface to be.

The language is fluid, often times poetic, and ultimately a feast for the senses. The story spans many years and depicts the epic struggle of one man who could have been god, against all those who now rule the world with an intolerant fist. Technology is precious, and hidden from the general populace who are forced to live in a sort of perpetual Dark Age so that the gods they worship may continue the turpitude that is their tyranny.

I like SCIENCE in my science fiction, and I like fantasic environments, strong characters and unique magic in my fantasies.Lord of Light was recommended to me by two seperate people when they found out I like science fiction. THey asked what types of science fiction I like and what authors. Both these people are widely read in science fiction, and were familiar with all the authors and books I names, such as Heinline, Asimov, C.J. Cherryh, Clark, Peter Hamilton, Jules Verne, ect, so when they both recommended this book, I was excited to have a new book to read. I have to say I was very disappointed. In my opinion, Lord of Light IS NOT science fiction, but fantasy, and in the realm of fantasy, I find it poorly done. There is no hard science, but rather a convoluted mix of religion and sketchy technology, so in my opinion, that is a big fat fail on the science fiction scale. As a fantasy, it has sterotypical, shallow characters, a exagerated and cartoonish religious system rather than a unique magic system, and the world is barely rendered in minimal description, very minimal.The plot is very confusing, but not terribly hard to figure out, as it skips around in time without explination, warning or identifying marks. I also found the plot rather predictable. Information regarding past, present or future happenings is something discussed in rather lengthy conversations that I found unnnecessary and boring. THe characters are barely described, and we are given a list of attributes, almost litterally, a list, a paragraph of sentences depicting physique, accessaries, attitude. I find this rather lazy writing. This book is all tell and no show. I'm told what is going on or what something looks like rather than shown, and as a result, I felt zero involvement in the plot or characters,cared not at all for any of them, and ended up skimming the last parts of it to be done with it.I was also irritated by the only female \\"god\\" and only real attempt at a female character in the book. She has gone from young, slender and beautiful to older, \\"matronly\\", \\"manly\\" in facial feature and over weight, a transormation that is depicted as unfavorable. She is a goddess of \\"love\\" and her temple is essential a whore house, and actually called a whore house, to which she takes minimal and fussy offense, although in the very next moment, she relents saying she cannot remain angry with the offender and proceeds to continue eating. At one point she says it takes all her lessened powers to \\"put on a pleasing form\\", and she says it regretfully as if it is of great importance during their struggles and evasions and offensives against the powers that be. This book was written many years ago, but I still find such renderings of women irritating and it detracted form an already lacking story.The only thing the story really had going for it was an interesting mix of religion and technology that could have made for a facinating read if it had been fleshed out and presented better. The bits of the story I did linger and read with interest were the descriptions of the strange religious machines or prayer generators. But a 5 star sci-fi novel? For this reader, not even close."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"A surprisingly good book, given its inherently problematic nature: a group of white people pretend to be Hindu gods on another planet. Yet Zelazny appears to have done his research, creating a rich world and using the character of Siddhartha to skillfully question the ways of the \\"gods\\". The world rang true, to my admittedly limited experience of Asia, but that's more than some books about Asia manage. Lord of Light is a book that wears its problematic nature on its sleeve, and opens itself for the attendant discussion. Also, it tells a good story."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"this book is absolutely amazing. and trust me, i have read many, many books, and i do not lightly say this. lord of light is one of the best books ever written. now, in the some of the other reviews, people said it was tedious and a bad book. that is because they are rather stupid- one can tell from their writing style. this book is amazing in the way that at first it is rather confusing and boring. it doesn't occupy you in the first two chapters at all, but as you continue reading a picture is painted for you, a picture that doesn't make very much sense until you finish reading, and even then it may not make complete sense. you are left with a sense of wonder, of excitement, and a feeling of understanding, although you do not quite know what it is you understand. i find it impossible to tell exactly what this book is about, for i myself really do not know. i just understand it on a deeper level. but to tell you a bit about it...it is the battle over time between the gods and the common men, whom are led by a great leader, sam. sam, who could be a god, but is not one (at least not officially). sam, who is more a god than the &quot;real&quot; gods. this book has so many vivid and incredibly real characters that it is impossible to describe. this is a MUST READ, but don't expect to finish reading it and move on. you must continue to think about it, to make connections, in order to get this book. and that is what is the greatest triumph of it: it grinds itself into your mind, haunting you, for it presents you with concepts and ideas that fascinate you. i promise you, you will reread it again and again and continue to find more connections, more insights. now i'm going to end this- i'm rereading lord of light again."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Zelazny's Lord of Light came recommended as the best book in a friend's science fiction library of several thousand volumes. I'm mystified. It's good, of course, especially the character development that electrifies the few quiet moments between its many bombastic battles. In a two-page dialog between former lovers, for example, Zelazny provides a chillingly sensual picture of how a life spanning many incarnations would skew one's moral compass. But to me the book just wasn't tight enough to put it above works like Ender's Game or The Stars My Destination. Zelazny's timeline is sloppy and the philosophical foundation he builds in the first three chapters goes nowhere (except for a twist that will surprise nobody who has read much Heinlein or Niven/Pournelle). He eventually even starts to recycle phrases, as when Sam's weapon darts like a tongue twice in two pages. I couldn't even remember the ending a week after reading it.But the book gets 4 stars anyway, because the things that are good (the philosophy, the poetry, the way he lets his characters live) are very, very good. It's a wonderful read, but surely not the best in all of SF."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"I have only praise for Lord of Light and lately, 25 years since I read it in high school, I have this notion that Lord Of Light is Zelazney's back handed homage/parody of Lord ofthe Rings. There are so many odd parallels, Christian vs. Hindu, and the Sauron like Lord of the Dead who causes revulsion in just about everybody. Anyway, it's just a thought."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Sorry but I just can't quite jump on the bandwagon behind this novel. I know I shouldn't be second-guessing a &quot;classic&quot; - and this book does deserve this consideration because Zelazny was a truly visionary writer and the setting and characterizations of this book are very unique. However, the problem here is a style of writing and plot development that is very much a product of its time, and is not really that different from much of what was being cranked out by the sci-fi intelligentsia of the late 60's. Here style has taken on a little too much importance. Because of this, it is difficult to decipher what this novel is really about through the reading of it, unless you already know beforehand - through the reviews of those who have read it many times, or the publishers' descriptions which become more like clarifications than summaries.The true plot of this novel is certainly what you've read about - human colonists on an alien world have made use of advanced technology to give themselves godlike powers, have created a society based on Hindu mythology, and the new &quot;gods&quot; have oppressed both their fellow humans and the world's original inhabitants. Religion, godliness, and life itself have been reduced to technological determinism and have also been politicized and bureaucratized. This leads to many possible insights into these issues in our modern world. Unfortunately, these fantastic and creative plot elements are not spelled out adequately for the reader, instead being trickled out only in passing, usually through the conversations of the new demigods, who speak either in hip small talk or gigantic theological speechifying. The plot elements are consequently fighting for air beneath a story that is mostly action and movement, with repetitive battle scenes that I suspect were inspired by the scriptural tomes of the East (which Zelazny was surely familiar with, to his credit). This neglect of plot development and explanation, which must be implausibly inferred by the reader, makes this novel less readable than it is awesomely creative. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"This book didn't grab me as much as I had expected. The description I got was of a thought-provoking look at religion from the perspective of technology; gods being simply highly advanced members of the race they subjugated and kept in the dark. But it isn't so. Zelazny's gods are complex, and put a very human spin on mythology, but he doesn't confine them to technology and mortality. Magic abounds, much is left unexplained, and he invokes the mysticism of actual mythology.You may say there's nothing wrong with that approach. But the problem is, if I want mythology, I read real mythology. Any of the great traditions of myth - Greek, Norse, Hindu, Celt, Buddhist, etc. have a depth and subtle beauty that benefits from hundreds of years of retelling and refining, something one author can't match, particularly when trying to meld it with sci-fi.There are good elements. Siddartha, as the rebel of the old Hindu pantheon, is a perfect confidence man. Other gods (Kali, and particularly Nirriti the Black) have character, but Zelazny makes many disposable, and utterly omits noteworthy mortals, a sin for any book of myth.The best that I can say is that this book makes me want to review Hindu and Buddhist myth in the future. But what I expected from the reviews was a scathing interpretation of old religion as power plays and intrigue. If you are looking, as I was, for &quot;Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain!&quot;, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Okay, the 1960s were a crazy, drug-oriented counterculture time of the last century. That may explain why this novel won a 1968 Hugo Award for the best novel, and also was nominated for the Nebula Award too. I still shake my head over this. Let me explain:I loved some of the short stories of Roger Zelazny from the 50s and 60s. In my effort to read the list of novels that are actual winners of these awards, I finally got to this thing. Lord of Light is a glitzy and rambling tale of the battle of the titans on a faraway Earth-like world where a bunch of super-powered beings fight it out over the control of the lesser inhabitants of their world. Immediately you get to be totally immersed in the pantheon of the Hindu gods and their nefarious deeds everywhere. Reading this novel is like being transported into some magical age of the Indian continent, date unspecified. The battles and devious plans of these semi-divine creatures is everywhere, on every page. It is as if Zelazny decided: what if the age of the Hindu gods was brought to life and we saw what they were doing. It is as if a mixture of Norse mythology, Greek mythology, Easterm mythology and so on was churned up and vomited forth to the reader.My contention is that Zelazny must have being doing some drugs and wanted to be a part of that drug-crazed decade (the 1960s) and he splashed the entire novel with cosmic battles and unlikely and bizarre reunions of these so-called deities. In a word, this is a fantasy novel very thinly disguised as a sci-fi novel. And I am not a fantasy fan at all. To top it all off, this is very confusing and pell-mell story telling, if it can even be called that. There are hints here and there that this is a fallen world of colonists (mention is made of the \`Firstlings'...) in which a few of these human rulers have made themselves into gods with their technology and set up their various mythological kingdoms. We have scenes of \`gods' sitting around and smoking and drinking and plotting their next moves. We have various battles involving lasers and magic machines and we have the transformation of people's minds and personalities into donor bodies (ie Aspects and Attributes of the gods!). But it all doesn't click.This would have been a decent idea if developed in a sensible way. If Zelazny had presented the reader with a world where normal humans struggled to regain their rightful place among these god-like terrorist rulers and learned that the gods were mere humans with special technology. But Zelazny bombards us with mythology and the playful war games of the Hindu pantheon until we are numbed and confused and there is no reality but to think that these are real gods. Ho hum. It is very poorly done and not at all convincing. I suggest (seriously) that even the judges of this tripe of a novel were also on the same pantheon of mind-altering drugs as was (likely) the author Roger Zelazny. It was a common thing in the 1960s, remember. Sorry, Roger, but this is in no way a brilliant novel, not even a half-good one.It is worth noting that in that same year of 1968, there were a few other novels of far superior quality. Piers Anthony had given us Chthon, a riveting story of a prison planet, and Samuel R Delany had also been nominated for his perceptive look at a post-apocalyptic world in The Einstein Intersection; and also we had Philip K Dicks wonderful tale of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? And not to forget John Brunner's compelling and truthful Stand On Zanzibar or the poignant winner by Alexei Panshin, Rite Of Passage. Etc etc, all of this in that same weird year just before the fantasy-like fact of the first moon walk (which received a special Nebula award in 1969).Notwithstanding the fact Zelazny is a fine writer in most respects, a choice like this for award material truly puzzles me. This is the world of sci-fi in its best mode and Lord Of Light is the world of fantasy in a poor light. But as I said, I am not a fantasy literature fan. This was another waste of good printing paper by the publishers concerned."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Maybe I would have loved this when I was in college? My 13-year-old son turned me on to this book. He loved it but to be honest, the first half of the book seemed to be intentionally confusing and unexplained. I was too tired to take the rest of it seriously. I sped through it slowing down to wonder about the significance the character spouting the sermon on the mount near the end. I'm giving it two stars to show my lack of enthusiasm in the first reading. Since my son liked enough to get the hardback for his 'best books' collection, I feel bound to give it another chance some day."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Originally published in 1967, Lord of Light was one of the earliest and best loved novels by author Roger Zelazny. Based on a world long colonized by humans from \\"long lost Urath\\", the main theme of the book is the struggle between the denizens of Heaven, who have named themselves Brahma, Shiva, Krishna...etc. after the Hindu Pantheon, and the common man. While the struggle between man and his Gods is a well worn literary plot, here it is approached by a different angle. In Lord of Light, Heaven is located high in the mountains, much like Mount Olympus, and its residents are men descended from the crew of the Star of India, the spaceship that colonized the planet. They possess fantastic levels of technology, even allowing for their reincarnation into new and enhanced bodies. Through this power they rule the rest of the worlds as Gods, suppressing their technological levels to keep themselves in power. There are some who have spurned the power of Heaven, or been cast out, and they seek to advance man upon the world to level they feel more appropriate. The central character of the book, called by many names but best referred to as Sam, founds Buddhism as a counter movement to Hinduism and leads many forces against the gods to break their hold over the planet and accelerate man out of the dark ages.The Author goes to great lengths to give the story the feel of myth. The book is broken down into seven chapters, each telling a different part of this saga. These chapters have brief headers that give some context to what is about to occur, as well as a quote from various Hindu/Buddhist texts. These are necessary as the chapters do not follow events in a linear fashion, which can be hard to grasp upon first read, but give better feel to the number of years that pass during the course of the novel as well as imparting that ambiguous feel that tend to travel with older texts about the gods and their dealings.As an author, Zelazny often skirted the edge between Science Fiction and Fantasy. Known for his poetic style and engaging characters, he was considered a leading part of the New Wave of Science Fiction writers in the 1960's. Awarded many Hugo and Nebula awards for his work, he was a prolific publisher of short stories and novels up to his untimely death in 1995 at the age of 58.As this novel is not the easiest read, I would recommend it to someone of high school age and up that also is possessed of an active and open imagination. Should you enjoy this book, as I hope you will, and seek other titles both Paingod and Other Delusions by Harlan Ellison and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by Philip K. Dick are quality titles by other New Wave Science Fiction writers."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"I'm not going to explain what this book is about, the synopsis up top does that. I am just going to tell you what I think of it. Firstly, this book will push you away from it at first because of its confusing beginnings. Just want to preface this review with that. If you can make it through the confusing opening, you'll find that this is a many layered, and extremely well crafted novel. Zelazny, just like he did in the Amber series, has created a world that is in many ways all unto its own. He tends to jump from past to present almost seamlessly in this book, so make sure you are paying close attention from chapter to chapter and page to page. If you do stick with this book, and truly try and immerse yourself in its words and prose, you will find a real gem in your hands. It never really gets boring, just a little confusing with the shifting from time period to time period. If you know a bit about Eastern religions, you can get even more out of this book, but even if you know next to know about them, you can still really enjoy this book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"The only bad thing that I can think to say of this book is that is a bit disjointed (ok, a lot disjointed). But I'm used to reading John Barth and Philip K. Dick novels; they are good preparation for the jumpy narrative and time line. If you can stand to be perplexed for the better part of each chapter (as to exact time and character/s that your dealing with), than you'll absolutely love this book. If you're easily confused or are looking for a quick read, than you may want to look else where.With that aside, I would compare the battle scenes to a more poetic Robert Jordan. You know...back when his novels had action in them. Zelazny truly has command of the language he uses to describe fighting.I'm a Sci-Fi fan and I highly recommend this."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"I am not usually given to hyperbole, BUT... Lord of Light is only one of the best books ever written. period. This is one of the books that elevates sci-fi into the realm of great literature.

Then read it again. Then maybe give it another read. Every time you pick up something new.I love this book. (or couldn't you tell)"},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"I first read this book as a sci fi obsessed teen. My mum, knowing my literary tastes, used to go to jumble sales and just buy me any books that had (In her opinion) weird covers. This was how I first came to acquire Lord of Light.On finishing it, I immediately turned straight to page one and started to read it again as I couldn't bear to leave the amazing world that Zelazny had created.I don't have that original copy any more, with the great (Peter Goodfellow?) cover illustration of an eye in a golden cloud as I lent it to a friend who lost it (How many people has that happened to?) but the friend bought me another copy that I still have and I've read it and reread it many times since.Some have said that this book is crying out for a sequel. I disagree. Zelazny's tale hints at an epic history leading up to the events in Lord of Light which if anything would necessitate a prequel. I regret that he will never write us one.One minor nag, There are a lot of glaring typos in the book which have never been corrected in any of the editions that I've read and could be confusing to the reader. Can't someone just proofread this book and sort this out once and for all?That's it. I'll leave it to others to summarise the plot, I'll just say this. You will never read a better sci fi book than this (even with typos). The story and characters will live on in your mind for ever."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Roger Zelazny's &quot;Lord of Light&quot; is one of a short list of works for which a very good case can be made that it is THE best piece of science fiction ever written. In scope, scale and originality, L.o.L. has few peers in the genre (Dune comes to mind), and vast themes, after all, are what SF is really all about. Zelazny's use of language is charmingly idiosyncratic - it soon becomes recognizable as his stylistic signature - and it succeeds in its ambitious program of combining a certain elevation of style with an abundant, dry wit.Above all else, however, Roger Zelazny's characters are believably very human, and at the same time compellingly larger-than-life. They are somehow archetypal, maybe eternal, but very modern in their outlook. They talk, all the time, the way you would if you could carefully craft all of your lines. And yet, they speak with a lovely and natural spontaneity that is never forced or artificial. Even his villains, who are thoroughly villainous, have considerable personal appeal.Of course, this book has some very minor flaws - the most important of which is that it is relatively short (about 300 pages). A rather endearing flaw is that the author has and displays an abundance of the arrogance of the brilliant young, and he doesn't mind clubbing you over the head with his considerable erudition. If you are still young yourself you will love him for it, and if not you will fondly remember the days when you were. In the end, I consider even L.o.L's few flaws to be an essential part of its fabric. Zelazny manages to dazzle you with his brilliance without ever being condescending, forced or phony, and its all great fun if you're quick enough to run with him.Lord of Light is one of a short list of books of ANY genre that I make a point of re-reading every few years - for about 30 years now - always with fresh enjoyment. It is a sad and lonesome thing that Zelazny is gone, and he will never give us another story like this one."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"This is a great book.

When I write \\"best,\\" I mean both the most satisfying to his fans and the most accomplished in a literary sense. During that time he used religion as a hook and nimbly cavorted through the pantheons. \\"Lord of Light\\" and to a lesser extent \\"Creatures of Light and Darkness\\" were novels of brilliance, but two of his novelettes were lightning bolts constrained to paper and ink: \\"A Rose for Ecclesiastes\\" and \\"But for a Breath I Tarry.\\"Zelazny, himself, didn't fully appreciate his triumphs. He thought he was in a rut. I remember an interview that appeared in some long-since forgotten magazine in which he said he disliked being regarded as merely a writer of religion-oriented themes.Not long after that, his bank account grew and his talent shriveled as he was drawn irresistibly into the black hole of his own making that was Amber."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"If I only had 50 stars to split among 50 books, this book would get all 50 of mine.

Make no mistake, it's not. In fact, one of the characters says there's nothing particularly regional about the events which take place; Christianity and Protestantism could have easily (though I doubt less controversially) taken the place of Hinduism and Buddhism.Rather, this book is a thought-provoking engagement of that which operates behind social revolutions, both peaceful and otherwise, both secular and religious. This is not to call it a dry read by any means. The story itself is action-packed with enough laser battles and sufficiently-advanced \\"magicked\\" science to satisfy any fan of science fiction or space opera. The characters are quite deep, but draw the only major criticism I found for the book.Factions change with barely-credible ease. Bitter enemies turn into staunch allies in mere moments. This does not only occur with the good characterizations, where individuals are noticeably conflicted towards each other from the get go.

I still tend to tag the Amber series as a strong contender for the best fantasy/science-fiction books that I've ever read. Anyway, as my \\"formal\\" education in the genre is fairly limited, I recently stumbled upon the \\"Lord of Light\\" at a friend's house and quickly got a lecture about this being Zelazny's best work, won many prizes and you *must* read it. So I did, I borrowed it and put it straight on top of my queue.With great expectations come great disappointments. Following the read I found myself starting to rationalize why I didn't enjoy it. At first I thought that book is so complex and I should give him another try to see if I missed anything. Then I thought that maybe I've changed, I mean I did read the Amber books about 10-15 years ago (but I can still even enjoy Harry Potter kind of books). It might also be the case that one might need formal training in literature to appreciate what I just read.But, in the end of the day, I just think the book is not a very good read. It does have some interesting ideas, the plot is original and appealing as it spans around Hindu gods who are basically depriving human beings from accessing or developing technology in order to keep their beneficiary life for eternity. These \\"gods\\" control and decide which body one gets when his \\"current\\" body died from natural or other causes.However, it's really hard to keep track of what is going on, who are the characters (as there are many gods with different names that relates to them) and what moves them. The book is composed of several \\"sub-plots\\" on very large time scales that seems very disconnected from one another. Some of the stories are interesting, but as soon as one finishes you find yourself reading a chapter or two that simply does not really connects to anything else.Its about two month since I've finished the book, and the best test is that it seems that I can remember very little of what I read, as oppose to Zelazny's \\"nine princes in Amber\\" which I pretty much remember the entire plot about 15 years after the last read."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"On a far planet in the future, mankind has fallen into its old ways. Long ago, the officers of the spacecraft STAR OF INDIA stranded their colonists with no technology, then returned in a century to rule their descendants as the gods of the Hindu pantheon.

Once they were all saved by the power of Sam, who could bind the demonic energy creatures native to the planet; today they spurn Lord Siddartha, as he is known, and plot to harm him, and so begins Sam's war against Heaven; just as the fit hits the Shan. Sam is angry with the way the world is run, and prepares his most potent weapon: philosophy. You thought philosophy was the stuff of dry tomes? Watch Sam's new buddhism attack the roots of this pseudo-Hinduism like weed killer. Even though the goddess of destruction Kali was once his wife, Sam fights a war to the death...and beyond, and then even further than that, against beings who hurl lightning and fire, who breathe dreams and dance emotions, who are nearly the gods they imagine themselves to be. But not even the Buddha was above Death, and Sam must play a deadly game with Dharma himself until the world is convulsed with war. The world's last Christian is no help either; he's become a satanic figure leading an army of mindless zombies.

Perhaps others who feel strongly can do likewise. ----- &quot;Lord of Light&quot; is, without question, one of the great Science Fiction books ever written. In 1967 it won the most prestigious award in the genre -- Hugo, for novel of the year -- at a time when Science Fiction may have been at its artistic peak. More important, in the years since a great number of science fiction fans have read, re-read, and loved the novel, classifying it along with &quot;Dune,&quot; &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land,&quot; &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress,&quot; &quot;The Mote in God's Eye&quot; and a handful of others books that can legitimately contend for the title &quot;Best SF Novel Ever Written.&quot; As you may surmise, it gets my vote.

Furthermore, like &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot; and &quot;The Little Prince,&quot; it touches something special in the hearts of people. That isn't something every book does after thirty two years. I learned that &quot;Lord of Light&quot; was out of print when I looked for it on AMAZON.COM. Amazon has a policy of letting readers post reviews about the books they've read. The site has both good and bad reviews for nearly everything. &quot;Lord of Light,&quot; however, is an exception like I've never seen. It was rated a &quot;10&quot; in every review. I've captured all of them, and they're attached to this e-mail unedited, so please judge for yourself. It boils down to this: Please consider re-publishing Roger Zelazny's science fiction masterpiece. It has been unavailable for too long."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Just picked up this reissue, and it's aged much better than have the Amber novels. Poor Z. wrote a good bit of crap in the 1980s up to his death in 1994, so if you've read any of that, don't write off the early stuff.\\"Lord of Light\\" builds on the foundation of earlier SF. Whereas the idea of a sleeper-ship whose crew decide to lord it over their charges on the destination planet---and I mean, Lord it over them---might've been a plot in itself for Heinlein or Clarke, Zelazny leaves this so much in the background that it's really handy to have that part indicated on the back cover.I didn't find the chapters disjointed or mere \\"tales,\\" though time may pass between them. I will pass along that, in my teens when I first read the book, it took me a while to catch on that chapter 1 is \\"in medias res\\"---chapter 2 goes back to the beginning of the story, and the book advances from there.A clever, funny, poetic, and touching book. Z's better books are valuable for their style alone, even when the plot and characters are as good as they are here. He, Vance, and maybe Brunner are the great SF stylists of the Sixties."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"This has long been one of my favorites. It is Zelazny at his best, and represents a fusion of sci-fi and fantasy. I love this book, and my old copy was so worn out that I have been looking for another for about two years. This re-release represents a chance for those lucky individuals who have not yet had the pleasure of reading this amazing book to do so, and for those of us who want another copy to get one. If I had to reccomend one book this season it would be a this one - do yourself a favor and spend the money."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"IT'S BACK IN PRINT! IT'S BACK IN PRINT! Thank all the gods, it's finally back in print!The book is everything promised and so much more. A mature counter-point to the (also excellent) &quot;Creature of Light and Darkness&quot;, the book is not diminished by re-reading.Even though I have the story comitted to memory, along with numerous key quotes, it remains fresh and insightful -- indeed, timeless. The book was written in 1967 and could have just as easily been read today.The characters are distinct and original and, yet, at the same time the story has an epic and poetic feel that is perfectly appropriate to its subject matter.Zelazny was the Lord of Writers and we shan't see his like again. Let us only hope that this book is the first of many re-prints to come."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"In brief: Science fiction meets Hinduism in one of the most surprising, intriguing and enjoyable books I've come across in a while. Highly recommended.The story centres on an off-Earth colony which has come to be utterly dominated by its founders, who rule with the names, personalities and even the attributes of Hindu gods. With the injection of SF technology, social and political control pivot upon Hindu tenets with a futuristic twist. Reincarnation functions through personality-storage and cloning, allowing effective immortality for the gods, and some very bad karma for any who oppose them. The populace is held in a permanent low-tech state to ensure it continues to need its gods; innovations that might benefit mortals, such as the printing press, are swiftly eradicated.Stylistically, too, it is brilliant. The whole thing takes the form of a Hindu epic, in terms of both language and structure. The hero, Sam, rebels against the gods by (literally and figuratively) taking on the Buddha role, preaching against the priesthood and the oppressive rituals and strictures which bind society. And through this, Zelazny brings out some of the most interesting implications of his blend of SF and myth, exploring how the 'gods' have merged with their masks to truly _become_ their mythic roles.Finally, and importantly, _Lord of Light_ also contrives to be a truly entertaining read. Deservedly a classic."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Lord of Light is a wonderful novel, fully worthy of the praise it has garnered. It is set many centuries in the future, after &quot;the death of Urath.&quot; On a colony planet, men have battled the previous inhabitants and won, and have established a society. This society is based on technological means of imitating the Hindu religion. Specifically, when the body nears death, it is possible to transfer the &quot;mind&quot; or &quot;soul&quot; to a new body, even the body of an animal. But some of the earliest colonists, including the &quot;First,&quot; have additional powers, which give them the status of gods. They also have taken control of the means of reincarnation, and a faction among them is using that means in political ways: punishing their enemies with reincarnation as animals, or with the &quot;true death.&quot; The result is a society of humans living in a world in which something resembling Hinduism is literally true. Furthermore, the leading faction of &quot;gods&quot; is using its powers to keep the technological level of human society low enough that their own position cannot be threatened. The novel tells of the hero, one of the &quot;Gods&quot;, and his two attempts to free the people of this world.This is definitely worthy of its place among the standard-bearing works of science fiction. Not only does Zelazny pull off the intriguing feat of creating a scientifically plausible world (given some extremely advanced technology, and a fair bit of handwaving) in which a fairly close rendering of the Hindu system of gods, demons, and their powers -- and reincarnation -- is real; he makes that just a nice background to an honest and moving story of a believable man. And his story is grounded on a sound theme. And finally, all the clever background ends up as more than just background: it reinforces the central meaning of the book. Definitely recommended, and it's nice to see that new readers will be getting a chance to encounter this excellent work."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Humanity defeats the native \\"energy\\" beings that populated the orb and establishes a colony on the planet with a Hindu like societal order. Using advanced technology, the crew of the ship transfers their minds into a new body when theirs is near death. They also develop other advances that enable them to form a pantheon with god-like powers. Beneath them are the colonists and even further below in this pyramid of power are the natives. No one bucks the leadership as not only can they technology reincarnate they can convert others into animals.One of these techno-Gods, preferring to be called Sam rather than Mahasamatman, feels that the mistreatment of others is morally wrong. He thinks that he and his peers should share their technology with the lower strata. His peers insist those beneath them are incapable of dealing with godlike powers and need their hand to guide them. Sam never claimed the mantle and though he hates what he feels he must do, this \\"fallen angel\\" leads a revolt against his ruling brothers and sisters as he wants to establish a different world order.This is a deep science fiction novel with religious and social overtones. The story line is loaded with action, but also takes its time to defend critical arguments set forth by author Roger Zelazny. The cast fosters the concepts of the plot so that development is targeted more towards an idea than a character. Still with all that this is a cerebral tale that will have readers pondering a host of subjects from comparative religions to white man's burden to fostering American style democracy in Iraq, etc. in a clever novel that will require concentration or one will miss a point.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"This turned out to be Zelazny's masterpiece. It wasn't supposed to be that way--Zelazny was the '60s version of the guy who was going to hoist SF into the artistic empyrean. That didn't happen. (It never does--see Varley, John, and Gibson, William.) But he did leave behind &quot;Lord of Light&quot;, and a few other works that serve as glowing examples of what can be done within an all-too-often infantile form.The premise is that an interstellar colony has, so long ago that the events are no more than legend, been turned into an effectively eternal dictatorship by the starship crew, who with the aid of advanced tech have acquired the aspects of the Hindu pantheon to lord it over the poor peasantry. (There's also a dour Calvinist theocracy elsewhere on the planet, but that's another story.) The protagonist is Mahatsamatman, known as &quot;Sam&quot;, a man who is not, in fact, the Enlightened One, (though everyone insists otherwise) but is close enough. He decides to overthrow the whole miserable structure, and that's the story in a nutshell. Battles, conspiracies, encounters with alien, and not very advanced, energy beings, betrayals, disasters, and all else follow, in the style of the great Hindu epic the Mahabharata, along with plenty of 20th-century wise-guy prose. (Zelazny was also a student of Chandler.) This is a great roaring monster of a book, of a kind that would have a very hard time getting published today. (It's also *structured* like the Mahabharata, with vast chunks of out-of-sequence narrative--the first chapters occur *after* the ensuing two-hundred-odd pages--which would be guaranteed to drive the current generation of editors out of their minds.)&quot;Lord of Light&quot; is one of the few novels to take on a basic, and all but ignored, SF thesis--if technology does have the power to make us godlike, then we'd better damn well be ready for the role. Zelaxny shows us the negative aspect--what happens when the process fails. The positive side--which Sam perhaps reaches, and perhaps doesn't--is only hinted at. But it's good to see the concept handled at all by anybody apart from James Blish. Everyone else simply runs away from it in terror.A final point: this is very much a novel of the '60s, and one of the few reflections of the *real* '60s, the one that didn't make it into the books or documentaries. The major feature of that lost time was, very simply, joy. That's what everyone recalls, and everyone mistakes for something else. After long, bleak decades, the possibilites opened up. For one brief instant, a renaissance beckoned, only to be killed by Nam, and dope, and dirty left-wing politics. The period is truly reflected in very few things--Dylan's pre-accident albums, the Beatles, and in this book, which is suffused by joy, and humor, and hope, on damn near every page. Read it to learn what you missed, and what could still, with luck, come again. I'm sure that Zelazny didn't intend it that way--he was in real life a career bureaucrat for the Social Security administration. But that's how it came out. And that's no bad thing."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"This is one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written. If you are going to read one ofZelazny's books make it this one.

But all the majorcharacters are given a chance to rise above the best they believe themselves capable of.

Above all, it is cleverly knitted together, and provides excellent entertainment value. Few SF novels can match it with its smooth yet complex plot and ingenious use of religious / scientific themes."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"&quot;Lord of Light&quot; is an outstanding example of Zelazny's intriguing writing style. As a writer on the fore-front of New Wave science fiction, he had more interest in delving into a character's psyche than the character's surroundings. He does this stunningly with Sam (drop the &quot;Mahat-&quot; and the &quot;-atman&quot;).As is usual, Mr. Zelazny drops the reader, confused, straight into the action. Don't give up reading, you'll understand what's happening around page 100.Zelazny utilizes the Hindu pantheon of gods in this book much better than the Egyptian pantheon in a previous book. He acurately depicts the beliefs, and, later, how Buddhism was able to unravel (ch.sp.) them.The story, though written in a way as to seem aloof of any concern over or involvment in mere mortal culture, is actually a moving story of how one man (he never claimed to be a god, but then, he never claimed not to, either) frees a stagnant society from the bonds of the Caste (Kaste?) System.If you don't enjoy &quot;Lord of Light&quot;, try &quot;Donnerjack.&quot; Zelazny's humor is shown slightly better in &quot;Donnerjack&quot; than &quot;Lord of Light.&quot;"},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"Lord of Light is without a doubt, one of the best things I've read (and I've read a LOT, believe me).I highly recommend this great masterpiece to every serious Sci-Fi/Fantasy fan out there, along with Gibson's Neuromancer, Orwell's 1984, Herbert's Dune (1-6), Harrison's The Hammer and The Cross trilogy - ones of the best novels ever written."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"The good news: this classic is back in print.

Just as the Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, Asimov's I, Robot, Gibson's Neuromancer, Card's Ender's Game and other works were ground-breaking works in the genre, Lord of Light is a timeless classic that must be on the shelf of any SF lover."},{"Title":"Lord of Light","review":"This book is my bible.

Clarke, Roger Zelazny had a brilliant knack for mixing religion and science fiction. In Lord of Light, he gives us a unique spin to Indian mythology in a novel that is both serious and a bit whimsical. But at the root of this story there is more, for as with so much fine science fiction, a question is posed: if mankind achieved the power of gods, would we be corrupted by it? Or would we use it to transcend? The Hindu \\"gods\\" of Zelazny's imaginary world would seem to indicate the former, but the protagonist, Sam, directs us to the latter.But even this is not so clear-cut, for Sam himself is subject to all the temptations of both immortality and power, and it is his journey to final understanding that moves the novel forward. It is not mere liberation for the human slaves of his fellow \\"gods\\" that he seeks, but a deeper understanding of what it means to be human at all when you have the power to change bodies and thereby live forever. But would such a scientific breakthrough and the immortality it would bring really make us gods, or would we remain merely people?After all, Sam never claimed to be a god.

During my early investigations I came upon Alice Marriott's \\"The Ten Grandmothers\\". This was the book I was looking for but didn't know it. Other research had served up books \\"about\\" the Kiowas. This was as close to a book \\"by\\" the Kiowas as could be expected given that the Kiowas had no written language. Ms. Marriott has done a superb job of not only recording these stories of the old ways, but has let the Kiowa voice come through loud and clear. As you read these stories you feel yourself sitting around the fire in an 1800s Kiowa camp listening to these stories being told first hand.One of my favorite chapters was about the day the children made a play camp and built a defensive earthen berm and ditch (I believe the Kiowas were about the only plains tribe to employ such a defensive tactic). Later that night White Bear began blowing his \\"liberated\\" cavalry bugle as he led the victorious raiding party back to camp. The women in the camp, awakened and thinking they were under attack by the cavalry, began tearing down the camp as the men mounted and rode out to meet the enemy and cover the escape of the women and children. Not knowing about the children's ditch, both incoming and outgoing parties of mounted warriors careened into this obstacle in the darkness. Those within earshot of the melee were in a panic thinking their worst fears were being visited upon them. The next day, a rule was announced by White Bear that, while play camps are good, children were not to make play camps with ditches; only the men could make ditches.We owe Ms. Marriott a huge debt of gratitude for preserving these treasures that might otherwise have been lost."},{"Title":"Takin ' , Taking , Back My Name - The Confessions of Ike Turner - illustrated with Photographs & complete with Discography of all Ike & Tina Turner Revue releases - with introduction by Little Richard + photos","review":"I find &quot;Takin' Back my Name&quot; a funny title for this book. Admittedly, Ike owns up to all his faults and doesn't hold back much, but that only leaves you feeling like all the things you've ever heard about Ike Turner over the years are true.The commentary is laughable as it defends Ike who admits to &quot;marrying&quot; 12 or so times, beating and mentally tormenting Tina (about whom he can't muster anything really bad to say), snorting coke, smoking pot, smoking crack, carrying guns, and more.His recollections are all over the place, and he actually tries to make it sound like he had everyones best interests in mind throughout everything. For the things even Ike can't defend, he simply says he was young and didn't know better.A favorite moment was when Ike actually suggests that considering his financial situation, Tina should go on the road with him for one last farewell tour. After all the years of cheating, beating and drugs he still can't understand why she wouldn't want to!Through all this though, and despite the fact that Ike could be recollecting 1963 in one sentence and 1974 in the next, it is an interesting rock n' roll bio from someone who is arguably a hall of famer.Ike &amp; Tina are my favorite duo of all time, so this was a must read for me - but even if they aren't your favorite band you'd enjoy the smattering of other celebrities and unbeleivable stories in this book.I gave it five stars because forgetting his faults (I know...), Ike Turner does deserve some recognition as half a legendary rock duo, and also because this book is very entertaining and hard to put down.Let's hope with the proceeds Ike is doing something productive."},{"Title":"Takin ' , Taking , Back My Name - The Confessions of Ike Turner - illustrated with Photographs & complete with Discography of all Ike & Tina Turner Revue releases - with introduction by Little Richard + photos","review":"This book was very interesting and real from the begining until his relationship with Tina. Ike was definitly an important part of the history/creation of Black Music/Rock 'N Roll. That's why I give his book two stars.However, when Ike starts to discuss Tina, it gets confussing. One needs to take notes in order to keep up. He's constantly contradicting himself and blaming Tina for his actions. That's an abuser. I've found that you have to take whatever Ike Turner says with a grain of salt. Over the years, either on tv, print media, Tina's book, then his own book, Ike's story is always changing. It's gone from he only slapped her, he only hit her once, to he never hit her at all. However, the story from Tina (and others) has always been the same. There are definitely two sides to every story and the movie &quot;What's Love&quot; totally had some facts mixed up, but Ike needs to get one story and stick with it.I was also disappointed with the contribution by Little Richard. I was confused because since I've been alive, this man (rock music's own Richard Simmons) has argued and insisted that he is the &quot;architech of rock 'n roll&quot;. Hey, no argument here. But suddenly, Ike Turner writes a book and Little Richard now says that Ike is the architech. And Ike did record what is considered the first rock record, &quot;Rockket 88&quot;. What really got me though was when Little Richard insulted Tina. Is it me, or is that unprofessional? Ike is always saying that he has nothing against Tina, but he allowed these insults to be printed in his autobiography-in which he claims that he has no career because of her. Will it ever end?I would recommend this book only if you have nothing else to read and you've borrowed it from the public library. However, there are several other books on the history of Rock music/Black music that are much better."},{"Title":"Takin ' , Taking , Back My Name - The Confessions of Ike Turner - illustrated with Photographs & complete with Discography of all Ike & Tina Turner Revue releases - with introduction by Little Richard + photos","review":"I, like most people, learned much of what I knew of Ike Turner from his eighth ex-wife Tina's autobiography, I, Tina.

Takin' Back My Name fills in many of the gaps left by Tina's book and by interviews that have focused more on his relationship with his wife than with his life and career. Contrary to other reviews of this book which appear on this site, Turner is not illiterate or unfamiliar with the English language -- nor is the book full of mis-spellings. It was co-authored by Nigel Cawthorne, a British journalist and printed in the United Kingdom where the spellings are &quot;proper English&quot;. When sent here to the United States, the publisher did not deem it necessary to change over spellings of words like &quot;tyre&quot; or &quot;recognise&quot;. For those looking for an in your face, honest examination of Ike &amp; Tina, look no further. Pay close attention to the fight that takes place in Texas the prefaced Tina's departure.

First, most people are aware that the film WHATS LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT does have inaccuracies, and yes, there are two sides to every story, BUT...That out of the way, I read much of TAKIN' BACK MY NAME with my mouth open in disbelief. Ike IS recognized as a pioneer in Rock-n-Roll, no denying, and of course we should take that into account, but genius does not justify the monster that even he admits that he was. For those who credit him for admitting it, its really hollow praise- I mean, he had NO CHOICE but to admit it- if he tried to deny it, he would have countless witnesses to the abuse, adultery, drugs etc. who would tear him to shreds!As a read, this is definitely fascinating, although frustrating in its context and confusing in its narrative (Ike is apparently not a slave to chronology). He seems to contradict himself at various points, and even seems a bit out of touch at other times (does he really think Tina would reunite for a reunion tour??? The Supremes couldnt even do it, and Ike thinks that Tina's gonna??? LOL)My main problem was the subject matter- it is so difficult to have compassion for the author, even in light of his declaration of mistakes. If you can get past it, you may enjoy this book...PS. for the prior entries who ridiculed Tina for staying with Ike so long, have you even considered the possiblity that she may have been fearful of what he might do?

I guess he figured, \\"if she could do it, I can too\\". And this style did not do him justice. It made him look like a low life womanizer, don't give a hoot about life and that everyone is picking on him or was/still out to use and get him. I feel that he could have gotten another co-writer or a contributer to help write his side of the story.I did not like this book, because they jumped from one year to another and back to an earlier year and left the reader wondering what happened in between. The book really got confusing.Second, Ike did admit that he did hit Tina, he said he did not abuse her, but he hit her. I do believe that he did not abuse her until after he became addicted to cocain. And I a glad to see that he apologize for his actions.I think that he should have stayed away from the movie \\"What's Love Got to Do With it\\", and focus more on answering questions in her book \\"I, Tina\\" because it was obvious (if you read the book), that the movie was somewhat ficticious.I wanted his book to go into more details on his life with Tina, though I know that he had a life before and after her and I wished he could have shown more pictures. I think he was too detailed in his child hood sex life. He should have just told who and how he lost his virginity and not described how it felt. When he did this, I felt I was reading porn.He could have given a little more detail on why him and Ann Thomas seperated.

He writes as if the relationship was great and Tina loved the fact that he cheated constantly. I am not one sided and do believe that she was tolerant of his cheating, but I doubt she was ok with it. He does not speak much of the physical abuse, and if you read the book , you will see that he doesnt believe that he was abusive. He's not hiding it, he just doesnt believe that its wrong. In fact he views it as a regular part of a relationship, and he doesnt understand why his women were leaving him. I actually pity him.

I decided to read this book because I was obsessed with the movie \\"What's Love Got to Do With It\\". I just wanted to see what Ike had to say. When I first opened the book and began to read Little Richard's foreward I was immediately taken aback. There were so many spelling errors. For instance, he spelled tires \\"tyres\\". I thought it was me so I continued reading, only to find that Ike did the exact same thing. You would think that the editor would have caught words like organiser and kerb. Ike talked about his relationship with Tina and he switched back and forth. It was very confusing. In one part he said that he was proud of Tina. The next chapter he said that he was upset with her and that she had lost her \\"blackness\\"; or that she forgot where she came from. (And oh by the way how are you not black anymore? *lol*)I thought that it was wonderful that he claimed his demons in this book. That he owned up to be a avid drug user. However that was it. If you want to hear about almost every sexcapade that Ike Turner ever had, the hole in his nose, and how he made everyone a big star, this is your book. However if you want to get a book that explains what really happened purchase I, Tina. Otherwise you will shake your head in disbelief and giggle often!!! Did he take back his name?

If you love rock and roll, you should be interested in the life of the man who wrote Rocket 88 and who invented Tina Turner. The book is a provocative, balls-out character study of a complex, violent, multi-faceted musical genius. Places the Disney over-simplification of this individual in frightening context -- Ike's been trying to tell his story all these years. He lacks the idiom of standard English -- and so it's difficult for most people to make him out as anything more than a violent bogey-man. But he's far more -- and the contribution he made to rock obliges us to understand his background, his feelings and his violent complexity. It may be good to hear his side -- he's penitent, but not ashamed. Let's not forget -- he was hopelessly addicted to cocaine during much of the time he committed many of his most egregious sins.

It is a shame, I expect the problem still exists today.The book isn't very well written. It gets mired in the details, goes on and on and on and on, and has some sections that are in extreme poor taste in my opinion. I found myself skipping ahead.

And I have never taken a theology course in my life.I suspect that a professional theologian of the year 2008 might, however, find this book easy reading and long since overtaken by events and ever newer and more daring speculations and suggestions. But for me this was work, enjoyable work, but nonetheless work. Why? What makes the clearly expressed, far from ponderous SURVIVAL OF DOGMA demanding to an average non-specialist reader with strong interest in the religions of America?First to be flagged, perhaps, is the book's rather weak unity. Its subtitle is FAITH, AUTHORITY, AND DOGMA IN A CHANGING WORLD. Three topics are spread over twelve chapters. But each chapter represents either a separate lecture or article composed between 1968 and 1970. And each was written to stand alone. The author suggests that we read them in any order we choose. So the unity is not tight.That said, the writing is clear. In particular the three page INTRODUCTION is the best brief overview I have read in a decade. It pulls together with correct emphasis the half dozen major themes of the book. In his INTRODUCTION the future Cardinal Dulles states his main thesis: old religious words such as 'faith,' 'authority' and 'dogma' must today be shaken up and conceived less statically, more historically, dynamically and fluidly. For the Gospel was delivered to a particular audience in a specific age in a concrete language embedded in a time-bound culture or cultures. We today do not think in ways that Jesus's first disciples did or did early Apostolic Fathers in their efforts to convert Greeks and Romans, or as did Thomas Aquinas and the Scholastics defending the Faith against Averroes and Muslim philosophers. Time accelerates, communications advances increasingly unite the globe and so we don't even think the more recent ways Reformers did in the 16th or rationalists did in the 17th Century or Romantics in the 19th. Roman Catholics, the principal audience of THE SURVIVAL OF DOGMA, no longer think remotely the way they did in 1870 during the First Vatican Council, which defined Papal infallibility.When professional theologian Father Avery Dulles, S. J., was writing his twelve essays, the Second Vatican Council (1962 - 65) was the most exciting, horizon-filling recent event in Catholicism. Theologians everywhere (including today's then young Pope Benedict XVI) were scrambling to absorb the Council's messages of liberation. The underlying challenge: to make Christ and the Gospel understandable and attractive to contemporary men: to scientists, technologists, existentialists, post-modernists, Catholics, Protestants and indeed to everyone.Here is a tiny sample of the book's more striking insights:-- People abandon old conceptual categories (e. g., flat earth theory), think new thoughts and therefore to save people the Church re-expresses old truths, pours old wine into new wine skins. The Church of the future will almost certainly have to abandon venerable but non-essential forms of thinking and worship in order to reach contemporary and future men, women and children.-- To understand thoroughly what Christianity has to offer (or what the Army, Rotary or any organization is really about), we have to sign on, do our apprenticeship. We first learn what the older masters learned, then, once masters ourselves, we think out new and original personal postures. That is natural and to be welcomed.-- People used to dwell more on the past and the present than we do. We all yearn for a better future. It is in our nature to do so. Hence the appeal of the Christian virtue of hope. No hopes aimed merely at creatures can satisfy us. But, \\"hoping against hope,\\" Christians retain an ultimate \\"transcendental\\" hopefulness that there exists a supreme good reaching out toward us personally, something that gives our lives permanent meaning beyond death and that belief in and obedience to Christ will lead us to our destiny (p. 64).-- We moderns distrust authority. But Christianity was established and preaches it message on the authority of God himself. And for Christians of any hue there is only one ultimate triune authority: God, Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit. But every created organization, religious or otherwise, is also a network of secondary, non-ultimate authorities. Each limited authority has its defined responsibilities and if any one reaches beyond its competence, the whole organization suffers. That is true of Catholics regarding such secondary authorities as scripture, pope, bishops, consensus of the faithful, the work of theologians and other foci of created authority. Christianity was empowered by Jesus to speak with authority, to serve others and to reach all cultures and all ages. Christianity must, that is, be flexible, pluri-form, multi-cultural.-- The notion of dogmas as inflexible, forever true statements made sense in earlier cultures under specific attacks, but does not in ours. Thus a rising authority today is the consensus of the faithful. For whatever reasons slowly (or not so slowly -- change in theological thinking or religious practice is often quantitative, qualitative and abrupt) we fall silent about, pay less or no attention to church formulations once deemed absolutely crucial. These include medieval condemnations of charging any interest whatsoever on loans (usury). They also include an old dictum, \\"extra ecclesiam nulla salus\\" i.e., \\"outside the church there is no salvation.\\"\\"In our time the ancient understanding of the formula is repugnant to practically all Catholics. ... The formula must be changed because in the mental and social structures of the contemporary world there is no longer any room for an exclusivist concept of the Church as a society of the saved. The old formula is not totally wrong. ... (But) it is an oversimplification to say that dogmas are irreformable\\" (p. 161).And on and we read from insight to insight: regarding salvation, apparent contradictions in Biblical texts, sanctifying grace, self-expression, doubt as a virtue. To the early post-Vatican II world these thoughts were breathtaking and totally fresh. They are still being assimilated by most of us a third century later. -OOO-"},{"Title":"THE HISTORY OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION","review":"In spite of its length, I've read this book several times. It isn't just a widely acclaimed historic and literary masterpiece, written by a leading participant in the events he describes. It isn't just vividly written and thoroughly researched.More importantly, it's one of the best books ever written about revolution, as relevant today as ever.The most important conclusion that emerges is the crucial role of a revolutionary party with an overwhelmingly working class membership, leadership and political orientation: a party that has trained itself in the many years of partial struggles that precede a revolutionary crisis; studied together the lessons of past revolutionary struggles throughout the world; and done everything possible to educate broader layers of workers in those lessons.(The point is illustrated both positively and negatively. More than once, Lenin had to turn to the Bolshevik's working class rank and file against wavering intellectuals in the party leadership.)Please don't be put off by the first chapter, the driest and most difficult in the book. The basic idea is that capitalism arrived late in Russia, imported from abroad in the form of huge factories, which laid the basis for the rapid development of a strong, militant labor movement. As a result, the emerging capitalist class was reluctant to mobilize the masses against the feudal nobles and landlords that stood in their way, for fear that the aroused workers might turn on the capitalists themselves.Under the impact of war and economic crisis, the resulting mixture of different forms of class oppression exploded in a combined revolt of workers, farmers, and oppressed nationalities, destroying both feudalism and capitalism by the time it was through.Several postcripts:(1) If you're wondering what went wrong in the Soviet Union after such a promising start, I recommend \\"The Revolution Betrayed\\" by Trotsky; also \\"Lenin's Final Fight\\" by Lenin.(2) I disagree with Trotsky's assessment of the pre-1917 differences between himself and Lenin concerning the role of working farmers, the relationship between democratic (anti-feudal) revolution and socialist revolution, and Lenin's formula, \\"the democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry\\". I think Trotsky's discussion of this is confusing. I recommend \\"Their Trotsky and Ours\\" by Jack Barnes. There is also a good debate in \\"Bolshevism and the Russian Revolution\\" by Doug Jenness, Ernest Mandel, and V.I. Lenin.(3) Another reviewer pointed out that this book is available online. However, the printed version has glossaries of people, places, organizations and unfamiliar terms; a more complete chronology; and a thorough index. I relied very heavily on all of these, so much so that I used color-coded post-its to turn to them easily. Also, parts of the online version are full of obvious typos; books from Pathfinder Press are proofread very thoroughly.(4) Finally, I recommend the ads in the back of the book. Pathfinder Press is defined by a political goal, not commercial success. It aims to provide a platform for revolutionary leaders speaking in their own words. If you like one book, you will probably like others."},{"Title":"THE HISTORY OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION","review":"Leon Trotsky's History of the Russian Revolution is partisan history at its best. One does not and should not, at least in this day in age, ask historians to be \`objective'. One simply asks that the historian present his or her narrative and analysis and get out of the way. Trotsky meets that criterion. Furthermore, in Trotsky's case there is nothing like having a central actor in that drama, who can also write brilliantly and wittily, give his interpretation of the important events and undercurrents swirling around Russia in 1917. If you are looking for a general history of the revolution or want an analysis of what the revolution meant for the fate of various nations after World War I or its affect on world geopolitics look elsewhere. E.H. Carr's History of the Russian Revolution offers an excellent multi-volume set that tells that story through the 1920's. Or if you want to know what the various parliamentary leaders, both bourgeois and Soviet, were thinking and doing from a moderately leftist viewpoint read Sukhanov's Notes on the Russian Revolution. For a more journalistic account John Reed's classic Ten Days That Shook the World is invaluable. Trotsky covers some of this material as well. However, if additionally, you want to get a feel for the molecular process of the Russian Revolution in its ebbs and flows down at the base in the masses where the revolution was made Trotsky's is the book for you.The life of Leon Trotsky is intimately intertwined with the rise and decline of the Russian Revolution in the first part of the 20th century. As a young man, like an extraordinary number of talented Russian youth, he entered the revolutionary struggle against Czarism in the late 1890's. Shortly thereafter he embraced what became a lifelong devotion to a Marxist political perspective. However, except for the period of the 1905 Revolution when Trotsky was chairman of the Petrograd Soviet and later in 1912 when he tried to unite all the Russian Social Democratic forces in an ill-fated unity conference, which goes down in history as the \`August Bloc', he was essentially a free lancer in the international socialist movement. At that time Trotsky saw the Bolsheviks as \\"sectarians\\" as it was not clear to him at that time that for socialist revolution to be successful the reformist and revolutionary wings of the movement had to be organizationally split. With the coming of World War I Trotsky drew closer to Bolshevik positions but did not actually join the party until the summer of 1917 when he entered the Central Committee after the fusion of his organization, the Inter-District Organization, and the Bolsheviks. This act represented an important and decisive switch in his understanding of the necessity of a revolutionary workers party to lead the revolution.As Trotsky himself noted, although he was a late comer to the concept of a Bolshevik Party that delay only instilled in him a greater understanding of the need for a vanguard revolutionary workers party to lead the revolutionary struggles. This understanding underscored his political analysis throughout the rest of his career as a Soviet official and as the leader of the struggle of the Left Opposition against the Stalinist degeneration of the Russian Revolution. After his defeat at the hands of Stalin and his henchmen Trotsky wrote these three volumes in exile in Turkey from 1930 to 1932. At that time Trotsky was not only trying to draw the lessons of the Revolution from an historian's perspective but to teach new cadre the necessary lessons of that struggle as he tried first reform the Bolshevik Party and the Communist International and then later, after that position became politically untenable , to form a new, revolutionary Fourth International. Trotsky was still fighting from this perspective in defense of the gains of the Russian Revolution when a Stalinist agent cut him down. Thus, without doubt, beyond a keen historian's eye for detail and antidote, Trotsky's political insights developed over long experience give his volumes an invaluable added dimension not found in other sources on the Russian Revolution.As a result of the Bolshevik seizure of power the so-called Russian Question was the central question for world politics throughout most of the 20th century. That central question ended practically with the demise of the Soviet Union in the early 1990's. However, there are still lessons, not all negative, to be learned from the experience of the Russian Revolution. Today, an understanding of this experience is the task for the natural audience for this book, the young alienated radicals of Western society.The central preoccupation of Trotsky's volumes reviewed here and of his later political career concerns the problem of the crisis of revolutionary leadership of the international labor movement and its national components. That problem can be stated as the gap between the already existing objective conditions necessary for beginning socialist construction based on the current level of capitalist development and the immaturity or lack of revolutionary leadership to overthrow the old order. From the European Revolutions of 1848 on, not excepting the heroic Paris Commune, until his time the only successful working class revolution had been in led by the Bolsheviks in Russia in 1917. Why? Anarchists may look back to the Paris Commune or forward to the Spanish Civil War in 1936 for solace but the plain fact is that absent a revolutionary party those struggles were defeated without establishing the prerequisites for socialism. History has indicated that a revolutionary party that has assimilated the lessons of the past and is rooted in the working class allied with and leading the plebian masses in its wake is the only way to bring the socialist program to fruition. That hard truth shines through Trotsky's three volumes. Unfortunately, this is still the central problem confronting the international labor movement today. Read this book many times."},{"Title":"THE HISTORY OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION","review":"Considered by some to be the greatest 20th century work of history, Trotsky's masterpiece could equally be considered great literature. Trotsky's &quot;protagonist&quot; is the Petrograd working class, whose consciousness develops under the ebb and flow of the revolution. Trotsky writes with superb eye for individual detail, his crowd scenes as masterly as Tolstoy's battles. This is one of the great works of the 20th century."},{"Title":"THE HISTORY OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION","review":"If you're looking for a light read, Trotsky's History of Russian Revolution is not the way to go by any means. But, despite its length, and despite the enormity of its topic, this is an amazingly accessible and engrossing account of one of the modern world's most important political and historical events, written by one of its main players. There are certainly some parts that are more difficult than others, and some where clearly Trotsky assumes an understanding of what happened in Russia during 1917 - an expectation of his readers that would have been utterly reasonable for the audience he was writing for, at the time he was writing, but which at times can be a bit confusing for a Westerner reading it almost 100 years later. But this is only occasionally frustrating and there is, in any event, a very helpful set of appendices and glossaris at the back that help you know who's who and what's what. It is, undoubtedly in my view, well worth the effort that it will take you to get through it. I don't think any other history of the revolution is as detailed, as comprehensive, and as engaging as this. There are times when it really has you on the edge of your seat - and that, no doubt, is largely because it is written by someone who was actually there.Max Eastman, who was a friend of Trotsky, gives us a translation that feels tremendously fresh and was enthusiastically endorsed by Trotsky himself."},{"Title":"THE HISTORY OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION","review":"If you want to learn how to change the world, read this book, not for the history, but for the practical realities of struggle, of how working people, peasants, oppressed nationalities, in struggle can topple what might seem an invincible and unjust regime. If this is a literary masterpiece, if it gives the real history, if it is a great analysis, it is because the writer wanted to share the experience of working people of the Old Russian Empire with people of the world, because he knew there would be a future that needed this book. This is that future!This is best read with volumes 25,26,27, & 28 of Lenin's collected worksWhile this book is not always available on Amazon, it is always available from BooksfromPathfinder, an Amazon Z store that you can get to by clicking on New and Used further up this page!"},{"Title":"THE HISTORY OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION","review":"This is one of the most exciting books I've ever read. It tells the amazing story of the Russian revolution of 1917, from the overthrow of the Czar to the Bolshevik Revolution of October. What makes it an incredible read is that the author, Leon Trotsky, was at the middle of it all, as one of the central planners of the insurrection that took power. Trotsky was a great revolutionary and great writer. But one thing I especially like about the book is that Trotsky uses excerpts from many other accounts, including those who hated him with a passion, to tell the story accurately. It is an inspiring story, especially for new generations of young people, workers and farmers who need to learn about an example showing that the dog-eat-dog system of capitalism we live in can be overthrown. For the definitive account of how this great revolution was later derailed, see Trotsky's Revolution Betrayed."},{"Title":"THE HISTORY OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION","review":"What a fantastic book! This is the Russian Revolution that you were never taught in school, full of fascinating detail. It shows you how workers can run society, and is a welcome antidote to all the right wing and Stalinist rubbish that has been written about the Russian Revolution in the last 80 years. Leon Trotsky was one of the great thinkers of the 20th century and his genius shines through in this magnificent book. Don't be put off by images of dry, dusty, incomprehensible academia - 'History of the Russian Revolution' is a vibrant living book which is just as valid and relevant today as when it was first published."},{"Title":"THE HISTORY OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION","review":"This book provides a very unique perspective into the Russian Revolution. Written by Leon Trotsky himself, it is an excellent way to get first hand information on the events of the revolution. Furthermore, it is very interesting to read how a leader of the revolution viewed the event after several years. Trotsky is an excellent writer, and his book is very detailed. My one warning is that if you don't know much about the Russian Revolution to begin with you may get somewhat confused because of the great amount of detail in this book.Trotsky's History of the Russian Revolution is written in the third person - just as a historian would write it - not in a first person narrative. After reading the book for a while, I sometimes even forget that it was written by Trotsky. Then, when some bizarre interpretation appears, I think - &quot;What is this? Who wrote this book?&quot; only to realize that, obviously, the book is written by Trotsky and would naturally be biased!Even if you don't read the entire book, just reading some of the passages can give you a very facinating perspective into the revolution. After all, Trotsky was one of the most important leaders during the revolution. It is not often that a revolutionary leader has time to record the events he lived through. Luckily for us, Trotsky did write an account of the Russian Revolution, an event that has clearly had immense influence on world history! So, I would totally recommend this book - read it, and see what Trotsky himself has to say!"},{"Title":"THE HISTORY OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION","review":"Trotsky's History of the Russian Revolution is a long, very complex, and extremely detailed treatment of the remarkably eventful period from February to October of 1917. Russia at the time was at war with Germany as part of an entente or three-country coalition that also included Great Britain and France. The Russian army was doing badly, its troops were ill-equipped and poorly supplied with essentials, and desertion and simple refusal to fight were commonplace. Some on the Russian political left, conspicuously the Bolsehviks led by Lenin and Trotsky, called for a separate peace, thereby hoping to put an end to the slaughter of Russians and enabling Russia's largely peasant army to return to its small plots of land.Russia, however, was still an hereditary monarchy, headed by Tsar Nicholas II. The Tsar was oblivious to his army's mounting losses and indifferent to the privations suffered by most Russian citizens. He was insular, oddly detached, inexplicably cheerful, and easily led by the Tsarina, who was under the pernicious influence of Rasputin, a semi-literate monk who ostensibly possessed preternatural foresight and wisdom.In February, with conditions throughout the country insufferably deteriorating and the army becoming more disorganized, ineffective, and badly bloodied, the Tsar was forced to abdicate. His most likely heirs had no interest in succeeding him, preferring lives of untroubled leisure. Mainstream political parties, including the Mensheviks and mis-named Social Revolutionaries, were indifferent to taking power, recognizing that Russia might prove to be simply ungovernable. On the left, the Bolsheviks were regarded by many as ideologically and programatically ill-suited to fostering the best interests of a state that was shedding the ill-fitting cloak of monarchy in favor a liberal-bourgeois regime.However, the liberal-bourgeois coalition that came to power in July proved as ill-suited to governing as its immediate predecessor. Yes, a revolution had occurred. Russia struggled into the 20th Century having divested itself of the most obvious and outmoded institutions peculiar to a monarchy. But the coalition-based liberal-bourgeois state that succeeded the rule of Nicholas II was equally ineffectual and even more unstable.All the while, the Bolsheviks, champions of the proletariat, the small peasants, and the front-line,trench-bound soldiers were anticipating and planning for an insurrection that would open the way for creation of a genuinely socialist state. As the popularity of the once-discounted Bolsheviks grew and conditions within Russia and at the front became increasingly intolerable, occurrence of an insurrection followed by a full-blown revolution became more likely. In late October the insurrection erupted, and the Bolsheviks were ready.This historical sketch does not begin to do justice to the astonishing mastery of detail and profound interpretative power that Trotsky brings to bear in his history of the Russian Revolution. The reader can only imagine that Trotsky had to be a man who never slept and never stopped thinking, observing, and reading, a revolutionary intellectual in the most powerful sense.At the same time, and recognizing that this book was originally published in three volumes, it's not difficult to find ways in which judicious editing could have made Trotsky's History shorter while losing nothing of importance. The book is interesting throughout, but there is so much material that it's hard not to lose the connections between various parts, from start to finish, of Trotsky's magnificent story. Trotsky, no doubt, would have had effective arguments for leaving the book just as it is.In view of the book's subject and length, I was surprised to find so few references to Marx as providing material useful in guiding the work of the Bolsheviks. Trotsky, unquestionably, benefited from reading Marx, but Marx seems clearly to have been but one source among many that Trotsky used in thinking about the development and destruction of social systems.Given the time and the place, even more surprising is the near-total physical absence of Lenin. Trotsky repeatedly, perhaps even gushingly, pays homage to Lenin as the wellspring of revolutionary wisdom. Perhaps so. In Trotsky's history, however, Lenin is almost always out of the country, in deep hiding, or incapacitated by illness. For one who held that being close to the people and sharing their struggles was essential to understanding the class-based nature of a society and its development, this seems a debilitating handicap. Perhaps Trotsky underestimates his own contribution and overvalues that of Lenin.Trotsky acknowledges that the work of any historian is open to charges of incidental subjectivity, tendentious selectivity, and self-interested interpretation. He holds, however, that his adherence to the materialist method provides safeguards against such sources of error. In making this claim, he uses the term \\"method\\" not as referring to a set of procedures and techniques, but a perspective, much as, say, Gadamer uses hermeneutics in Truth and Method. In my view, claims such as this are impossible to evaluate, and it would be remarkable, indeed, if Trotsky's History were not influenced by his own peculiar perspective. In that regard he is like the rest of us: his and our flights of fancy are constrained by the knowledge that others are studying the same thing. Trotsky fairly often refers to the work of other historians of the Revolution, including those on the right, especially Milulov, with whom he agrees more often than he disagrees. In Trotsky's case, however, it seems reasonable to argue that his actual method was his brilliance.Making a revolution is one thing, but building a socialist society is quite another. Trotsky understood this perfectly well. However, governing by giving \\"all power to the soviets,\\" while it may have a stirring populist appeal, is not self-explanatory. How Trotsky, Lenin, and others expected this to work is not evident; perhaps it was something that had to develop historically.Finally, both Trotsky and Lenin were convinced that \\"socialism in one country\\" would not last. Surrounded by capitalist nations, an isolated socialist state would soon be overwhelmed by bourgeois interests that governed the context in which it was located. Acknowledging the need to foment socialist revolution as, ultimately, a world-wide phenomenon is all well and good, but how does one transform the entire planet.Trotsky's History of the Russian Revolution is a demanding book, one that merits careful study. Given its length and complexity, however, it's difficult not to give up on it. Nevertheless, sticking it out until the end proves worth the effort."},{"Title":"THE HISTORY OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION","review":"Whatever Trotsky's faults or your own political persuasion, his own history of the Russian Revolution is an excellently written, engaging and energetic work.

Much was concealed even by his enemy Stalin, as it would have exposed Lenin, Trotsky's boss, as complicit. Trotsky was basically Lenin's enforcer and executioner. For example, his violent fist-shaking \\"take no prisoners\\" speech to the drunken mob in front of the Winter Palace in October 1917, defended only by a woman's brigade and troop of boy cadettes, led to unnecessary rapine slaughter. This event was white-washed also by the later propaganda films of Sergei Eisenstein, which distorted the violent Bolshevik coup against human freedom into something heroic. Trotsky lied to the Kronstadt sailors defending the remnants of the early Russian democracy to get them to surrender, and then had most of them shot, unleashing the Red Army to pillage Petrograd. As Generalisimo, he sent the Red Army across large areas of Russia to terrorize and murder the remnants of the democratic Soviets, stomping out all opposition to Bolshevism in what was little more than a prelude to the Red Terror and gulag death-camps.

Bartholet is a mother to one child born prior to her divorce, and two boys adopted from Peru as a single, divorcee. Batholet states that \\"The myth is that the legal structure surrounding adoption is designed to serve the best interests of the child. Actually experiencing the system as an adoptive parent shattered this myth for me.\\" As a woman who endured the international adoption process I too had this myth shattered. The current adoption system, both domestic and international, is a travesty. The needs of children are the lowest priority and their \\"best interests\\" is something to which only lip service is paid. Anyone who has traveled to a foreign country can attest to the heartbreaking conditions of orphanages and the bizarre affinity for orphanages over international adoption. You need only be exposed briefly to babies languishing in wooden cribs or strapped to potties as early as possible to be appalled by the fact that so-called \\"advocates\\" for children oppose adoption and actually support anti-adoption sentiments. Most of the children in these orphanages are not legally \\"available\\" for adoption, yet they are purportedly \\"better off\\" being NOBODY'S CHILD than being an American's child. It is a disquieting notion, but nonetheless a reality.Elizabeth Bartholet is a voice of reason in the adoption world; a world that is sadly perverted by anti-adoption forces clinging to a mythological ideology that blood equates to the best parenting scenario for all children. This is a dangerous ideology as many are willing to sacrifice children's lives in order to defend it. Children rot away in the foster care system and most are reunited with their parents at all costs - to the point that many are killed by their biological parents who are unfit to parent them.

I can't think of a better use of our time than reading about great souls like Thomas Kelly, Max Ehrmann, and Sarah Farmer."},{"Title":"Restless Souls : The Making of American Spirituality","review":"I excitiedly picked up this book when it came out but only recently found the time to sit down with it. The topic is one that I am fascinated by and have studied a bit. I walked away at the end overall disappointed. That is not to say the book does not have merit.First the pluses...The subject matter....as the cultural creatives or integral inclined individuals who are \\"spiritual but not religious\\" look to see the pattern or history in America that has been brewing on the cutting edge of religious/spiritual thought the last 150 years or so...the subject is a timely one that needs to be fully explored....thanks for taking it on.Covering some of the essential forces.....Emerson and the transcendentalists are explored and cited.A few engaging stories of lesser known influences.....I liked the stories of Ralph Waldo Trine (with whom I have read and was familiar) and Sarah Farmer (with whom I was not).Now the minuses....The format of chapters focusing on some topic (e.g., meditation) and how they impacted our growth....this seemed forced, there was too much overlap of the stories with the details of those brought out in other chapters and led to each chapter jumping around to bring too many short references to other influences that maybe related to the chapter's \\"topic\\".The author's writing style was not always engaging. Some of his stories engaged (as mentioned), but (and this may be a product of how he outlined his chapters into topics) there seemed to be too much jumping around. He could have benefited from using a bit more of a sequential fact telling to help his reader stay with the overall story....bottom line was that there were really engaging stories within chapters and they were strung together with other details that led to the overall direction of the chapter being somewhat lost.The biggest complaint.....so many major influences upon the modern desire for spiritual experiences were either not in the book or only briefly mentioned in some passing reference (or were mentioned sporactically as he wanted to make a point about them in this themed chapters, hence losing the importance of them). For example, he mentions New Thought collectively but primarily points at Dresser as the entire subject. He does mention some of Quimby and a bit of Mary Baker Eddy and Christian Science in reference to NT but most NT scholars quickly point out that Christian Science is not truly New Thought...readers of this book would think that it is. Major New Thought influences are not mentioned at all! Where is Emma Curtis Hopkins, Charles and Myrtle Fillmore (Unity), or Ernest Holmes (Science of Mind)? All had much more lasting influence than Dresser or Trine....and in the more popular culture, where is Dale Carnegie, Norman Vincent Peale, or Napoleon Hill? Where are other major Eastern influences such as Yogananda? I could go on....If this truly is the \\"making of American Spirituality\\" as the title implies, then this books greatest failure is one of omission of very real and vital influences upon that topic.Finally, the payoff on current culture in the book seemed to be reduced to pitting traditional conservative Christians vs the \\"Church of Oprah\\". Although Oprah certainly is an influence, she is more indicative of the maturing of Americans such that those few who were on the cutting edge of sprituality in the 19th century are now growing in numbers due to more and more people transcending old worldviews and moving into what has been labeled the cultural creatives (or the green and higher meme levels in Spiral Dynamics). This natural evolution of our culture is the end game story which the author overlooked.I would have given this book 2 1/2 stars if possible....kudos for tackling the topic....kudos for some engaging stories of a few of the influences on American spirituality....however for someone looking for the \\"making of American spirituality\\", please know that you are getting only certain interesting pieces of background presented to you without a full picture of what is truly unfolding in our current society."},{"Title":"Restless Souls : The Making of American Spirituality","review":"I've been using this book in a class I teach on contemporary spirituality, and students have responded well to it. Schmidt focuses on the New England axis, as it were, of American liberal religion, and leaves it to others to explore the later developments. I wanted to read, for example, about Esalen and the sixties, Ramtha, Seth, and Oprah, but I think Schmidt was wise to limit his focus. Perhaps we'll see a volume two? I would certainly enjoy that. What's excellent about the book is that it demonstrates that American metaphysical or liberal spirituality is not ONLY Robert Bellah's \\"Sheilah-ism,\\" i.e., self-indulgent, narcissistic, etc. It is a genuine spiritual quest and, as such, provides a real alternative for contemporary culture that seems divided between right wing religious lunacy and (truly) self-indulgent materialism.

And yes, the book addresses the fundamental need to illuminate the persistence of liberal theology in America. But, while there are several sparkling veins of valuable information here, extracting them from the tough ore of worthless rumination proved entirely too tedious for me.I agree with the comments by Mark Gilbert on this page that the writing \\"jumps around\\" far too much. We can be more definite about it: the writing is by turns too often disorganized, repetitive, facile, and, ultimately, completely unequal to the author's grandiose ambition. After all, the very idea of a book that seriously addresses both Oprah and Emerson, as if one of them has anything remotely to do with the other, is absurd. So, in a word, the book is a sobering display of self-indulgence: it's not much more than an exercise in remarkably-well-informed free association, masquerading as perceptive analysis.Don't think E.

Tej K. Bhatia's book is an outstanding, gentle, yet comprehensive introduction to the Hindi language for a beginner. It's difficult to cite the numerous reasons why this book is so valuable for the apprehensive beginning language-learner, but I'll make an attempt to summarize the high points:(1) Bhatia is careful not to overwhelm the beginning learner with the complexities of the Devanagari script too early. He has the perfect instructor's touch here, rendering most of the early dialogues in Roman characters while gradually easing the learner into Devanagari as he/she gains more confidence in the basics of speaking and comprehending.(2) Bhatia's book has just enough grammar to give any Hindi learner a handy mental framework for organizing the rules of sentence construction, without being too intimidating. Happily, Hindi grammar resembles that of Mandarin Chinese in some respects, though not quite as simple as Mandarin-- it's fairly consistent, broad-brushed enough to allow sophisticated emotional and logical expression yet accessible enough that even beginning students can basically vocalize their thoughts after just a couple weeks of study. Bhatia does a fine job of really organizing this grammar in the right sequence, explaining the niceties of Hindi syntax while taking some of the language's trickier aspects (e.g. postpositions, as in Japanese, participles, causatives, the oblique) and making them seem eminently manageable.(3) Pronunciation, often neglected in self-teaching language books, gets more than a cursory treatment here, an asset not to be downplayed!(4) The tape/CDs have a wealth of spoken material and can be conveniently played at home, on the road or on the plane or train or bus.(5) Bhatia's book, as the series title suggests, really focuses on Hindi as a colloquial idiom. While this may at first seem trivial, it's a very important asset to his book! In India, there are in effect two forms of Hindi-- the formalized literary version used in ceremonial and official circumstances, and the popular \\"Bollywood\\" Hindi that's used on the street and in the markets throughout India and, indeed, much of the world (including in quite a few South Asian shops in New York City, where this \\"common Hindi\\" is a sort of lingua franca). It's this colloquial Hindi (very closely resembling Urdu), essentially, that's so rapidly become a world language and taken much of the world by storm as Bollywood movies and music, among other Indian exports, become so popular.In practice, this \\"colloquial Hindi\\" isn't even entirely Hindi, but a hybrid spoken tongue with a Hindi foundation plus plenty of contributions from Malayalam, Marathi, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, and other Indian as well as European languages tossed in to spice the mix, popular throughout the Subcontinent in its varieties. While Bhatia doesn't delve too much into the varied vocabulary of this \\"dialectical Hindi(ish)\\" language, his dialogues and idiomatic expressions do a fine job of conveying true conversational Hindi to the learner and thus providing a nice basis for communicating in the popular Hindi that's actually used between native speakers.In its dialectical varieties, Hindi-Urdu has close to a billion speakers worldwide, may soon become a UN official language and-- along with Spanish and Mandarin Chinese-- may well be one of the \\"essential languages\\" of the 21st century as India continues its ascent. Moreover, since Hindi is a fellow Indo-European language, it has enough similarities to intrigue and delight a native European-language speaker and smooth the learning process. In fact, if you've already learned an important European language like French, German or Spanish-- or Farsi Persian or Dari, which Hindi-Urdu in many ways resembles-- you'll have a headstart in mastering the quirks and structures of Hindi, especially as Bhatia presents it.Besides which, Hindi is a beautiful and poetic language that sings as much as it speaks, equally at home conveying complicated scientific concepts as in expressing the deepest emotions of the heart. Bhatia is an experienced and talented teacher of this wonderful language, and after just a couple months of studying you'll find yourself able to communicate at a decent level, maybe even humming some Hindi music during your lunch break."},{"Title":"Colloquial Hindi: The Complete Course for Beginners (Colloquial Series)","review":"This is a fantastic resource. I have just received my copy and already I am in love with it. It is very well-written, and strikes a nice balance between the structure of the langauge and usability. I especially like that the author is no fan of prescriptivists, and so presents \\"Hindi as she is spoke\\". I would not say that it is \\"better\\" than Snell's TYH, but it takes a slightly different approach, and is, in my opinion a great complement to the other work.My only gripes are the way that all the devanagari is stuck at the back (grr!) and that I had to buy the book and CD separately. Even with those minuses, it is absolutely worth it, and I would rate it a must have."},{"Title":"Colloquial Hindi: The Complete Course for Beginners (Colloquial Series)","review":"An excellent book for beginners, like the title implies, it is mainly a course in Colloqial Hindi, and almost omits the Devanagari syllbary entirely. There is only one chapter on it, but that chapter is very helpful all the same. The tape that comes with the book is a necessary element; it is integrated with the exercises in the book quite nicely, so make sure you get the cassette as well. The romanisation scheme is weird, but it's not too difficult. As an introduction to spoken Hindi, this can't be beat. For a better knowledge of the Devanagari syllabary, I would recommend Snell's &quot;Teach Yourself Hindi&quot;."},{"Title":"Colloquial Hindi: The Complete Course for Beginners (Colloquial Series)","review":"I felt Colloquial Hindi was like teacher inside a book teaching me.

Not only did this book teach me Hindi quite thoroughly, but the culture as. It was like going to India and learning Hindi there!"},{"Title":"Colloquial Hindi: The Complete Course for Beginners (Colloquial Series)","review":"I found it clear, gradual and (most over all) aware of the non-linguistic rules related to conversation. I disagree with the &quot;London reader&quot;: I found the romanization good and easy to follow... maybe it's 'cause I'm italian or 'cause I was teaching myself Hindi just for pleasure, so I wasn't expecting nothing more than an aid!"},{"Title":"Colloquial Hindi: The Complete Course for Beginners (Colloquial Series)","review":"If a textbook for Hindi must use some romanistion then it should use the same system as R.S.McGregors' Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary, as &quot;Teach Yourself Hindi&quot; does. The authors of that title, R.Snell &amp; S.Weightman, teach Hindi at London University's School of Oriental and African Studies.Further this textbook relegates the devanagari script to the rear of the book and includes no devanagari at all for the tape dialogues.As a final black mark the standard reached in the course is way short of Snell/Weightmann. This is partly a product of having 10 lessons instead of 18.Recommendation : Get Snell &amp; Weightmann, and then McGregor's Dictionary and Grammar. Use Bhatia if you need extra tape practice."},{"Title":"Colloquial Hindi: The Complete Course for Beginners (Colloquial Series)","review":"I purchased both the book and the audio CD, and so far I've read maybe 8 or so pages, but have played the CDs quite a bit as a companion to my daily commute. Bhatia is my first exposure to Hindi langauge instruction. So far the experience has been enjoyable, though a lot of Hindi letters sound alike to my tin ear.Compared to products I've used for other langauges (mostly Berlitz tapes), the Hindi CD is a vast improvement, moving beyond \\"set piece conversation\\" into more general usage.Obviously, I'm not in a position to critique Bhatia's style of instruction or other technical details.The CDs I received are \\"burned\\" (CD-Rs) with one-color silk screening, and not pressed. That's OK, but for extra safety, ripping a copy for general use is recommended. Keeping CD-Rs in hot cars is an express ticket to data oblivion.My only minor gripe is that I wish that those who write about Hindi or Indian culture would stop apologizing for India's social problems. Remember, the USA broke away from Great Britain in 1776 with a population of about 3 million. India started her own path in 1947 with a population hundreds of times greater. It took the USA roughly 70-80 years to achieve social and economic milestones comparable to Europe.

The authors pick out a huge variety of Bible readings, and then explain their significance and context in a way that's both profound and completely understandable. I am finally able to see &quot;the big picture.&quot; It's also removing a source of guilt from my life - one of those things that you don't realize is such a thorn in your side until it's gone.

What's even more benificial is that after each of the 365 readings, Yancey and Quinn see to it that the reader understands the historical and practical issues of significance of the passages have just read. If you have desired a devotional that will help you undersatand scripture in its entirety as well as answering the all-important &quot;what does it have to do with me?&quot; this is by far the best tool I have ever seen to give your relationship with God the boost it so often needs.

The Paradise War by Stephen Lawhead begins a series built around one of these \\"British-isms\\": ordinary, humble folk from our dreary mundane world stumbling into a magical parallel world quite by accident. Unlike the obvious Chronicles of Narnia-type examples however, this series was written purely for grownup audiences.Lewis is a graduate student at Oxford; one of those bookish, plain sorts who would never get any female attention if it weren't for his handsome, impulsive roommate Simon. One day they decide to take a road trip north to investigate some paranormal happenings reported in a tabloid. Simon ends up crossing over into the parallel world unwittingly, and a few months later a frantic and confused Lewis follows to \\"rescue\\" him. Instead, Lewis finds that Simon has passed four years as a warrior in the fantastic and barbaric Otherworld of Albion and has settled in happily. In order to survive in this savage and beautiful land, Lewis must also undergo an extreme transformation. Meanwhile, the barrier between the worlds is wearing thin and leaking through to England. Disaster for both worlds is inevitable unless Lewis can convince his friend to return with him and find a solution.Lawhead depicts this alternate realm of Albion as a legendary paradise that is based on a lot of research into Celtic folklore and traditions. I can really respect the labor of love that this kind of world-building represents. The author is also careful to remain true to the harsher realities of survival in a primitive culture; there are battles and grim bloodshed depicted (fans will get their share of this Lawhead staple), almost a surreal counterpoint to the lovely land and peoples he describes. There are also spiritual themes weaving through the plot: the evils of pride and folly, and how these things have far-reaching consequences throughout time and space; providence; and inner transformation being more important than anything physical. Lawhead delivers these messages masterfully and without preaching.The Song of Albion promises to be a rich, absorbing read if this first book is any example. My reaction to TPW was enthusiastic, even though I do not normally seek out fantasy that involves so much war strategy and action thrills. Despite a few choppy transition passages, the storytelling is solid. I anticipate picking up book two immediately to continue the adventure.-Andrea, aka Merribelle"},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Although I am a voracious reader, I rarely read fantasy...I suppose because I am tired of being dragged into &quot;created worlds&quot; that rarely seem to be believeable or worthy of the time involved in figuring them out.

I knew nothing of Celtic history or legends, but this author wove the threads of &quot;real&quot; legends and lore into his &quot;otherworld&quot; so completely and so perfectly you never question the reality of it all!! And to be perfectly honest, right up to the LAST sentence of the LAST book, he had me hooked. I am ashamed to say I put off more than one chore/responsiblity to get in ONE MORE CHAPTER before falling asleep at night!!

Thats that!I was so impressed and pleased to have stumbled upon this book.I just happened to pick it up; I read one of Lawhead's others before and remembered that other reviewers had said that other book wasn't one of his best. So I decided to try it and apparently found his best. Geez.The ideas that it has, they're so savory. Could it be that the fairy world is just a go around the cairn away?His logic, argument, writing style, magic, whatever it was, had me convinced that there truly is another world out there. And it is beautiful. Imagine that world----that world with out our modern conveniences---the most profound perhaps, imagine that world with out our modern sound.

Its a fast pace to get there, too.Simon, the main characters friend, is an intriguing enigmatic fellow. We think we know him so well until the last of the story.The next part of the book is gaining acceptance and appreciation of that other realm.And the last part is fighting to keep it whole and sound.

He does his research and has the knack of being able to &quot;get into&quot; other cultures.The premise of this book: two Oxford graduate students who get transported through a sacred cairn into Another Place -- is an interesting theme and Lawhead works it fairly well. The character development is lacking at times and the development of character motives can be unnecessarily slow but there are moments of brilliance which do make the book worthwhile. (I particularly loved the encounter with the Serbian and his restaurant.)However, JRR Tolkien, CS Lewis, and even Charles Williams have nothing to fear here -- Lawhead comes nowhere near to their level (or even to the level of Robert Jordan).Read this book, enjoy the series -- but don't expect &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"As an avid fantasy reader, I was reluctant to try this trilogy because Lawhead is not one of the best known fantasy writers.

This is a \\"can't miss it\\" for the Celtophile, as it details an adventure to the Celtic Otherworld, which is also called Faerie. He has done impeccable research into the Celtic myths and the totality of his vision in weaving all this into a fascinating novel is nothing short of astonishing. Even if you don't have any background in the Celtic past and myths this would be a gripping tale. The pacing just never flagged. In summation, it was totally wonder-full."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"5 Word Review:Exciting, thrilling, captivating, inexorable, awesomeThe premise for The Paradise War seems to be a familiar one: 2 otherwise normal, decently adjusted people are taken from their average, dreary world and either given extraordinary powers or put into an extraordinary, otherworldly place and left to fend for themselves and start an adventure. That part of this book as a foundation is unchanged from the archetype, I think. That is where the similarities begin and end, though!Two Oxford graduate students, Lewis and Simon, venture out on a spontaneous road trip to visit a mysterious cairn with possible connections to \\"The Otherworld\\", an alternate dimension of Celtic history where the past of our world is transpiring as the present for Otherworlders. Right away you can tell that Simon is the more adventurous, yet more quarrelsome, of the two... Whereas Lewis is reserved and quiet, Simon is outgoing and indefatigable. This disparity ends up playing into several storylines once the boys reach \\"The Otherworld\\" and I recommend watching for this theme throughout your reading of the book!After a really slow start for The Paradise War (About 50 pages or so), the reader will be transported through clever prose and sentence structure into Tuatha de Denann, \\"The Otherworld\\" as Lewis called it, there is an explosion of awesomeness not unlike the slow warm-up of an F-16 Falcon fighter jet which appears to be sitting idly thrust all of a sudden into a full afterburner take-off. After those first agonizing 50-ish pages, I found myself having to put time aside throughout my day for The Paradise War, promising to get \\"at least 2 chapters\\" at a time read. 2 chapters turned into 3, which turned into 4, and that's when I knew this book was a winner.Many folks criticize The Paradise War for telling the reader what to think as opposed to letting the reader make up his or her own mind, but I never felt forced in any way while reading this book. I felt that, for something so very, very foreign to me (As both a genre of fiction AND being about complicated Celtic history and myth), Lawhead took the correct approach. Perhaps this would've felt patronizing to someone who was either very well versed with the genre and could therefore easily predict what would happen next, or someone who was, himself or herself, a scholar of Celtic history. Barring those 2 possibilities, however, I can't see how the \\"told what to think\\" complaint is truly valid.A fantastic thing for me in this book was the unemphasized existence of a romantic attachment. It seems like romance, sex and the like is a complete necessity nowadays, but Lawhead wove in a cute, age-appropriate romance for Lewis and a girl he met at a particular school in The Otherworld. Perhaps this was due to his devout Christian faith, but in any event, this romance was never cringe-worthy (Haven't you ever face-palmed at a particular scene in a book where you were just thinking, \\"NO WAY that actually happened!\\"? I know I have...) and added to the story, rather than detracted from it.Progressing through the book, the reader WILL experience a variety of emotions: Hope, intrigue, sadness, agititation, excitation, and anticipation. The plot unravels in a seamless fashion, moving inexorably from one plotline to the other, wrapping things up nicely... Which is a huge \\"plus\\" for me. Not everyone cares for the \\"happy ending\\" and the neat bow-wrapped story lines like I do, and if you're one of those, then perhaps that might be annoying for you. But it was great for me!There are glorious fight sequences, wonderful best-friend altercations (Isn't it so human to argue with your best friend once in a while? So many books neglect this!), cute romances, and generally just an epic feeling about this book. The Paradise War has puzzles to solve, problems to overcome, quests to complete, and sides to root for - It is just amazing and I have a hard time finding anything particularly troublesome about the book, besides the slow introduction and progression into \\"The Otherworld\\", where the bulk of the story takes place. At one point, Lewis, who you'll recall was the less adventurous of the two, is transported back to \\"our world\\", to find out that only a matter of days transpired, despite him having experienced years of combat and training!"},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"So begins the The Paradise War, the first book in the Song of Albion trilogy by Stephen Lawhead. Cynical Oxford grad student Lewis Gillies is convinced by his roommate Simon to drive to Scotland to investigate the truth behind a tabloid photo of an long extinct type of oxen. Upon arriving, they make several discoveries, including an ancient mound known as a cairn. But before Lewis can stop him, Simon goes into the cairn and disappears. Believing that he has fallen victim to one of Simon's pranks, Lewis returns home. Very quickly however, strange events begin to overwhelm him and Lewis learns that he must find Simon and bring him home before the whole world is threatened. This launches him on an amazing adventure that continues in The Silver Hand and The Endless Knot.This hidden gem was introduced to me by a friend's wife and has turned out to be among the best fantasy literature I've ever read. Lawhead is an adoring anglophile as evidenced by his other major works, the Pendragon Cycle (his own retelling of the King Arthur legend) and The King Raven Trilogy (a retelling of the Robin Hood legend). Steeped in Celtic mythology, Albion is no different. In fact, Lawhead's expertise is such that it is nearly impossbile to tell where facts and history end, and fantasy begins.The trilogy is written in first person which has its strengths and weaknesses. Seeing and experiencing everything through the eyes of Lewis really makes you feel a part of the story. However, as time goes on you want to respond to the story in your own way rather than being told. A narrator change in the second book is a nice touch and allows you to experience the world from a new perspective.The setting is richly told. The plot is well-crafted and full of layers. The prose and dialogue are excellent. But Lawhead's greatest strength is his characters. From heroes to villians and everyone in between, Lawhead peoples his world with distinct, interesting and sincere characters, giving each an opportunity to show they matter.Even more impressive, is Lawhead's powerful, yet nuanced inclusion of Biblical themes. There is too much to give it justice in this short review, but through the plot, parables, prophecies, character arcs, and imagery, Lawhead explores the corruption and redemption of creation, good vs. evil, providence, and liberation from sin. All of this is done with the right amount of thoughtfulness and subtly.My only real criticism is with the ending where things seemed a bit rushed and incomplete. All said however, The Song of Albion is an outstanding fantasy series that has found itself among my favorites, and placed Lawhead firmly in the tradition of Tolkien and Lewis."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Getting lost in Albion is a rare treat. This is the first (and only) book I have read as an adult that made me feel as if I had managed to step into a realm far more beautiful then anything that could be known in this.This is a book that engages on many levels with a story that can be read as simple mind candy or with a careful disection of symbols, either way the story only disappoints in that it must end.In fact, I was so engrossed in the story I did not realize the pages were running out! The shock of such an abrupt ending literally made me scream at Mr. Lawhead for leaving me hanging until I could get the next two books (which I read within two days of recieving them)."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I have rarely read another book or series of books that so fully and effectively transport you to another world like Stephen R. Lawhead's The Song Of Albion series does.As the first volume of this series, this begins the story of Lewis Gillies, an American scholar in modern day England who travels with his buddy Simon Rawnson to Scotland to check out a tabloid story. Turns out that the tabloid story isn't so trumped up after all. After Simon disappears due to unexplainable phenomena, Lewis is drawn into ancient Scotland to find him and bring him home.The adventure that ensues is an adventure and drama of an epic scale that sees Lewis become a warrior and a hero. A story of betrayal, greed, adventure and a touch of romance, filled with great characters and peppered liberally with Celtic legends and lore, this is a story that is hard to put down. Go ahead, take the journey. When it is over, you, like Lewis, may wish you never had to leave the world of ancient Albion. I know I was hooked and you just might hooked on it too. Peace."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I got this book out of the library at the recommendation of a friend. I can honestly say that my life has never been the same.This is the first book of the Song of Albion trilogy. It opens with two college students sharing a flat, and one dissapears inside a cairn. (Long story) From that point on, the adventure grows wings. The main character, Llew, goes from being a college student, feeling like he has no point in his life, to a man discovering the world anew. He learns to deal with evil--real evil, not the petty inconveniences that plagued him at the university.When Llew (then Lewis) is swept into the otherworld, Lawhead describes its perfection beautifully. I know that I smelt the air, saw the perfection of every little blade of grass, experienced the unconditional love of a swordbrother, and fully realized the horror of having that world defiled.The few-chapter dissertation of the concept of beauty opened my eyes, along with Lewis', to a new world. When I first read this part, I found it dry and rather incomprehensible. Then, as the tale elapsed, I understood. For all you readers slightly bored with Nettles' explanation, just be patient. Like Lewis, you're eyes will be opened in time.Besides the philosphy, this story had wonderful action. Llew and Tegid's journey to the heart of the earth, the fight with the cynthrawl, and the murder of Meldryn are gripping. Also, there is a lot of humor throughout. (&quot;I told him that Simon had run off with the maid from Boots. Served him right, the toad.&quot;)I will reiterate my warning: Once you progress far enough into this book, you will be held in a death grip for the rest of the series. The only reason I gave this book 4 stars is that the other two are slightly better. I do not want to decrease their credibility.I believe someone below mentioned this: GET ALL THREE AT ONCE! You will want to have &quot;The Silver Hand&quot; right at your elbow when you finish."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"There is not a dull moment in any of the Song of Albion books.

In my opinion, the Paradise War was one of the finest books I have read, though it certainly did not have the same feeling it gave me reading the Dragon King trilogy.

The mystical link between worlds is enchanting. As one who owns all of Stephen Lawhead's fictional works, I can easily say that this series is the best. Each book leaves you wanting more.

It was written in first-person, but I never felt like I really got attached to the main character or knew his motivations or cared much about what happened to him. The first half of the book has our Ph.D. Oxford students behaving like high school kids with no responsibilities or much intelligence. Once they arrive in the Otherworld it is full of content that that these history scholars should have expert knowledge of, but they are mostly clueless. In the first chapter or two we get some good visualization of the characters, who they are and where they're from, but after that I don't know why they're bumbling through Oxford (they never work on their studies or have any responsibilties). When we reach the Otherworld we're told what to think and feel (e.g. the comparison and contrast of modern industrial society to the author's utopic Celtic society) rather than letting the reader decide for themself through the prose. If you're looking for a good fantasy read you can do much better. If you're determined on finding a book that centers on an adventure through Celtic lore, have at it."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Have you ever imagined being caught up in your favorite myths? Well that is precisely what happens to a pair of college students, who find themselves participants in ancient celtic lore when they are transported via a mysterious portal. But what sounds like a cool idea in theory is a rather plain read. The story is enjoyable as a casual read, but lacks the punch of really epic fantasy. Much of the dialogue is dull, and the author has a terrible tendency to tell us how we are suppose to feel or respond to a given scene instead of just letting the words speak for themselves. I'm not much of a scholar on Celtic lore, but the presentation is authentic enough. I just wish the characters themselves also felt authentic. I never really get behind them. Their reactions to events are too muted to have a realistic feel."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"As a story this is very enjoyable and exciting - I quickly found myself immersed in the mystery, adventure, scheming and magic that the author skillfully portrays. My one complaint, however, is with the mistakes and inaccuracies scattered throughout the series. For example, when Lewis first meets Simon in the Otherworld, Simon says that he was named 'sylfenu' by the 'Celts' because they just 'found' him. This is a very sloppy error, as in Welsh 'sylfaenu' means 'to found' ( as in to establish, or set up ) and not 'to find'. A better choice would have been 'darganfyddiad' which means a discovery, or something found. I realise that to the vast majority of (non-Celtic) readers this doesn't mean much, but to someone who knows his native language and culture it is a bit cringe-inducing ! Also, the author mixes the different Celtic languages freely, as if they were used interchangeably by all the Celtic peoples, whether Welsh, Irish, Scotish, Manx, Cornish or Breton. Linguistic and cultural quibbles aside however, it is a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The characters in the story looking for an interesting distraction turning it into and amazing misadventure Monsanto a different world and place."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Although at times very engaging, it wasn't as captivating for me as the Arthur or the Hood series.

Lawhead's &quot;Song of Albion&quot; series, &quot;The Paradise War&quot; is one book that any lover of fiction will want to read. When Simon Rawnson accidentally steps into a portal, linking this world to the Otherworld in ancient Celtic Mythology, it is chaos for his roommate Lewis Gillies. Lewis at first doesn't think much of it, but as time goes on and Simon doesn't show up, Lewis starts seeing things that make him think the old Celtic Mythology is true. When, four months later, (and four years later in the Otherworld), Lewis finds himself trapped in a Celtic circle maze, Professor Nettleton, AKA Nettles, comes to help out. Nettles helps Lewis figure out what is going on with his friend and how it is slowly destroying our world. When Lewis starts to understand, he goes to find his friend in Albion, the Otherworld. When Lewis arrives, he finds himself all alone and trapped in between two warbands. Fortunately, Simon finds him and slays the opposing army's champion. To save Lewis's life, Simon lets Lewis get the honor of slaying the Champion, not getting the credit that Simon deserves. But as things progress, Lewis's role in Albion begins to change. The king sends him off to a warriors camp on Ynnys Sci. There, he is trained for seven years. When he goes back to the king, chaos has erupted. The chief bard of the king is dead, and someone is plotting to kill the king. What will happen next? Will Lewis get back to his world with Simon and stop the chaos that is destroying both worlds, or will Lewis die in a battle against the evil Lord Nudd, the king of the Otherworld's version of Hell. Read on and find out. If you liked the Pendragon or The Dragon King Trilogy Series, I will guarantee that you will love this book.

I absolutely love how intelligent and intriguing this story is. It pulls you in with compelling storylines, complexity of characters, and illustrates wholesome values often undervalued in modern society. I was given the set as a gift and have already read them all 3 times through to make sure I didn't miss a detail. I will admit the final book in the series was not my favorite of the three, but I think that's more to force the reader to feel the hero's utter devastation at the turn of events and you end up regretting how things inevitably conclude. I think the author did a decent job of helping you understand how he takes the first step toward getting on with the rest of his life, as regrettable as it is to him and to us. Ultimately once you've read the 1st two books you can't resist reading the last, so whether you approve of the author's choice of ending or not there's no reason not to finish the series and follow the story full circle.I'm now a fan and I'm back to see how many more Stephen Lawhead novels I can scoop up.

LawheadThe Paradise War is the first book in Lawhead's Song of Albion trilogy. Lawhead is best known for writing stories infused with Celtic mythology and history. The Song of Albion Trilogy and his King Arthur series are two of his most well known series, though his retelling of Robin Hood has garnered many fans as well.There may be minor spoilers throughout.In the books I've read, Lawhead tends to write two types of stories. One type is the retelling of a famous myth, such as King Arthur or King Raven. These stories usually chronicle their early days and work in many of the popular elements of the myth while using his knowledge of history to add realism. His second type of story is that of an apathetic person suddenly thrust into a strange new world. The Paradise War is one of the later types.Lewis Gilles is an unassuming Oxford scholar with an adventure seeking roommate/best friend, Simon. When Simon begins investigating the supposed appearance of mythological beasts, Lewis rolls his eyes at Simon's eagerness to believe everything. While investing these appearances, Simon enters a Cairn and doesn't come back out. This obviously unsettles Lewis. He teams up with a man named Nettles, who is an older scholar with a deep knowledge of Celtic history. Lewis ends up entering the same Cairn and it transports him to an ancient Celtic land called Albion.The first person Lewis meets is a battle crazed warrior who tries to kill him. The second person Lewis encounters is Simon, who slays the warrior but has Lewis pretend to have done it. Lewis quickly discovers that Simon has been in Albion for 5 years, even though in our world much less than a year has passed.Lewis is accepted into the kingdom and is sent to a training school where he will learn to be a warrior. A bard named Tegid is sent to bring Lewis back after the training is complete. They take a brief detour as Tegid attends a gathering of the bards, a gathering that proves fateful. An ancient evil creature attempts to escape bondage and is held at bay by the chief bard. Though the creature is repelled, it kills the chief bard. Before dying, the chief bard breathes into Lewis his \`awen' or spirit. Held within the spirit is the key to locating the Song of Albion.Tegid and Lewis continue back to their king, to give him the fateful news. Upon their return they find the castle destroyed, though the king and his war band are gone. They discover that a demon named Lord Nudd managed to escape the pits of hell while the chief bard held off the greater evil and this demon is ravaging the land.Tegid and Lewis are able to rejoin the king and they hold up in another fortress where they are repeatedly attacked by Lord Nuffen and his horde of demons that cannot be killed by mortal weapons. Lewis's only hope is in retrieving the hidden Song of Albion. For his part in saving Albion, Lewis is renamed Llew (renaming is a common tradition in the book).One of the things that immediately strikes me about this story is much of the realism that is present. When Lewis is trained, he doesn't become a sword master overnight. Rather he goes to a training school and is there for years. He also doesn't master the language immediately. At the end of the book he still needs to ask for clarification for words. While the way it is done is used more to cue the reader into certain Celtic phrases/words, it helps create a realistic setting for Lewis to be learning in.Another great thing is that the story is largely self contained. Though there are scenes that hint at a larger story (as well as a huge cliffhanger I won't reveal here), the primary narrative here isn't \`part one' of a larger one. Rather the narrative has a beginning/middle/end contained in this book as well as containing the \`beginning' of the larger narrative. One thing that often bugs me in trilogies is when the end of the first (or second) book offers no true conclusion but rather a cliffhanger with no satisfaction. At least the cliffhanger here comes withI also tend to be picky about my first person narratives, but Lawhead handles it well, creating a great environment of an Oxford student thrust into an ancient/mythological Celtic world.My biggest complaint is that the beginning dragged on too long. After Simon disappeared, it seemed to take forever for Lewis to eventually follow. I get that Lewis is supposed to be an apathetic type of person at first, but this was too apathetic. Your roommate just DISAPPEARED into a pile of rocks. I wouldn't go home and tell his girlfriend that he made an impromptu vacation thus missing a dinner date. Even if I thought it was a joke, I would call the police when he wasn't back after 24 hours, not seek the help of an old professor much, much later!7/10"},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I read many reviews of this book before I finally decided to pick it up. I was somewhat familiar with Lawhead having read Byzantium. I generally like historical fiction that's not a soap opera and that's historically accurate and somewhat feasible.I was a little bit turned off at first that this was considered fantasy. However once I started reading the book I couldn't put it down. Yes there are similarities to other works of literature (like C.S. Lewis) but it's original and stands on its own. For those that may be worried about reading a historical novel that's considered fantasy let me allay your fears without giving away any spoilers. Yes the fantasy part is one aspect of the book. But it is only a vehicle with which to deliver the historical side of the story which by the way makes up the majority of the book.For those that didn't like the book, well, some people are just malcontents when it comes to reading. Can't you just enjoy a good book that's well written and well researched? Reading is about going on a ride and stimulating the mind for enjoyment.I can certainly say this book fulfilled any expectations I had from previous reviews and then some.It now rests along side of Pillars of the Earth as one of my favorite books of all time and one in which I will recommend to everyone I know."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I love Trilogies and when I saw all three of the Song of Albion series on sale together I decided to give them a try. I had never read SRL before, but the concept of this series really caught my attention. Needless to say I was hooked. I have since read just about everything SRL has written, since March!As was mentioned in a previous review, the book takes a little while to get started (most Lawhead's books do), but it was all necessary backround and character development. I guess he could have just created a \\"time machine\\", but that wouldn't have been anywhere nearly as interesting a storyline Lawhead has created here. Part Fantasy, part historical fiction/speculation, I found this whole series both entertaining and educational and really created a good foundation for his other Celtic based storylines (i.e. Pendragon series, Hood, Celtic Crusades etc.) I don't know if it's just because this is first series of Lawhead's I read or what, but this is still my favorite SRL series, one which no doubt I will re-read more than once."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I read this book only because another book in the series sounded interesting and this is the first of the trilogy. It has a very slow start, but when it picks up I couldn't put the book down. It is a great story and I would recommend it to anyone. (I also recommend buying all three so you don't have to keep running out to the store for the next one!)"},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Lawhead's five-volume \\"Pendragon Cycle\\" series was magnificent, and the hope of another series as good seemed an unlikely dream. But in his three-volume \\"Song of Albion\\" series, Lawhead has more than matched the brilliance of his former effort. The series kicks off in \\"The Paradise War\\", introducing Lewis and Simon, two university students in Oxford, England. They are opposites in every way: while Simon is a rich, good looking and lazy Brit, Lewis is a poor, plain and hardworking American, and these opposites prove to play a key role in the events that transpire. Through a remarkable chain of events, Lewis and Simon both enter a Celtic paradise, the \\"other world\\" of Albion. Here they become warriors in a society with medieval traditions, ruled by kings and bards. There are similarities to the worlds of Narnia, and Lawhead paints the other world using language that has strong overtones of Plato's forms.But even more important than the Platonic overtones are the Biblical overtones. Lewis and Simon's involvement in the other world have Messianic and Satanic allusions respectively. The title \\"The Paradise War\\" is already an immediate indication that Lawhead is working with the Biblical themes of Creation, Fall, Redemption, and Consummation. Simon's entrance to Albion in the end proves to be a dangerous and destructive poison in a paradise: \\"Simon, who had forced his way into this world, had brought with him alien and deadly ideas\\" (p407). As great the good and beauty of this world is, so great is the evil and danger into which it is plunged. After receiving warrior training, Lewis plays a key role in rescuing Albion from the evil that threatens it. The main threat is the Cythraul and the infernal demonic host of Lord Nudd's warband, but before they can be conquered the Song of Albion must be restored with its magical singing stones. Lewis (called Llew in the other world) who performs the Hero Feat and so enables king Meldryn to conquer the enemy that threatens and defend the kingship. In his usual style, Lawhead doesn't go for complex allegory, but incorporates Biblical allusions. Readers familiar with Scripture will find many of them, such one instance alluding to Aaron and Hur holding Moses' staff aloft. Some readers might be critical of the fact that Lawhead uses Celtic religion rather than Biblical religion, since although the other world is ruled by the Swift Sure Hand, the Celtic lore at time approaches a pantheon with a plurality and hierarchy of gods, and forms of worship based on rituals and priestly figures much like Old Testament times. But it could be argued that under the guise of Celtic lore and materialistic religion, Lawhead is portraying and conveying valid truths about Christianity that apply in our world today.As always, Lawhead is tremendously articulate. Simon's wordy assessment of modern England is a wonderful example showcasing Lawhead's eloquence and humour (p14ff). The following metaphor is also typical of his talents at literary prose: \\"We might have exhausted our meal grain, but we possessed the bread of dissent in perpetual supply. When the last of the grain went, people reached for those ready loaves.\\" (p330). When such eloquence is combined with a vivid imaginative world and deeper themes of kingship, justice, truth and good, the result is a tremendously powerful story. It is enjoyable for any serious reader, but will especially be enjoyed by Christians who love fantasy in the style of C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien. To rank Lawhead on the same level as these two famous writers is perhaps too much, but readers of \\"The Paradise War\\" are sure to wish that they had heard of Lawhead sooner!"},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The first two books in this series may be the best of Lawhead's writing. I know 8 people that have read this book and we all enjoyed it greatly. The books were so enthrolling that Jeff Johnson wrote a series of celtic music CDs based on them. They are also worth purchasing. The books and CDs are delightful."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"In a trilogy that lies along the spectrum of two other British-born trilogies--Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; and C.S.Lewis' &quot;Space Trilogy&quot;--this is a fantasy that will be hard to put down. I took a few weeks to read the first volume, a week to read the next, and a few days for the third. The inner logic pulls you forward while the events continually surprise. There is here the beauty of Ireland (though in a more primal form), the heroism of the Celtic warriors, the subtlety of kingship derived from the people, the tenderness of friendship and romance. Though one need not be familiar with Celtic lore to appreciate these books, those who have done some study in it will it come to life."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I believe that this was the first of Lawhead's books that i read. And, now that i have traversed his literature more thoroughly, I see the characteristics of Lawhead shining through to make a brilliant story in the heart of another world. The story (characteristically for Lawhead) begins slightly slowly. In the middle of Oxford England weird things are happening, and honestly I didn't really get it or get into it until Oxford was far behind. As soon as the England part was over I was thrust into gripping suspense. I could not put this book down. The series quickly became my favorite trilogy ever--and subsequently my favorite books ever--with the beautiful description of a lost celtic world, enthralling story of a boy's journey into manhood and heroism, and driving plot. This is a must read for anyone who loves adventure, suspense, mythology, learning, or just a gripping page-turner. Two thumbs way way up!"},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Before I get into the review, let me assure you I am well-read in the fantasy genre, and that this is an honest review.Also, please like or dislike, and feel free to say what you think in the comments section. Also, read my other reviews!1. Similar to Narnia?Many reviewers have suggested that TPW (The Paradise War) is similar to The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis. Well, is it?- Only in premise.The writing style is similar: first person, second person. And, even though the narrator is American, it still has a wonderful British taste and feel to the book.The premise is similar: Ordinary young-people are transported magically to an alternate fantasy world, and find themselves caught up in the thick of things.But TPW is ever so much richer than Narnia.- Ahem... Throughout this review, you will see the word \\"rich\\" cropping up often. This is not because I have a limited vocabulary; it is because that is the perfect word to describe Albion. More on this later.When reading the book I forgot all about its similarities to Narnia. I was engrossed in Lewis\\\\Llew's adventures in Albion. This is mainly because the world Albion and the world Narnia are totally different. Namely: No talking animals.2. Albion ItselfAbove I said the word \\"rich\\" would come up a lot in this review--I'm not lying--Albion is a rich place. Plus, in Microsoft Word, the synonyms for rich are: wealthy, well-off, etc.That's not the rich I mean. As described by Lewis, every color looks brighter, everyone feels stronger, and everything looks more alive. That's the rich I mean.I have several criteria for fantasy worlds. Perhaps the biggest one is the one I call the Golden Rule of Fantasy:Fantasy Should Have Some Ground in Reality.To explain: Middle Earth has ground in myths. Westeros in history. Albion in myths. The bases of these strong worlds are in reality, and therefore they make them believable and relatable to modern day readers.Albion fulfills this rule excellently. It is a world thick with Celtic heroes, great kings, princes, knights, warriors, prophets, and ordinary humans.Albion is a world from days of fantasy gone by. Today we have gritty, grey worlds, which, although they have their own appeal, make me wish for the fantasy worlds of Tolkien and Lawhead when Heroes were good and Villains were bad.3. Of Villains, and Deux ex MachinasThe primary villain is so classic, so well-known, that I do not know how Lawhead gave him so much believability!He is Nudd, make that LORD Nudd. I'm sure you know who he is:Lord Nudd the Black, Lord of the Underworld, King of all Black Evil and Doom. He is the epitome of fantasy evil. He is the classic Dark Lord, the Sauron of Albion.He wears black, rides a HUGE aurochs, has a living snake for a torc, wears a wicked black crown, and carries a crooked, black blade!Now, these Uber-villains are a dime-a-dozen and quite frankly we're tired of them.Yet Nudd is different.He has been ramped up to heights beyond Galbatorix. He is a great villain, (with a name that...just...doesn't ...sound...err...villainy)His henchmen make the Orcs look like supermodels. They sound so indescribably ugly they make me sick! I won't describe them now so read the book to find out.!!!SPOILERS ARE CONTAINED IN THE FOLLOWING SECTION!!!Nudd is defeated in an ending that just sliiiiightly whispered \\"Deux ex Machina!\\" (Google it if you don't know what it means, which you should!)So Llew and Tegid descend into one of the 2 sacred centers of Albion, and they find the body of the Phantarch, which was supposed to help them defeat Nudd.Well, he's dead.Oh, but wait, he was crushed to death by rocks. Slooooowly...So how does that help?Well, he imbedded the Song of Albion into the rocks as he died--Smash the rocks, and, voila, the Song of Albion is released, and it repels all evil in its path!So the armies of Albion smash the rocks, the evil demon-spawn melt and die, and Nudd is defeated.!!!SPOILERS END!!!To me, there was just slightly too little effort involved in the defeat of Nudd.This is still a fitting ending to a good book, but it could have been done better.4. You Want To Keep ReadingBooks in a series should have some sort of conclusion to them, as well as prepare the way for the next book in the series. Rangers Apprentice, The Chronicles of Narnia, and The Lord of the Rings all do this, but The Song of Albion ends in a way that makes you wish you could just turn the page from the ending of Book 1 to the first page of Book 2.The moment it concludes one plot line, it introduces a whole skein of new problems, and I just can't wait to keep reading!CONCLUSION:The Song of Albion is a must-read for fantasy lovers, a voyage into a land of extreme beauty and violence, a beautiful tapestry woven masterfully with color, light, blood, and magic. Its battles and hunts are thrilling, its heroes and villains compelling, its journeys engrossing. As rich as the Celtic mythology from which the song was taken, this story tells of the war for a land undreamed of by you and me, and how an ordinary man, with a courageous heart, made a destiny for himself in a land called Albion.Read it.P.S. Like or dislike, and feel free to say what you think in the comments section. Read my other reviews!"},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I happened to find this book under the \\"Free\\" kindle books and boy what a bargain! They must have put the first of this 3-part series up for free to entice readers to purchase the other two, because that's exactly what it did for me. I didn't know what to expect of this book (seeing as I got it for free) but once I started reading I couldn't put it down. The beginning is a bit slow as the characters are being developed, and the curiosities of the celtic myths had me a bit confused, but once the story took hold my eyes were glued until the very end, and I was left itching to purchase the other two.If you're looking for adventure, suspense, fantasy and even a little humor, The Paradise War is a perfect match. Great read."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Trekking through Lawhead's narrative is like a journey through the Celtic landscape he describes...sometimes tedious and cold, sometimes awe-inspiring and moving. I was hooked by the initial premise and, as the story moved into the Otherworld, I found myself increasingly pulled into the story. I breathed in the Albion air and walked with painted warriors. Unfortunately, elements of the final conflict did not live up to the potential inherent in the earlier destruction scenes; the Coranyid, gruesome in description, never exuded the oppressive fear that you'll face in Tolkien's masterpieces. Even Nudd, lord of the Nether Realms, presented a manageable foe. This aside, I enjoyed Llew's journey into the Heart of the Heart to discover the cure for all that ailed Albion. The final pages, even the final sentence, left me yearning for another trek through Lawhead's imaginative world. As the story closed, we caught a glimpse of the true hero that Lewis, the Oxford graduate student, could be. And a glimpse of a more personal foe in the sequel. Give me my hiking boots--I'm ready to go."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The Song of Albion trilogy are some of the best books I have ever read!! They deserve 10 stars! I read fiction critically, paying attention not only to the quality of plot, but also quality of writing and, most importantly, development of characters. Stephen Lawhead's books in general, and this trilogy in particular, satisfy me in every detail. The plots are original and very well researched, and the writing is excellent, with inspiring but not over-used metaphors and subtle alliteration. The characterization is excellent! I could not believe when reading some of these reviews that the reviewer had read the same books that I did. I can truly say that I have never read books in which the characters are better developed than in these. These books deserve to be compared with Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, which are my all-time favorite books!Read these books if you like, as I do: Celtic mythology; high fantasy; believable fictional characters; writing that is at once both poetic and gritty; anything written by Tolkien; well-written fantasy with Christian values...I could go on, actually--let's just say READ THESE BOOKS.For those people who thought that the Celtic mythology setting of these books was not accurate and rather forced, I beg to disagree. Having studied Celtic mythology informally quite a lot for the past couple of years, I happen to know that these books are VERY well researched. The more that I learn about Celtic mythology, the more I am impressed by the accuracy of the Song of Albion setting. You will have learned more than you know, as you will find if these books inspire you to look further into this fascinating genre of mythology! And the Otherworld setting is, to me, very believable. I could almost believe it is real. It was a mysterious experience to visit a full-sized model of Stonehenge at sunset, during the time-between-times.Another great thing about these books is that musicians Jeff Johnson and Brian Dunning have written music to go with them. I originally heard of these books through this music. I have all the &quot;Songs from Albion&quot; CDs and highly recommend them, especially if you like contemporary Celtic-style music that is original composition, with a touch of New Age, rock, and medieval styles.That is my review of the series. About this book in particular--I do not need to go over the plot since that has already been done here, and I would not want to ruin it for you anyway. This is my second favorite of the three books. It is a great start to the series. Don't be discouraged if it doesn't seem very &quot;fantasy-ish&quot; at the beginning. And don't get it without getting the second one. You will not want to wait. The best thing about this book as far as author's style is the wonderfully character development using the first person. I enjoy writing myself for pleasure (and am preparing to publish my first short story), and I know how difficult it is to develop a character's personality gradually over a book written in the first person from that person's point of view! Stephen Lawhead has done it with a master's touch.Well, I'm done raving now. READ THESE BOOKS!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"As a fan of all things Celtic, I really wanted to enjoy this book. For the most part, I did; however, what really annoyed me was the fact that I had to drag myself more than half way through the book before it finally started to get interesting. Yes, I enjoy Celtic lore, legend, and history, but the major portion of this book reads more like a graduate seminar than a novel. Moreover, the character of Lewis really got on my nerves in the beginning. For someone who was pursuing an advanced degree in Celtic studies he seemed to know very little about Celtic history. These two faults aside, once this book gets going, it really gets going. The last half of the book is non-stop and riveting. By the end, I was fully invested in the characters and the plot. The religous underpinning of the novel, like the novels of C.S. Lewis, was not over the top and moves the novel beyond just another average fantasy novel, which opens it to an audience that might not otherwise read fantasy. I look forward to the next two books in the series."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The Song of Albion series is by far and away my favorite works of Stephen Lawhead. From my first reading some ten years ago, to my tenth (or more) reading this past winter, this series of 3 books as always lifted my spirits, deepened my faith, and given me hours of reading enjoyment. I just finished reading the Skin Map (also by Stephen Lawhead) which many would say has certain commonalities with the Song of Albion, but to me the biggest difference is speed, where the Skin Map flies along at break-neck speed, in the Paradise War and subsequent books Lawhead takes his time to let his readers experience the magnificient wonders of the otherworld called Albion, with detailed descriptions of the land, the people, their customs. Lawhead takes his relunctant would be hero Lewis from a impoverished American studying Celtic Mythology at Oxford to the mighty Llew, High King of Albion. I can't say enough about this book, and I'm sure you'll enjoy reading it over and over as I have."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The Song of Albion trilogy, starting with The Paradise War, continuing in The Silver Hand, and concluding with The Endless Knot has long been one of my favorite book series. Although I already have the paperbacks, these books are some of the few for which I will pay again to get the electronic version, since I enjoy reading them over periodically.Based primarily in an alternate reality, on and around the island of Albion, and steeped in the mythology of the ancient Celts and the folklore of the British Isles, this is an epic tale of courage, destiny and ultimate triumph in the face of tremendous adversity. The plots are deep, intricate, and resound with a sense of authenticity which draws you completely into this fantastic world. I especially found the concept of kingship as depicted in these novels to be fascinating and thought provoking - the ideas that the king exists ultimately to serve his subjects and that the king is appointed and anointed to the position rather than inheriting it by bloodline.One is taken on a roller coaster ride with our protagonist as we journey with Llew from Oxford in England to a parallel universe with an alternate Briton filled with warriors and heroes and villains, vying for the high-throne of Albion. Just writing about it makes me want to start reading them again tonight. Enjoy the ride with Llew from a nondescript Oxford student to a warrior to almost a king to a maimed outcast, to a... well, you'll just have to read all three to see where it goes.A thoroughly engrossing tale, rich in the detail of another world, with an unusual conclusion that I don't think I really fully got until the 2nd or 3rd time through. These books are on my most highly recommended list of fiction, alongside the Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, Asimov's robot crime novels, and Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Honestly, I downloaded this book because it was free and because it had such good reviews, but I had few expectations. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by how entrenched I became in the story. I got the book yesterday and finished it in less than 24 hours and now I can't wait to get to the library tomorrow to check out the other two. (Yes I realize how cheep I sound but being an avid reader gets expensive). It's the kind of book that catches you off guard because all of a sudden you realize you've been thinking about it all day.The story opens with two friends, Lewis and Simon, getting swept up in an adventure, or more accurately, Simon using whatever obnoxious antics he can come up with to drag the unwilling Lewis across England and Scotland on a wild goose chase (Aurochs chase actually). The two friends are complete opposites; Simon is impetuous, pompous, wealthy, and cynical whereas Lewis is levelheaded, modest, and content to be insignificant. But... for reasons unknown, apparently opposites attract. Unsurprisingly, Lewis, our main character and unlikely hero, finds himself forced to throw caution (and reason) to the wind and brave the unknown \\"Otherworld\\" to find and save his friend. Lewis's journey leads him through a complex and exciting story that brings Celtic mythology to life.In the beginning I didn't find the book particularly readable and was often irritated by Simon's unconvincing bombastic rants and Lewis's apparent spinelessness. I found their friendship unrealistic and puzzling. I'm a character junkie and I really find it hard to get into a book when I don't like or respect the main characters, but there was some indescribable element that kept my interest intact long enough for me to suddenly realize I was speed reading on the edge of my seat even though I had told myself I'd go to bed two hours ago. Without me noticing, the story had gotten it's hooks in me. Lewis, our protagonist doesn't disappoint in the end and develops nicely into a hero that will be remembered as one of epic fantasy's strongest characters.Overall, I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the others."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Shipped promptly...just as said.

The way the story unfolds and resonates with the gospel of salvation through Jesus Christ is remarkable!"},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I stumbled upon this book at work one day, and after finishing it I bought the entire series for myself to add to my library."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I got this book for free as a limited-time offer for Kindle, so I might be a little biased. That being said, I still think it's worth either buying or renting from the library. What's unique about it is that it is largely told from the first-person perspective of Lewis, an American college student studying at Oxford University in the UK. Lewis, following after his friend Simon, enters into the world of Albion which is styled after Celtic history and mythology. Many people are opposed to the book because of its Christian themes but I would say give it try anyway. It's a refreshing and unique take on historical fantasy."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I particularly enjoyed the first 1/4 or 1/3 of this book, where the author set the stage for later events. The main characters for that section of the book (Simon and Lewis) were very well drawn; their life(style) was totally believeable and current; and the bits and pieces of Celtic mythology that were woven in were just familiar enough to be understandable and yet alien enough to keep you wondering.After Lewis entered the Other World, the tone changed, and became much more serious and showed more of an emphasis on his personal metamorphosis from scholar to warrior, and his internalizing of the Celtic ethos of honor and loyalty. There were some very intense scenes in the latter half of the book, but no gratituous violence or cruelty. The author continued to show a deft hand with his presentation and integration of Celtic mythology. I'm only minimally familiar with the Celtic legendarium, so I was left trying to mentally track down names and allusions that I was sure I had heard before and felt were an important sub-plot to the story.The one thing that I felt was somewhat jarring about this book was that Lewis, who was working on a post-graduate degree in Celtic history, with the intention of becoming a teacher, seemed so out of his depth when confronted with the objects of his studies 'in real life'. Of course, being suddenly transported to the Otherworld would do that to anyone, but even after he had settled down and accepted what had happened, he seemed no more familiar with what-was-what than Simon did, and Simon had no background in the subject. This by no means spoiled the story - it just sort of swam in the back of my mind during certain episodes and gave a slightly out-of-place feeling to the character at that point.Highly recommended! I will be looking into the 2nd and 3rd books of this series.Note on Kindle formatting: Excellent. I noticed no issues at all."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This was a really good read. That's the bottom line. I love Celtic mythology and this book was full of it. The author does a wonderful job of contrasting the Celtic lands and peoples with modern sensibilities. It starts off with a sort of cheesy premise. A couple of grad students go through a portal into a magical world. But as soon as they do that is the end of the cheese. The adventures they both have in the magical land were entertaining and very well written."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I picked up the Kindle version of this book when Amazon made it free for a limited time, and I'm so glad they did (it worked out for Amazon too, because I purchased the other two books as soon as I finished this one). I had kind of fallen out of reading for pleasure and just bought the Kindle. This was my second book I read on it and I loved it so much that I've been reading like crazy ever since. Lawhead totally pulls you into the world he creates. The characters, environment, battles, and problems are all well developed and you end up totally engrossed.

Five Stars, a must read."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The first chapters of this book were great. Lewis is an American student studying at Oxford University and rooming with bored, rich friend Simon. One morning, Simon whips him off to Inverness on an apparent whim to investigate the appearance of an aurox, reported in a dubious gossip-filled newspaper. Their trip up is filled with tight, engaging dialogue on the current state of the world. They encounter a Scottish farmer who is quietly enjoying the notoriety of having a 'beastie' in the back paddock - which has since been taken away to Edinburgh for further examination. They find their way back to an ancient cairn at which point Simon disappears. Unfortunately, so does the story!Lewis returns to Oxford and mopes around for several weeks. He meets up with the eccentric Professor Nettles, who spends a whole chapter giving a rather doubtful metaphysical explanation of the 'other world' and its importance to our world. Nettles then takes Lewis back to Inverness, only to discover that a group of evil metaphysical archaeologists are digging around the cairn (for what exactly is not clear). A diversion is set and Lewis makes his way into the cairn and through to the otherworld.There follows several chapters of travelogue. The otherworld turns out to be a perfect replica of the Victoriana view of British Celtic society, complete with kings, chiefs and warriors running around killing each other. But somehow everything is at the same time wonderful to behold. The chapters describe in detail the landscape and the structure of the society, while the pace of the story languishes. We are expected to believe that the otherworld is a template on which British Celtic society was built (never mind that they were made up of various invading neolithic tribes from Europe). Lewis' character reaches his absolute nadir, expecting his friend Simon to 'do something' and to take responsibility, when Simon is clearly well settled into the local society and the least responsible person around. Meanwhile, Lewis just goes along as helpless victim rather than trying to work out any original action of his own that might actually change the situation.At this point I realised that this was the first of three books in a trilogy and decided I had much better things to spend my time doing than reading bad imaginary travelogues written from a victim point of view.Great start - shame about the rest."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Originally published in the early nineties, Stephen R. Lawhead's bestselling Song of Albion Trilogy has now been released in a gorgeous hardcover edition that immediately catches one's eye. The first in the series is The Paradise War, followed by The Silver Hand and The Endless Knot. Lawhead pulls from Celtic myths and legends and ancient texts to create story set in modern day of a most unique world.Lewis Gillies is an American graduate student studying at the eminent Oxford University, specifically on the subject of Celtic lore and ancient sources; but he's bored with life and everything and feels he's getting absolutely nowhere fast. Then there is Simon, his friend who is very well off and of noble standing. Simon is interested in the mysterious and unexplained, and when there are sightings of the legendary Greenman, and the purported capturing of an extinct creature in a glen in Scotland, Simon drags Lewis along for the ride. The two end up exploring an ancient cairn, where Simon promptly disappears within it. At first Gillies thinks he's having the ultimate prank played on him; but when days pass and Simon doesn't show up he begins to worry; and then he meets a man with all the answers. They travel back to the cairn to discover it is a special gateway between this world and another; the time-between-times, as the Celts called it.

Dont buy this novel if you are looking for your next great fantasy read"},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"After reading this book and the reviews here, I am forced to write a critical review myself.Perhaps I am alone in seeing through this tale, but I find it a thinly veiled white supremist manifesto, nothing more. Here's why:Picture the author's vision of Paradise, which is called Otherworld, or Albion by its inhabitants. In this world, a proto-Celtic people, the Lwyddi--white, of course--is the repository for all that is noble, beautiful, courageous, and just. Yes, there is betrayal at times, and violence, even murder, but these evils are trivial compared to the disgusting, putrid, \\"colored\\" (red, yellow, brown, and black; read Afro, Jew, Catholic, Oriental, Arab, etc.) race of demons who rise up to destroy all that is good in the name of their Dark Lord Nudd (dressed in black, of course), who, being the Devil himself, is not spoken of in polite society.These demons obviously represent all the inferior races of the earth who corrupt the natural order just by living. Their very smell makes brave men puke. In addition to being disgusting in physical appearance, they are mostly brainless, have no individual personalities, and are unskilled in the manly arts of war, in short subhuman. Easy to kill? sure!--Except their corpses are then deposited in a stinking cauldron of boiling muck from which they arise, alive and fully functional.In other words, there is no end to their numbers, no final solution to the demon problem, and so no hope for the glorious master race. O my gosh! Are the Lwyddi to vanish, the glorious race exterminated, and Albion to fall into eternal darkness?Not a chance! The Song of Albion, which when loosed in the world melts the demons instantly, saves the day. This song is really little more than a paeon to racial superiority, as it restores Albion to its natural state of perfection--all White.I find the whole thing fairly transparent and disgustingly phony. No more for me, thanks."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Wonderfully written Celtic fantasy"},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I am re-reading this series, after having bought it years ago. Lawhead is one of my favorite authors, and books like these confirm why. His attention to detail is amazing. Usually I skip over background to get straight to the action in books, but I found myself relishing every word in much of this series. My only complaint is that in the first hardcover printing, I believe the artwork on the covers to be out of order.

Must read"},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"With a lot of time on my hands these days and having this book and its follow-ups to hand, I thought why not give it a bash. In truth, the series is very readable, and you can picture both characters and environment reasonably well, and trundle through the chapters at a pace which pleases. The only problem I have is that it's just not very gritty. The language is all just a touch too antiseptic, and lacks believability. Having just been transported to another world, and a violent one at that, full of marauding semi-naked Celtic huntsmen, the contrast between new and old, (which consisted of nothing more exciting than wondering when exam results would arrive), would surely raise a few expletives from even the most sweet tongued well groomed young man?That aside, and assuming that you like your fiction in this vein, you'll enjoy this offering. I guess its a bit like a bath... some people want to be invigorated by one, and others want to just lay and soak. Buy the trilogy and you can soak way 'till even your wrinkles have wrinkles."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I wanted to like this book but it seemed to shuffle on and not land anywhere.

Sections of each book in this trilogy are excellent and quite enjoyable. However, there are longer portions that are awkward and tedious. The writer also commits a number of literary sins that drag the whole down. In the first book, there is the character of the professor. He is quite flat and is what is known as &quot;the author's mouthpiece&quot;--a set-piece device used to conveniently convey information that the author has trouble working in otherwise. The professor has at least a couple long monologues that reek of the above device.Although there are worthwhile sections, I recommend you avoid this title and pick up something better."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I just finished the last book and have lots of thoughts about it. This review covers the trilogy in general:1. I loved the beginning of Book 1, which had a humorous tone and was set in modern day Oxford. It reminded me of Brideshead Revisited in some ways, and was so laugh-out-loud funny that I wish the author would set a fantasy novel solely in modern day Oxford.2. Because I loved the setup so much, I was taken aback by some of the character development later on. (I won't give away any plot but you probably know which character I'm talking about if you read it.) I just didn't believe some of the changes based on the beginning, even after reading the entire trilogy and the author's explanation. I do think some of his characters were too \\"black\\" or \\"white\\" and had too many motivations based on plot convenience, but that's okay. I also think he does better character development in his new Robin Hood trilogy - more complex.3. The author does a great job of world building, with lots of description and a real sense of being there and experiencing the Celtic world. Sometimes, I could do with a little less description and more plot/dialogue, but that's just me.4. I think his female characters can be a little boring - amazingly beautiful, wise, graceful, and good, they're sometimes interchangeable. I wish he'd mix things up a little and make them more flawed/human.5. As a Christian reader, I got a lot out of all three books spiritually and really liked some of his analogies to the Christian life.6. I was satisfied with the plot in general. Some things I guessed at the end. Others, I had no clue. It was a fairly wild ride and I had a lot of fun reading it.When it was all over, I spent a lot of time thinking about it and had trouble getting it out of my head. For me, overall, it was a 5-star read. Very enjoyable and definitely recommended."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book is amazing. Not only does it have a fascinating plot, it also goes into some detail of the Celtic life style, and digs deep into the mythology of the Celtic religion and persona. It starts off a little dull, but toward the middle, the book picks up its pace, and delivers to you an experience that you wouldn't want to miss. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes Celtic things or a fast pace fantasy/adventure novel.Lawhead is an amazing author. His imagery and word choice is spot on, and his plot is very interesting. That's what makes this book such a great one, one that can hold a candle up to even the likes of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Okay, this book starts off my absolute, all-time favorite trilogies by Stephen R. Lawhead - who is one of my favorite authors because of how stinking awesome the trilogy is. The trilogy is called the Song of Albion. And it is a must read for any and all fantasy readers, especially if you love Celtic fantasy, of which Lawhead is a supreme master.Anyways, Paradise War starts off a little slow, at least in comparison to all that happens over the span of the trilogy. But I would suggest some patience and for you to just enjoy how Lawhead sets up and transitions into the primary story, because he really is setting the stage and establishing characters which you will see grow, mature, and change throughout the entire trilogy.I would also warn anyone who's got a squeamish stomach about Lawhead's books in general - he doesn't flinch at violence or describing the results thereof. It's not that he's overly gory or anything, but if a character has a wound inflicted on them and they have to deal with it, he describes it in, well, almost explicit detail.I love Lawhead, also, because he's stylistic in his writing and very character driven. You see the main character go through a very drastic transition.Overall, though I love Paradise War, it really only gets the story rolling and introduces you to a cast of characters which you will come to love. The Song of Albion is an amazing trilogy, and I highly recommend it to all fantasy lovers. I would suggest to parents that this book (and trilogy) are more for senior high students due to mature content."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Simon & his friend Lewis take off on an expedition to find an aurochs because Simon read about it in a tabloid. Simon goes into a cairn and disappears. Lewis waits for him to come back and then goes in search of information. He finds Professor Nettles, an odd duck, but thoroughly loveable. Nettles gives him the background that he needs, and then they go back to the cairn. This time Lewis goes in.He finds himself in Albion, and must find his way through life. Simon is there at the outset, but there is always something untrustworthy about Simon. The ramifications of having two present-day \\"strangers\\" in Albion are set up to be disasterous.This is a wonderful book. You can tell that Mr. Lawhead researched the topic extensively and brings his active imagination to life with this book. The descriptions are wonderful, and the characters about leap from the page. There is a little bit of everything in this book to suit different readers--intrigue, romance, fantasy, history--truly a wellrounded book.I can't wait to read book 2."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I must admit that I have found the books I've read by Mr. Lawhead to have some interesting premises and an occasional noteworthy character, though on the whole his work has seemed overwritten, loosely structured, and sometimes requiring real labor to get through. This is not to say that I don't like long books. I do, but I think they should be long for a good reason, and I haven't been able to ascertain if this length and structure problem I felt in Lawhead's work was because his editors required him to keep his books long for economic purposes. At any rate, in contrast to his other books, I find that &quot;The Paradise War&quot; remains on track with a nice balance of mystery and revelation most of the time. Though one of the character's motives seems unbelievable in at least one place, I found on first reading that the story unfolded convincingly and with some surprises. And while the language in the author's other books can tend toward static representations of character's thoughts, the tension is foregrounded in &quot;The Paradise War.&quot; Finally, the author's research into Celtic backgrounds is worked convincingly into the story."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"What a great trilogy! The Song of Albion ranks up there with \\"Eldest\\", \\"Eragon\\", and \\"the Lord of the Rings\\". I started the trilogy and finished all three books in less than a week. For anyone who enjoys great fantasy writing, this trilogy is for you. Mr. Lawhead has done his homework on Celtic traditions, imagery, beliefs...everything was \\"spot on\\". Spend the money and buy the books, curl up in front of the fire, and enjoy Mr. Lawhead's unique brand of Celtic Fantasy writing."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The Paradise War is a tough book to tackle, admittedly. Any book that comprises 464 pages is, but this one in particular was slow, despite being very interesting and intriguing. Though I haven't slogged through many of Lawhead's books, it seems that each of his series is quite unique from the rest. The first two novels in the Bright Empires series exhibited very good description (showing and not telling) but the characters were nowhere near as rich (and the writing style as a whole so captivating) as in this first volume of the Song of Albion.While many fantasy books go the way this seems to be going (telling the story of the fall and redemption), this is a fresh relief in the genre. Everything is steeped in Celtic myth and lore, becoming vivid reality in the reader's mind. While still telling the story, it is not predictable, and the reader doesn't worry that Lawhead will take them somewhere they've been before. No, this is new territory, and he lets us blaze the trail with him.The characters are wonderfully immature at first, showing us how much we are like them, and that we need to change. Then, Lawhead shows us the process of their maturing, either in good or in evil, as some characters choose. Some interesting persons show up near the beginning of the story, then disappear, when they could be great sub-characters during the war itself. However, they may appear in the next volumes, and that would be good to see.In conclusion, while the writing is superb, the Celtic research is apparent, and the characters are quite helpful, the story slows down often, and that tires the reader out. It took me over two months from start to finish.*This book was provided free by the publisher. I was not required to write a positive review, and the opinions expressed are my own.*"},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The best complimentI could pay this book is that I want to read the sequel.

Nettles claiming the ancient celts took ideas and stories from Albion make it seem more plausable somehow, though, the fact that the celtic gods arent mentioned and everyone refers to Dagda, definitely shows the christian side of the writer.Everything about Albion makes me want to go to Scotland and try to get there myself.i also love the feel of the hardcover of this book. and the art on the cover just draws you in. the book itself just feels safe. i just nest in my bed curl up with it. i think i could read this series a dozen times and never tire with it. i recommend it to everyone i meet. right now, it is my all time favorite."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this series.

However, once the the character enters this new world full of Celtic folklore and adventure, everything really starts to take off an shine. I honestly do not know why the author thought it was even necessary to do this, but perhaps was grasping at creating a radical shift in both the character Lewis and the world he is leaving to make a stark contrast. Unfortunately, the writing and characters' conversations were grating to the point that I almost stopped reading it. I hope that other readers do not give up until they have really gotten into the otherworld narrative. Once that happens it is really a great book and I look forward to reading the next installments."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I enjoyed the story, character development, and overall themes of this book.

I am reading this series for the second time and it is so engrossing. You get lost in these books. If you love to read and get lost in the pages of a book, this series is for you. Lawhead treats the Celtic myths with dignity and imagination. He knows his stuff but doesn't over mystify it or weigh it down with religious sentiment. I have read countless books with the Celtic myths as their background and most do just that.Great reading.... only problem is the adventure of these books is over too fast. Guess I will have to read them again!!"},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I've been an avid fan of Stephen Lawhead's work for some years now, and I truly believe that the Song of Albion triology is his best work to date. Our world is but a shadow compared to the world Lawhead creates when Lewis and Simon cross over into the Otherworld. It's incredibly vivid and the plot is so engaging and well thought out that you can't help but be drawn into it. Celtic mythology is also something so different from any other culture in the world, and Stephen Lawhead the master of the Celtic/Fantasy genre. I can't speak highly enough of these books, and for me they sit equal with 'Magician' and just below 'The Lord of The Rings' as all time fantasy classics."},{"Title":"The Paradise War (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I bought these books from a used bookstore a few years back.The first one (where this review is being posted) I found kinda tedious, hence the four.After the trip to Scotland and before you cross over into the other world, the only really interesting thing to me was the wolf in the street and the restaurant. ;)But once you cross over, watch out! The series will just SUCK you up.There are times it is slow though. Describing oranges with too many words, if you take my meaning.Other than that, it's a great book, but the other two in the series are the best. And fortunately for this series, if you read them out of order, it won't hurt you, you'll just have less of an understanding.Lawhead explains most of everything, so they're good stories on their own :)"},{"Title":"King Kong Cometh!","review":"Much of the material is familiar to me as I recall reading a book about King Kong back in the 90's that was a lot like this one. I do not recall the other book's title but I feel certain this book deliberately draws heavily from it.

Gone are the exercises dealing with the actor's personal emotional trauma--no more teacher as therapist. Meisner's approach is in the &quot;now&quot; and works in the fertile field of the actor's imagination. With practice it works every time. Larry Silverberg has crafted a treasure."},{"Title":"The Sanford Meisner Approach Workbook II : Emotional Freedom","review":"In my opinion, Lee Strasberg's indefatigable attachment to \\"Emotional\\" or \\"Affective Memory\\", a technique that Stanisklavski later disregarded as unusable, has done more to harm the training of an actor than it did good. This misconception was the basis for \\"The Method\\". Both Sandy Meisner and Stella Adler knew that Strasberg got it wrong. This was partly the reason for the rift in The Group Theatre. Sandy knew from his experience as an actor, that using memory to re-create emotion on stage would disconnect the actor from his environment, and done night after night, would lead the poor fellow to madness or a nervous breakdown. Dustin Hoffmann's performance in \\"Death of a Salesman\\" on Broadway are living proof. While \\"The Method\\" might sometimes work for the camera, it doesn't work for the rigor demanded of the stage. Meisner's approach relies on and nurtures the actor's imagination to put him or herself into the appropriate emotional state for the imaginary circumstances of the drama. Silverberg's book is practical and essential. It is a workbook, not a textbook. It contains practical exercises, frank anecdotes and the underlying theory behind the exercises. Great work, Larry. I am certain that Sandy would be very proud of his star pupil."},{"Title":"The Sanford Meisner Approach Workbook II : Emotional Freedom","review":"I have a MFA in acting from the University of Central Florida, and I teach acting at Christian Brothers University in Memphis Tennessee. I studied with Larry Silverberg for two summers. He is as remarkable a teacher as he is a writer. Even though one might think it is extremely difficult to explain the Meisner technique in a book, Larry has accomplished that. Like many, I believe you need to study acting in a class to learn the craft, but these series of books are a rare exception. Not only do they teach the technique using a step by step process which allows the actor to really understand what s/he is doing, but they reveal the essence of the Meisner approach which is to specify a role until it has ULTIMATE MEANING for YOU!Also, if you didn't know by now from reading the other reviews, \\"Meisner gave Larry and Smith & Kraus written permission to publish these books."},{"Title":"The Sanford Meisner Approach Workbook II : Emotional Freedom","review":"I encountered these books several years ago as I am a college professor and am constantly seeking out fresh ideas and approaches to acting. I had studied with a few people trained in the Mesiner technique, but always felt I was missing something. When I read the first book of the series I realized I had found something I had been seeking: a step by step approach to the Mesiner technique. Each chapter builds upon the last and I, as a student, felt that reading the books gave me practical tools I could bring to the craft of acting. As I am a union actor working primarily in Shakespeare I was surprised to find the Meisner techniques found in these books informed my performing in very interesting and valuable ways. Yes, Meisner preparation and moment to moment work made me a better Shakespearean actor. I also appreciated how much these books helped me tailor my introduction of Meisner technique in the University classroom. I enjoyed working from the books so much that I decided to study directly with the author. I contacted Larry and was thrilled to find he taught several levels of Meisner work. I have been teaching acting for 30 years and can say that Larry Silverberg is the teacher I have been looking for. His generosity in the classroom. his commitment to student growth, his laser beam attention to the work, his warmth, and his sweet sense of humor combine to create a learning environment that is as unique as it is valuable. These qualities are present in his books. Read them and listen to Larry's \\"voice\\"- he is as excited as you are to plunge into the work. This quality is alive in those books and it is evident when you work with Larry. Frankly these books are of great value to me. Now that Meisner is passed I feel that we are so lucky to have Larry Silverberg's codification of the Meisner techniques. Read them and know that they are written by someone who is grounded in sincerity and dedication to our craft. There is an informal tone to the writing throughout sections of the books- treasure those sections because they represent Larry as he is during a break, talking and exploring with his students. The books are written in the spirit of a tribal elder- Larry speaks to the reader as if he knows you because, in a way, he DOES- since actors are similar in their deep desire to get better and better at stimulating an audience with a vital performance of an author's character. He is the opposite of slick and his books read that way. He is warm, nurturing, and deeply understanding. I celebrate the day I found these books and recommend them to you with great enthusiasm."},{"Title":"The Sanford Meisner Approach Workbook II : Emotional Freedom","review":"I was lucky enough to spend a year with two of Larry Silverberg's students who now have a studio of their own. Over four sessions of 11 weeks each, we followed Larry's interpretations of Sanford Meisner's teaching in a very caring and trusting environment. I can't say enough good things about this experience. It really changed my life as an actor and as a person. I see that a reviewer here has said that you can't learn acting from a book. Well of course you can't, but that doesn't mean that great books can't be an immense help. How many have poured over Stanislavky's books and found inspiration there? And these books are wonderful. They lay out paths to follow without anxiety or fear, in a straightforward, simple and productive manner. I mentioned the atmosphere of trust in my classes; I'm sure that began with Larry. Find a teacher who knows this work, get hold of the books, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Sanford Meisner Approach Workbook II : Emotional Freedom","review":"As both a professional actor and an acting instructor I cannot recommend Larry's \\"The Sanford Meisner Approach Workbook\\" series highly enough. Having studied and applied the Meisner technique as an actor for 14 years and having taught it now for 4 I find Larry's series to be the most straightforward and accessible breakdown of Sandy's technique. I teach acting in the BFA program at Central Washington University in Ellensburg WA and we currently offer a total of 50 weeks of Meisner training over a two year period. Larry's \\"Workbook One\\" is one of the required texts in the first year and the remaining three books in the series are required in the second year. I, and my students, have found that their experience is enhanced by reading the chapters, or sessions, in the book that correspond to the work we are doing in class. I have seen their connection to their others, their art, their community and themselves strengthen and deepen as we work on this technique and the exercises together. As an actor and/or an acting teacher you cannot go wrong with The Meisner Technique and you cannot go wrong with Larry Silverberg's \\"The Sanford Meisner Approach\\" series. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Sanford Meisner Approach Workbook II : Emotional Freedom","review":"I have personally worked with Larry Silverberg, and before that used his books both to learn and teach the Meisner Technique.

These books are clear, succinct, and incredibly easy to work with, and they include many examples for clarification. Larry is the most nurturing acting teacher, and I cannot recommend him highly enough."},{"Title":"The Sanford Meisner Approach Workbook II : Emotional Freedom","review":"Silverberg's Meisner workbook series is a jewel for acting teachers and students alike! Filled with a step-by-step approach and essential exercises that allow actors to genuinely understand what it means to \\"live truthfully under imaginary circumstances\\" onstage, Silverberg's books are direct and practical, yet also astoundingly inspirational. As a university acting professor, the artistic growth that I have witnessed in my students as a result of this material is phenomenal. Do yourself a favor and read this series. I cannot recommend this work highly enough!"},{"Title":"The Sanford Meisner Approach Workbook II : Emotional Freedom","review":"I have been a professional actor for 30 years. About fifteen years ago I was verylucky. I picked up Larry Siverberg's first book on the Sanford Meisner approach. It changed my life as an actor, and as a teacher. I know of no finer book on acting, and I have read a lot of them. It is the clearest, the most step by step, and the most inspirational book on true acting that has ever been written. This also holds for the other three books in his series. Did reading his book make me a better actor over night? Of course not. And Larry Silverberg never said that it would. Let me repeat that - he never said that it would! So what did it do? It opened a path that I could begin to follow - a long and very difficult path, but a wonderous and life changing journey. It showed me where my training was lacking, and what real actor training could be. It inspired me and gave me a map to use to begin exploring with fellow actors the craft of acting. And it lead me to seek out new teachers. I am a better actor because of this book.I have used Larry Silverber's books in many university acting and directing classes.

Don't bother reading the mistake riddled text."},{"Title":"A Coming of Age.","review":"I'm going to have to go with a five-star rating here despite the fact that it's a four-star kind of book; light reading that's not going to change your life. But the thing that's so special about this book is that I'd uphold it (particularly the first chapter) as a how-to for sci-fi authors: it's a great example of how to create a unique world without having to stop and (directly) explain things to the reader. I don't think Zahn ever states outright that &quot;teekay&quot; stands for telekinesis (TK), he just uses the phrase in context enough so the reader can figure it out within a few pages. The same approach is emplyed throughout the book - we eventually learn what we need to know in order to understand the story about the setup and history of Tigris, but it's blended seamlessly into the narrative and never feels like an interruption.The narrative itself is interesting, if not brilliant. Per usual with this author, we get very competent prose and intelligent, likable protagonists. There are a few flaws here: the villain is pretty bland, the storyline is only barely strong enough to last 300 pages, and there're a few plot contrivances here and there. Plus for the first half of the book one basically has to take the author's word that the different story arcs have anything to do with each other. But since I've spent two whole sentances on flaws, I'll also have to mention that Zahn does a good job with most of his characters; I particularly liked the kids, Lisa and Tonio. And the central concept is a nice twist on the old &quot;magical power that comes at a certain age&quot; clich&eacute;.I'm not an expert on Timothy Zahn - until about a year ago I only knew his Star Wars stuff - but I'd highly recommend A Coming Of Age along with any other Zahn you can find, since everything I've read so far from this guy has been top-notch."},{"Title":"A Coming of Age.","review":"With the exception of books by C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkein, I hadn't read fiction of any kind--let alone science fiction--for several decades until I got hooked by Tim Zahn. This book takes an utterly imaginative premise--that, because of some mysterious occurrence in the past, humans are able to use telekinesis UNTIL puberty--and does wonderful things with it. How to control a society when the kids are immeasurably more powerful than adults? The characters are very real and likeable, both kids and adults (at least the good-guy adults). Both kids and adults end up having to deal with strong internal conflicts. There are cops and robbers, as it were. There are both up-tight and laid-back authority figures. And there's even a twinge of romance. In the end, the question is whether a preteen can save the world. I thoroughly enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"A Coming of Age.","review":"As I have mentioned previously, Timothy Zahn is my absolute favorite author. I first read his works withHeir to the Empireand have continued to enjoy his non-Star Wars books. As a mini-goal, I have decided to read all of his works. This was another of his older works that I picked up in a used bookstore.Plot:The planet Tigris is strange not necessarily for its flora, fauna, or alien life. Something about the planet has bestowed a \\"gift\\" upon anyone between the ages of 5 and puberty--telekinesis. This \\"gift\\", however, quickly turned into a curse during the Lost Generation, in which much technology was lost. Since then, society has changed to reign in the children who have this ability to \\"teek\\" anything they see or touch.Lisa Duncan is a preteen (actually 14, but she hasn't yet reached puberty) who is not looking forward to losing her gifts in Transition. So, she decides to get ahead on some schooling and learn how to read. However, this proves to be a serious error and leads her into much trouble.Meanwhile, a scientist, Dr. Matthew Jarvis, kidnaps a 5-year old orphan boy and starts some break-through experiments on him that could uproot the entire Tigrin society. Stanley Tirrell and his righthand, Tonio, a preteen, rush out to find the lost boy and to keep Dr. Jarvis' discovery from falling into the wrong hands.Good:Wow! I was not exactly looking forward to reading this book just because the concept didn't sound that interesting. But as I started reading, the story drew me further and further in. I felt Lisa's pain at seeing her childhood come to a close. I understood her actions to try to \\"get ahead\\" of the crowd. I also cheered on Tirrell and Tonio as they slowly picked their way through the rubble of the mystery.Besides pretty interesting characters (namely Lisa Duncan and Tirrell in a smaller sense), the story is awesome. Timothy Zahn creates this world without spending pages upon pages of boring history lessons. He retells it only as necessary and convinces me as the reader that the characters know their history and don't feel like they have to regurgitate it for the audience to understand what is going on.There is enough action towards the end to grip the audience. You are never quite sure who will win in the end.Bad:Very minimal. The language was quite intense, which was quite unlike Zahn. Also, the villain, Omega, was rather dry, certainly nothing like his villain, Thrawn.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:A lot of da**, he**, and sh**. Mention is made of a sexual relationship between two teens and the kidnapped child is illegitimate. The Lost Generation wrought havoc on society 200 years previously. Omega is not afraid to use children and their teekay power to harm others.Overall:Impressive! Most impressive! For a book that I thought would be dull, this kept me very entertained. Give it to Timothy Zahn to pull off another good book!Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"A Coming of Age.","review":"A Coming of Age is a strange story by Timothy Zahn, an author famous for his science fiction. In this tale, he creates an upside down society where adults live in fear of children. He then mixes in a detective story, a coming of age story for a school kid, a kidnapping, a science experimentation plot, and a child labor scam artist. It's an interesting combination for a young adult story.First off, let's tackle the setting. Sometime in the past, a generation ship arrived and colonized the planet. The inhabitants ran into a strange side effect while on the planet: the kids gain super powers at the age of five. Specifically, the children gain the power of telekinesis, or teekay, which allows them to fly and to move any objects they can see or touch. They're so powerful that adults are helpless to stop them. This situation creates an environment where adults live in fear of children.There is a counterbalance to the super powers, however. When the kids reach puberty, they go through the Transition and lose their powers, their teekay. Thus everyone turns normal as they grow up. In order to keep the preteens inline, society created a system where the kids are placed in daycares called hives. They are raised to respect authority and are forbidden any education involving reading or writing. Older preteens are used to enforce the rules on the younger kids. Thus society lives on with a degree of stability.The core of the story is centered on a preteen named Lisa. She's an overachiever worried about puberty and the Transition. She desperately wants an advantage that will lessen the stress of all the changes. Alongside her story thread is detective Tirrell and his righthand Tonio. They start off tracking down a smuggling racket and quickly get side tracked into a kidnapping case. Then there's a scientist and his young test subject who are trying to break the rules of this planet and its weird mutational side effects. All of these plots merge together into a fairly fun and interesting story.The content and focus of the book is a perfect fit for the young adult market. If you are looking for good, clean, safe fiction, then this fits the bill. It's also very different and very unique, which works well in keeping the reader engaged. All in all it's an appealing story and I give it a three out of five."},{"Title":"A Coming of Age.","review":"A large percentage of the book is from the Lisa's point of view, a young girl on the brink of puberty, but this is not a young adult book. It has none of the typical angst you often see in today's teen characters. There is no romance. A Coming of Age is more like a SciFi Crime Drama, a mystery set on another planet with twists and turns so complex I was always on the edge of my seat.One thing I found refreshing was the lack of over-explanation. Zahn left it up to his readers to interpret subtle clues about the plot and alien terminology from the context. I felt like a grown-up, reading a book that gave me a chance to flex my brain.I don't say this often, but this book would make an exceptional film!"},{"Title":"A Coming of Age.","review":"This was my first encounter with Timothy Zahn. Since A Coming of Age does not have high rating on Goodreads (only 3.6) and it was written in 1984 I started reading this book with caution.There are so many older novels that simply got run over by new styles or trends. But do not be afraid, I can assure you that this is not the case with A Coming of Age. Timothy Zahn writes with a straight-forward matter-o-fact style that never gets old. His world building is so subtle than you don't even notice when and where he explained all that unknown customs and terms.I can become overwhelmed if authors piles up all the data at the beginning of book or if he keeps bombarding me with unknown (invented) words. Sometimes, I can even give up reading the book altogether because of that. So this is a BIG plus for me.When the Humans colonized planet Tigris, they never imagined that it would lead to genetic mutations that will trigger telekinetic powers in kids at the age of five. Or that those same powers will inexplicably disappear when children reach puberty.When someone first mentions telekinesis my first association is moving and throwing objects around. But Timothy Zahn gives us a delightful new aspect to this ability - flying. Anybody else thinking about 'Peter Pan'? :)Unfortunately (as we all know) children are usually the ultimate hedonists. The do not plan or think about the future - they only want to satisfy their current needs. So what will happen if that type of humans had the most power in society? And what would be solution to that?In A Coming of Age, Timothy Zahn does not gives us a pretty picture of society. This is a great book for a book club to discuss possible alternatives and flaws in the structure Tigris' society is organised.We are introduced to the world of planet Tigris through eyes of a couple of characters: Lisa Duncan (coming of age teen who is going to lose her telekinetic powers soon), Stanford Tirrell (quirky detective working on a child-kidnaping case), Dr. Matthew Jarvis (brilliant scientists) and Prophet Omega (shady leader of mysterious new cult).Altough character building of others is not neglected, most attention is devoted to Lisa Duncan. When you read about her thoughts and fears, you read about the usual problems that coming of age teens meet: dealing with changes in your body and how the society and your friends will accept them.You gotta like Lisa - she is smart, innovative, ambitious, inquisitive... And she is not afraid to break the rules. ;)In the end, of course, all the plot lines untangle and all the characters clash together in an ultimate showdown. Yes, there is big aerial battle. ;)This book has something for everybody. A little bit of mystery, coming of age teen problems, dystopian fiction about oppressive government and enough action and adventure to keep you interested until the end.I recommend this book to fans of: classic science fiction, quirky detectives, coming of age stories or speculative fiction about colonization of other planets.Disclaimer: I was given a free ebook by the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for a honest review.

If wealth creation is the topic that a reader is pursuing I would strongly recommend Peter Drucker (Innovation and Entrepreneurship), which will give the reader a clear insight into why Americans have expanded their wealth, without the rhetoric.

In this book, Edwards does a very good job demonstrating that what is fashionable may not always be true and biblical. The book you can say is divided into two main sections. In the first part (chaps. 1-6) Edwards talks about the legitimacy of the orthodox Christian view of Jesus Christ. He delves into the Jesus Quests, the Jesus Seminar, the historic reliability of the New Testament documents, Jesus' self-identification, etc. In all these dicussions, Edwards does a good job exposing the various flaws of liberal and anti-Christian perspectives on these matters (demonstrating how the Enlightenment's heightening of the individual and a naturalistic view of the universe has severely skewed how one reads the biblical narrative). In fact, students who are interested in the methodology of finding out who Jesus really is from an evangelical and conservative perspective will enjoy reading the first six chapters. All in all, Edwards pretty much smashes the presuppositions and arguments of the liberal school that aims to deconstruct the historical Jesus Christ (the God-man) and orthodox Christianity through a worldview that is foreign to the biblical period.The second part (chaps. 7-12) deals more intensely with soteriological pluralism. Edwards does an excellent job smashing down the often ridiculous accusations laid against a particularistic understanding of the gospel. For instance, he does a good job showing how orthodox Christianity does not undermine world peace but aims at reconciliation with the whole world because of the nature of the gospel (cf. Matthew 5:9). He also provides a good treatment regarding the relationship between the gospel and postmodernism (chap. 9). He does a good job exposing the flaws of a postmodern worldview (i.e., that there are no such things as universal truths and that every opinion has legitimacy--which is a joke to any rational mind). Edwards' commitment to the particularity of Jesus Christ comes out strong in chapter 11 (\\"How Should Christians Think about Other Religions?\\"). He gives ample Scriptural evidence that the Bible supports only one way to heaven--through Jesus Christ. In fact, Edwards is even bold enough to proclaim that Judaism has no saving efficacy apart from Jesus Christ and that we cannot automatically assume that some people who have never heard the gospel will be saved. In a final note, Edwards convincingly argues that the particularity of the gospel leads to its own universality. If God did not come down in a particular place and time then there would have been no possibility of redemption for the whole world.Overall, this is an excellent book. The one thing that is refreshing to know is that this book was written by a New Testament biblical scholar rather than a Christian theologian or philosopher. Hence, you will notice throughout the book that Edwards quotes Scripture to back up his arguments. Though many modern scholars are willing to rebel against Scripture because they feel that this leads to hostility and dogmatism Edwards does not fall into this futile path. Modern Christians should realize that ONLY in Jesus Christ are people saved from eternal perdition and that Christianity does not have to cater to certain disenfranchised groups because they complain that orthodox Christianity is too exclusivistic (which is quite the oppposite, read Galatians 3:28), morally-upright (which is no surprise, since some people in this world still want to live a sinful lifestyle), and sexist (which, if understood properly, is not)."},{"Title":"Is Jesus the Only Savior?","review":"James Edwards asks the question in the book's title (Is Jesus the ONLY Savior?) and the answer is Yes.But it is not the Yes of a demagogue, a hermit, or anAmerican evangelist. Is is the Yes of a student, a scholar, an intellectual, and a world citizen.It is a measured Yes, a thoughtful Yes, a reasoned Yes.The book answers the objections to the uniqueness, the non-equivalance, of Jesus to other religious thought leaders.It is written for anyone curious about Jesus, and that covers all kinds of belief and non belief. If you want a clear exposition of why some find him unique and not merely one of many, this book makes it clear.If you are already convinced, it may help you present your convictions with kindness and generosity.It was bracing and satisfying to read, the best spiritual read of the year. I'm sending copies to thoughtful people I love."},{"Title":"Is Jesus the Only Savior?","review":"James Edwards has written a timely and necessary book that deserves a great deal of attention from a broad Christian community. At issue is the drift in our culture toward a type of multiculturalism which causes Christian and non-Christian alike to question whether Christ can or should be spoken of as the \\"only\\" savior.Edwards looks, in the early chapters, on the various forms of the \\"quest for the historical Jesus\\" up to and including the historically recent conclusions of the \\"Jesus Seminar\\". As is common in many fields, some theological excursions into the quest for the Jesus of history were fully indebted to naturalism, the view that all things can and should be explained in purely natural terms. Edwards calmly and clearly asks whether such assumptions are warranted and finds the resulting conclusions wanting.He takes the question further showing that there is a great deal of reason to trust the historical reliability of the New Testament with easy to read, cogent arguments and a judicious choice of compelling evidence. Having established the reasonableness of trusting the New Testament, he tackles the central issue - did Jesus believe himself to be God.What is unique about the book is that it is not a mere apologetic for the historicity of the Christian faith. Edwards, having established the reasonable foundation, moves from the key questions of the 20th century in the first half of the book to the key questions of the 21st century in the second half. Postmodern theories and multicultural sentiments lead many to believe that the exclusive claims of Christianity are unwarranted, arrogant, and perhaps even a threat to world peace. Without disparaging anyone in the process, Edwards carefully deals with questions about postmodernism and exclusive truth claims, relativism and its relation to human sin, the clash of cultures and its relation to the tendency of many Christians today to embrace universalism rather than the historic view of the uniqueness of Christ.This book hits all the critical issues at an important time. It is sholarly enough to have credibility, but readable enough for lay study. It would be a great gift for college bound kids at graduation. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Is Jesus the Only Savior?","review":"These are difficult days to be a biblical Christian. In affirming the uniqueness of the Christian truth claims, we run up against a host of obstacles, such as the denial of truth, as is postmodernism; disdain of ethical absolutes, as in moral relativism; spiritual eclecticism, as in the New Age Movement; religious pluralism, as in interfaith dialogue; and theological relativism, as in liberal Christianity.Because biblical Christianity insists that Jesus is the unique and only way to God, and the only true saviour, such claims are met with hostility and disdain in today's pluralistic climate. Yet they must be insisted upon, if we are to retain the very heart of the Christian faith.Can a good case be put forward that Jesus is indeed who he claimed to be? Is it possible to affirm the uniqueness of Christianity in the face of other world religions and their claims? Are the New Testament documents indeed reliable? Can a case for universal truth still be made in a postmodern world? And does the insistence on Jesus being the one true way make Christianity intolerant and bigoted?These and other important questions are more than adequately addressed in James Edward's new volume. He takes on all the challengers - be they from without the faith, such as postmodernism, or from within, such as the Jesus Seminar.Christian particularity and uniqueness can be cogently defended, as Edwards demonstrates. Consider just one issue, that of the Jesus Seminar. This is an effort to reconstruct Jesus in the image of contemporary liberal theologians. By voting with colored ballots, they determine whether a saying attributed to Jesus is indeed authentic. In the end, they have decided that 82 per cent are not.Of course such scepticism about Jesus and his words and deeds is not new. But what is different is the way the Jesus Seminar has marketed their results since coming together in 1985. They have managed to get a lot of free publicity, and have been able to widely disseminate their radical claims. But they have \\"turned the wine of myth into the cold water of reality\\" says Edwards.He argues that these scholars come to the New Testament with minds already made up, with a predetermined agenda. Instead of letting the gospels speak, and recognising the high level of reliability and authority of the canonical gospels, they simply read their own assumptions into the debate. The question is, does their reconstruction best fit the evidence? Edwards thinks not.Other meaty chapters deal with other attacks on the Christian truth claims. By the end of the book, the reader is left with the strong impression that these various attacks have not been effective, and the traditional understanding of biblical Christianity still stands.Edwards deserves credit for nicely bringing together in one volume the various recent assaults on the Christ of Christianity, and performing a credible job of debunking those challenges."},{"Title":"Is Jesus the Only Savior?","review":"'The saving historical death of Christ is made present whenever the gospel is proclaimed in His name.' p 137Christianity has a right to be heard because of Christ. He is the only Being who has unique claim to being the true Son of Abraham. Matthew demonstrates not only Christ's biological descent from Abraham, but also His biological descent from David, which emphasizes Jesus' legal claim to the throne of David. The genealogy of the Messiah in Matthew 1:1 affirms these claims: 'The record of the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham...'While the genealogy establishes that Joseph is the legal father of Jesus, Matthew emphasizes that Mary is the biological parent 'of whom' Jesus was born. 'Yet, despite all that evidence, we hold, on the testimony of the first chapter of Matthew and the first chapter of Luke, that Jesus was not as a matter of fact descended from previous men by ordinary generation, but that at the beginning of His life upon this earth, there was a creative act of God, the supernatural conception in the womb of the virgin Mary.' J Gresham Machen,The Christian View of Manp 121Denying 'The Jesus Seminar' its power, Edwards proclaims: 'The claims of Jesus were not an exercise in self-promotion, but rather the corroboration of the Scriptures that 'testify on My behalf' (John 5:39), as the Father 'who sent Me testifies on My behalf' (John 8:19).' p 94'What was unique in the NT drama of salvation was not that Jesus was God, but that in Jesus of Nazareth, God had become a human being. It was the humbleness of God, and not the exaltation of God, that was and is the crowning glory of the Christian gospel.' p 115The gospel experienced the continuous threat of perversion in the early church through the foreign practices of initiates drawn from the mystery religions and pagan sects. 'It is in these later Gospels that one sees the wild inventiveness that is wrongly suspected of the early church.' p 57 Still, today there is the ever-present drive for religious experience to substitute the objective revelation of God in the Bible, but nonetheless, Edwards reminds us quite rightly that 'The gospel, of course, is also an experience, but an experience of grace, which is a different kind of experience. Mysteries promised an emotional experience in life; Christianity, which appealed to the will and mind, promised a new life.' p 137This book seeks to reclaim the ground lost to pluralism by acknowledging that Christ is the one true Savior, and that all other religions fall short of the mark. Any who espouse to this solid view, will find this critique to be unquestionably vital to a robust Christian faith presented to a fallen world. The uniqueness of the Son of God has saving power. Especially Edward's contrasting look at the gospel and 'Not By Mystery Religions' is enlightening reading. 'The Mysteries, both then and now, are expressions of human longings; the gospel was, is, and ever will be a demonstration of God's longing.' p 139Edwards offers a much needed book and an uncompromising stand. He articulates what so many sense is wrong with the post-modern generation. Fables and endless genealogies all become minuscule in the light of Christ and the faithfulness of God, 'when we review the interface of biblical faith vis-&agrave;-vis other religions in the ancient world'. p 227 Added to this, Edwards has genuine writing flair and I appreciated his ability to inform, as this turned out to be a very stimulating read."},{"Title":"Is Jesus the Only Savior?","review":"It used to be typical for the majority of Evangelical Christians to insist that the true Jesus (2 Cor. 11:4) was the only way to God, as all other ways fell short. John 14:6 used to have meaning to the church. However, in recent years, the meaning about the exclusivity of Jesus have blurred, as many have turned to pluralism or, at best, inclusivisim (Jesus can be found innately in other faiths).In this book, James Edwards deals with the issue head on. Indeed, he holds to the conservative position that a true relationship with Christ is vital to one's standing before God. In the last chapters, he hits Postmodernism head on and also talks about what to do with other monotheistic faiths such as Judaism. His conclusion? We should continue to preach the gospel to everyone who does not have a personal relationship with Christ. I, for one, am glad to see this scholar hold such a view, and think the book is worth a look."},{"Title":"Is Jesus the Only Savior?","review":"This book does for this generation what Josh McDowell's books and FF Bruce's books did for an earlier generation, but this one surpasses them all! Edwards swims into familiar territory when he discusses the overwhelming ancient manuscript support for the New Testament (especially in light of the miniscule support other ancient documents have that we still trust anyway).Edwards also shows how unlikely it would have been for the early church to put sayings into the mouth of Jesus and then not draw them anymore in the epistles. He also shows that the gospel portraits of Jesus are much more realistic than anything anyone could have made up. He shows how plausible it was for Jesus to use the less explosive Son of Man moniker than it would have been for him to throw aroudn the Messiah label.Edwards also answers questions skeptics might have about Christ and Christianity such as \\"Is the exclusiveness of Jesus as Savior a threat to world peace?\\" \\"What about the claims of other religions?\\" All the while, Edwards is meek and respectful of other faiths while holding without apology to the specialness and uniqueness of Christ a Savior. This is a book you'll want to pick up for friends who are hungering and thirsting for truth."},{"Title":"Is Jesus the Only Savior?","review":"James Edwards is this age's C.S. Lewis, welcoming with warm, comfortable truths and steely images of wisdom. He coalesces deduction, induction and truth to make the case that encourages the doubter, invites the hostile and fortifies the believer. As a minor historian, I was stunned by the unprecedented validation of Jesus' life. As a former prosecutor, I marveled at the impeccable precision of Edwards' reasoning. As a struggling Christian, I was moved by the unconditional gift of Jesus' life to our own. Edwards respectfully invites a response by the Monty Pythonic-postmodern Jesus Seminar, which might be better served by hiding from the bright light of this book. This is a resounding hurrah for a courageously brilliant recall to logic, truth and faith."},{"Title":"Is Jesus the Only Savior?","review":"Edwards is a biblical scholar with a philosopher's mind. The thinks through the issues thoroughly and presents his conclusions clearly. He is well-read in the literature that bears on this topic.

There is a lot of general information, and the specific information that is included is rather dated (as can be expected; Barbara Bergquist has been involved with the Maltese fancy for about forty years!)I am reading all I can about Maltese, and suggest that serious fanciers (or would-be serious fanciers) get The Complete Maltese by Cutillo, that people who want a good overview of the breed get Howell Book House's The Essential Maltese, and that both get Dog Fancy's Popular Breed Series publication about Maltese (at larger pet stores or www.dogfancy.com)."},{"Title":"Maltese","review":"I have read this book and I know of Mrs Barbara Bergquist. She has given her heart and soul to the Maltese breed. I do not think anyone has been able to match her. She cares about the breed, and not as a money maker.

For four or more of those years I thought I had \\"the perfect job\\" (for me) and quite seriously thought I might be one of the rare souls who stays working for the same company for most of their life. I thrived on going the extra mile and working miracles, as it were.Conditions changed, internal conditions deteriorated, and the perfect job morphed into a soul-draining daily drudge.Luckily for me I found David's blog (where he first fleshed out the essays in this book) and his advice helped me dispassionately assess my current situation, understand what had been happening and why, and gave me the motivation and optimism to make a career change. By the time he published his book I'd left the toxic job, was earning more, working with people who respected me, and had also begun working on a self-publishing project of my own to provide some secondary income.I'm sure that anyone who wants to do better in life will gain far more than $19.95 worth of insight & perspective from reading this book."},{"Title":"Danger Quicksand - Have A Nice Day- An unconvential guide to surviving corporate employment","review":"Most books dealing with careers start out by showing the reader how he or she can go about landing a great job. David St. Lawrence does things differently. His primary audience is people who already have jobs, especially those who work in large corporations, and who either sense that things are somehow going wrong... or fail to sense it. I think it is fair to say that St. Lawrence doesn't regard the working environment at most large companies as reflecting the values we would most like to see there: truth, fairness, reward according to merit, and excellent communication. What he writes about the fate of whistle blowers is one of many examples he cites of upended ethics. Indeed, his view of the corporate working life is infused with darkness-though he lightens this with nice touches of humor, and tangy expressions. For example, one subchapter is entitled \\"Why Your Manager Lies.\\" You've just got to read that part, for sure.It's not as if the author doesn't recognize that there can be some awfully attractive elements to corporate life. Another subchapter is: \\"Seduced by a Fantastic Job.\\" But he emphasizes the risks of wholehearted subscription to a company's work ethic, and doesn't hesitate to cite the costs of such dedication that he has paid in his own career.Much of the first two-thirds of Danger Quicksand is devoted to coaching employees on how to analyze their work environment, and counseling employees on what to do before or after the environment becomes insupportable. His term is \\"exit strategy.\\" The last part of the book, however, develops some more hopeful themes: work-family balance; how to get a better job with a better company; and \\"doing your own thing\\" by starting a \\"micro business\\" are three of them.If you are working, and feeling uneasy about your career, reading Danger Quicksand might make you more uncomfortable. But it also might impel you to take action that will ultimately benefit you greatly."},{"Title":"Danger Quicksand - Have A Nice Day- An unconvential guide to surviving corporate employment","review":"David has a great way of bringing the stuff thats going on around you in the corporate world into focus so that you can make reasoned decisions about your career path."},{"Title":"Danger Quicksand - Have A Nice Day- An unconvential guide to surviving corporate employment","review":"Danger Quicksand is the most honest career advice book I've ever read. I encountered it first online after I complained about my situation to my partner, a practicing psychiatrist, and we sought an outside perspective to bounce our thoughts off of. We got more than we bargained for in St. Lawrence's book and highly recommend it. Beyond salient section titles like \\"Signs of a Problem Workplace\\" and \\"Why Your Manager Lies,\\" you will encounter heaps of worthwhile advice like the choices we can make (Voting with our feet, p.112), how to treat co-workers (You will find that it is far better to be interested in others than to be interesting to others. It is also saner, p.106), and what can happen after whistleblowing ([This about co-workers:] They recognize you as a lightning rod that is already buzzing with a corona discharge and will withdraw from you at the first opportunity, p.85). It must be noted that St. Lawrence has been trained as an engineer. One criticism my partner had of the book is that it devotes little space, if any, to salvaging a problem workplace. Here, St. Lawrence's message is more realistic and just the opposite: He wants to help people take responsibility for their careers and bail out of difficult situations to find better workplaces or independent employment opportunities. So, if you are in need of some saavy advice and ready to help yourself, St. Lawrence has written this book for you. It's never too late."},{"Title":"The Slam: Bobby Jones and the Price of Glory","review":"A marvelous look at the pressure that a champion athlete faces as he attempts to achieve something never done before. Few accounts offer the depth Mr. Sampson does as to the pressure Bobby Jones faced and the turmoil he experienced as he attempted to win the 1930 Grand Slam. The Bobby Jones of\\"The Slam\\" is a fellow you would want to play a round with and then drink a round with, and not the marble statute of most golf hagiography. Jones comes across as talented, driven, conflicted, troubled, yet handling the pressure with grace and resolve.Mr. Sampson has a cynical side to his writing, and it comes out in this book in his accounts of Jones and the USGA. Mr. Sampson spends a significant amount of time in explicit and implicit references to a controversial ruling on the next to last hole of the 1930 US Open. The ruling may have kept Jones from missing first place. However, as much time as Sampson devotes to what is arguably the critical point of the 1930 campaign, he still does not fully bring the point home. The ruling was based on a local rule, and Sampson suggests that the rule was not made evident to the players. Yet Mark Frost's biography of Jones indicates that all players were made aware of the rule. Who is correct? Sampson talks about players complaining about the ruling, but who were the players? Supposedly the ruling not only saved Jones a stroke, but placed him in an exceptionally advantageous position for his next shot...but from Mr. Sampson's description I could not get a good fix on the geography. A map would have been helpful.A good book, and a book that does Bobby Jones a service in making him human again, but often hampered by the author's tunnel vision about \\"The Ruling\\" and the man who made it, Prescott Bush. Yep, the future US Senator and father and grandfather to presidents."},{"Title":"The Slam: Bobby Jones and the Price of Glory","review":"I am puzzled at why Sampson would set out to deminish Jones and his family. I noted that some of \\"his\\" facts are actually completely different in other books that are exhaustively researched such as Mark Frost's book The Grand Slam and others I have read including Down the Fairway by Jones himself. Even if everything negative he came up with was true it isn't really very much in light of the great man that he was. He was a man of impeccable character but he was a human being. He was sensitive and conscientious, intellegent, honest and gracious above all.Even so, I enjoy reading anything about Jones which has led to my reading of other books of this era and books about Walter Hagen etc. I enjoyed the pictures."},{"Title":"The Slam: Bobby Jones and the Price of Glory","review":"I was pleasantly surprised with 'The Slam'.

Jack Hutton"},{"Title":"Children of the Star","review":"I first read &quot;This Star Shall Abide&quot; while in high school, and was stirred by the powerful and profound questions posed by this book, its psychological and moral depth, and its ability to create a consistent world that's very different from our own. I found out a few years ago that there were more books in the series, but wasn't able to track them down, as they were out of print. But finally I've been able to read Ms. Engdahl's full series, and the wait was worth it. The second and third books in this volume surpass the first -- they raise issues of faith and perseverance, self-sacrifice, vision and hope. This new omnibus edition is essential reading not only for science-fiction fans, but for anyone who's thought seriously about ecological issues, the future of humanity, hope, faith or courage. Most highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Children of the Star","review":"As evidenced by masters such as Patricia McKillip, often worthy and original fantasies slip out of print under the wave of Tolkien ripoffs. Sylvia Engdahl's books are in that class, and thank God Meisha Merlin is reprinting them! May they keep on doing so.The main character is Noren, a guy who knows that the world is unjust. The Scholars and Technicians are the only people allowed to use machinery and metals, and enter the City (which, of course, he also craves to enter). They also control the knowledge meted out to the lower caste systems, into which you are born and can never hope to rise from.The High Law is why these rules are there, but a prophecy promises that knowledge and machinery will be accessible to everyone, not just the Scholars. Noren, however, doesn't care about High Law or the Prophecy, believing that High Law is simply oppression and the Prophecy untrue. But freeing his people to equality will be a strange and hard task...Once again, Engdahl creates a believable and thought-provoking piece of SF/fantasy that doesn't fall to the usual ray-guns-or-dragons cliches. The questions raised about freedom in this book kept making me pause in the middle of a page, thinking deeply about what was being shown in the story. For fans of action: There isn't much. For fans of originality/intelligence: There's plenty.Noren, the idealistic rebel, is a particularly endearing character. Like the characters in &quot;Enchantress from the Stars&quot; he is complex and multifaceted, and grows as characters should through his trials. His relentless search for truth is fascinating to the reader, and there are entire pages where you may forget you are reading a story.Faith, truth, and knowledge are the cornerstones of this book, in my eyes. Yet they are not heavy-handed in their presentation, rather they are subtlely woven into the plot. Engdahl's writing style is, if possible, even more captivating than in &quot;Enchantress,&quot; descriptive without getting too overwordy.I'm not certain if this will appeal to the younger readers of &quot;Enchantress,&quot; as this has topics in it that may bore them. (If your kids have read Tolkien, though, they will like this). I recommend it to fans of Tolkien, Lewis, McKillip, and readers of &quot;Enchantress&quot; who can appreciate this multilayered tale."},{"Title":"Children of the Star","review":"I first read &quot;This Star Shall Abide&quot; when I was 11 or 12, but it wasn't until I was 26 that I managed to locate and read &quot;Beyond the Tomorrow Mountains&quot; and &quot;The Doors of the Universe.&quot; The rerelease of all three books in a single omnibus edition is fantastic news for anyone interested in intelligent science fiction. The narrative follows one enormously sympathetic character who is notable for his overriding, unflinching honesty. As a young man, he gradually comes to resist the limitations of the caste system into which he has been born-- but this is just the beginning of a long and tortuous road to maturity. The other characters whom he encounters along the way, while rather modest in number, are also memorably and movingly drawn. Ms. Engdahl's work does not rely on flashy technology, kooky aliens, or gory battles to keep her reader's interest. Instead, she has conceived a world where abstract issues of faith, truth, knowledge, love, loyalty, and obligation have uniformly concrete consequences for its people's continued existence. To have such high stakes riding on individuals' morality and resourcefulness is what makes this such a gripping read."},{"Title":"Children of the Star","review":"Noren is a young man who is frustrated about the class stratified society that he lives in. When he decides to challenge the system, he finds himself on a perilous journey . . . facing truth as he has never imagined. When I read this story many years ago in junior high, I realized for the first time that it was possible to have a perspective on life that did not encompass a large enough view of the truth. This story challenged my views on the limitations of my own perspectives. It is science fiction at its best. This book is a compilation of the trilogy that begins with \\"This Star Shall Abide\\"."},{"Title":"Children of the Star","review":"I first read this as three books from the library, in the 1980's. Since then I've tried multiple times to purchase them but found they were out of print. Imagine my delight to learn of this newly printed omnibus edition! In my opinion, this is one of the most important works of fiction ever written, though not many are familiar with Ms. Engdahl or her stories. She is one of the few to emphasize the importance of our space program in a way that should touch everyone interested in the future of humankind. I think that everyone should take it upon themselves to read this deeply intriguing and wonderfully crafted story."},{"Title":"Children of the Star","review":"The first book in this trilogy, This Star Shall Abide, literally helped determine the course of my life. It took years before I realized I was following a similar course to that of its main character, a course I first read of when I was in about fifth grade. The main character, Noren, is unflinching in his search for Truth with a capital T, a search that demands that he face the hardest of questions and challenge the heirarchical status quo of the world he was born into.You don't have to like or even be interested in science fiction to love this story. It's about the highest strivings of the best of humans. It's a terrific model in many ways for the right way of approaching the world. It's smart, it's cleverly constructed, and it's challenging.The second book I find a little thinner in its reverberations in my life, although my personal struggles -- which on the second book's subject also mirror the main character's -- have led me to essentially the same conclusions. The story grows richer each time I reread it.I only found out today that there WAS a third installment in the saga. I look forward to reading it."},{"Title":"Children of the Star","review":"Like most fans of this book, I first read the trilogy when I was in my teens. I was awed-- it's amazing the way that the author was able to construct such a completely unjust society, and then turn around and make such a compellingly strong case in its favor. (Saying any more would completely give away the ending to the first book!). A must read. The truly amazing thing is that, after searching for this book for literally eighteen years, I have found it to be every bit as powerful and provoking a read as it was all those years ago... it's lost absolutely NOTHING over the years, unusual for a science fiction book to seem fresh and relevant after so many years. I hope this review helps you, if you're wavering then just go ahead and make the purchase. You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Children of the Star","review":"Sylvia Engdahl's intelligence, thoughfulness and care in weaving this story have brought about a book unlike anything else I've read. The hero is never allowed the easy way out, the reader is never treated with condescension. If you enjoy grappling with big chunky issues of politics, philosophy and theology all rolled together, rites of passage, technological challenges, and a delicious flavour of ultimate conspiracy... do yourself a favour and read it!!"},{"Title":"Children of the Star","review":"Overall, I was really impressed with this book. At times it goes a little slow, but Engdahl made up for it in the wonderful plot of the book. The surprising things, is that Noran, the main character, would actually be considered a static character, which is not typical of an engaging main character. His views do not change, nor does his personality or goals throughout the entire book. What keeps the reading turning the pages is the strangeness, and the fact that this sci-fi book could in fact be based on events that could happen one day. Another aspect of the book that was really engaging was the originality of the ideas used. It was not the typical sci-fi book that included space-crafts, aliens and the like. The ideas were extremely original, and fact-based. The other reason I enjoyed the book so much was that throughout the entire thing there was a mixture of sci-fi writing, and science. Sections of the book were devoted to explaining the concept of genetic engineering, which if you are interested in, is used very well in this book. The fact that a good book can incorporate aspects of reality, in the form of genetic engineering, is amazing, and makes the novel that much more notable.I would recommend this book for people who won't get frustrated with the sections that are very slow-paced, but who are dedicated to reading each and every page, because they all add to the entire meaning of the book as a whole. It is not a typical sci-fi book, so don't expect lots of space-ships and people from different planets, but instead look forward to a well written novel about a culture struggling to re-build its self. You will follow Noran as he struggles to find his place in a world that he feels is wrong, and corrupt. Be open to twists in plot, and strange themes brought up again and again throughout the book, and you may enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Children of the Star","review":"I bought \\"Heritage of the Star\\" (UK title) when I was 11, more or less at random from the Puffin Book Club, and it remained my favourite book for years and was lent to everyone I know.

It had never occurred to me that there could be sequels, so I was delighted to find this trilogy at Amazon and finally read the rest of the story. Science (and Science Fiction) may have moved on, but this remains one of the best stories for teenagers (and everyone else) I've ever read; it deserves a much higher profile - buy it for yourself and every young person you know who likes to daydream and think about the bigger things in life."},{"Title":"Children of the Star","review":"I first read these books (now book) over 10 years ago. They have remained among my favorite books. The book is appealing to people young and old. Ms Engdahl's writings have a way of staying with one always.This trilogy serves as a thought provoking journey through the relationship between society, religion, and science. It starts out with one man challenging the foundation of his society, to him embracing it, and back to him challenging it yet again, but for a completely different and selfless reason. Ms. Engdahl paints a wonderful picture of a futuristic and simultaneously primitive world whose advances and way pique the imagination.Ms. Engdahl throws a taste of her intergalactic society into the final installment, but no one recognizable from Enchantress from the Stars or The Far Side of Evil."},{"Title":"Children of the Star","review":"Everything Ms. Engdahl writes is gold. Not only does this book have a great storyline and characters, it also is thought provoking. She centers around themes about the importance of spacetravel and innovations in science.

Though Noren's world initially seems far removed from our own, his struggle is profoundly relevant. What is faith, is it positive or negative, and why? If these questions interest you, I strongly urge you to read this book. It helped me find a resolution to such questions after struggling with them most of my life.When I originally read the first book (on its own; this volume is a collection of all three books in the trilogy), the revelation at the end had me opening the book again the moment I finished it to read it over again. Another point left me feeling so betrayed and angry that it was like it had actually happened to me in the real world. The stakes were set so high that I wondered how it could all possibly come together, but then it comes to a masterful conclusion.It's a shame that this book did not get more attention. I certainly will tell everyone I can about it. It's true that it's not an action-packed book, but if you enjoy thought-provoking stories of great moral and emotional complexity, definitely give this one a try."},{"Title":"Children of the Star","review":"If you're a sci-fi fan, don't miss this book. If you're not a sci-fi fan, don't miss it either. Sylvia Engdahl successfully creates an alternative world that will force you to rethink your view of our own world. What is truth? What is knowledge? What is faith? If you've ever asked these questions, you owe it to yourself to read this book. You will be thinking about it for a long time afterward - in my case, 15+ years."},{"Title":"Children of the Star","review":"I first discovered Engdahl's trilogy about 15 years ago. Her work is thought provoking and intelligent. I'm really glad that more readers are going to have a chance to discover her with the reissue of Children of the Star.

I read it when I was 11 years old, and the main character's determination to pursue truth at all costs, and his struggles with the issue of faith, absolutely fired my imagination. My career today as a Christian preacher was molded and shaped by concepts I first met in this book. I was 33 when I finally got to read the other two books, and was gratified to learn that author makes no compromises in the rest of the story. In fact, the character's struggles in the final book in many ways mirror the struggles of my own life.I have since bought 2 copies for friends, and have loaned my copy to anyone who will read it. Buy this book. There should be more of its kind in the world."},{"Title":"Children of the Star","review":"Like others, I was first swept up in Noren's story when I was 12 years old. I loved 'This Star Shall Abide' but was less than thrilled with 'Beyond the Tomorrow Mountains.'Last night, at age 36, I re-read 'Tomorrow Mountains' (in one sitting!) and understood immediately why a young teenager would have found it difficult: the story of Noren's new challenge was far beyond my youthful understanding, much less sympathy. But as an adult, I found it an amazingly vivid and true-to-(my)-life portrait of an existential crisis.Engdahl has a gift for creating compelling, sympathetic characters whose minds and hearts are engaged in their relationshps with each other and their world. Each one has a different perspective, and each (slowly) learns from the wisdom of the others. The &quot;lessons&quot; are there, but so are rich stories of people you enjoy spending time with.Tonight I'll start &quot;The Door into the Universe&quot; third book of the trilogy, and I'm delighted at the chance to discover a whole new chapter.And don't miss &quot;Enchantress from the Stars&quot;, also by Engdahl."},{"Title":"Children of the Star","review":"Today is SF/Fantasy writer recognition day and I decided to honor some of my favorite books of all time.

I loved the fact that her values were strong, her charactors intelligent, and her worlds exciting and finely felt.Definitely enjoyable reading without being overly fluffy"},{"Title":"Children of the Star","review":"This book is a trilogy published as a single volume, consisting of \\"The Star Shall Abide\\", \\"Beyond the Tomorrow Mountains\\" and \\"The Door to the Universe\\". I read the original first book under the title \\"Heritage of the Star\\" - that was how it was published in the UK, and its sequel was never published here. I had no idea there were sequels of this, one of the most memorable books I read in childhood, until I discovered the author on the web. I quickly ordered this book, because Heritage of the Star was such a profound work that I have never forgotten it and often wished I could read more like it.The trilogy does not disappoint. I knew the first book well (I re-read it at least twice in the past). That follows a young man who becomes a heretic for challenging the religion of the mysterious scholars who rule their world. The first part of the book follows his scepticism and attempts to persuade others. The second part is all about enlightenment (and I will say no more to avoid spoilers).The second book of the trilogy was supposed to complete the story originally, but it feels vey much like a link book. It seems to me that it asks more questions than it resolves, and frankly I see why this was not published originally in the UK. Nevertheless it is a vital key to the third book - which only cam about some years later as real world science set the author thinking in a most interesting and, indeed, compelling way. The third book is easily the equal of the first, and looks at all kinds of issues around the struggle for a race of people to survive.These books only show their age in a few minor and forgivable ways. Again I will not be explicit about these ways to avoid spoilers - but if not perfect science fiction, these books are certainly profound and intelligently written. This is not humdrum space opera. This is true science fiction, to engross you, make you yearn for the people and to ultimately make you think. This book is already doing the \\"loan\\" rounds amongst friends who like good science fiction."},{"Title":"Casanova in Bolzano","review":"The life of writer Sandor Marai has all the elements of a dramatic novel, regrettably a tragic one. Born in the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1900, he had established an enviable reputation in only 30-some years. His nobility, humanism and hatred for the Fascists earned him the enmity of Admiral Horthy's Hungarian regime and later the malevolence of the Communists who were to be in power. All copies of his books were destroyed, and his work was banned forever.Disillusioned and in despair he left his beloved country, first to find sanctuary in Italy and then in the United States. In 1989 he took his own life never knowing of democracy's return to his native land. Some five years later three of his works were found in French translations. In 2001 we were privileged to have the first English translation of one of his novels, Embers. It was published to great acclaim, as I feel certain that Casanova in Bolzano will be received.In an opening author's note Marai makes it clear that the only actual event in this story is Casanova's escape from an unspeakably horrid cell in Venice's ducal palace in 1796. What follows is totally fiction - ah, but what fiction it is.With the assistance of a defrocked priest, Balbi, Casanova makes his way to an Italian village, Bolzano. Once there he demands and is given the finest rooms by an innkeeper who at first distrusts the pair because of their ragged appearances and lack of luggage. But Marai has given Casanova a silver tongue, one which commands, influences, and, of course, woos.Bolzano is far from what most would consider a safe haven because some years before Casanova had dueled with the duke of Parma for the love of Francesca, then a 15-year-old girl. The Duke got the better of Casanova but did not take his life, rather making him promise never to see Francesca again.Now, the duke is an old man and has come upon a note Francesca has written to her former lover asking to see him. She, too, has changed over the years. Married to the Duke she is no longer a susceptible teenager but a rather willful woman. Will the two meet?Throughout his richly told tale Marai treats readers to painterly details and ruminations pertaining to the human condition - desire, honor, love, duty. Here is a novelist whose life was far too short, yet he speaks to us as if he were alive today. And his voice is sublime.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Casanova in Bolzano","review":"The second Marai novel to be published in English by Knopf. If Embers was primarily about friendship, Casanova is primarily about love between man and woman. It is clear that Marai understood people better than most writers of the twentieth century, or in fact any that come to mind. From his writing, one assumes that Marai must have lived, really lived.Casanova is Bolzano is not a young man's (or woman's) book. Its insights speak to those who have lived a good chunk of life already, exploring human ambition and disappointment, youth and age, celebrity and exile, and the complicated relationship of love and sex. It's a mature work from a mature writer.It is also not a historical novel; it has precious little to say about the eighteenth century, or Italy, or even specific characters. The characters in Bolzano are not even \\"characters,\\" as such-- in fact, the name \\"Casanova\\" does not appear once, outside of Marai's introduction (the original Hungarian title is \\"Vend&eacute;gj&aacute;t&eacute;k Bolzan&oacute;ban,\\" which also does not mention \\"Casanova\\"). It's about people, archetypes.How does it compare with Embers? It starts off a little more slowly (The NYTimes review called it, \\"a novel of exquisite slowness and refreshing oddity\\"), but quickly picks up for one classic Marai scene: two people in a room meeting again for the first time in years."},{"Title":"Casanova in Bolzano","review":"Who better to read this inspired story of Casanova than the acclaimed Simon Prebble? His English accent and rich tenor add immeasurably to a listener's pleasure. Combine these with his ability to inhabit all make of diverse characters within a single reading and you have an audio book head and shoulders above the rest.In an opening author's note Marai makes it clear that the only actual event in this story is Casanova's escape from an unspeakably horrid cell in Venice's ducal palace in 1796. What follows is totally fiction - ah, but what fiction it is.With the assistance of a defrocked priest, Balbi, Casanova makes his way to an Italian village, Bolzano. Once there he demands and is given the finest rooms by an innkeeper who at first distrusts the pair because of their ragged appearances and lack of luggage. But Marai has given Casanova a silver tongue, one which commands, influences, and, of course, woos.Bolzano is far from what most would consider a safe haven because some years before Casanova had dueled with the duke of Parma for the love of Francesca, then a 15-year-old girl. The Duke got the better of Casanova but did not take his life, rather making him promise never to see Francesca again.Now, the duke is an old man and has come upon a note Francesca has written to her former lover asking to see him. She, too, has changed over the years. Married to the Duke she is no longer a susceptible teenager but a rather willful woman. Will the two meet?Throughout his richly told tale Marai treats us to painterly details and ruminations pertaining to the human condition - desire, honor, love, duty. Simon Prebble treats us to a superb reading.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Casanova in Bolzano","review":"Venice, the 18th century: The days when Venice controlled trade by the sea are long over, and the city has descended into decadence. Carnivale, the annual event celebrated by Venetians, lasts half the year; the elite of Venetian society gamble and drink behind the anonymity of masks. In 1756, Venice was home to the infamous Casanova, a rake who lived the high life to the hilt. Born in obscurity, Casanova managed to befriend a duke and move himself through the ranks of Venetian society. Although not by accounts a physically attractive man, he captivated all kinds of women with his charm and flair.With a kind of poetical language which is all his own, Sandor Marai wrote this practically perfect novel which attempts to recreate the period immediately following Casanova's escape from a Venetian prison, in which he hid out in a room in the ton of Bolzano on the mainland. A surprisingly passionate man, one tiny event or word from someone brings on a torrent of passionate words from the famous aristocrat, who is startlingly violent in his actions. After sixteen months in prison, Casanova is ready to enjoy the finer things of life, but finds that he has lost his touch. Marai, who wrote Casanova in Bolzano in the 1940's, gives a warm, sensual depth to descriptions as well as a finely-tuned insight into the subject of his narrative.Going back and forth in time, Marai mixes the present with past memory, and reality with that which can't be touched. He recreates the day when Casanova fought in a duel with the Duke of Parma, five years before over a country girl, a woman he might have been in love with.The paragraphs in this book are long, and there is quite a lot to take in; but this book is certainly worth the read."},{"Title":"Casanova in Bolzano","review":"Escaping in 1756, after sixteen months in a Venice jail, Giacomo Casanova, \\"all seven deadly sins in one accursed body,\\" arrives in Bolzano, where the Doge and the Inquisition cannot reach him. Seeing himself as \\"that rare creature, a writer with a life to write about,\\" he and a defrocked priest, Balbi, move into a hotel, not far from where the Duke of Parma and his young bride Francesca reside. Casanova was wounded by the duke in a duel over Francesca three years before and has promised never to see her again. When the Duke arrives at Casanova's hotel with a letter from Francesca, asking to see him, the stage is set for the action and a surprising ending.This is the second of Hungarian author Marai's \\"lost masterpieces\\" to be \\"discovered\\" and published recently in English, and it bears some structural similarities to Embers, his previous novel. Like Embers, the action takes place largely in one room, where an assertive narrator comments on his life, his rationalizations for his actions, his beliefs, and his future. Observant of even the smallest details about people, the author is far more romantic in his descriptions here, as befits a novel about Casanova, piling up detail upon detail in a narrative which sounds, in places, almost like the grand chorus of an opera (with one incredible sentence consisting of over three hundred words).As the author catalogues the response of the citizenry of Europe to news of Cazanova's escape, the glories and cruelties of Venice, the enthusiastic reaction of the citizens of Bolzano to the \\"surgeries\\" Casanova holds each afternoon to discuss love, and the details of Cazanova's life, he sets the scene for the action which takes place in the second half of the novel. The arrival of the Duke with Francesca's letter, his \\"deconstruction\\" of the letter, and the solution the duke proposes to Cazanova set up a morality tale in which Casanova must evaluate his life, his feelings for Francesca, and his definition of love.Witty and delightful to read, the novel raises thoughtful questions about love and responsibility, but in its details it is not as fully integrated as Embers. The story seems overloaded with heavy descriptions in the first half, lacking the action and, more importantly, the characters' interactions which make the second half so enjoyable and the ironies of the ending so memorable. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Casanova in Bolzano","review":"Just a note to add my enthusiastic review of this masterpiece to the others on view, and to point out the richness of George Szirtes' masterly translation. I can think of few books one can read, even in their original language, with this novel's extraordinary evocative power. In reading Casanova, as with Szirtes' other Marai translation, the earlier, lesser and far more youthful novel, The Rebels, I find myself reading half a page, then drifting off into a reverie the text has evoked, returning only when a timeless time has passed: it is as if Marai's extraordinary, passionate density of detail, and the interiority with which he invests it, play a Proustian trick on the reader--the text remains short and highly concentrated, while the reader performs his own feats of extensive Proustification. Bravissimo!The translation of the excellent Embers, done from the German translation, cannot perform this trick, alas."},{"Title":"Casanova in Bolzano","review":"In a brief sojourn in Bolzano, Venice, on his way to Munich in 1756, Giacomo Casanova, stops to rest at a local inn. Newly escaped from Leads Prison with Balbi, a defrocked priest, Casanova employs his considerable powers of persuasion to elicit lodging and all manner of material goods to make his stay more palatable. Ensconced in his rooms, word spreads that this master of the secrets of love is entertaining paying guests, offering advice and observations to help others unravel the thorny knots of their relationships and romantic liaisons. For a few coins, Casanova dispenses his invaluable wisdom, waiting for his fate to play out.Also residing in Balzano at the time are the Duke of Parma and his wife, Francesca. Casanova and Parma have dueled over this woman in the past, Casanova vanquished, never to see his love again. Suddenly, the duke arrives with an unexpected proposition for the banished lover; Casanova is faced with a conundrum that requires him to examine the complicated tentacles of his attachment to Francesca and the nature of love as he perceives it. In flowing prose that evokes both time and place, Casanova embarks upon a personal narrative, musing on every aspect of his emotional attachment to Francesca and a dialog with both the Duke of Parma and the very wise object of his affections, who knows her lover better than he knows himself.The Inquisition looms large in Casanova's past and possibly his future, should he tarry too long in Bolzano, the duke's reach extensive and pervasive. The reputed lover's flight from Leads is a boon to the gossiping citizens, who follow his progress with enthusiasm and attend his surgeries seeking advice. But even the Inquisition pales beneath the force of Francesca's declaration of love and the clarity of her intent. Francesca's soliloquy makes a mockery of Casanova's obfuscations in denial of truth, an expose more deadly than the sharp point of his dagger. Brought together through the duke's machinations, the lovers engage in a truly memorable encounter. This remarkable feast of wit and the vagaries of love is a fine exercise in the illogic of reason when applied to romance, obsession and the indulgence of grand passion.

He goes to Bolzano to rebuild his life and to resume his life of seduction. He picks Bolzano because of his history with the place and this particular lady. The story picks up when her husband, the elderly duke ....Well you can guess the story from there. It marks the second novel of Sandai Marai that's in print.

The prose is just brilliant, full of memorable passages and this alone is worth reading this work.

He unexpectedly meets his former opponent-duelist, the Duke of Parma, who married a young girl, Francesca, when she was in love (she still is) with Casanova.The Duke forces the latter to meet Francesca again for one night and a last confrontation.Casanova is \`a sworn enemy of virtue and morality'. He is the incarnation of the unbridled sexual instinct looking for conquest after conquest: \`A flame that burns but cannot warm. Only the thrill of seduction. You are doomed never to be satisfied.' For him, \`love is too much'.The Duke of Parma \`lived by violence and will die in vanity.' He had the power to force Francesca to marry him.Both consider Francesca as merchandise, whereupon a deal can be made. She has a price.But Francesca responds: \`I am life'. Francesca is the incarnation of love: \`Love is life'.However, for S&aacute;ndor M&aacute;rai, true love is not from this world.This novel starts very slowly.

One of its characters--and a remarkable one--espoused as fine and powerful a description of true romantic love as exists in literature, I felt. The sad thing was, in reading it, I knew this was a dated novel. That notion of romantic love was in that \\"fine and private place/where none I fear do embrace\\", as far as I could tell.This novel is about love. In a sense, it makes a lovely headstone for the notion of romantic love."},{"Title":"Casanova in Bolzano","review":"It was only natural that after reading Sandor Marai's \\"Embers\\" I had to read his work \\"Casanova in Bolzano\\".

It was more useful than anything though."},{"Title":"Sylvia Browne's Book of Dreams","review":"I was a bit skeptical at first but I found this to be interesting. While I don't find myself \\"travelling to the Other Side\\" often when I dream, I found her explanations plausible. And I definitely agree with her assessment that dream dictionaries are fine, but a symbol in a dream may mean something entirely different to each individual. I liked her \\"dividing\\" dreams into five types, including prophetic dreams, an informational or problem-solving dream, and astral visits.Sylvia goes into detail to describe each of these \\"dream types,\\" and points out in our society people don't give enough credit to dreams. She does spend a chapter describing dream symbols, and it's as good a \\"dream dictionary\\" as any I've seen.She also describes ways to make a dream (especially a bad one) end differently by \\"telling yourself\\" it's only a dream and to \\"choose\\" a different ending to a recurring bad dream.I felt Sylvia did a very good job in describing dreams and what they mean or may not mean. Several dream books I've skimmed through seem to follow a \\"template\\" of sorts in trying to explain what your dreams mean. And Sylvia went out of her way to do the opposite in explaining dreams.I'm glad I took the time to read this book."},{"Title":"Sylvia Browne's Book of Dreams","review":"I have to admit, I was afraid to start reading Sylvia's books in the beginning. Being raised Southern Baptist, I was taught from childhood that anything of this nature was strictly forbidden. Since I finally (thank God!) decided to open my mind and my heart, I have found a wealth of comfort, peace, and even confirmation. So many references in her books spark me to realize that I've known and believed this my whole life, but was afraid to question it, and ignorant as to how to put it into words. What a beautiful knowledge that there really is a Mother God and she loves us eternally and unconditionally! Astral catelepsy is something that I've experienced since early childhood, but never knew what it was. My brother is the only other person I know that has experienced it as well. I was so happy to read in this book that it's not death knocking at the door! Now that I know what it is, I have no more reason to be afraid of it. This book, along with every other book I've read of hers is definitely one that I would recommend to anyone! A must read!!!!"},{"Title":"Sylvia Browne's Book of Dreams","review":"This is the second book I've read by Sylvia Browne. I enjoy her insights and the information about dreams, life after death, astral visits, etc. I am always interested in reading spirituality books, and I found this book of dreams very enlightening.I have recently read \\"What Dreams May Come\\" by Richard Matheson about life after death, and what I found interesting was that his book was written in the late 70's and a lot of Browne's facts/theories in her book match with what Matheson wrote about in his fictional love story. (The Hall of Wisdom, Working plateaus, etc).There were still a few times while reading \\"Book of Dreams\\" where I had to really shake my head and wonder, \\"Wow, is she for real??\\" But I kept reading and I think the ideas and theories do make some sense. Since her theories are hard to prove, our faith and beliefs are what spirituality is all about. I enjoy Browne and her books, and I rate this read a 4 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Sylvia Browne's Book of Dreams","review":"Okay, I have to admit up front, I'm a Sylvia Browne freak. I loved all her books and how much she helps people when they are having difficulties in life.(The reviewer that gave her \\"predictions\\" in a general broad manner to critique Sylvia, was even funny because she showed how general preditions are not much help at all and not even worth reading hers or anyone else's was great in justaposition to true psychics such as Sylvia and James Van Praagh. I just hope she doesn't quit her day job to become a \\"psychic\\"-hahaha)But back to her book, Sylvia is far more skilled, and even though she does not have advanced degrees in psychology or psychiatry (which may even be an asset), she does a truly fantastic job in categorizing the types of dreams you may have (both recurring and nonrecurring)into 5 basic types, and then does a truly wonderful job of discussing how you can best further analyze a troubling or mystifying dream you have had to your benefit. (Freud, on the other hand, and others who have all the PhD's seem to complicate the matter of dream interpretation far beyond the average person's ken.)In any case, Sylvia does give specific techniques for analyzing and understanding dreams, and even getting rid of nightmares and upsetting dreams that aren't there to help us.She also gives numerous life examples of how properly analyzing the dream can help us in our daily lives or help us dispel fears and misunderstandings when we just take some time to properly put an annoying dream in perspective.If you are interested in what dreams mean in a simplfied form, and how you can learn some simple techiques to learn from the information which is being relayed to you in your dreams, this book indeed is a well written, easy to understand and helpful guide. It is very practical and not at all scientific, and it is based on intuition and belief, written by someone who is extraordinarily intuitive and sensitive.This book is just one more lesson in how we can use our angels and spirit guides to open up our hearts to loving messages we can receive from the other side which will help us immensely in our daily lives."},{"Title":"Sylvia Browne's Book of Dreams","review":"Wow! This book is her best yet. I found this to be the most comprehensive and fascinating book on dreams and dream interpretation that I've ever read.

Her ability to look in to the information and decipher the meaning was Sylvia at her best. I liked her subject dealing with deceased loved ones coming into communication during our sleep which is very fulfilling and informative.

However, the books spends more time discussing Ms. Browne's views about herself rather than focusing on the more interesting information about dreams themselves.It is obvious from reading the book that Ms. Browne is a lay person and a &quot;spiritual guide&quot;, not a scientist of any kind. I would venture to guess that most of the information she provides is based on her own opinions and conjecture rather than hard, sounds facts.I was very disappointed with this book, and only &quot;dream&quot; of getting my money back . . ."},{"Title":"Sylvia Browne's Book of Dreams","review":"I love this book.

This one will stay on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Sylvia Browne's Book of Dreams","review":"You know this book makes you think back about every dream you can remember having lately or even some that have been very memorable and if you can just try to not guess at every dream you have had by what the 5 dream states mean in here you may be able to answer a few questions. Now i myself have had many dreams that i thought were wish dreams and then realized after examing the book that i think were probably release dreams or maybe something else. I know that this book will not give me all the answers so if that is what you are looking for don't read it. It just helps you to go deeper inside yourself and gives you little things to do to help you if your really interested in delving deeper into this dream thing. It is totally up to each individual. If your not the type to really believe in how dreams can give you answers to your problems or be a part of that other world then don't bother buying a copy. For those of you who are new to this then it is the perfect book. She simplifies and breaks things down for you to understand your dreams and believe me i have been into this Sylvia browne thing for a while but i can't even begin to try to understand my own self and my dreams so this book has been a great teaching tool for me.

I give this book 3 stars because I was starting to get bored reading it. There was some interesting stuff in the book like totems which are animals in dreams that we have \\"chosen\\" as \\"protectors\\" because animals are pure spirits and most sacred to God. I had never thought of them that way in dreams before and so this book did make me look at animals and a few other things differently in my dreams. But I started to become bored with all the account stories from other people about the content of their dreams. I found myself skimming alot when another dream was told here and there. I skipped to parts I was most interested in. Some one else might not become bored, as I did, reading other people's dream accounts in the book so that is why I did not give this book less than 3 stars. I did learn a few things and will look for other souces of information on those topics. So my search moves on.

She never has let me down and definitely didn't with this book. I've always been interested in dreams (and been confused by them). This book explains EVERYTHING but lets you find meaning in your dream's own symbolism rather than have a list that tells you what they mean. AMAZING! Definitely recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Sylvia Browne's Book of Dreams","review":"While most dream books focus on the symbolism within the dreams, Sylvia focuses more on the different types of dreams, offering a fresh perspective on dream analysis. According to Ms. Browne, there are five different types of dreams. Release, Wish, Information, Prophetic, and Astral Travel. Within each section, she not only explains what the category means, but also provides examples for them. One of the last chapters of the book contains examples of various dreams submitted by readers, some a combination of two or more categories.While there are tons of books on dream symbolism, this is the first book I've come across that actually helps you to categorize the dream. Since dreams are mostly symbolic in nature and very personal, thereby, a bit cryptic, being able to categorize the dream first is a BIG help in deciphering it.I strongly recommend this book as part of further studies in dream analysis, including Carl Jung's 'Man and His Symbols'"},{"Title":"Sylvia Browne's Book of Dreams","review":"This was a VERY informative book by Sylvia on many aspects of our dreaming. She's explains when we dream, what we dream, what kinds of dreams we have and even how to control those weird or bad dreams. I haven't had a bad dream (2 years now) since reading Sylvia's books and DREAMS enabled me to actually take advantage of the information our dreaming may provide us.Sylvia's explanation on Astral Catalepsy was a blessing. Ever wake up in the middle of the night and have the feeling of something sitting on your chest and you can't move or speak? I had this condition a lot in my 20's and it terrified me! Sylvia explains the condition common in many people as merely our conscience minds catching our soul returning from an astral visit. Now that I understand this condition and Sylvia's suggestion to eliminate this, it doesn't occur anymore! Sylvia also explains how and when we astral travel too.Those reading may find Sylvia's many examples of people who had certain dreams a bit distracting but the information she gives in this book for us is golden and instantly applicable in our daily lives!!"},{"Title":"Sylvia Browne's Book of Dreams","review":"i've been studying dreams for along time and i found this book to be the best tool for knowing why we dream what we dream; it's not a dictionary of dreams like most dream books, but a comprehensive look at dream types and the occasions in which we have certain dreams, i've recommended it to all my friends and even my students."},{"Title":"Sylvia Browne's Book of Dreams","review":"I enjoy Sylvia Browne, and you may have seen her on Montel Williams. She is so down to earth, and real. You can get this essence of her personality in this book. She has a no nonsense discussion of dreams and their meanings. She is a little less into symbolism unlike many other dream books you may have read in the past.What I liked about this book is that she feels not every symbol you see in a dream is some sort of repressed sexual symbol. She also states very clearly that not every thing you may see in a dream is absolutely relavant. I think this is very helpful as some dream books will have you trying to sort out everything you see in a dream. Themes are the key for her dream interpretation.She also feels that there are different types of dreams. Some dreams may reveal the future, while others may answer problems that you are currently working on. Other dreams may be spiritual connections with loved ones that may have passed on, and others dreams, are simply dreams.I would recommend reading this book for those of you who may not have heard of Sylvia Browne before. For the fans of Sylvia Browne I feel the content of this book is fairly original and not material that is used in other books. She offers you a realistic way to view your own dreams and learn the insight from the dreams that you have."},{"Title":"Choice is Yours: A Teenager's Guide to Self-Discovery, Relationships, Values, and Spritual Growth","review":"The Choice is Yours is an invaluable book for any young person.

Gainous' book \\"Be a Contender, Not Just a Contestant!\\" for a second Blessed time! I must confess, the first time I read it I was a mere contestant who sometimes had doubt whether I was even in the contest at all. My first reading allowed me to see the need and gave me a desire to make the bold decision for both the need and want to become a viable contender for the ultimate prize - Salvation. I decided to read the Reverend's wonderful message again to compliment my growth in Christ through my study of the Word!The message of the book is designed for Christians to respond to the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Reverend Gainous effectively completes this objective with precision. The chapters are written in such a manner that they reference one another and maintain a common thread throughout the book. They also stand independent to add fresh insight to the topic of each chapter. He not only provides the contestant with the armor to survive spiritual warfare, he also provides a Seven-Step Spiritual Strategy to become a contender, which paves the glorious path to Victory!The book is also directed toward the spiritual contenders in life. The author continually uses Bible scripture to support and reinforce his message of how to become a contender and maintain the contender status through a spiritual regimen of prayer and fasting. Reverend Gainous provides personal testimony from his earlier days of running to Hell to his Blessed transformation of becoming a volunteer soldier and leader on the spiritual battlefield. Through his discipline and obedience he is fighting to win! As Reverend Gainous so eloquently wrote - \\"do not be ashamed to suffer as a Christian\\" because \\"if you do not experience the pressures of life and make it, you cannot witness to anyone or strengthen anyone.\\"I encourage those of you who enjoy hearing and reading Messages from great Preachers such as Dr. Frank M.

Denouncing the path of compromise as seeking to &quot;satisfy and find peace with others rather than God&quot;, Be A Contender, Not Just A Contestant! is a powerful and provocative testimony for those Christian who strive for enthusiasm and focus in the fundamentals of their religion amidst a secular world that ranges from the passively indifferent to the actively hostile."},{"Title":"Be a Contender, Not Just a Contestant!","review":"Reverend Gainous presents a tremendous challenge to move beyond the medicraty of sideline Christianity by moving into a position of power and faith, which leads to ultimate victory that all believers can enjoy.

I had always wanted crown molding in my house, but my then husband was not a handy man nor did he want to pay the outrageous expense of professional installation. Last Christmas I treated myself with a nice compound miter saw, a miter saw table and a handful of books on crown molding. I also bought my first piece of molding to start practicing. I was warned by friends and coworkers that my 20 years of experience in accounting were not going to help me with this project. But I was determined; after all I was a free woman and didn't have to account anyone for my failures. After reading many books and practicing the infamous \\"coping\\" I was in tears. It looked like if my dog had done it.My pride was at stake. I could sense the mixed looks of compassion and laughter of my friends and, especially that of my ex.Most of the books only devoted a couple of pages to crown molding making it look as simple as baking Christmas cookies. Deep in my heart I new somewhere someone held the key to do this project in a humane, rational, and logical way. Coping had to be the way the Stone Age man did his cave trimming.Searching the net was when I came across Wayne Drake's site. After reading excerpts from his book I new his book was the answer to my prayers. I bought it along with his angle measurement tools. I recommend also buying the templates. I didn't and I end up wasting a lot of time and trim. I have done all of my four rooms upstairs only with the help of my 12 year old son. I am waiting to save some money to do the first floor where I am planning to install fancier molding. I have to confess that I am not any good with hammer and nails. (Now that I think of it, it is another Stone Age tool and procedure) I purchased a Paslode cordless nailer and it was a cinch to do the job.Another neat thing that I have not seen before is that the author of this book is only one email away. He is always ready to help you with any question or problem you may encounter.Needless to say I have become the hottest girl on the block. And if you wonder about my ex .... The fool thinks I am dating a guy from Home Depot. Good luck with your project."},{"Title":"Crown Molding & Trim: Install It Like a Pro!","review":"My apologies to Mr. Drake for my review below. The book IS a valuable resource, BUT the print quality was atrocious with the pictures particularly difficult to divine. I understand that at the author's web site a new edition with improved print quality is available. I returned my copy because the print quality and picture quality was poor. I would highly recommend buying the book at his web site or at the few Home Depot stores on the west coast that carry the book with much improved (I hope)quality of production. Visit his web site at www.compoundmiter.com for more information.His book does contain fairly complete explanations about installing crown molding, but his chapters on crafts were mere filler and fluff and were not at all helpful. The unhelpful chapters represented nearly 50% of this VERY short and limited book. I would have much preferred that he use that space to enlarge on molding installation and other useful trim carpentry projects. Though helpful, the book is too short for its $20 price tag PLUS shipping.His plastic protractors on his web site are ridiculously expensive. In my field (Radiologist) the vendors give out the same plastic protractors for free. Really, he should price them more reasonably thereby increasing sales substantially (ever heard of Henry Ford?).His prices on the web site should INCLUDE shipping at least since they are quite high to begin with.I hope that this book is a work in progress. It is a good beginning and a valuable starting point for any tyro such as myself.

It has content in it for working with sloped and cathedral ceilings that most other books on trim leave out. There are plenty of photos, all black and white but the print quality of the photos leaves much to be desired. However, you can see enough detail in virtually all photos that the print quality does not seriously take away from the quality of the book -- if you can see well.The shining quality of this book is its devotion to the use of crown molding. Very little coverage on any other trim work. If you want a more thorough treatment of other trim work, I would suggest the following books:Decorating With Architectural Trimwork: Planning, Designing, Installing.

I'll attach the laminated charts and molding templates directly to the miter saw and portable stand... right where I need them. As a decorating contractor, complex miters are a daily headache.

Just tell us what is going on, and if you are like me and already have invested in a really good (Starrett) protractor, pass on his book and get a more straightforward guide to installing trim.I also agree with others who think the reviews are fishy. Amazon, you really dropped the ball on this one, with no details on the product.By the way, I took the book back."},{"Title":"Crown Molding & Trim: Install It Like a Pro!","review":"All of the reviews are real. I also sell my book thru my web site and the reason that I had so many reviews posted in a short time period is that I emailed a lot of my customers that had purchaed my book thru my web site and asked them if they would please provide me a honest review of my book on amazon. I did not ask for just favorable reviews, I asked for their honest review... these are customers that had purchased my book and were willing to take the time to go to amazon and leave their honest evaluation of my book. Burke, thanks for your comments but when you get the book you will see that it is just like the reviews say it is.

Everybody I talked to said, &quot;You need to hire it done - just cutting at 45's won't work&quot;. Through surfing the web, I came across Wayne's book and decided to give it a try.It couldn't be an easier read. Wayne explains everything in layman's terms. I had basically no woodworking experience and borrowed my brother-in-laws mitre saw and completed the job.I highly recommend this book!!!"},{"Title":"Crown Molding & Trim: Install It Like a Pro!","review":"from a novice wood-worker who appreciates good quality work and usually pays someone else to do it. this is the first how-to endorsement i have ever written. the book reads fairly well but every piece of advice MUST be followed or the reader will end up just as the author indicates in his book. definitely a strong recommendation after installing several rooms in my home, then helping a friend install molding in virtually his entire home (just purchased). after i finished my work, i happened to notice molding in every commercial establishment i walked in and i genuinely believe it looks as professional, if not better, than the pros.some highlights:1) the photos add alot of detail that can't be provided in just words2) the templates are the BEST things. makes cutting a virtual 'no-brainer' exercise. i actually tried a cut ONCE without using it and made a mistake (time and money in wood) ;-)3) his step-by-steps are wonderful and lack no important detailsome cautions:1) spend the money or borrow a decent compound mitre saw; preferable double compound. it will save you time AND the cuts will be true to form.2) read the instructions carefully; if you don't, you'll waste time and money. during the installation process, i found myself referring to the instructions in the book and it would have been easier if there was a table with an outline of the instruction steps similar to the angle charts. when i got started, i referred to the instructions constantly and it got tedious going back to the text.again, without receiving any $ for this review, the best home-improvement instructional i have used. his intro on the web page talked about spending about 5 times the money on a contractor versus doing it yourself. this time, the adverstisement delivered. i spent about $100 on a job quoted to me at $600."},{"Title":"Crown Molding & Trim: Install It Like a Pro!","review":"Based on the reviews I ordered this book only to notice that 14 of the first 19 reviews were written on August 6 thru the 9th.

I am sorry I didn't notice this stacking of the deck before hand because I relied heavily on the reivews to help me decide which crown and trim book was the best.So, BEWARE!!

I purchased this book earlier this year and only recently got around to installing crown molding throughout my house this past week. I have never done any type of carpentry work and let me say I was quite nervous to start this project. My line of work is behind a desk on a computer and not working with power tools other than around the house fix-it stuff. In 3 days I installed almost 400 ft of crown that looks like it was professionally installed. I can't begin to tell you how helpful I found this book to be. My wife is so impressed that she is now trying to think of other projects that that require some sort of molding or trim.With the guidance this book provided, I am extremely proud of a project that I can say I installed on my own.ToddFlorida"},{"Title":"Crown Molding & Trim: Install It Like a Pro!","review":"I almost gave up on using this book because of the unending sales pitch throughout to buy the True Angle tools, and other accessories. What is annoying is that this is a really good book, with clear descriptions, and excellent pictures that help highlight each point the author makes at nearly every step. It is not necessary for him to push his tools; he has a good system that can stand on its own. As for the approach he uses in demonstrating how to measure and cut the molding, it was extremely helpful, in that he breaks it down at a level that doesn't overwhelm the reader. I started with baseboard molding, used the True Angle tool (Yes, I did go down to Home Depot and purchased one.) It worked perfectly in that each step can be verified via the pictures and hints that are throughout the book. This has proven to be a valuable approach for me, which has saved me both time and money. I recommend this book if you've never installed molding, it has everything you need, just ignore the sales pitch. I also recommend the True Angle tool, however you don't need to buy the full set, one will work."},{"Title":"Crown Molding & Trim: Install It Like a Pro!","review":"I purchased this book through Amazon and the picture quality is terrible just as others have said.

Particularly the chapter on cathedral ceilings....I wasn't able to find any other books that addressed this problem but this book does an excellent job of it. I don't have cathedral ceilings in my home but the ceilings in my stairways are exactly the same situation so it is useful to me.

What once seemed like a daunting task actually turned out to be a fun, simple, and manageable project thanks to the book, charts, and tools; it really is as easy as 1, 2, 3...(1) measure the angle, (2) set your miter, and (3) make the cut! Worth every penny and then some!

This book is easy to use and understand, with many pictures showing exactly how to place your molding in the saw, and the angles you need to use to get a perfect joint. My upstairs crown molding project would have been IMPOSSIBLE without the use of this book. My ceilings upstairs were coffered, and went from 8' to 9' on several different slopes. Crown molding on a flat ceiling is one thing. Crown molding on different ceiling heights is something altogether different! I can truthfully state that I could not have done the upstairs without Wayne's book. I believe that this book is a must for anyone who wants to install their own crown molding. It makes a great reference book for anyone's library."},{"Title":"Crown Molding & Trim: Install It Like a Pro!","review":"I originally ordered this book from Amazon however our illustrious USPS lost the package. I did however go to Lowe's a pay full price for it. Boy was I disappointed. I also purchased their recommended angle measurement tools. I and my son took the angle measurements in the room and checked each other. We were extremely careful and took the measurements until we agreed with each other. The tools aren't quite as easy to use as the book implies. After drawing out the room and following all steps outlined in the book, we cut our crown molding and installed it. It looks terrible. The corners DID NOT fit like the book says they will and yes, I got the lefts on the left and the rights on the right. I basically wasted $75 in books and tools together with about $100 in Crown. I am going to take it down and start over using the flush end/fit end method (which I have used successfully before but thought the method in the book would be better) utilizing my coping saw. I recommend that you do not use this book but instead search on the net and find an article telling you how to hang crown with the use of a miter saw, a coping saw, and a half round file."},{"Title":"Crown Molding & Trim: Install It Like a Pro!","review":"the book cobers the subject well and explains how to do difficult molding but it only works if you buy a set of expensive angle measuring tools that they also sell.

We all know we should love the cross and love to know nothing &quot;save Jesus Christ, and him crucified&quot; but I personally struggle to grasp the fullness of the cross. And I mourn that the crucifixion story bores me too much of the time. And so I was thrilled to receive a new revelation of the work of the cross in the life of the believer through this book. (It got me preaching the cross to my wife and just about anybody else I could get to listen. :)) So, if you desire a new look at the cross then I urge you to read this book.

This book drew me in from the get-go. Clark's characters are as real as the guy living next door to you. And when they talk, you can't help but listen. Just a good read, and you don't have to be interested in war novels to enjoy this kind of writing. Good stuff. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Flowers of the Dinh Ba Forest","review":"This is a fresh novel that keeps getting better as it goes along. The beginning seems a little familiar (I guess I've read too many Vietnam novels) but then you suddenly notice you're hooked. We get to see the war from very personal but complex points of view. There are good and bad and innocent on both sides, and we can figure that out for ourselves as we travel on the strange road to find orchids. A little bit of mania (how can anyone have any outside interests in the middle of battle?) makes the novel move with confidence and friendship.The people in this novel are convincing and sometimes annoying and it's hard not to worry about them as we see how their fates keep driving forward. There's a real momentum here, based on what we want to see happen to these people--we want the good ones to live; we want the orchid to be found. We want everyone safe and we want the horror to be gone. This book feels real."},{"Title":"Flowers of the Dinh Ba Forest","review":"Flowers of the Dinh Ba Forest was a great read, I can't wait to see what Clark puts out next!

Ms. Ayres reviews every aspect of making a monotype from the tools, the ink or paint, and the process of transferring the image. All the printmaking terms used when describing this art are expertly explained and illustrated. It is clearly not a medium restricted to artists familiar with printmaking. The work of many artists are presented along with the ingenuity they have used to transfer their work. A very valuable resource book both for the artist and those wishing to learn more about this art form."},{"Title":"Monotype: Mediums and Methods for Painterly Printmaking (Practical Art Books)","review":"There seems to be very limited information available on the technique of monotype. This book fills that void by demonstrating the incredible variety of effects possible using the monotype method. There are no projects, per se, rather it teaches techniques that help you create your own masterpieces. Many pieces of example artwork are found throughout the book.A monotype is a one-of-a-kind print made by transferring a painted image to paper. The book starts out with an introduction to materials including plates, mediums, solvents, panting tools and paper as well as hand and press transfer equipment. It also covers studio safety and finding workshop facilities.Techniques are next including working into a light or dark field and both hand and press transfer.These include step-by-step instructions accompanied by demonstration photos. Working in specific mediums including watercolor, acrylics, water-soluble writing instruments, monoprint paints (Createx), oil paints, water-based oils and alkyds follows. A section discussing special oil-based printing inks for lithography, etching, printing and serigraphy is also here. There is even a chapter on special techniques including using masks &amp; stencils, embossing and creating collages.The final chapter gives an overview of monoprints, which combine monotype with other print making processes, and mixed-media monotypes. This includes intaglio, drypoint and engraving, as well as linocut and collagraphic monoprints.There is a nice list of suppliers as well as interesting biographical notes on the artists featured in the back. This is a great book that displays the great diversity in mediums and results available with monotype."},{"Title":"Monotype: Mediums and Methods for Painterly Printmaking (Practical Art Books)","review":"I agree with the previous reviews - if you're creating monoprints, and particularly if you're looking for non-toxic methods, this is a great book. It's full color with many inspiring illustrations, and full of useful, practical information written in a friendly, down-to-earth manner.Re. recommended paints: I recently had the pleasure of taking a monoprinting class with Julia Ayres and her daughter Gail Ayres (at the Art Methods & Materials Show in Pasadena, CA, Oct 2004). The Ayres now recommend using the new Akua-Kolor waterbased inks by Rostow & Jung (www.waterbasedinks.com) which I assume were not invented at the time this book was originally printed. The advantage is that these inks are non-toxic, clean up easily, and they stay moist for days. You then print to DRY printmaking paper, and the inks dry instantly once they hit the paper. Now you don't have to worry about the inks drying on the plate, or handling fragile, wet paper. (I shoved my Createx paints in a bottom drawer after the workshop!)(If you get the opportunity, take a class with the Ayres if you're just getting started, as there's nothing quite like seeing the process in action and the book will make even more sense! They also teach using the PinPress Roller for making monoprints by hand; very useful if you don't have access to an expensive printing press.)"},{"Title":"Monotype: Mediums and Methods for Painterly Printmaking (Practical Art Books)","review":"I'm so glad I bought this book.

Charles W. Read","review":"Charles W. Read was an inept student, he graduated last in his class at Annapolis in 1860 just before he re-signed his commission in the US Navy. What he showed (just like US Grant and a lot of other military minds) was that some people do best by doing, not studying. Having lost his steam ram in a battle on the Mississippi River near Vicksburg. He is called to work on a \\"Raider\\" out of Mobile Bay.Once on the open ocean \\"Florida\\" sailed into the Caribbean where they attacked Union commerce and merchant marine. Taking a captured ship \\"Tacony\\" with one howitzer and some fake (Quaker) wood guns, Read proceeds to damage over twenty ships on his way up to Portland Maine where they are caught but only after they steal a US Revenue Cutter and blow it up. The story is a lot like that of the \\"Shenandoah\\" which had two books about it published in 2005; more interesting from an historical point of view but not that thrilling. (How exciting can it be to read about the capture and burning of fishing Schooners?)"},{"Title":"Sea Wolf of the Confederacy: The Daring Civil War Raids of Naval Lt. Charles W. Read","review":"Although a life-long Civil War buff I had never heard of this attempt by a young Confederate Naval officer to take the war to the seas off New England. Lt. Charles A. Read had previously served on the ironclad \\"Arkansas\\" and the commerce raider \\"Florida\\" and had seen a lot of hard fighting - which he seemed to relish. In February, of 1863, the \\"Florida\\" captured a Union merchant vessel and Read was given permission to take over and convert this captured ship into another commerce raider. Read promptly sailed to the North and with only one small cannon on board began to wreak havoc on the New England fishing industry. The Northern states then began beseeching Washington for more protection - threatening to divert resources from the bloackade of Southern ports. Shipping insurance rates started rising, too.Shaw skillfully interweaves the two sides of the story - the motives and actions of the protagonist, Read, and his antagonist, Union Secretary of Navy Gideon Welles. The author may have a Northern bias but it does not ruin the story. There are many good accounts of Civil War naval actions - we can add this one to the list."},{"Title":"The Things I Wish I'd Said","review":"The Things I Wish I'd Said was an enjoyable, insightful read. The perfect book for the bedside table. Each chapter revisited a theme ten years later. Perspectives change with age. Michele's refreshing candor covered the gamut."},{"Title":"The Things I Wish I'd Said","review":"This book surprised me. It was recommended by a friend and since I liked the cover, I gave it a shot. What a delight! It's one of those collections that you want to keep next to your bed, or at the table, or while you're waiting in the school parking lot for your kids.This is a moody collection of newspaper columns that read quickly. She writes about everything from gardening and home improvement projects to what it's like to have phone solicitors interrupt dinner. And while the author claims her columns weren't \\"too political\\" there's a chapter called \\"Not Too Political\\" where she confronts issues of war, gender equality, sexual harassment and celebrities as role models. I particularly liked the piece about Michael Jackson where she made the claim in the original column in 1991 that we'd most likely be hearing news of this freakish character for the rest of our lives. How right she was!While not as political (or divisive) as Kingsolver's essays or Quindlen's columns, I was reminded of both while I read. But the columnist who came to mind most was a favorite, the late Erma Bombeck. Michele Cozzens clearly has both warmth and wit and is a fine, fine writer. I recommend this book to both men and women-especially baby-boomers who will no doubt have shared many of the experiences of the author."},{"Title":"The Things I Wish I'd Said","review":"I've been reading a lot of memoirs and essay collections lately and this is the first of many where I actually found MYSELF and MY LIFE within the pages. First of all, who can't relate to the notion of what it's like to stay awake all night replaying a certain scene or confrontation where instead of walking away unsatisfied with your response, you walk away in the wake of the perfect comeback line? I can think of hundreds of things I wish I'd said.Michele VanOrt Cozzens has a smooth, conversational writing style and by the end of the book, I felt like I was listening to a friend tell me about her day-or about her family. I especially related to the story about the death of her mother, (my own mother died two years ago), and when she further discusses the death of her 20 year old niece who took the herb ephedra and suffered a fatal heart attack, my own heart nearly broke in two.On a completely different note, I loved the piece entitled \\"Deadhead Withdrawal,\\" where she explains what it was like to be a Grateful Dead groupie in the San Francisco Bay Area and \\"The WASP and Mr. Alger,\\" where she lambastes author Isabelle Allende for a comment she made at a writer's workshop proclaiming that \\"waspy literature is dead.\\"Waspy literature is certainly not dead. And \\"The Things I Wish I'd Said,\\" is a perfect example to prove that statement incorrect. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Things I Wish I'd Said","review":"We've all had our forehead-slapping moments when we come up with the perfect comeback, the wittiest repartee or the sharpest retort way too long after the moment to matter anymore. Unfortunately, we don't usually have the opportunity to go back and right the wrongs, but if you were by chance a newspaper columnist, you could certainly reflect on your earlier pearls of wisdom, reinforcing or shredding as the need arose.Telling it like it was, Michele VanOrt Cozzens reflects on a series of her articles, published back in the days when she was the PG-13 Carrie Bradshaw of Oakland.If you are fortunate enough to have read \\"I'm Living Your Dream Life\\", you're already on the inside track for this book, which touches on a range of topics, from home, family and friends through pets, Elvis, telemarketing, home improvement, beauty pageants, boxing, disc golf, and the Grateful Dead, among others.Running the gamut of emotions, the stories are about real life, and will touch chords of recognition in every reader. Funny, poignant, reflective or sad, it takes you deep down into the soul of the author, and will alternately touch your heart and your funny bone.Amanda Richards, July 13, 2005"},{"Title":"The Things I Wish I'd Said","review":"I am an aspiring writer and I read CONSTANTLY, but I have never felt compelled to write a review for a book online until now.\\"The Things I Wish I'd Said\\" is an incredible read and I can't say enough about it or recommend it high enough.One of the things that you will get from this book if you read it is the fearless honesty of Michele VanOrt Cozzens. There is no subject too taboo or personal to cover. She reveals intimate feelings about life that make you feel like you really do know her. By the time I finished her book I felt like I knew her as a friend.There is a section in the book (titled \\"Wings\\") that is honestly one of the sweetest and most romantic things that I have ever read(and I am a guy). I actually walked around the office, demanding that people read particular sections of the book and brought it home for my girlfriend to read as well.Lest you think that Michele only covers deep or romantic topics, her book also covers a wide range of topics....and it is funny. Very funny.I absolutely urge everyone to read this book. This is the first book by Michele that I have read, but I guarantee that it won't be the last. She has a fan for life."},{"Title":"The Things I Wish I'd Said","review":"This book was one of the most down-to-earth collection of essays I've ever read (and I've been a bookworm all my life). Cozzens effectively moves the reader from her views of life in the 80's to current day, without unnecessary Monday-morning quarterbacking of her younger days. She addresses life's daily events with a light touch and good humor (telemarketers at dinner, home improvement). Just as easily, she brings you through thoughtful reflections on death, loss, and disappointment. The reader is left seeing the strength of a complex person who thrives in a joyous family despite challenges shallow and deep from the rest of the world. I loved it!!!"},{"Title":"The Things I Wish I'd Said","review":"The Things I Wish I'd Said is another winner with me. I could see these stories unfold either because of the imagery that Michele provided or in some cases reflections of my own past experiences.

I also want to thank Michele for another wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Things I Wish I'd Said","review":"I absolutely loved this collection of stories. It hit home on many levels. The author writes about bad haircuts (Just an Inch off the bottom) and baby showers (Baby Showers on the Brain) and had me laughing out loud. Then she turned a corner and wrote about the loss of her pet (Woman's Best Friend) and then the tragic loss of her niece (Playing God and Losing) and an amazingly poignant story about the death of her mother called The Summer of Old. Easy to read and very relatable."},{"Title":"The Things I Wish I'd Said","review":"I had a hard time putting \\"The Things I Wish I'd Said\\" down. It was truly inspirational. I could relate to so many of the stories that made me evalulate my past, relationships, and the value of the things that we take for granted. It reinforced my belief that every day is a gift and we should live it to the fullest. Thank you Michele and congratulations on another successful book!"},{"Title":"The Things I Wish I'd Said","review":"I enjoyed Michele's direct perspective in her original articles and seeing how years later, she adds a personal view on the things she wishes that she said. This book brings the reader into the mind of a young journalist who has now a seasoned career. Offering personal glimpses into the life of the author with sincerity and emotion. I cried at the loss of her mother and I laughed at her witty portrayel of a simple haircut. I encourage others to read this book and the other novels written by Michele Cozzens, she entertains with style!"},{"Title":"The Things I Wish I'd Said","review":"Wow! Michele VanOrt Cozzens is a terrific new writer and her second book, \\"The Things I Wish I'd Said\\" is as wonderful to read as her first one, \\"I'm Living Your Dream Life\\", was. It provides a nostalgic look at many issues that effected me during the second half of the 20th century...baby boomers will love it. Michele has a true gift when it comes to writing. She vividly describes situations and events that are sometimes serious and adds humor into almost every topic. I found myself thinking of Irma Bombeck while reading this book on more than one occasion. Michele's use of metaphors gives the reader an opportunity to form imagery in their own head that only a truly talented author is capable of doing. This book invoked a lot of emotional responses in me. I was drawn to tears several times as I read through it; I also laughed out loud frequently. If you are looking for an entertaining and interesting book that will keep you wanting more then you need to read \\"The Things I Wish I'd Said\\". I can't wait until her next book because both this one and \\"I'm Living Your Dream Life\\", Michele's book about operating a resort, were excellent!"},{"Title":"A Tiger Called Thomas","review":"Diana Cain Bluthenthal's brightly-colored illustrations bring Charlotte Zolotow's A Tiger Called Thomas to life once again--just in time for its 40th anniversary. Charlotte Zolotow's classic is a sad but sweet tale of a shy, preschool-aged boy's move into a new neighborhood-a neighborhood where he's afraid no one will like him.Zolotow's story is more to the point today when so many families are on the move, than when it was first published in 1963. Today's children seldom grow up in the neighborhoods where they were born. Today's children often find themselves in Thomas's situation--trying to fit in, trying to find acceptance in their new, unfamiliar worlds. And the shy ones feel Thomas's pain. They too, are afraid no one will like them.Bluthenthal opens the book with a 2-page spread showing a forlorn Thomas sitting on the moving van's ramp. Chin in hand, Thomas sadly stares at his sneakers while his little goldfish stares up at him. The tag marked \\"fragile\\" seems to describe Thomas, not just the fishbowl for his best buddy in the world.When you read A Tiger Called Thomas to the little ones at Story Time, you can see some of the kids nodding their heads in agreement with Thomas's refrains of, \\"Maybe she wouldn't like me...\\" or, \\"They might not like me...\\" or, \\"I don't think he'd like me.\\" You get the feeling that those youngsters know what it's like to walk in Thomas's sneakers--and that they themselves haven't discovered yet what Thomas himself discovers by the end of his Trick or Treat night.As you continue reading though, you'll see the smiles that light their small, shy faces as you reach the end of the story, when they, as well as Thomas, discover that their loneliness can easily be banished. It's a wonderful feeling for you as well as for them.This book isn't just for the little ones at your library, nursery school, or day care. If you have your own Thomas or Thomasina, it's a wonderfully non-threatening way to approach your youngster's shyness. (You might also be interested in getting a copy of Bernardo J. Carducci's new book, The Shyness Breakthrough: A No-Stress Plan to Help Your Shy Child Warm Up, Open Up, and Join the Fun.)I have to admit I'm a dyed-in-the-wool fan of Diana Cain Bluthenthal. I'm firmly convinced that ANY book written or illustrated by her is a delight to read. She has a gentleness, a kindness, a playfulness of spirit that always shows. Her books bring smiles of pleasure to those who read, or listen to, them. A Tiger Called Thomas is no different.Don't save this book just for Halloween. Whip it out whenever you see kids in need of its gentle story--a story that may give them the courage to overcome their shyness. Read it to them with a smile and a hug. You'll all be glad you did.And don't forget to grab Meaner Than Meanest--a funny Halloween story by Kevin Somers & Diana Cain Bluthenthal."},{"Title":"A Tiger Called Thomas","review":"Yes, I thought this book was OK but my five-year-old really liked it and asked me to read it over and over again.

I loved introducing her to Halloween from a book that emphasized friendship and generosity among neighbors, rather than scary monsters, pranks, or candy. The illustrations were lovely. I'm sure the original edition had beautiful illustrations too, and the previous reviewer might have been chagrinned by the changes to a personal childhood favorite.

Absolutely stunning!"},{"Title":"The Bachelor Machine","review":"The truth about science fiction, like stories about [physical activity], is that it is not what it seems: it is rarely science or fiction. M. Christian's work in 'The Bachelor Machine' recognizes this from the first page, taking erotica through some very familiar moves in an environment that all at once is both highly creative yet strikingly familiar (Haven't I dreamed here before? Isn't this a far corner of my mind?). The end result is a collection of fiction that will arouse even the most jaded sci-fi ... devotee and leave you wondering about the next few strangers you encounter (They seem so human, yet I can't help thinking...).Get it, read it, and, if you're really adventurous, go out and live a little sci-fi of your own."},{"Title":"The Bachelor Machine","review":"The scenes in these stories lingered in my thoughts long after I put the book down.

If I were forced at gunpoint to try and label it, I'd call it cyberpunk with sex in. M. Christian manages to create rich, dark worlds which, while not always arousing, all pay tribute to the fact that sex is an essential drive for all of us. Ranging from the merely slightly futuristic to the truly bizarre, his stories force you to question who is the user, and who the used, and what does everyone get out of the wild, wired and fantastic sex depicted in his stories. Don't expect a bedtime story that will ensure sweet, lustful dreams. But definitely expect stories that you'll meet again in your dreams in ways you didn't imagine."},{"Title":"The Bachelor Machine","review":"This is a collection of some computer geek's wet dreams.

Christian, though, seems to be one of the gifted ones. I don't read erotica, as a general rule, but because this book was featured at my favorite SF store, I picked it up. A quick perusal of a few pages convinced me I had to read more. It's one of the very best books I've read in months -- he creates fantastic worlds that are simultaneously believeable and other-worldly. Some of the stories were indeed very erotic but the eroticism sort of crept up on me, which intensified both the story and the sex. Very, very well written.

What it had that the current edition has much less of was an exhaustive collection of allusions to classical literature and mythology. This made it indispensable if you were reading 19th Century literature (or earlier), where allusions to these texts were not only more common, but went unexplained because contemporaneous readers didn't need the explanation. The current edition has cut much of this - admittedly obscure - material, presumably to make room for items of more contemporary appeal. &quot;Brewer&quot; was at least as much fun to &quot;dip into&quot; with nothing in particular to track down as it was for reference use.

I know a lot of people, once they get out of school, have like $30,000 in credit debt.\\"Ary also covers the necessity of waiting in line overnight to secure premium parking permits, the lure of high-stakes gambling, roommate culture clashes, \\"hooking up\\" and the relationship between classroom seat selection and grades, among other topics. He discusses it all in frank language.Ary, 25, graduated with a degree in broadcast journalism in 2002, which, based on the experiences described in the book, was a feat unto itself. He didn't exactly start off as a model student.He set the tone early for his first few years at college. It happened to be raining during the first two days of classes in 1997, so he never left his dorm room at Palo Verde East. Instead, he passed the time playing video games.In one of the most poignant passages, he describes arriving at his parents' house in Phoenix after his second beer-clouded year at ASU.\\"I noticed both my parents were in tears like a family member had just passed. Frantically, I asked what was going on. In my father's right hand was a letter explaining I, their youngest son, was \`disqualified' from school. The music screeched to a halt. The proverbial house lights were abruptly turned on. The big party was over. My sophomore year, I was kicked out of college,\\" he wrote.He enrolled in summer school and focused on his grades for the first time. A year later, he applied to the journalism program. Again, a letter was waiting at his parents' house.\\"I took a deep breath, slid my finger underneath the opening and skimmed the first paragraph of the letter until I came to \`Congratulations. You have been acce...' I didn't even read the rest. Immediately, I threw my hand up in the air, stomped my feet and did the holy ghost dance like I was in a Baptist church on a warm Sunday afternoon.\\"Ary wrote the book mostly during his final two years at ASU, though it omits his senior year and his seemingly impossible graduation. Those will be the topics of a sequel, he said.The original, which is ridiculously funny, depressing and revealing, is available at warningcollege.com."},{"Title":"In defence of my country","review":"Author Jedrzej Giertych, the father of scientist Maciej Giertych and grandfather of politician Roman Giertych, has written a powerful rebuttal to many inaccurate portrayals of Polish history. But he is no blind apologist. For example, he is critical of the way that the pre-WWII Polish government had handled the Ukrainian nationalist movement (p. 398).We hear a great deal about past Polish antisemitism but seldom about the conditions that had set Poles and Jews against each other. Contrary to the stereotype of Poland as a land of pogroms, Giertych points out that antisemitic violence in Russian-ruled Poland was actually of Russian origin. After the assassination of Czar Alexander II in 1891, the Russian government had encouraged and organized anti-Jewish riots (p. 268).In Holocaust materials, history is commonly forced to run backwards and the prewar Jewish experience in Poland is inaccurately portrayed as a forerunner of that under Nazi German-conquered Europe. Giertych soundly rebuts this tendency. His book recounts how Poland had for many centuries been a land of tolerance, where anyone could freely practice his faith as long as loyalty to the state was exhibited. Giertych then shows that Polish opposition to Jews was a relatively recent development, and then of a political and economic nature, generally free of religious prejudice and completely unlike German racial antisemitism. The genocidal extermination of Jews was not even imagined. Roman Dmowski, vilified as an inveterate antisemite for organizing boycotts against Jewish monopolies was, for example, strongly opposed to the desecration of synagogues (p. 268). Giertych sees the Polish-Jewish conflicts as no different from other economically-driven ones (e. g., the Chinese-Malay conflicts in Malaysia, or the Italian-German conflicts in Southern Tyrol).After Poland had lost her independence in 1795, more and more of her Jewish population had shifted their loyalties to Poland's conquerors. The economic development of the region became concentrated among the Jews, who enjoyed the influx of German and Russian capital. Moreover, Jewish owners tended to hire Jewish workers in preference to Polish ones (p. 262). A large fraction of both local and foreign Jews came to prefer the status quo to the resurrection of an independent Poland. For example, the Jews in Prussian-ruled Poland became self-Germanized, and vehemently opposed the rebirth of Poland. The pro-Russian attitudes of eastern Polish Jews were little better. In time, more and more Poles began to see the Jews as a foreign element that was inimical to Polish interests. Other Jewish actions that tended to inflame the Poles included the pro-Russian parliamentary Jewish vote in Warsaw and Lodz (1912), and the numerous anti-Polish statements made by Jewish spokesmen in the west (e. g., Lewis Namier, Baron Rotschild, etc., p. 269) at about the time of WWI.It is inconceivable that the Poles would have allowed themselves to stay a de facto economic minority on their own land. Giertych sees the \\"buy Polish\\" anti-Jewish boycotts organized by Roman Dmowski as a necessary step in the economic liberation of Poland (p. 267). As for the Jews who lost their livelihoods and had to emigrate, one must remember the many Poles who earlier had been forced to emigrate in penury as a result of Jewish economic monopolies. It had become obvious that Poland was too poor to simultaneously support a Jewish and a Polish economic engine. The only question was who would be forced to emigrate? Giertych cites Zionist leader Alfred Nossig, who suggested in 1919 that both Poles and Jews should work together for the emigration of half of Poland's Jews (p. 280). Giertych also quotes from Zionist leader Vladimir Jabotinsky, who rejected the notion that Poles had an antisemitic spirit in the usual sense of the word, and who recognized that Polish national and economic self-interest, even when directed against Jews, was really no different from a parent's preference for her own children over that of another's offspring (p. 263).Giertych also addresses the cultural divide that had developed between Poles and Jews. A large fraction of Jews, including Polonized ones, were atheists. The forces of libertinism and what otherwise is called today the \\"permissive society\\" were disproportionately Jewish. In the mostly traditionalist Catholic Polish society, these tendencies stood out prominently, evoking a negative reaction from most Poles. Giertych rejects the notion that this attitude had been a form of antisemitism. Instead, Giertych sees this as a defense of the Polish national spirit. He furthermore insists that the negative Polish reaction would have been the same had the promoters of libertinism been mostly ethnic Poles.Giertych also tackles German revisionists, notably Austin App and Alfred de Zayas. Austin App has recycled some Nazi-era propaganda that had tried to steal Mikolaj Kopernik (Nicolaus Copernicus) from the Poles and to recast him as a German scientist. In actuality, Copernicus was ethnically Polish on his father's side, and of mixed Polish-German ancestry on his mother's side. Copernicus, like his immediate forebears and descendants, was solidly Polish linguistically, culturally, and politically. Even the name Kopernik is clearly of Polish, not German, origin. And, although it has long been refuted, Alfred de Zayas has repeated the canard that some two million Germans had perished during the expulsions of Germans from the lands awarded to Poland after WWII. Giertych shows that, among other flaws, the two million figure is solely an armchair invention resting on dubious inferences from questionable population statistics. In rebuttal to the \\"Silesia is eternally German\\" notions, Giertych shows from church figures that large parts of Upper Silesia (and environs) had been substantially Polish, resisting the pressures of Germanization well into the 19th century. However, in an apparent effort to avoid engaging in Orwellian doublethink, Giertych rejects the argument that Silesia was owed Poland because it had once been substantially Polish. Otherwise, Indians could claim that the Americas belong to them, and must be henceforth returned. Instead, Giertych sees the Polish repossession of Silesia and environs solely as the outcome of the events and treaties of WWII."},{"Title":"In defence of my country","review":"Author Jedrzej Giertych, the father of scientist Maciej Giertych and grandfather of politician Roman Giertych, has written a powerful rebuttal to many inaccurate portrayals of Polish history.

For many of us who have been practicing for decades, this was one of the first books we may have read.It contains a collection of both interesting stories and pieces of information for students of martial arts that detail physical training regimens as well as martial philosophy and history. It is not a &quot;how to&quot; book but rahter an introduction to martial arts training in general.

While a little eccentric, Urban was true to the bushido roots, while adapting karate for an American population.This book covers karate philosophy in its mid-twentieth century form and promotes the positive aspects of discipline and etiquette. The book deals with attitude and motivation of spirit. The second half of the book has \\"dojo stories\\" that help embody the essences of karate training.This is just a nice and simple book worth the read."},{"Title":"The karate dojo;: Traditions and tales of a martial art","review":"As a ShoDan assistant instructor of Shiho Karano Kenpo Karate, I strive to educate myself about the martial arts. I've found some good books on the subject, and I'm always on the lookout for more. Since \\"The Karate Dojo\\" has been in print since 1967, I figured it must provide valuable direction. It does, mainly by portraying a snapshot of martial arts history that challenges the budo practitioner to forsake mediocrity for mastery and character.The book has three basic parts. First, the author provides a somewhat Karate-centric view of martial arts facets such as the dojo, belt ranking systems, and character self-analysis. In the second section are a number of martial arts parables that teach through historical narrative. Finally, Sensei Urban uses the last chapter to discuss the \\"contemporary\\" Karate scene (i.e. the mid-1960s). The overall theme is one of extreme discipline and perseverance within the martial arts, necessary to achieve a seemingly mystical level of physical, mental, moral, and spiritual ability. In other words, it takes hard work and commitment to become a \\"weaponless weapon.\\"\\"The Karate Dojo\\" is a quick read - I finished it in less than a day. There are a number of stylized line drawings and black-and-white photographs to complement the text. It's a portrait of an era in Karate that seems to be almost mythical - and mostly lost, at least in the West. The author fondly discusses harsh daily training under the strict discipline of a revered master in a dojo where everyone's practically family. I've tasted some of that, but nothing close to what Sensei Urban describes. And that's where I differed with the author. Yes, optimal mastery of any activity requires the type of commitment he advocates, and that's OK for some. But I believe it's possible to benefit from a consistent and disciplined practice of the martial arts without making an all-consuming religion out of it.At any rate, despite some dated aspects and a monkish focus on martial arts that may be beyond what many would bear, \\"The Karate Dojo\\" contains worthwhile insights for the martial artist. If nothing else, its high standards may challenge one to take their current commitment and practice to a higher level."},{"Title":"The karate dojo;: Traditions and tales of a martial art","review":"The author's name is synonymous with the Goju style of Karate.The volume covers the dojo etiquette, the system of belts,kata and jiu-kumite. The Goju style has a progressive series ofbelts from white to green to green/stripes to purple to brownto brown/stripes and finally to the first level black belt.Incremental knowledge of the katas combined with excellence ofexecution are important distinguishing factors between thevarious belts. At the higher levels, candidates must havesome formal teaching together with entries into various competitions sponsored by local, national and internationalassociations in the art. Contestants have a separate karateetiquette to be displayed before the judges and their fellowcolleagues.Master Peter Urban shows the all-importantconnection between excellence of execution of the kata andtransferal of those skills to the formal jiu-kumite. The bookcontains a series of stories related by the author. These storiesform an integral part of the book. Mastery of the art requirescontinuous practice and study on the part of candidates.The skills learned in Goju Karate can be transferred into lifepractices and habits.

This book is a must for all serious students."},{"Title":"The karate dojo;: Traditions and tales of a martial art","review":"Having discovered the Urban legacy only recently, through my sensei, I thoroughly enjoyed the trip through the maestro's mind that this book represents. Between this and 'karate psychology' (aka 'Karate sensei')we are given passage into a brilliant martial arts masters mindset. Urban wasn't just a groundbreaking sensei in terms of his being first to connect martial arts with the 'new world', but he was a fascinating thinker, in whatever he might have done. This aspect of his brilliance becomes clear in-between the pages, not so much as in the content but the eclectic style he writes with. The patchwork, almost mad-magazine throw it on the wall and see if it sticks style lets us see the way he makes connections between things and the ride is a most worthwhile one. The man clearly would have stood out in some way no matter what he did in life. The fact that he became who he was just delineates a rare example of the perfect person finding their perfect calling perfectly.As a (goju) martial artist, AND psychology enthusiast, I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The karate dojo;: Traditions and tales of a martial art","review":"The book is a nice read, it has an enjoyable read and some curiosities.

The book's title is spot on and really sums it up in a nutshell: \\"Traditions and Tales of a martial art.\\" Again, this is NOT an instructional or how-to book, but more akin to a writer's (martial artist's) journal or diary.

The books are Katie John (1960), Depend on Katie John (1961), Honestly, Katie John! (1963), and Katie John and Heathcliff (1980).This first book begins shortly after Great-Aunt Emily dies, leaving her large and rambling old house to Katie John's parents. When the Tucker family moves from California to Missouri to see about fixing up and selling the house, ten-year-old Katie John is not at all enthused, but consoles herself that the change is only temporary. As she makes friends with neighbor Sue however, and the two girls explore the house and surrounding countryside together, Katie John's feelings gradually begin to change.She dreams up a plan to save the house and keep it in the family. Set on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River, author Mary Calhoun evokes a strong sense of place in this story. The dedication to the book suggests that the setting for this story was based on Mary Calhoun's actual childhood home. Pictures by Paul Frame make the story come alive.Katie John is a lively and spirited heroine, whose impulsive nature is constantly causing her to get into scrapes.

They summarize the conflict in six easy chapters - one for each year on the fighting in Europe, plus one on the fighting in the \\"peripheries\\" - and they have an introduction and conclusion that covers the origins of the war and its aftermath. Prior and Wilson make no secret of their views on the war; they are unabashed \\"Westerners\\" with a healthy contempt for most of the political and military leadership involved, a judgment that emerges repeatedly when assessing the outcome of battles and the results of strategic decisions.Despite their approach, the authors do a good job of presenting the war. Well illustrated, the text is accompanied by a number of computer-generated maps of the various fronts and battlefields, and there is a section at the end with brief biographies of the leading military and civilian commanders of the conflict. Readers familiar with the war would do better to consult some of the books listed in the bibliography at the end, but for anyone seeking an introduction to the war this is a good book to start with."},{"Title":"The First World War (History of Warfare)","review":"This is another volume in Cassell's History of Warfare series, which combines a general history of each topic with lots of maps and photos. This addition to the series deals mostly with events on the West Front, although some *brief* coverage is offered for Gallipoli, Mesopotamia, Russia, Austria and Italy. In focusing on the West Front, the authors lavish the most attention on British and Commonwealth forces. Do not expect to find much on the naval or air forces involved.The book begins with a short analysis on the causes of the war. The authors place most of the blame squarely on the Kaiser and Moltke and seem to go out of their way to discount AJP Taylor's thesis that the Great Powers stumbled into war. They are probably correct in their analysis, but I'm not sure such an academic debate belongs in a general history such as this.The next several chapters deal with the chronological events of the war, year by year, with one chapter reserved for events on the peripherpal theaters.The book concludes with a decent summary of the Treaty of Versailles and how it led to World War II.All in all, I'd recommend the book to those looking for a general introduction to the land campaigns of World War I on the Western Front. While the maps are a tad busy, the photographs are well selected to enhance the text."},{"Title":"The First World War (History of Warfare)","review":"As others noted, this book does not dive into a deep analysis. It also doesn't focus on the individual participants; however, I think it occupied a very nice middle ground. It gives and simple yet slightly nuanced year-by-year account of what happened and who the major players were The authors tie the book together by asking, from the prospective of what was accomplished the previous year, what the strategy should be for the following year. I think it would be best to follow this book up another book that fills in the spots not covered by this book. Of course \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" would be a good choice; my next book will be \\"The Pity of War\\" for more detail.I thought this book was very well illustrated, though sometimes the illustrations did not fit as well with the text as I would have liked. My main complaint is that none of the maps have a scale and there is no really comprehensive map to refer to. I found myself continually lost trying to figure out how close or far I was from a previously mentioned action. I would suggest reading this book with a good travel map of Europe."},{"Title":"The First World War (History of Warfare)","review":"I read this to supplement my viewing of the 2004 British ten-part documentaryThe First World War - The Complete Series, which is more about the social and political aspects of the war than a close look at the military engagements. I knew almost nothing about WWI before this. The book begins with a discussion of theories on the cause of the war, but it doesn't lay out the historical background. The first episode of the documentary covers this. I recommend the documentary, and won't say more about it here.The book has interesting pictures, a six page chronology, thirty biographical summaries, a four page essay on further reading, and twenty-five colored maps which show the major movements in the battles they depict; but the format of the series of which this book is a part (the Cassell History of Warfare, on my copy) doesn't allow space for the kind of narrative detail that's needed for a wide-ranging grasp of the war. Especially in the accounts of 1914 and 1915, there isn't much context for the battles mentioned, and the battles themselves are described with the briefest of detail. The years 1916-18 are given more attention.Aside from the value of the maps, the chronology, and the short biographies, the book is a condensed overview of the war, which is all that could be expected with the limited space the format of the series allows.Map List -1.

Poison gas was introduced in WW1, as was trench warfare, the bi-plane, and No Man's Land. It was a war of stalemate and attrition. The conclusion of WW1, with the signing of the Versailles Treaty ensured that there would be another, and much more deadly war. In essence, World War 1, called the \\"War to end all Wars\\", was actually the stage-setter for all the wars that came later. World War 1 made the USA into a great power, and it also enabled the Spanish Flu to kill over 20 million people worldwide.All of this, and much, much more is neatly and clearly explained in this fine text by Prior and Wilson.This is the first (and only) book I have read on WW1. I bought it so that I could understand how an assassination started the world at war. I found the book to be clear and concise, something I clearly wanted on a subject that could easily surpass thousands of pages. I liked the many maps which showed nations and their troop positions, battle lines, and battle progress. There are many excellent photos, a very few in color, but these give a visual dimension to the text and add clarity.The six chapters are arranged by year, 1914 - 1918, and there is a good introduction and conclusion as well.I learned a lot from this book, and I have used it as a resource for my children's education.kone"},{"Title":"The First World War (History of Warfare)","review":"I will start off saying I enjoy this series of books and have all of them. Great maps, graphics, and pictures, they are usually consise coverage of the time period or war at hand. However I am suprised that the Smithsonian would give it's imprimatur to a book that pretty much ignores American participation in World War I.Except for a few mentions in passing, American contribution to the war effort is covered in three pages. Pershing isn't even listed in the mini-biographies in the back of the book.If you want to read about the War up to the end of 1917 or about the British contribution to the War I would recommend the book. If you are are interested in the American effort, buy another book."},{"Title":"The First World War (History of Warfare)","review":"This book is great in the technical meaning of the word. The cover is very capturing of the era, the binding is top notch, and the high-gloss pages have the look and feel of a top quality book. That's where the high sticker prices comes from. Other than that, this book wasn't very impressive. I bought this book with the full intent of learning of the political and strategic aspects of World War I, but this book made even WAR boring.I bought this with the full understanding that it wouldn't give me a soldier's perspective of the war. I read Death's Men for that. I wanted to get a big picture of WWI including the military tactics, political mindsets, and the chain of events. Though this book has the chain of events, it is shallow as to the why (military tactics and political mindsets) and the chain of evens are written in such a mechanized prose that it is hard to keep reading. This happened... then this happened... then this happened... then this happened...This book reminds me of the classic history textbook, but it is even less encapsulating than that. This book DOES have a good selection of maps and photographs, but I just couldn't get past the mechanized prose. In some sections, the grammar is poor, which I also abhor. I'm going to force myself through the rest of the book after just 80 pages. After the first 2 chapters, I've already lost interest in WWI, which I didn't think was possible after Death's Men."},{"Title":"The First World War (History of Warfare)","review":"This is war as seen from the Allies side, with hardly any references or researches on the Central Powers. Hardly impartial historical writing. And boring too."},{"Title":"Ninochka: A Novel (Suny Series, the Margins of Literature)","review":"In his 1984 book \\"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\\", Milan Kundera, the most prominent Czech &eacute;migr&eacute; writer, defines the condition of exile as a \\"tight-rope high above the ground without the net afforded a person by the country where he has family, colleagues, and friends, and where he can easily say what he has to say in a language he has known from childhood\\" . Svetlana Boym's novel provides a perfect illustration of this thesis. Her protagonist Tania (Tatiana) happens to share the name of the heroine of Pushkin's novel in verse \\"Eugene Onegin\\" Tatiana Larina, who epitomises the quintessential qualities of Russian identity. Boym's Tania is a contemporary Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; who lives and works in America and travels to Paris to research the activities of the Eurasian circle in Paris in the 1930s, including Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; Nina B. who was fascinated by Greta Garbo's performance in the Hollywood film \\"Ninochka\\". Nina B. had been murdered in the 1930s. Tatiana acts as a historian-detective to resolve the mysterious political circumstances of her death. Yet it would be hard to define this book as a typical suspense novel since it represents a hybrid genre. It contains passages from diaries, e-mails, letters and numerous conversations between Tania and Hungarian and Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;s in Paris. Tatiana also travels to St Petersburg to attend the funeral of her grandmother, a former Gulag prisoner who had taught at secondary school. The narrative provides readers with an exciting opportunity to experience different periods and spaces. To a great extent, Tania represents a typical &eacute;migr&eacute; intellectual whom Joseph Conrad identifies as a divided person split between two shores, a \\"homo duplex\\". Thus, for example, in her conversations with East Europeans in Paris she establishes an imaginary collective identity through performance of Soviet songs and popular jokes of the Soviet period. At the same time, Tania's journey through space begs comparison with classical picaresque novels that put to the fore the theme of spiritual journey and search for self identity. Being born in Lenigrad around 1960, Tatiana returns to her city in the late 1990s to attend her grandmother's funeral. Her trip to the renamed city helps her the re-discovery of her bond with it and she comes to terms with her own identity. Her visit to the Jewish cemetry in St Petersburg, for example, makes her realise she had become estranged from Yiddish language and culture because of the Soviet regime's alienation of many people from their cultural roots as a result of turning them into Soviet citizens, an abstract notion that failed as a binding force in the post-war period. In a laconic but emotionally charged manner, Boym concludes the chapter about the Jewish cemetery thus: \\"I look around at the crowded tombstones. Even after their death this people suffer from the shortage of space. Jewish names, Russified, Polonised, Germanised, float in front of my eyes. I can't see anymore. They are saying Kaddish for my grandmother in a language that I don't understand\\".Like Kundera's novel, Boym's \\"Ninochka\\" is a richly layered text that combines jokes, documents and lively dialogues with political and philosophical overtones. It has numerous allusions to Russian writers and thinkers, including Dostoevsky, Chekhov, Nabokov, Berdiaev, Soloviev, Shestov, Trubetskoy, Savitsky and Gumilev. Boym's novel alerts readers to the importance of memory in the construction of personal and collective selves. It warns of the danger of historical amnesia that resulted, for example, in the emergence of new powerful ideology in post-communist Russia that resurrects an obscure form of the imperial philosophy formulated by the displaced Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;s in Europe in the 1920-30s. The novel convincingly demonstrates that Eurasian ideology is a renewed form of Slavophile ideology ascribing a missionary role to the Russian people. It is difficult to define this novel as postmodernist pastiche, though it is made up from autobiographical, fictional and historical details. It is a totally new and exciting mode of writing that relies heavily on framing and montage. It brings together cinema and literature in order to highlight the boundaries between imaginary and real, fictional and historical, west and east. Its thought-provoking discourse challenges all our preconceptions about imaginary communities and imaginary identities. It constructs a playful space of its own that invites readers to relate to the role of a displaced subject who could adopt the various selves of Ninochka as a fictional cultural construct with an elastic identity that stretches from Greta Garbo to Nina Blank and Ninel' Markovna Bel'skaya. The dead female characters described in the novel prove to be very alive today: their ideas and stories continue to haunt a new generation of displaced Russians in Russia and abroad. Boym's novel is ideally suited for a broad audience: it is stimulating, exciting and entertaining.Reviewed by Dr Alexandra Smith (University of Canterbury)"},{"Title":"Ninochka: A Novel (Suny Series, the Margins of Literature)","review":"Here's one recent novel that I can recommend without reserve, and I know it will appeal to all sorts of readers. Svetlana Boym's first novel Ninochka is a murder mystery in which a contemporary &eacute;migr&eacute;e Tanya Stern, a Ph. D. student in history at Columbia University, attempts to solve the murder of a woman named Nina Belskaya, who went to see the Paris premiere of the film Ninotchka the night before she was murdered late in 1939. Tanya speaks to elderly surviving members of Tanya's circle in Paris, and then her investigation is suddenly rerouted. Tanya's maternal grandmother dies in Leningrad, an event which prompts Tanya to leave Paris and attend her funeral and revisit her natal city for the first time since emigrating. In Russia, she learns of the crossing paths of her grandmother and the dead woman and tries to find out if Nina's murder was a political one prompted by the intrigues of the Stalinist Era.All sorts of readers will find Ninochka hard to put down. First, it is a skillfully handled mystery story about a long unsolved murder, with evocative descriptions of Paris, Leningrad, Moscow, and New York City. Second, it will appeal to readers who are familiar with Ernst Lubitsch's 1939 film Ninotchka and who would enjoy seeing it presented in terms of the life of Russian exiles in Paris in the late 1930s. Third, the novel grants insight into the Eurasian movement of the 1920s-1930s and its revival since 1991. In general, it offers a perceptive view into the period 1991-1994 and the changes in Russian urban life in that period. The increased visibility of the Eurasianist movement with its aggressive nationalistic agenda in the last ten years adds to the novel's topicality.Readers will find many provocative and serious reflections on such issues as exile, nostalgia, bilingualism, paranoia and conspiracy theories. The author, a chaired professor at Harvard University, uses no jargon to present her ideas, and the novel will claim both a general readership and an academic audience. Any one desiring to find a further development of the author's ideas should turn to her earlier non-fiction books, Death in Quotation Marks: Cultural Myths of the Modern Poet (1991), Common Places: Mythologies of Everyday Life in Russia (1994), and, in particular, The Future of Nostalgia (Basic Books 2001). Boym's observations on the political uses of utopian nostalgia are particularly shrewd, her novel will prompt you to read further about the Russian exile community and the new Russia, and the mystery will keep you alert to the end.Peter G.

Melanchton: The Quiet Reformer was written in 1958, the year before I was born. This paperback is released in 2009.Manshcreck's biography reads like a novel. It maintained my interest throughout. It deals with the controversies Melancthon dealt with and showed him as human but also that he was stronger in character than some believe. For example, he points out some say he was so much a humanist he was at odds with Luther while others say he was Luther's puppet. Manschreck stated it was none of the above.One thing that's interesting is that I consider evangelicalism to be a modern movement. However, Manschreck refers to the Reformation movement as evangelicals throughout the volume.I like reading biographies in hope of finding a kindred spirit, and I sometimes succeed. Melanchthon is an example. He has a heart for education not just of theology but the classics, a desire for unity but an unwillingness to compromise.One more point -- the Reformation was an interesting and dangerous time. There was a consistent threat of war against the evangelicals. Some of the evangelicals (not Melanchthon) brought this on themselves.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Melanchthon, the Quiet Reformer","review":"This book should be read by every Christian of any faith group (Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Protestant), esp.

To realize what an Evangelical and Reformational giant he was (and still is), reflect that Melanchthon wrote the Augsburg Confession, Apology to same, and the treatise On the Power and Primacy of the Papacy. These 3 seminal documents are the very foundation of Lutheranism and are in the Book of Concord, the statements of \\"official\\" confessional Lutheranism from about 1580 that still \\"bind\\" most Lutheran bodies today. Melanchthon also wrote his Loci Communes, a guide to systematic theology that greatly influenced Luther, Calvin, Bucer, and others during the Reformation, and was consulted for nearly a century by both Protestants and Roman Catholics.Melanchthon's role as the founder of Germany's educational system makes him worthy of study, though his religious efforts are what made him most famous then and now, and are the focus of the book.Protestants and Roman Catholics alike will be richly rewarded. They will experience what it was like to be a Christian, layman and theologian, prior to and during the Reformation. They will see how the RCC acted and interacted as well as how the various Protestant groups argued and fought ferociously within themselves and against each other. Not to mention the Turkish threat. And fears of end times and demons. Europe was utterly divided and disharmonious. Sadly, Melanchthon was often collateral damage to the virulent assaults of his enemies, both Lutheran and non-Lutheran!Contents:- Foreward (1 page)- Contents- List of Illustrations (n=22)- Introduction (pgs. 13-18)- 23 Chapters (pgs. 19-318), including:-- 1. Wittenberg's New Professor-- 6. The Loci and the Passional (pgs. 82-91)-- 9. Attack, Tumult, and Gossip-- 12. From Protest... (pgs. 158-172)-- 13. ... to Confession-- 16. Defending the Confession (pgs. 210-219)-- 20. Bigamy!-- 21. The Important Nonessentials (pgs. 277-292)-- 22. The Word, the Holy Spirit, and the Will-- 23. Reformer at Home- Notes (pgs. 319-341)- Index (pgs. 343-350)This is a delight to read, but in its enthusiasm for the man and his times, it also means it sometimes comes across as being non-scholarly. The author has great respect for Melanchthon both as a person and as a Reformer. So this is a most sympathetic work! And a great corrective for the calumny heaped on Melanchthon by so many over the years because they failed to study the man, the times, the issues, and his writings.As the author points out, Melanchthon was a peaceful thinker who engaged others and the world as they were. He was willing to constantly study, review, and revise. He didn't think he or anyone else, including Luther, were right about everything and anything. Though he was eternally firm on the issue of Justification by Faith. And he admitted his changes on issues like the Eucharist and predestination & the will.Manschreck assumes the reader has a decent understanding of the basics of both the issues tied to the Reformation as well as the people and politics of the times. So he doesn't go into great definitional detail about issues like justification, predestination, the will, or Eucharist. And he doesn't give bios of the various Electors, Cardinals, theologians, and Emperor (Charles V) who inhabit the book. He doesn't even do much background on Luther or Luther's own ideas. So you get the most out of this work if you first know something about the Reformation, in general, and the German Lutheran Reformation, in particular.While the author has a decent amount to say about Melanchthon's children and their spouses, he says very little about his wife, Katherine. She is only mentioned on pages 60, 305, 314-315. So we never get any real sense of her presence in his life or how they interacted.Thus overall, I both thoroughly enjoyed the book and wished it was about twice its length in order to more fully cover the man, his ideas, and his times! An Afterward about his future impact on Germany, Lutheranism, and Protestantism would've been a good idea.This is a review of the 1958 hardback, Abingdon Press (Nashville). The book is 350 pages. Large, easy to read print. Many magnificent engravings (which are shown in the \\"List of Illustrations\\"). Sadly, there are NO maps of either Germany or Europe, even though Melanchthon and others are constantly travelling within Germany are around Europe.The biggest failing of the work is the lack of a bibliography. There are end notes at the back, with the index following; however, there is no dedicated bibliography so it is very often hard to find the original citation in the notes for a specific work. And it is hard to tell which sources are in German vs English. The majority appear to be in German.Anyone wanting a bibliography, esp. of English works on Melanchthon, as well as a bibliography of Melanchthon's own works, should consult R. Stupperich's 1960 work, Melanchthon, in German that was published in English by Westminster Press, 1965. Translated by R. Fischer. This is a short work, totally only 175 pages."},{"Title":"Emanuel Law Outlines: Evidence","review":"This book is also great in providing me the ability to understand laws as they were and are written. I am just starting in this arena, but I have a better understanding than I've had in the past...about law."},{"Title":"Emanuel Law Outlines: Evidence","review":"At six-hundred pages, your average overworked law student is not too keen on reading another 40 pages a night, especially with a full slate of classes. That being said, this book contains a \\"Casebook correlation chart,\\" which helps you decide which part of the book to read in the approximate order of your own textbook. It covers: Green Nesson, \\"Evidence\\" (3rd Ed. 2000); Wellborn, \\"Cases & Mat...\\" (1st ed. 2000); Mueller & Kirkpatrick, \\"Evidence Under the Rules\\" (4th Ed. 2000), and Waltz & Park, \\"Evidence\\" (9th Ed. 1999).I would suggest checking this out of your law library instead of buying it and reading the relevant parts of the \\"Capsule Summary\\" (79 pages) if you're pressed for time and you want a nuanced overview of Evidence.The rest of the book is nicely outlined, but way too much information for the average to under-achieving student.

You know what I mean. Lifeless, humorless, numbing commentaries that weave together speculative threads of speculative traditions, sources and texts that have little or nothing to do with the stories at hand and much to do (as these scholars claim) with the supposed selfish, manipulative desires of some deep, dark unknown editor at some deep, dark unknown time. Well, if you do not know what I am talking about, read this commentary and you will get a great introduction to it.I have also read the Word Commentaries on Exodus and Leviticus, and they were much better. Yes, they felt constrained to tip their hats and pay homage to this critical wasteland. But in the end, after laying it out (usually fairly briefly), they aways seemed to say: Ok, enough of this highly speculative nonsense that can't be proved one way or another. Let's dive into the text as we have it.But the author of the Numbers Commentary never goes beyond the critical nonsense with its speculating scholars. After dredging up these questionable claims and dragging the reader through an endless hodge-podge of trying to piece them together, he never stands up, wipes off his hands and says: Ok, enough of this, let's develop the text we have and enjoy it and learn from it.Take Numbers 11, for instance. Reading this author's commentary, you would never know that this is perhaps one of the most humorous, no, funniest chapters (albeit tragi-comedy)chapters in the Bible. Or that the Balaam story set forth the pattern of Satan and the nations plan of evil against God and Israel, which would later be taken up by the prophets, reaching its climax in the Revelation.So I will continue to look for a good commentary on Numbers."},{"Title":"Brokers observe self-insurance dip.

And over all itwaas okay, but I wouldn't be caught reading it again."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"As I have mentioned in other reviews, Jules Verne is an author greatly at the mercy of his translators. Bad translations have cut and mangled Verne's writing, often making his style seem arthritic, his plots disjointed, and his thematic content insipid. Therefore my reviews of Verne's novels usually are concerned with a particular edition of Verne.This is a review of the 1962 Bantam Classic edition of _20,000 Leagues Under the Sea_ (1870). It contains an introduction by Ray Bradbury comparing Captains Nemo and Ahab. (Nemo is mad north-by-northwest, but Ahab is _really_ crazy.) The translation is by Anthony Bonner, which is generally rated as \\"above average\\" by Verne scholars. Bonner does maintain some errors from the older (and much inferior) Mercier Lewis translation. For example, Nemo still says that the steel plates on the _Nautilus_ have a density of .7 to .8 that of water. If this were true, the steel would be lighter than water! What Nemo actually says in the original text is that the specific gravity of the steel plates is 7.8. What a difference a few decimal places can make!But on the balance, the Bonner translation does very well in allowing Verne to exercise his scientific knowledge without cutting or mangling it. The discussion by Professor Aronnax of sea pressure and the type of creature that would have to withstand it, the details of the electrical system of the _Nautilus_, the shipbuilding figures for constructing the submarine, the calculations of the formidable Black Stream... all are detailed and concrete. (Though admittedly, there is electronic information that is withheld from us.) And there are underwater sights such as these:The sun's rays struck the surface at a rather oblique angle, and, refracted by this contact as if passing through a prism, they tinted the edges of rocks, plants, shells and corals with the seven colors of the solar spectrum. It was a marvelous feast for the eyes; colors criss-crossed one another in a veritable kaleidoscope of green, yellow, orange, violet, indigo, and blue-- the entire palette of an enthusiastic colorist! (113)And again, during an undersea funeral near a coral forest:The light [from our lamps] produced a thousand charming effects as it played about these brightly colored branches. I thought I could see these tissuelike cylindrical tubes tremble beneath the wavy motion of the water. Small, fast fish would would dart past like flocks of birds. I was tempted to pick the coral's fresh flowers and delicate tentacles, some of which had just blossomed and others scarcely yet opened. But if my hand drew near these living, sensitive flowers, an alarm would spread throughout the colony. The white blossoms would dart inside their red cases and vanish from sight; the shrub would change into a block of stony bulges. (175)The enigmatic Captain Nemo (sometimes vindictive and villainous, sometimes noble and heroic) promises his three involuntary guests: \\"You will travel through a land of marvels. Your mind will be in a continual state of astonishment and stupefaction. It will be difficult to get bored with the continual spectacle that will pass before your eyes\\" (71). And do you know, the Captain is right. The voyage of the _Nautilus_ is truly a grand adventure-- almost the archtypical extraordinary voyage-- from the undersea hunting party, to the encounter with the giant clam, to the visit to Atlantis, to the battle with the squid, to the use of Nemo's thunderbolts.Some modern readers grumble over the length and detail of Verne's descriptive passages. But remember: Jules Verne wasn't writing for an audience that had seen dozens of underwater movies. His task was to get people who had _never_ seen such a sight \\"to enter a new element\\" (71) and experience it for the very first time. He did this. And if you give Verne half a chance, he will do it again."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"Almost twenty years ago, I took hold of this book and remember reading it in a day (though we all know how memory can trick you). I didn't recall much more of a narrative other than a general knowledge when I took it again, but I remember avidly my childhood experience and feelings which went hand in hand with this book. It was all about mysteries, about adventure, about submerging into the unknown depths on a strange vessel accompanied with a mysterious figure of Captain Nemo. I recall reading, after lengthy search, sequel of this novel, trying to fulfill the urge for finishing of the tale, and being astonished with events on mystery island that summed up the story. Verne was one of my first authors and first guide to the fantastic world of science fiction. Much has changed since those days. In part, I blame it all to growing-up, other parts would be too lengthy to mention. I picked this book again about a month or so, hearing the praise of this translation of Naval institute press, wanting to remember some of the experiences I had as a child. Effect was quite opposite. I was bored to death. And I saw too much. Somehow, when you're innocent in reading, when your voyage through world of books is only at its beginning, world seems much simpler and you take your story for granted. You're easily marveled by plot, by gadgets, by effects, by sheer promise of something unknown that unravels in front of you, failing to notice all of the work that lies somewhere behind. When you loose your virginity, when you spend countless hours studying the mechanism of narration, the idea of fiction and storytelling, those hidden things come before your eyes. And you start to see faults and errors, bad phrases and filler paragraphs, you begin to see colonialism, glorification of science, problems of liberty and equality and rhythm of the text and somehow it all falls apart. Instead of the wondrous book that you remember from childhood, you hold before yourself gigantic block of text without almost any kind of value other than historical one. Reader that exists today, one that grew distant from childhood innocence, keeps noticing the cramped language, keeps comparing Verne to other authors of the period and finding him outmatched, keeps noticing hasty structure with uneven tempo and failing rhythm, keeps noticing typified characterization and obsessiveness about scientific detail which painfully slows narration and cannot avert his gaze from all of that. It existed before, for sure, but being unaware of it, made \\"20 000 leagues under the sea\\" a fond memory. Today, it stands for concept of bad literature. I am aware that many of the Verne's fans out there could debate me on numerous points here but I do not wish to start a debate here. This text talks more about me as a reader than about the book in question, but in a way it is accounting of an experience and personal voyage through concepts of literature. If your views are similar to mine, it is likely that you will also be disappointed with this book. Maybe this should come with a stamp - not suitable for those above 14. And maybe, once again, I'm failing to see something of importance. Maybe another decade or so will shed some more light on it. Oh and, by the way, edition and translation is great."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"This book looks very nice, it is great to have the whole map on the cover so you can actually follow the travels.

The men are taken prisoners of the strange creature and have to find a way to escape! Jule Verne was a great author born in Naotes, France in 1828.

The author was very good at detail and I was able to see what the author was talking about in all of the different parts of the oceans, and the ship, which they worked and slept, and ate in.

But the sea creature turns out to be a submarine, the Nautilus, and they're joined by the harpooner Ned Land in being rescued/captured by its crew when their attack on it fails.I definitely encountered this book far too late to fully enjoy it. Like when I tried re-reading Tolkein a couple of years ago, I found I lacked the patience to read through pages and pages of interminable description. There were several times when I just couldn't stand it any longer and I'd put the book down and go do something else. Only sheer stubbornness made me finish it.The story itself was interesting, though the style of the times was a bit of an obstacle. The enigmatic Captain Nemo is never fully explained, nor are the professor and his two companions. It's left up to the reader to fill in the blanks. The professor's unconcern about his imprisonment on the submarine is partially explained by his fascination with the undersea worlds he encounters; the complacence of his assistant and Ned Land are less understandable. Ned Land does try to escape occasionally, but he's portrayed as narrow-mindedly violent because of that, which I found peculiar.I do see why films were made from this--condensing those descriptive passages into scenery would make the action and adventure parts of the story stand out more. I've never seen one, but I'm thinking of adding one to the Netflix queue. Any suggestions of which version to try?In short, I'm giving this 4 stars for the story, but 2 stars for the pain of reading it."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"Unfortunately, \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\" shows its age. While the story is, actually, quite good, the language is somewhat stilted and the book takes a while to really get going. I think many young readers will be puzzled by the vocabulary and will be bored. Eventually, the story picks up. However, I was bored in the 1950's and cannot imagine that today's youngsters will do much better. I think that the Walt Disney movie is a much better bet if you want to expose your child to a story that was a true classic.

This is the second time I have read it and I found it better now then when I was a kid."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"Submarines as we know them didn't exist in 1869. But Jules Verne had an almost eerily prophetic knack for knowing what technology would be used in the future -- and he put it to work in \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea,\\" a slow-moving adventure tale with plenty of proto-steampunk and almost fantastical undersea life.Ships in the middle of the ocean are suddenly seeing -- and being attacked by -- \\"a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.\\"Eventually the US government sends out a ship to capture the object, and during a sea battle Professor Aronnax, his manservant Conseil and harpooner Ned Land go overboard. Soon they're picked up by the Nautilus, the vast submarine that has been causing all this trouble, and introduced to Captain Nemo -- an intelligent, charismatic man who belongs to no nation.Aronnax becomes fascinated by Nemo, his ship and his library -- as well as the amazing underwater adventures that Nemo introduces them to, like pearl-hunting and fighting a giant squid. But the captain's free, lawless life has its dark side, and the three men begin to realize that they must get away from the Nautilus no matter what.It's actually rather amazing that Jules Verne not only dreamed up the idea of a semi-modern submarine long before they existed, but thought out the applications, the stealth, and the vast size. And since nothing like the Nautilus existed at the time, there's a slightly fantastical, steampunk flavor to \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\\"And as usual, Verne painstakingly studies everything about his imagined world, filling it with science (although he obviously didn't know about water/air pressure) and lovely descriptions of the Nautilus and the eerie underwater world (giant oysters, forests, Atlantis). The only flaw is that he tends to ramble on about exact measurements and travel details; there are boring patches here and there.But Captain Nemo is probably one of Verne's most fascinating characters -- a charismatic, embittered man who is a sort of noble sea pirate. He does some stuff that is totally unacceptable (sinking a random warship), but he also has little spurts of kindness and generosity towards poor and powerless peoples of the world. He's scary but fascinating.Giant submarines, charismatic pirates and an undersea world just waiting to be explored -- \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea\\" is a fascinating sci-fi classic, if you can get past the dull patches."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"This book was an amazing book that I could not put down after I started reading it.

If you are into marine biology you might appreciate the detailed descriptions of undersea creepy crawlies better than me but I still made my way through them.The other descriptions are rich in detail, it's been a while since I saw the movie so Verne's descriptions of the ship were in my mind's eye and I felt like I knew what it was like to be aboard the Nautilus, in the dormant volcano, walking through the ruins of Atlantis.When it comes to the action scenes they are also descriptive but they move quickly as the crew and passengers battle with various sea monsters and go through the wild maelstrom that may, or may not have, destroyed the beautiful, magical Nautilus."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"I want to read it again!

God bless ya."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"The other reviewers have noted how the editors...both experts on Verne and the Victorian era science that guided him.. have gone back to the original French manuscripts, collated them to use the best, most reliable, paragraphs and phrases from each, and annotated the book to reflect on Verne's social, political and technical background as if affects the story.If all this sounds like the book is some kind of dull scholarly treatise, rest assured that the novel as STORY is not harmed, but actually improved by the editors' restorations and fix-ups.My own path to Nemo and the Nautilus was watching the Disney film version when I was 11, then getting the Classic Comics version, and finally going to the available butchered translation. Even that version captivated me, and sent me to the dictionary to decipher some of the hifalutin 19th century phrases.Now, as then, I gloss over the endless catalogues of marine biology classification --- Verne as well as Victorian science fans were captivated by the then new interest in categorizing flora and fauna into genus, species, sub-species, varieties, etc. This stuff can be skipped without losing the story.What interests me is the adventure under the sea, and the way in which these fellows are able to watch the wonders of the deep through the window of a plush 1860s salon. I am also interested in how Verne envisioned the workings of the sub. Interestingly, in 1904, just before his death, he wrote an article for Popular Mechanics in which he updated his thoughts on the future of the submarine, based on the Simon Lake and John Holland boats of that day. He had to explain to readers that he was NOT the inventor of the submarine, as popularly believed.All in all, the editors have done a wonderful service in bringing the real \\"20, 000 Leagues\\" to light. I hope it will attract the interest of many bright and curious young boys and girls of the 21st century when the Sea Wolf and Virginia class subs of the USN have finally equalled the performance of the Nautilus of 1870."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"This is one of the most famous novels by Verne, and justifiedly so. A strange thing is happening in the seas of the world: a gigantic sea monster is terrorizing and sometimes sinking ships. The US government assembles a team of experts and sails around the world to discover the monster and catch it. Among them are two French scientists, Prof. Arronax and his assistant Conseil, and a Canadian harpooner, Ned Land. One day they fall to the sea while chasing the thing, and then are astonished when the monster rescues them. Alas, it turns out it's not a monster, but a machine that can travel under the surface of the waters. That is, a submarine, nonexistent at the time the book was written. So the three men become the prisoners of the enigmatic Captain Nemo and his crew. The \\"Nautilus\\" is a self-supporting device, lavishly decorated and the work of a genius, a strange one. The central question throughout the book remains: Why have Nemo and his people rejected all contact with their fellow human beings? What happened to him and to them to escape the world and become lonely travellers of the underseas? Mystery. During many months, our heroes travel around the globe, and in the way they discover Atlantida, hunt in submerged forests, rescue a pearl-gatherer, rest in a submerged volcano, and fight aborigines and giant squids. Prof. Arronax classifies and describes every creature they encounter, which slows down the reading between adventures.I took one star out of the book because it lacks a central feature of any great work of literary art: character development. To reach the highest literary glory, Verne lacks psychological depth, the exploration of human beings' motivations. I would have loved to know Nemo's story, his reasons for doing what he does. But it doesn't matter much. To read Verne is to come back home, to turn back the time and be a kid again, flying to that moment when one discovers the infinite possibilities of literature, chief among them the chance to live other lives and see the world anew. Verne and his characters have a unique charm, and in this book the fascination od the ocean is added."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"For some reason, a few of Verne's many works have become famous in the English speaking world and have even gained some kind of \\"classic\\" status. Unfortunately, these are in my opinion his more superficial and uninteresting novels. 20000 Leagues Under the Sea is a perfect example.Most people would have heard of the idea through some part of culture - the story of Captain Nemo in his submarine (Verne's alleged prophetic vision) and how one outsider is forced through circumstance to join Nemo and his crew on a host of adventures across the seas. This is fine, and that's what the book is. BUT, unlike many better Verne novels, this is ALL it is. It's an adventure story mixed with a description of the various wonders of the udnerwater world (including Atlantis). Don't get me wrong, Verne is good at describing all these things and it's interesting and certainly makes you think about worlds other than your own.What I love about Verne's works such as the Mysterious Island and the 500 Millions of the Beguma is that this is used as a vehicle for some deeper or more interesting messages. Here, the main \\"deeper\\" message is the study of Nemo as a recluse from society - a kind of conscienscious objector (or even hater of humanity if you will), surrounded by his cold machine-like submarine and the predator-like amoral underwater world. In the hands of most writers, this would be sci-fi schlock and it is only Verne that makes it into a good book - but this should not be the work he is renowned for.This book is actually the 2nd in a trilogy, the 1st being In Search of the Castaways and the 3rd being Mysterious Island and I reckon they get progressively better so read the third one!"},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"This book is about a man who finds an underwater secret boat.

To be frank, I wavered for about 4 minutes on how to rate this book. Was it a 3 or 4? In the end, I chose the 4 star rating. This book had a wonderful story line, the characters, and the setting where also both wonderful. The things that really drug this book down where Verne's consistent descriptions of things that really, in actuality, could have been left out. He goes on and on classifying fish and giving very, very detailed descriptions of the submarine (The Nautilus), the way it worked, and the things on board. I guess I can understand this, I guess Verne was just trying to give a believable and complete description of the things the characters saw on their journeyIf you could, somehow, get an abridged version, I would reccomend it. This book is great and truth be told, it was worth my time reading it. I just think that unless you're a marine biologist or are just, for some reason, very interest in the classification of oceanic plant and animal life, that 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea would be best read, and probally more enjoyable with some of the 'unimportant to the story' detailed descriptions of the above-mentioned things ...in frank, LEFT OUT. Now, this is not to say that you shouldn't read this book, you should. I'm just forewarning the prospective reader that they will find some parts of the book to be 'boring' with VERY in depth classifications and descriptions. On the other hand, the story is one of great splendor and excitement. Try to remain focused on the story line and keep a clear mind that the descriptions are just Verne's way of trying to give the reader the most in-depth and detailed assessment of the voyage. Now, I know that what I have written so far is not a 'review'. I'm just trying to let people know what kind of a read they will be in for, if they so choose to read the book. Now, as for a real 'review' on what happens in this book? ...Nahhh, read it yourself. I will say this, 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea takes you to places,in your mind,betterthan any book I've ever read. You will become attatched to the characters every move and sit in anxiety, with great with anticipation, eager to find out what will happen next in this Sci-Fi classic. So, with all the above information on how the book will lag a bit at times ...I finish with this, Verne's descriptive writting leads many modern day readers into boredom and complaint. If you really open your eyes and embrace Verne's descriptive style, you will learn to enjoy this work, and have an admiration for this classic story and classic storyteller almost unequaled in all of literature. For what it is, 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea couldn't have been written better by anyone, ever. Keep your mind open and don't give up on it.

Outside of the three captives, no other characters were well-developed. I would have liked to have gotten to know Captain Nemo a lot better, and what happened in his past that led him to isolate himself from humanity. Since his character is never developed, Captain Nemo ends up being a one-dimensional character with an inexplicable aversion to civilization. The ending is a big cop-out, where no explanation is given in how the characters arrived where they end up. In addition, since the book was originally written in French, it was difficult to read at some points because the text is not well translated, and reads awkwardly.

This hardcover edition is viewable on \\"LOOK INSIDE!\\" with Amazon. There is also a paperback edition (ISBN 978-1606641880) which was published by Aegypan in 2008. But beware: the \\"LOOK INSIDE!\\" for the paperback edition is actually of another version published in 2007 by BiblioBazaar (which looks like it was typeset on the cheap).Frederick Paul Walter's translation is also available as \\"Amazing Journeys: Five Visionary Classics: \`Journey to the Center of the Earth', \`From the Earth to the Moon', \`Circling the Moon', \`20,000 Leagues Under the Seas', and \`Around the World in 80 Days'\\" (ISBN 978-1438432380 List Price: $34.95) published by Excelsior Editions in 2010. This paperback omnibus edition is viewable on \\"LOOK INSIDE!\\" with Amazon. Note that the stories are printed like a newspaper with two columns to the page and in very small type.William Butcher issued a new translation in 1998 and revised it in 2009 (ISBN 978-0199539277 paperback) published by Oxford University Press with the title \\"Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas\\". This is viewable on \\"LOOK INSIDE!\\" with Amazon.All of the other myriad editions seem to be re-issues or adaptations of the first English translation done in 1872 by Lewis Page Mercer (who cut about 20% of Verne's original text and made hundreds of translation errors).The choice between the translations by Frederick Paul Walter and William Butcher might well come down to a matter of style - rather than accuracy in translation - or a preference for a hardcover over a paperback edition. I own the Naval Institute Press edition. I have only seen the other editions on \\"LOOK INSIDE!\\".Frederick Paul Walter's Evertype hardback edition (ISBN 978-1904808282) is typeset in \\"Fournier MT\\" which gives the text something of a nineteenth century appearance. There are also black-and-white illustrations - as there are in William Butcher's OUP edition (ISBN 978-0199539277) - which are of the period (but not necessarily thereby of great artistic merit). The dustcover of the Evertype edition shows - for some inextricable reason - a modern photograph of a stingray (where a squid, at least, might have had more relevance to the book).If I were just interested in reading the story I would probably buy the OUP edition which - like my copy of OUP's \\"Around the World in Eighty Days\\" (also translated by William Butcher) - could be expected to brown-up within a year or two as it's printed on cheap paper (the same as the Penguins of old). If I were buying it as a gift I would probably be tempted to select the Evertype hardcover translation by Frederick Paul Walters (even though I don't know what quality of paper it's printed on or whether the pages are sewn together in quires or just glued together like a cheap paperback)."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"This is actually my favorite book of all time next to Ivanhoe, To Kill a Mockingbird, The Man in the Iron Mask, and The War of the Worlds. I read this book in fourth grade and absolutely loved it. Now that I'm 3 years older, I appreciate it even more. Though there were some hard words, I loved the dialogue. There is even humor when Professor Aronnax explains how pearls are made and says, &quot;Yes, my boy, oysters can produce many sharks&quot; because he is scared to go shark hunting. Captain Nemo is a mysterious yet interesting character. My favorite parts are when they are at the sunken ship in the Mediterranean Sea, when they fight the giant squid, and when they are at Ceylon. Some of their other travels take them to the lost continent of Atlantis, a tunnel under the Suez Canal, and through the Great Ice Barrier. This is my favorite Jules Verne book, though it has some competition from Around the Moon and Journey to the Center of the Earth. This book is a must-have for science lovers. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves adventure and the ocean. Trust me, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"I thought that the book had one of the best plot lines I've ever seen, reguardless of the fact that there is only slight building up to the climax. The only thing that I didn't think was that good about the book was that about every other page, Jules Verne would go into a paragraph description of the animals. For example, he would say something like: I just saw a tuna. But not the normal tuna, it was yellow-bellied, had dorsal fins that went at a downward angle, etc.\\" Otherwise, I thought it was a great read and well worth the money. I will be purchasing more of Jules Verne's books very soon. I highly suggest for you to read this book. Another thing, if you enjoyed watching the 1954 \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea Film,\\" I highly suggest the book because the movie only gives a small picture of what actually occurred during their submarine venture and the book tells you everything, and the occurrences are just amazing."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"It's a great story, no question.

I'll think twice about getting another free book from this publisher."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea is a brilliantly crafted piece of art. Not only is it a riveting novel with a brilliant plot it is also an accurate prediction of the future. I have never read a book that is so flawlessly combines the disparate worlds of science and story telling. Verne's writing style grabbed me from the get go, yet he never sacrifices any detail. Verne pulls you into another reality and where you never know what is going to happen next. Even in its most technical moments Verne's masterpiece demands your attention. Most people know the gist of the story. Three men are held captive in an extraordinary submarine vessel, the Nautilus, led by the Captain Nemo, a man who has left the human world to live under the sea. If you read the book you will find that there is much more to this story than you originally believed. Verne is also very accurate in predicting how a submarine would work. His Nautilus uses many of the same devices as the real submarines of the future!Five Stars!"},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"In English speaking countries, 20,000 is considered a classic boy's book, but in France, it is considered a work of literature. The two translators of this version have gone back to the original French, and made a new translation. Turns out, the common translation that we are used to is full of mistranslations and ommissions of anti-English sentiments. Frankly, I didn't think the new translation adds that much more to the story, but I really enjoyed the footnotes and annotations. The translators take a boyish glee when they find and error or ommission that, to me, added a bit to the story. I'd recommend this version over the older translation. If you've read this story before, I think you will enjoy the annotations most."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"Jules Verne wrote this book in 1870. It has startling technological references (even in the concept of the submarine) but even more stunning was the Nuclear Reactor on board.I feel that some episodes of Star Trek (the original series) are models on Jules Verne, because behind the backdrop of the technology and adventure, there exists the social evils of slavery, colonialism and nihilism as well as genocide.The story is about Captain Nemo who is epic, driven and something good that is so strongly polar he is actually lead into a path of destruction - and his crew. The story is told through the eyes of Professor Aronnax. The usage of an observant intellectual to explain the dark pathos of a main character was rather popular in that era (think Watson and Holmes).In this instance it is important because Nemo destroys a vessel with all hands and then bows before a picture of his wife and children. The implication is that his family where kidnapped (or killed) as slaves.At anyrate, if you love steampunk culture, Star Trek social complexity, and classical literature you will love 20000 Leagues Under the Sea."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"For some reason, even after reading this book, my brain still translates \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\" to mean 20000 leagues DOWN instead of a DISTANCE. What's wrong with me?Anyway, this book was a treasure. Jules Verne, the grandfather of science fiction, again shows that his is much more than a scientific mind. Verne is a grand storyteller, and this novel is his masterwork.Our heroes, Professor Arronax, his faithful compatriot Conseil, and the salty sailor Ned Land find themselves together in a hunt for a giant, mysterious undersea creature which has been causing havoc among shipping lines as well as towns along the coastline. Setting out to sea on top-of-the-line sailing vessel, the three men and the crew encounter the creature, only to have it sink their ship like so many others. However, as you probably know, this is no creature at all, but the most spectacular vehicle ever created by man. It is the Nautilus, a gigantic submarine, and the proud creation of the enigmatic Captain Nemo.Captain Nemo holds the three as his prisoner. They are instructed that they may never leave the Nautilus, yet will be treated with hospitality and respect by Nemo and his crew. The Captain keeps his word, and treats the Professor and his fellows to all the wonders of the ocean depths. Captain Nemo has made the sea his home, vowing never to return to the distasteful world on land. The Nautilus has everything you would need to live and prosper; infinite supplies of water through its seawater processing machines, and an abundance of exotic seafood dredged up from the deep.Captain Nemo himself is as mystifying and brilliant as his creations. He is one of the greatest villains ever put on paper, and Verne's skill as a storyteller brings him to life. Nemo's motivations are clouded in mystery. I can't stress enough how excellent this character is, and the sly way Verne allows for Nemo's true motivations to remain as unfathomable at the end of the novel as it was at the beginning.The Professor doesn't want to leave the Nautilus. He is enthralled by the sea life and the wonders of Nemo's brilliant submarine. Conseil goes where the Professor goes, and is pleased to assist him in their adventure. Ned feels like a prisoner. He longs to walk on firm ground again, and considers his imprisonment as a violation.The action is blended well alongside the exploration and discovery. This book reads and feels like a grand adventure in ways few books can equal. The language is crisp and clear and so is the humor, which is a unusual for a novel written well over 100 years ago. It flows perfectly in English as a result of a superb translation. If I were to single out one thing I disliked about it, it would be the detailed discussions of sea life in the undersea world. I still found Verne's descriptions of multitudes of ocean species fascinating, but some readers may not. What helps alleviate the (possible) boredom is to remember that readers back in the 1800 had NO TV and few had any way of experiencing the wonders of the sea as Verne describes them.\\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\" can be read by all ages. Most of Verne's books are recommended to younger readers, but there is no indication that they were WRITTEN for the young crowd. You certainly never feel like you're reading a children's book, not by a long shot. Anyone with a sense of wonder and appreciates the fantastic would enjoy the ride. I know I did."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"This is Verne's classic novel about Captain Nemo and his submarine Nautilus. What really fascinated me when reading this story and other Verne novels was not only Verne's contributions to the science fiction genre, but his founding of a whole new genre, one that, as far as I know, he has never been given credit. I think Verne was one of the first to write the techno-novel, a work that is filled with technical details ala Tom Clancy. For this novel, Verne did considerable research to describe what was known as accurately as possible. Professor Arronax and his servant Conseil board a U. S. ship that is searching for a monster that has sunk a number of other ships. They discover that it isn't a monster at all but a submarine, captained by a mysterious man known only as Nemo (Verne will present readers with Nemo once again in &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;). Arronax, Conseil, and an American harpooner named Ned Land travel with Nemo and see many wonderous things and have many adventures. Verne's &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot; has gotten some very poor reviews over the decades since it first appeared in 1869. In many cases, it was because of the translation and not because of Verne. A number of the early translators inserted their own sections with their own ideas and opinions and deleted much of Verne's own words. So, readers should be aware of the translator. I read an excellent translation by Walter James Miller that was also annotated. Such an annotated volume can prove to be very helpful to teenagers getting acquainted with Nemo and his submarine."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"A fantasy written long ago in 1887, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea started almost an entire genre of fantasy with submarines like the Tom Clancy novels. In this story ships all over the world claim to have seen a mysterious shifting black reef. Many thought it was just a rumor until it bore a hole into the hull of a steamer that had been able to make it back to shore. Pierre Arronax, a French biology expert, and his servant are invited on a ship going to hunt this creature. When the ship sunk, they found themselves captive on the creature that turned out to be a submarine, and it captain, Nemo, a genius who despised human society, showed them the wonders of the depths.Slow and plodding, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea does not match the excitement of more contemporary fantasy fiction. One reason that this book did not appeal to me is that, compared to the other fantasy book that I am reading, The Fires of Heaven by Robert Jordan, the characters and events are dull and boring. For example, a protagonist in The Fires of Heaven, Mat Cauthon, has two intriguing aspects. One is his incredible luck in games of chance. The other, most fascinating aspect, is that he has vivid memories of lives lived in the distant past. there is no character in the Jules Vern novel that can compare to such a riveting figure.Jules Vern's novel is flat and unimaginative in contrast to Robert Jordan's work. I was told it was a classic, but I was disappointed by its quality of creativity. I would not recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy fiction."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"okay i think this is a pretty good book but it's not that intresting.

The creature was believed to be 100 feet long with a long thick, sharp, and strong tusk that could break a steal hull. The group finds out that the creature is a submarine called the Nautilus. The group along with Captain Nemo went on many adventures such as visiting Atlantis. The Famous Maelstrom hits the Nautilus and the submarine can't escape.

I like anything that concerns with the ocean. I also like Mystery stories.My favorite part was when the group asked Captain Nemo if they could go and hunt on land. To their surprise he allowed them. When they landed and were cooking their meat a bunch of cannibals came and started to attack. When the group returned captain Nemo opened the hatch and kept it open. The cannibals then tried to enter, but then every time one tried to enter they would run away screaming.

Instead of meat (which they could not get) they ate many kinds of fish and sea plants, which, unless you were told, were indistiguishable from land- raised meat and vegetables.

The reader can clearly identify with the characters and their view of being on the Nautilus. Captain Nemo is an enigmatic person with many layers. In this one will see Man vs. man, and man vs. nature. For some the descriptions of various Marine life may seem over done.

The United States Government sends Professor Arronnax out to sea on the ship called the Abraham Lincoln to search for the monster. Professor Arronnax and his servant, Conseil, set out on the adventure.Professor Arronnax soon learns that the monster is really a steel-plated submarine, called the Nautilus. The Nautilus crashes into their ship and Professor Arronnax, Conseil and Ned, a harpooner, fall into the water and are captured by Captain Nemo. On the Nautilus, Professor Arronnax, Conseil and Ted watch Captain Nemo as he explores the under water world. On the Nautilus they visit many places including the lost continent of Atlantis, the South Pole and the Great Ice Barrier. They search for treasure and have fights with unfriendly sea creatures. Captain Nemo, however, rams the Nautilus into other ships when they get into his way. Nemo rams the Nautilus into a war ship one day because he believes the people on the ship are responsible for killing his family and taking everything away from him that he loves. Professor Arronnax realizes that Captian Nemo is crazy and that they must escape. Professor Arronnax, Conseil and Ted plan their escape only to learn that the Nautilus was caught up in the Maelstrom, the most violent whirlpool in the world. No ship had ever escaped the current of the Maelstrom! Do Professor Arronnax, Conseil and Ted escape the Nautilus and the violent whirlpool or do they drown in the whirlpool and sink to the bottom of the sea?I chose to read this book because I like adventure books and this certainly has adventure and excitement in it. I think that anyone who enjoys reading adventure stories should purchase this book because the characters go to many different places and always are in constant danger. I could not put the book down! This is one of the best books that I have ever read. I think that everyone will like 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea because it is such an interesting book."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"I think that someone who likes science fiction and mystery would like this book a lot. Someone who likes this book would also probably enjoy scuba diving, swimming, spear fishing, and boating. They also might enjoy oceanography, marine biology, hiking, and snorkeling.I really liked this book. One of the reasons that I liked this book is because it was very exciting. There was always action happening, for example, when the giant squid attacked the Nautilus. The characters were realistic and intriguing. I particularly liked Conseil because he was Professor Aronnax's servant and was extremely loyal. The plot seemed like it could be very real. I learned a lot about different geographic settings.

He is certainly a master in mixing scientific facts with literary fiction. A true visionary. Although I have seen various movie versions, I was still surprised at some of the events in this story. The book seemed to move along well besides a relatively slow begining. It has everything a great story should have. Mystery, adventure, action, exotic locations and even a bit of romance, albeit it is with Nemo and the Sea.This particular version was an &quot;audio book&quot; performed by Harlan Ellison. His narration was inspired. I also enjoyed his voice characterizations, especially the impersonation of James Mason's Captain Nemo. It had a reminiscent quality. Music and sound effects would have been a nice touch as long as it wouldn't be distracting. For me, the book ended too quickly. I wanted to hear more of their adventures and would have also liked to have read more about Nemo's past. Although, Verne does tell us more in &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;. Another book I shall look forward in taking up soon. I am sure it will be an equally pleasing experience."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"It's indeed ironic that great works of literature are censored, not only prior to publication, but also after the books hit the shelves. Depending on a period and country, even a incontroversial author like Jules Verne suffered from closed-mindedness. That totalitarian regimes see fit to burn books, or to actively block publication and distribution of some books, in hope that the nation will not see the uneasy point of view often expressed in books - that fact does not surprise anyone anymore nowadays. But that such practices have been utilized in the land of the free and the brave - makes us wonder how different these two systems are. What had poor Verne done to deserve censorship? \\"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\\" was censored prior to publication, and the original manuscript never saw the day during Verne's lifetime. Against his will the author had to cut the social commentary from his trilogy, of which this novel is the first volume. By today's standards, the punishment was incomparable to the guilt, but even then it was disturbing that a work of fiction, a splendid tale of adventure written for the purpose of entertainment and education of the reader, not a political pastiche, mind you, had to have been censored. In particular, the crucial part of the novel had been cut, one in which we learn what were the origins of Captain Nemo, his motivations and heritage. Only years later, after Verne's death, the original manuscript was published, to reveal that Verne originally intended Nemo to have been a Polish nobleman, who escaped his Vaterland after the failure of the 1863 uprising against the Russian Empire. Nemo decided to remove himself from the society, literally from human view - by constructing the famous Nautilus, a submarine, in which he cruised the tranquil abyss of the oceans, where no hand would touch him, and where he wouldn't have to stand the pettiness and cruelty of his fellow human beings.Thus, if you happened to have read the censored version, you would be genuinely puzzled as to the motivations of the Captain. Today, many abridged versions of Verne's novels appear in print, where most of the content is done away with, and what is left is the bare-bones action storyline. To mutilate the book in this way is to commit an unforgivable crime in general, and to hurt the author and readers in particular. \\"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\\" deserves to be widely read just as it had been intended by the author, with its wealth of scientific and prophetic information left untouched, with the commentaries and philosophical musings intact. Only then, within the grand context, the adventure makes sense, only then it is art. I have read this novel circa twenty times; I have admired Captain Nemo for years; I have held my breath in the depths of the Golfstr&ouml;m in the Norwegian Sea during the storm, and during many thrilling moments in the book, not to mention the unforgettable conclusion of the novel; I have tried to solve the mystery of the waterborne ship made of steel, with its many complicated instruments; I have followed the arguments hurled between the Captain and the involuntary passengers of the Nautilus; and finally, I was trembling all over whenever I reached the culmination of the adventure. Verne was a genius, and Captain Nemo was his most original character creation, one I am very fond of for personal reasons, as is I am sure the case with many other readers of the prophetic French author."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"THIS IS A CLASSIC THIS IS A CLASSIC.

Although they are in a sense prisoners, they are allowed to use all the facilities aboard the submarine. This submarine, powered by nuclear energy and christened the Nautilus, is one of Verne's many brilliant predictions of modern life made throughout many of his works. This like may others was correct. Through out the book, the reader gains a vast knowledge of marine life, and the lives of people in distant lands.The book begins when Professor Pierre Aronnax, the narrator of the story, boards an American frigate commissioned to investigate a rash of attacks on international shipping by what is thought to be an amphibious monster. The supposed sea creature, which is actually the submarine Nautilus, sinks Aronnax's vessel and imprisons him along with his devoted servant Conseil and Ned Land, a temperamental harpooner. When they are returned to their senses, the find themselves inside a dark, gloomy, desolate, endless, predicament. They are locked in a cell. However they soon meet Captain Nemo who agrees to let them move about the ship freely on one condition. They must remain aboard the Nautilus. So begins a great adventure of a truly fantastic voyage from the pearl-laden waters of Ceylon to the icy dangers of the South Pole, as Captain Nemo, one of the greatest villains ever created, takes his revenge on all society.The detail that Verne pours into this book is amazing. This is one of the few books that are capable of making the readers feel that they are actually there. His descriptions of how the Nautilus operates, how Nemo's crew harvests food and his account of hunting on Hawaii are excellent, and the plot never falters. The characters are wonderfully scripted; each one having their own unique personality, and they are weaved flawlessly into the awe filled spectacle.This is the book that predicted that there would be submarines, and that submarines would eventually go to the South Pole. It predicted the development of the SCUBA suit; it even predicted nuclear powered ships. The technology used in this book makes it easy to understand even today. This book is widely recognized as a classic- in my view, correctly."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"Submarines as we know them didn't exist in 1869. But Jules Verne had an almost eerily prophetic knack for knowing what technology would be used in the future -- and he put it to work in \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea,\\" a slow-moving adventure tale with plenty of proto-steampunk and almost fantastical undersea life.Ships in the middle of the ocean are suddenly seeing -- and being attacked by -- \\"a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.\\"Eventually the US government sends out a ship to capture the object, and during a sea battle Professor Aronnax, his manservant Conseil and harpooner Ned Land go overboard. Soon they're picked up by the Nautilus, the vast submarine that has been causing all this trouble, and introduced to Captain Nemo -- an intelligent, charismatic man who belongs to no nation.Aronnax becomes fascinated by Nemo, his ship and his library -- as well as the amazing underwater adventures that Nemo introduces them to, like pearl-hunting and fighting a giant squid. But the captain's free, lawless life has its dark side, and the three men begin to realize that they must get away from the Nautilus no matter what.It's actually rather amazing that Jules Verne not only dreamed up the idea of a semi-modern submarine long before they existed, but thought out the applications, the stealth, and the vast size. And since nothing like the Nautilus existed at the time, there's a slightly fantastical, steampunk flavor to \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\\"And as usual, Verne painstakingly studies everything about his imagined world, filling it with science (although he obviously didn't know about water/air pressure) and lovely descriptions of the Nautilus and the eerie underwater world (giant oysters, forests, Atlantis). The only flaw is that he tends to ramble on about exact measurements and travel details; there are boring patches here and there.But Captain Nemo is probably one of Verne's most fascinating characters -- a charismatic, embittered man who is a sort of noble sea pirate. He does some stuff that is totally unacceptable (sinking a random warship), but he also has little spurts of kindness and generosity towards poor and powerless peoples of the world. He's scary but fascinating.Giant submarines, charismatic pirates and an undersea world just waiting to be explored -- \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea\\" is a fascinating sci-fi classic, if you can get past the dull patches."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"this is William Robson's translation, which was published around 1853.

This book has a total of 46 chapters, none of them being more than fifteen pages long. I enjoy these kinds if books because it lets you read 5 or 6 chapters at a time, and not make you go so into extreme detail so you do not get bored. The main character, Professer Aronnax, tells the book. He is a very intelligent individual who is a Professor of Natural History in Paris during the late 1800's. He and his faithful servant, Conseil, are assigned to an expedition with many other chosen men by the French Government, including a Canadian Harpooner named Ned Land, to rid the seas of a little known and terrifying sea monster.

Jules Verne's story is enthralling and full of detail. However, the translation in the Sterling edition is very old and can be rather tongue-twisting when read aloud. The word ordering in the sentences often reflects the original French a bit too much. Likewise, the numereous names of various flora and fauna are rendered in Latin form, rather than the more common names I'm familiar with. I've found Frederick Paul Walter's newer (and also unabridged) translation to be much easier to read:Amazing Journeys: Journey to the Center of the Earth, From the Earth to the Moon, Circling the Moon, 20,000 Leagues Under the Seas, and Around the World in 80 Days."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"Regular readers of [...] won't be surprised to learn that the first book I read on the Kindle was 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. There's something so right about reading a century-old tale -- whose narrator is enthralled with the power of electricity -- on a device that's a pretty darn enthralling use of electricity.That said, in exploring how the image of technology and the future has changed over time, few books are as influential as this one. Some observations:1. Captain Nemo's built himself a utopia. Consider that he says the Nautilus is out of reach from tyrants and built so well that it can't be damaged by nature. Nemo says he's never been as free as when he put himself inside the sub. There's a library with nearly unlimited information. The ocean provides an unlimited amount of food. Everyone's healthy thanks to the constant temperature and fresh sea air. Electricity, described as providing light \\"more uniform and continuous than the sun\\" and behaving \\"more obedient than gas\\" provides an unlimited amount of power. Sounds like every other golden age longed for through time, but this one is all thanks to technology--and especially electricity.2. The constant use of extreme detail in the book, going on for pages and pages about what the fish look like and rattling off measurements, give the fantasy parts of the book much more credence. It's a lesson on the benefits of getting granular when selling a vision of the future.3. There's a great passage where, on behalf of science, Verne snobbily says, \\"It was Tasman who discovered this group in 1643, the year Torricelli invented the barometer and Louis XIV mounted the throne. I leave the reader to decide which of these events has been more useful to the human race.\\" This wasn't the first time an innovator scoffed at a politician, but it's certainly one of the sharpest. Food for thought for those innovation v. public policy debates that break out every so often."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"I thought that the book had one of the best plot lines I've ever seen, reguardless of the fact that there is only slight building up to the climax. The only thing that I didn't think was that good about the book was that about every other page, Jules Verne would go into a paragraph description of the animals. For example, he would say something like: I just saw a tuna. But not the normal tuna, it was yellow-bellied, had dorsal fins that went at a downward angle, etc.\\" Otherwise, I thought it was a great read and well worth the money. I will be purchasing more of Jules Verne's books very soon. I highly suggest for you to read this book. Another thing, if you enjoyed watching the 1954 \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea Film,\\" I highly suggest the book because the movie only gives a small picture of what actually occurred during their submarine venture and the book tells you everything, and the occurrences are just amazing.The novel basically tells the story of Professor Arronax, Ned Land and Conseil who get taken aboard the Nautilus and experiences many adverntures, such as going to Atlantis, an underwater hunt, getting trapped in an ice block and much more."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"I don't pretend to be a literary know-it-all. I know about as much about classic literature as I do about moose hunting...and that ain't much. For whatever reason, I thought it might make me a more cultured and enlightened person if I read some of the old school fiction. You know, the authors that nobody ever mentions unless you're in an English class. They may be crusty, but they're considered to have written some of the greatest novels ever.While my trek through the classics is still at its infancy, I decided to take that journey 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea that Jules Verne has been begging me to take ever since I was a wee lad. I've always noticed the various covers of this book over the years, often featuring a giant squid attacking either a submarine or some guy in an old-timey diving suit, or even both. Sometimes there's a treasure chest involved, too. It's no wonder that the book has always peaked my interest. How could you go wrong with such an inviting cover. It was about time that I figured out what was up with this Captain Nemo guy I'd always heard about.Through virtually the entire book, you have basically only four characters. Captain Nemo, of course, is the one everyone's heard of. He's the mysterious commander of an astonishing vehicle for its time, an electric submarine called The Nautilus. Professor Arronax, his servent Conseil, and Ned Land, a noted French-canadian harpooner, end up as captives aboard Nemo's strange vessel and are taken along for a voyage across the globe. The sights that they encounter are incredible. Creatures never imagined, lost treasure, undersea eruptions, and long-sunken vessels. The adventures are high ones, as they take the dangerous trip beneath the polar ice cap and even visit the lost city of Atlantis.I guess you could call it high adventure, but surprisingly, it's not all that exciting. The journey 20,000 Leagues Under the sea is a slow, plodding one. Sandwiched in between a fairly compelling beginning and ending is a wordy, overly explanatory middle filled with obscene amounts of nautical and technical jargon, yet devoid of much stimulating drama.I have no doubt that in the 1800s Jules Verne's descriptive prose awed readers to the wonders of the sea and underwater travel. In this day and age, however, the bar has been raised considerably and the story itself is very underwhelming for the modern read. The average person has been able to witness for themselves much of the stuff that Verne describes in such painstaking detail, either through television or trips to aquariums and the like. Much of the book simply isn't as extraordinary as it was 100 years ago. While the sea still holds great mystery, it's not near as foreign to us as it was back then.If you're not aroused by the technical workings of a submarine, or of the many food dishes that you can make out of sea life, there's not much else there for the average reader. The plot is more centered around situations conceived to further describe Captain Nemo's crazy contraption, The Nautilus, than it is to actually weave an interesting story. After the first few chapters, I was bored, save for a few bits here and there, until the last few chapters when it began to pick back up again.I trudged on, however, anxious to finish so I can get to the next book, hoping that it will be less yawn-inducing. If you're like me and wanting to tackle those classics, save 20,000 Leagues for the end. Pick up Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World or War of the Worlds instead. Both are far superior. Heck, I'd even rather read Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde, at least it was shorter. But like I said earlier, I'm no expert in the classics, maybe I just missed the boat, err...submarine, on this one."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"This book was TERRIBLE. I couldn't even get past part one. Yes, there are two parts, and I am certain that the second half is just as bad as the first. The whole story was just describing Professor Aronnax's daily life on the Nautilus, which was completely repetitive if you ask me. The only SOMEWHAT interesting parts of the story was when Professor Aronnax is in danger of being attacked by natives, but Jules Verne just HAS to say it in the most boring way. Jules Verne also spent entire pages describing totally boring conversations between Captain Nemo and Professor Aronnax. These conversations were not only boring but confusing. Jules Verne used way to many technical words, in my opinion. Don't get me wrong- I have a big vocabulary range, but that was ridiculous. And who cares about finding the Nautilus's exact location on a map using latitude and longitude lines? Why couldn't Jules Verne just say, &quot;IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN?&quot; If I were you, I would stay away from this book. Don't even THINK about reading it, because you'll just be bored to tears. I know you will, because I was.

It's a fast read, too."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"Verne was anachronous to his era. But, better that he was. Because the most amazing element of this work, more than the astounding genius and limitless creativity, was the fact it was penned in the latter stages of the 19th centruy. Some highlights: the undersea walks, Atlantis, and the attack of the cuttle-fish. There's many more, though; you could do worse than reading this book and discovering it's hidden treasures for yourself. There may be perhaps a bit too much of 'zoophytes' in it, but the book will hold it's own as a classic, regardless. For Verne's prowess was not how he told his stories, but WHEN. One final note: was Captain Nemo a villian, or simply a good guy who went too far? A megalomaniac, that Nemo."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"A scientist, his sidekick and a big strong sailor are going to have their lives changed forever when they are sent to capture a giant octopus. But, instead, they fall overboard and find out what they think is an octopus is really a giant submarine with a Captain Nimo and a crew that speaks their own language (which the trio calls &quot;the submarine language&quot;)! In this submarine, they go on millions of adventures like: tunneling through blocks of ice in the antartic, zooming through tunnels from sea to sea, and seeing every different kind of fish you could ever imagine. The only problem is the scientist's sidekick joins with the big sailor, Ned, and together they try to escape. They have many of their own adventures too, like when they try to escape the first time and they almost get caught by cannibals. The second time they escape and write a story which you will read if you want to read it and it's called, &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot;.

The listener is swept, along with the narrator and his two companions, aboard the futuristic (but never improbable) submarine \\"Nautilus,\\" helmed by the mysterious (and ultimately tragic) Captain Nemo. The wonders of Verne's tale of adventure, as well as the tension and sheer terror contained therein, have never before been made so real in any performance of any adaptation of this novel. It becomes easy to empathize with the plight of the narrator, and, indeed, to share in his feelings and frustrations, save one -- the listener may not share the narrator's desire to end the adventure and go home. Ellison's vocal work is outstanding, and the direction of the adaptation is flawless. In an era where the science fiction market increasingly relies on the use of franchised characters, it is refreshing to hear this adaptation of a highly original (and ever relevant) work."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"Beautiful descriptions, heroic adventure, and intellectual, that is how I describe the classic story &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot; written by the infamous author Jules Verne. &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot; is full of Adventure, vivid descriptions, and is well researched.

Is he the antithesis of a 19th century capitalist? Is he the result of capitalism, using technology to gain the liberty of a higher standard of living which it allows? Is he despot, savior, evil or compassionate?Nemo epitomizes a vision of humanity which is arrogantly attempting to create a peaceful world through technology. The battle is clearly in vain as the characters are hindered by the passions of their natures.Nemo is the rebel, the nationless man, who has turned away from the machine mentality, dollar diplomacy and imperialist expansionism of his age.Verne creates a self-contained world for Nemo, one in which there is no dependency on capitalism. All that Nemo needs is produced by the Nautilus.This freedom is decadent. The Nautilus produces no surplus value other than to provide for the whims of Nemo, a person dehumanized by the progress of the developing western world. A world he doesn't understand or is in touch with.Even in his act of political intervention against imperialism through the financing of the liberation movement of the Cretans from the Turks was decadent. The money came from the sea, it was put back into circulation, it wasn't the result of production or creativity. There is no net gain to society by this action. The people could have been better provided for by encouraging production and industry.Though Nemo was creative enough to produce the Nautilus to escape his world of torment, he's nothing more than a narcissist. Racing back and forth across the oceans is an act of conspicuous and selfish consumption.Nemo's goal is conquest of the sea, to make nature a possession, something no longer mysterious and otherworldly, but just a part of the humanized world, as if that's possible.Though Nemo suffers great loss, he blames the world, not himself. He sees himself as virtuous, as a victim of industry and progress. He is a paradox of the world.His is a world running from machines and science in a machine. A world free from governments and country in which he governs. A world free from captivity in which he holds others captive. A world from which he takes freely, but gives nothing to in return. Nemo is everything he disdains.All of this is lost to Nemo, an obscurity of self, hidden behind his anger and self exile. Reckless abandon seems to be his only motive. His disgust with society has robbed him of all virtue, all concern for others.In making his journey of discovery around the world, Nemo fails to make the most important discovry there is, what it means to be human."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"WOW--WOW--WOW---GREAT BOOK---WHAT A CLASSIC---CAN YOU BELIEVE THATIT WAS WRITTEN IN 1869???

It is very entertaining to discover what these people believed and to compare their beliefs to ours in modern times. 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea is entertaining in this fashion. Jules Verne is suprisingly accurate in his depiction of a modern-day electric submarine and its workings... although he doesn't go into the minute details that I was hoping for. The ending of this book is a tremendous let-down with regards to the character of Captain Nemo. Throughout the entire book, the Captain's background is built up to be a giant mystery... which simply begs for resolution. I couldn't wait to reach the end of the book in order to find out why Captain Nemo was the way he was. This resolution never comes. Never. This left me with the opinion that Jules Verne simply wasn't a talented storyteller, and never bothered to fill out and completely think about the character of Captain Nemo. Anyone can think up fantastic situations and theories... but the real talent comes in explaining them in a plausible way to the reader. It's akin to watching a movie where lots of incredible things happen to the main characters, only to have them wake up stating that it was all a dream."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"On my Kindle 4 and iPhone app. As always, Jules Verne came through with a fun and exciting read.

The fight with the school of squid is only a few pages long.On the other hand, Nemo is not shown as a man trying to force mankind to improve as much as he is trying to live without contact with it (even when he helps some parts of it to fight back by giving rebels gold he finds on the seafloor).

If you do not like to read classics with everything that goes along with that (such as long-winded language that seems outdated to us today), then you should stay away.For lovers of classical and relatively easy to read literature, this is a good book. A lot of things are amazing, considering how long ago they were written and what overall level of scientific knowledge was at the time. Some of it just boggles my mind.At the same time, the book is long winded and in the end, not quite as much happens as one would expect. Dan Brown's DaVinci code has more things happening in the first 20 pages than Verne has in his entire book. But that is OK in a way, because when I read a classic, I do not expect to compare it to modern standards. The entertainment is due to different factors. In fact, the way the book is written is part of the entertainment and not just the story.I do not give this book 5 stars however, because I was disappointed in the end, since not enough of the story really comes to a conclusion. I do not want to spoil the book for you, but there are a lot of unanswered questions, and getting those answers really was what kept me reading. There is quite a bit of build-up, and then in some ways, the book just ends. (I noticed that style in many books of that time, where the narrator just says \\"here is what I know... but I do not know the whole story...\\").Also, to some extent, I agree with some of my fellow reviewers that gave a lower score, in that it is too much of a narration rather than a real story. I do not complain about some of it being like a log book, but I would have wished to get a bit more information about the daily life on board. I just do not buy that the 3 travelers just stayed in their room. They must have found out a bit more about other parts of the boat. Or at least attempted it, and that would have been interesting to read about, without breaking with the overall style of the book."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea was a very complex book. The authors word choice was what made it so complex, the author used words like \\"Vexed\\" \\"Zoophytes\\" and \\"Connoisseur.\\" The majority of these words were Old English, which added to the complexity of the book. The sentence structure was similar to the word choice, it was also very complex sentences, the sentences were usually not to long but not to short, at times they could be quite long though, and they were old an English style. The book itself is about Three Human beings chasing after a giant \\"Narwhal\\" as the author calls it. These three characters are known as Professor M. Arronax, a genius Professor from France whose passion is to study, Conseil, a teenage boy who devotes his life to serving the professor, and Ned Land, a Canadian Harpooner. Conseil and the Professor accept an invitation to the boat the Abram Lincoln, the goal of the voyage is to track down a giant Cetacean, or a sea creature. This creature has apparently been reeking havoc across the world causing all sorts of deeds, and so the 3 meet up at the boat. They pursue the creature for over a month, when they finally catch up with the lightning fast Cetacean they pursue it, however when the creature strikes back Ned Land, Conseil, and Professor Arronax are thrown into the ocean, and separated from their boat, they awake to find they are in the supposed cetacean, to find out that it is not at all a sea monster, but an amazing Submarine named the Nautilus led by Captain Nemo. They then learn of Captain Nemo's plans, and embark on a Submarine Hunt on the bottom of the Ocean, they Discover Atlantis, they venture to the south pole, and even fight among Poulps or Cuttlefish of enormous size, 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea is full of adventure.In 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea The Brilliant minds of Captain Nemo and Professor Arronax save them in times of danger, Captain Nemo's knowledge of the sea allows him to guide his submarine across the world, confronting the sea's greatest beauties and threats. Jules Verne does a very good job of telling the story and making out every last inch of the amazing journeys taken place on board the Nautilus. In my opinion this was a very good book, there are times in the book were discussions between the captain and the professor take place that are extremely difficult to comprehend, but in the end I would say this book is definitely worth the money. However as I've said before almost every page has Old English in it and is hard to understand, the sentences are very difficult and there are some words which I'd never heard before in my life, so because of the books complexity I would have to say that only someone 13+ can read this, this would be great for adults even, but I don't think anyone below the 7th grade could fully understand it, a 6th grader could but not get the full detail of the book."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"In this book there are three main characters,Ned Land, Professor Aronnax, and Captain Nemo.

In this classic book he takes the reader through the unexplored depths of the ocean on a fantastic and breathtaking voyage fraught with excitement and danger.I have read several reviews of this book from a variety of sources. The biggest criticism that is offered by the reviewers is that throughout the book Verne, through the words of Professor Annorax, lists and describes a multitude of sea life, both flora and fauna. Many reviewers find this distracting and boring. My personal opinion is that the reason that many readers and reviewers criticize this is because they are comparing the book to the very poor Disney film interpretation and adaptation of the book.In truth, the book would suffer greatly without the detailed description of the flora and fauna observed by Professor Annorax. Why? I believe that many of the readers and reviewers misunderstand Verne's intention of who Professor Annorax is. Professor Annorax is a world renown naturalist and specialist in sea life. That is exactly what makes this story so wonderful. Verne takes the worlds foremost expert on sea flora and fauna and throws him into a world previously unknown to him. By observing the many life forms never before documented Annorax realizes just how much he does not know and becomes an even greater expert than before. The documentation of the many species is the natural response an expert naturalist would have to the sudden discovery of a whole new world of flora and fauna.Clearly, Verne had a vivid imagination by describing a functioning submarine well before the concept of a submarine had ever been dreamt of. The detailed explanations of how the submarine works and how it is able to produce electricity and power from nothing more than sea water is perhaps the best kind of science fiction, the kind that has a basis in fact. I have to believe that when the first submarines were being built that the inventors had to have made a serious study of Verne's Nautilus. To have come up with such an intricate, detailed, and scientifically sound description of a submarine in his time is absolutely astounding.Finally, the accuracy of the never before seen flora and fauna when coupled with the scientifically accurate description of the design and functioning of the Nautilus has to make one wonder if Captain Nemo and the Nautilus are really science fiction or if by some miracle they did actually exist and instead of fiction this story was a summary of a real experience Verne, as Professor Annorax, actually experienced."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was one of the best books of it's time and it's legacy still continues today. The author Jules Verne is able to create a world that is fantastic and believable at the same time. However there are moments in which the details become repetitive and rather insignificant.The main character Captain Nemo, it is never obvious if he is the protagonist or antagonist, has a personality that is quite paradoxical. He believes that mankind has wrecked the earth and has given up on the human race as so decides to escape it by traveling the seas in his submarine. However, he is compassionate towards his crew members. At most times he is emotionless, but it is his emotional trauma that bothers him more than anything else. He is a complex character who is interesting, mysterious, and quite interesting to analyze.The story line is intriguing and Verne's imagination adds to the impact of the plot. The story begins with a naturalist, his assistant, and a harpooner looking for a giant sea creature that has destroyed several ships. It turns out that this creature that they are looking for, and find, is Captain Nemo's submarine. Verne is also able to create a wonderful world full of different creature of the sea as well as the submarine it's self. At the time the book was written sea travel was common but submarines were unheard of. The description of the vessel and its ability must have wowed readers of the time.However, it's Verne's over usage of description and unnecessary plot that tends to ruin the pace of the story. For pages on end there is a constant rambling of encyclopedia-like information. Is it really necessary to know the name, size, origin, composition, weight (etc) of some random mineral that naturalist happens to find?Unfortunately these random occurrences make the book a little hard to follow, but in the end it is still a classic that everyone should end up reading."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"Twenty Thousand Leagues under The Sea by Jules Verne is one of the bestscience fiction books. I would recommend the movie starring James Masonas Captain Nemo. It is well written as all of Jules Verne's books are.Danny Fleming, author of How to Prove The Collatz Conjecture."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"Having chewed and digested \\"Around the World in Eighty Days\\", \\"Five Weeks in a Balloon\\" and \\"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\\", I set out to devour another chef d'oeuvre of Verne [the often overlooked \\"true\\" father of science fiction] with much relish. Sure, \\"20,000 Leagues\\" seemed bigger than the others I'd read, but I thought it would be the classic excitement and drama of Verne all the way. Well, I was nearly right.Professor Arronax leaves a \\"normal\\" life in France for the US, taking his assistant with him, to investigate the matter that has taken all the attention of the \\"modern\\" or \\"known\\" world. Joined by the egotistic harpooner, Ned Land, they seek adventure, and they find it.Again, I see Verne's classic touch of the dramatic as the threesome find the monster - the Nautilus - or rather, as the Nautilus finds them. They awaken to an interminable adventure under the sea. The Professor is fascinated, or perhaps, intoxicated with the endless wealth of life in the sea and spends hours, days and months observing and recording. The tireless taxonomist takes in all the eye can see and with the help of his assistant, classifies it all. This is where the tedium began for me as the reader. Pages upon pages of pure taxonomy.The accounts of the undersea explorations in specially designed suits offers some relief. The enigmatic Captain Nemo is in charge; incidents and never accidents. Everything about him is shrouded in mystery - pondering on the life of Captain Nemo offers some useful distraction and provides the fuel to consume more and more pages.However, you can never miss Verne's climactic scenes, where he brings drama and suspense to their peak. The almighty Nautilus is trapped inside a huge mass of ice at the South Pole, and for the first time, Captain Nemo shows signs of worry, however subtle. Yet, he goes on with a steely determination. Things are looking very desperate, but as usual, the day is saved. However, I found myself following every detail, sharing all their fears, their toil, their despair. Their ecstasy was mine when the Nautilus broke free. I was totally drawn in......The irritable Ned Land sparks the fire of escape. He's sick and tired of submarine life as Nemo shows no signs of releasing his charges. The adventure ends with the escape of the threesome back to terra firma, or does it? I guess it continued with Captain Nemo and his longsuffering crew until his death, burying years of useful knowledge and resources under the sea. Or did he live forever?A highly challenging but rewarding read for the discerning reader or Verne fanatic."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"Oh my gosh, this book is so cool! And so very important in understanding Verne's place in literary and scientific history. This large format book is an annotated version of the most widely circulated English translation of t he Verne classic. And because of the annotations, we learn how HORRIBLY Verne's work was translated from the original French. A great example comes near the beginning of the book when the delightfully detailed annotation in the margin points out that the common edition translation talks of the narrator returning from the \\"disagreeable territory of Nebraska.\\" We learn from the annotation that this is a huge distortion of the narrator's personality and experience. Verne's original writing spoke of the \\"badlands of Nebraska\\" and actually had a favorable attitude toward the region. We learn from the annotations that there were dozens of such awful, misleading mistranslations throughout the common edition that so many people have read, with the author often criticized for errors the he should not be held accountable for. Some of the mistranslations are comical in retrospect. For example we learn in this edition that the common edition includes the phrase \\"at the expense of my loins\\" when, in fact, a more accurate translation would be \\"hurting my back.\\"Verne's book is so filled with cutting edge science of his day and the annotations enlighten us so much about them. Thus this annotated version makes Verne's story an even more interesting and multi-dimentional reading experience."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne is a mysterious adventure book about four voyagers pioneering the unknown depths of the sea. The main characters of this book are Pierre Aronnax, Counseil, Ned Land, and Captain Nemo. Pierre Aronnax is an assistant professor at a natural history museum and Counseil is Aronnax's 30 year old servant. Ned Land is an expert Canadian harpooner with an instinct to kill. Finally, Captain Nemo the mystifying captain of the ship takes them in and does not release them. The French narrator of this story, Pierre Aronnax, while intrigued by Captain Nemo and their many underwater excursions knows that he is still a captive and is planning to escape.Pierre Aronnax, his servant Conseil, and Ned Land were all summoned to the Abraham Lincoln a ship designed to pursue the monster who was tormenting voyagers on the seas. They encounter a large and swift object in the sea and all three of them are thrown over board. The three men find out later that it was a submarine that attacked them and the commander of this submarine Captain Nemo brings them aboard his vessel. Nemo gives them a grand tour of the vessel. He still treats them like captives but grants them some mobility. Their first adventure with Captain Nemo is the Pearl Fields. The Pearl Fields are fields filled with pearl oysters but Nemo doesn't stop for any of them. He takes them into a huge cave and eventually leads them to a 7-foot long oyster with a pearl the size of a coconut. Nemo does not take the oyster but leaves it to grow. The next encounter is with a gigantic shark. The shark is preying on a helpless fisherman when Nemo jumps in to stab it in the belly. The shark overthrows Nemo but Ned Land is quick to defend him by spearing the shark through the head. The waters are foggy with blood but Nemo manages to bring the fisherman back to his boat and revive him. While these men are thrown together by chance they still show devotion to each other and acts of bravery and humanity. Still Arronax continues to want to escape. The last adventure these men have together is just off the American Coast when seven giant sea monsters that resemble squid attack their submarine. Just as they open the hatch a giant tentacle swirls down into the ship and grabs a hold of a defenseless sailor. As the squid's arm is slinking down Nemo cuts it off with a hatchet. They all fiercely battle the monsters as Ned Land barely escapes the jaws of one squid with Nemo's help. They soon fight off all the enormous squid and are on their way again. They come upon a whirl pool and as they frantically try to escape, a life boat is ripped from the submarine and Pierre Aronnax's world goes dark. What becomes of Nemo and his crew, Ned Land, Aronnax and his humble servant Conseil is the last part of the book.I thought this book was a great read and kept me guessing all the way through. It is not all violence and gore most of the book is about these adventurers discovering nature and the sea. The characters are interesting and very different from each other. Nemo is the caring yet stern captain of the ship while Pierre is somewhat shy and curious. I like both of these characters equally but respect Nemo more because of his strength and convictions. Ned Land is a hostile maverick with the instinct to kill while Conseil is gentle and barely expresses his personality except for his devotion to Arronax. I think Ned Land is a dangerous person to be with but he could save your life if you run into trouble and I admire Conseil's unflinching loyalty to Aronnax. The discovery and respect for nature is an underlying theme throughout the book and I was fascinated by this point of view because it was written so long ago. I can't compare this book to any other book because it is unique but probably the closest book would be Journey to the Center of the Earth which is also an adventure book. Anyone who likes a creative book with lots of adventure, action and heroics would find this book extraordinary."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"This book is completed destroyed by errors in printing.

This review is of the complete edition (not the bowdlerised children's version) and references the translation by Mendor T. Brunetti.This was a reread for me. I read most of the Verne books when I was quite young, and lately wanted to revisit some of my favorites. When I was younger, I was very much (like Captain Aronnax) taken with the catalogue of undersea marvels that Captain Nemo and his Nautilus enabled us to visit. Reading it this time around, I was quite struck with the political picture of Captain Nemo. As a man from an unknown country who has lost everything at the hands of men, Nemo becomes what we would today call a terrorist. He funds freedom fighters. He takes his revenge on the men from the countries who hurt him and his. The portraits on his wall: John Brown, Kosciusko, Daniel O'Connell. I think that I'm going to add The Mysterious Island to my list. I had never read the sequel in the past, and I understand that it provides more background about the mysterious captain.Readers who aren't familiar with this book are encouraged by this reviewer to rapidly amend this sad condition. I also have to say that I first read this when I was nine (the full version, not a children's edition) and I can't imagine what really needs to be cut to make it suitable for younger folks. I'd hand them the whole thing with a confident heart."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"I loved this classic French novel by Jules Verne and found it to be very entertaining from start to finish! I was very surprised that I would enjoy this book as much as I did.... I figured \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\", like many classic novels, would be boring, but Jules Verne is a marvelous storyteller. He imbues this novel with lots of intrigue and mystery as you wonder how the story will unfold... There is lots of adventure and interesting predicaments, and of course, many unforgettable characters one comes to care about during the course of the novel. Also if you like science fiction then this is the novel for you! Jules Verne seems to be ahead of his time in terms of technology and creates quite a wonderful piece of classic literature that has stood the test of time.The attention to detail that Jules Verne used to capture the readers attention is marvelous... This book is written in the 1st person through the eyes of Assistant Professor Pierre Aronnax of the Paris Museum of Natural History. Professor Aronnax unfolds the story to the reader of this novel about several sightings of a mysterious object seen around the world by many different people.... Some believe it to be an island, others seem to think the object is a floating reef, a large whale or other large mammal and so on. It isn't until Professor Aronnax and his faithful Flemish assistant, Conseil, take part on an expedition aboard the Abraham Lincoln to seek out this unknown object once and for all. Eventually, it is discovered that this unknown object is a submarine named the Nautilus, on which Professor Aronnax, Conseil and Canadian harpooner, Ned Land, spend the remaining part of the novel sailing on the Nautilus through the various oceans of the world along with the crew of the Nautilus. What adventures they have while sailing on the Nautilus!! And the exquisite detail in which Jules Verne imparts is wonderful. One feels like they are truly reading the actually travel journal/diary of Professor Aronnax. Professor Aronnax writes from a scientific/natural history perspective as he is very much interested in the under water world of the worlds oceans.The only draw back I had with this novel was that some of the descriptions were a bit overdone or a bit too much to take in (like classification of animal species or various nautical terms).... These descriptions aren't overwhelming or occur that frequently, I'd just find myself skimming through these parts rather quickly."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"My husband bought this book for our son at a visit to an aquarium, even though I thought it was too advanced for him because he's only four and half. I was wrong - my son LOVES this book! I know the age range on it is 9 to 12 and I have no doubt those ages would also enjoy reading the book themselves, but my son is constantly wanting me to read this to him and is always begging for me to read one more chapter because we usually only read one or two at a time (I will admit, I tone down the scarier parts just a bit for him because he's only four). The illustrated pages help hold his attention while I read to him even though there is a significant amount of text per page, and even my two and half year old can manage to sit through a chapter most days. I love the combination of illustration and text that allows me to read my sons more involved and advanced stories without them becoming bored because there isn't enough to hold their attention to the story. My older son loves asking questions about the pictures, especially the ones in the inserts that have information related to different aspects of the story, and I have learned a lot from those too!

Captain Nemo named it The Nautilus. The captain has a strange vow not to put foot on land people have been on land people have been on. He also explains that he only uses things that are from the sea. For example, his bed was made of soft eelgrass. On the voyage, the professor learns to hunt for pearls and sea animals. This book is also suspenseful because it leaves you in one question is captain Nemo still alive?I really liked this book because it had a leveled amount of description even though it is first person narrative.

Normally, they come out with things like \\"An Illustrated Design History of the United States Destroyer.\\" I'm not casting any aspersions on such a volume, and I may own a copy or two. But Jules Verne, is an a class by himself as one of the great inventive masters of literature. He stands up there with Homer and Chaucer and James M. Cain. And what a superb edition this is, the translation impeccable and the annotations which include technical and historical explanations of the text and are invaluable. I have to confess, it is one of the few times (not including Nabokov) I actually read all the footnotes in a novel (or any book) and found them to be supremely enjoyable.

The professor after a few days figured that he has to get off the monster seeing the captain is nearly insane, but he refuses to get off because it is his. Those are not the only characters. Others are Ned Land, Consiel, cannibals, Commander Farragut, and crew men.Three-fourths through the book, people are going crazy. Worst of all, Ned is going so insane; he wants to swim thousands of miles to shore. He feels he just has to get off the beast, even though he's being well supplied with food. As days go on Professor Arronax is seeing Captain Nemo acting weirder and weirder every day, until finally Captain Nemo resorts to yelling at the Professor for no reason.I would recommend this book for ages eight and up. If someone is reading 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea aloud, it would be exciting for any age. If you like drama, mystery, action, or creativity, this book is for you.

It is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one-quarter of Verne's story and mistranslating much of the remainder. Its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering Tor's status as a leading science fiction publisher, and the company's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning. If you want to truly get to know Verne's novel, pick up the elegant Naval Institute Press edition, in a modern, complete, updated translation, with commentary by the leading American Verne expert today, Walter James Miller. That book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original French first edition (no illustrations are to be found in the B&N Mercier reprint). Less attractive but more academic is the Oxford Classics version of Twenty Thousand Leagues. This review is posted on behalf of the North American Jules Verne Society by Jean-Michel Margot, president NAJVS."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"This is without a doubt the best translation of Jules Verne's 1870 science fiction classic &quot;Vingt mille lieues sous les mers&quot; (&quot;20,000 Leagues under the Sea&quot;). This translation by two Verne scholars, Walter James Miller and Frederick Paul Walter, takes all the knowledge available on the book and its author to not only make an accurate and readable complete text (early versions often omit a full quarter of the French original) that fixes the many errors of earlier translators, but also purges the text of many mistakes that were made by the original French compositors. The research and work that went into this translations is really quite stunning, and the result is a text that really lets Verne's genius shine: &quot;20,000 Leagues under the Sea&quot; is not only a brilliant piece of scientific prophecy, but also a thrilling story with superb, subtle characterizations.The plot is familiar: Captain Nemo, an enigmatic figure who has withdrawn himself from the world, tours the oceans in his submarine called the Nautilus. We see this journey of 20,000 leagues (approx. 43,200 miles) through the eyes of Professor Pierre Aronnax, a scientist who is both Nemo's guest and prisoner. Also aboard with Aronnax are his manservant Conseil and a gruff ship's harpooner, Ned Land. The Nautilus encounters many wonders and obstacles on its long voyage: underwater forests, giant clams, attacks by huge squid, imprisonment in ice at the South Pole, monster storms, a war with a pack of sperm whales, and the discovery of the lost continent of Atlantis. But as something deep and destructive gnaws away at Captain Nemo, his prisoners seek a way to escape from the miracle ship.In the English-speaking world Jules Verne has rarely received in the praise he truly deserves as a writer. People applaud his scientific foresight (while criticizing him for errors that were usually the fault of the translators), but shrug off his writing as inconsequential, with cardboard characters and plotless stories. If only these critics would read this translation of Verne's best novel...they would have to re-think their position on the great French writer! His genius for blending adventure, comedy, and psychology burst through in this translation. The book does veer into lengthy descriptions of marine life in places, and modern readers are likely to skim these parts (Verne even provides clues in the text to indicate when he's about to digress), but as a whole the novel is absolutely engrossing, throwing one stupendous adventure after another at the characters, while developing a mystery around Captain Nemo and increasing tension onboard the Nautilus so that the many different incidents hold together as a single plot. Even though submarines are commonplace technology today, Verne infuses his story with such awe-inspiring wonder that you can't help but feel the same sense of amazement as Professor Aronnax when he finds himself cruising the depths of the world's oceans. Real wonder never gets stakes, and no one was better at creating wonder than Jules Verne.Aside from the excellent translation, this edition contains numerous extras (if this were a DVD, it would be labeled as a Special Edition Director's Cut). The lengthy introduction explains Verne's background, education, the development of the novel, the many things that Verne accurately predicted, the book's unsung literary qualities, the different French texts, and the problems with earlier translations. All the original illustrations from the original French edition are reproduced in the text, and generous footnotes give the reader a guide through Verne's more obscure references and shed light on the author's scientific genius. As a bonus at the end of the book, the editors include a new translation of the relevant passages from &quot;Mysterious Island&quot; that discuss Captain Nemo's background (just in case you're too impatient to go read &quot;Mysterious Island&quot; for yourself to solve the Captain Nemo mystery). There's also a table of the measurements used in the novel for those readers who really want to test the author's scientific accuracy.There really isn't any other choice when it comes to translations of the &quot;20,000 Leagues under the Sea.&quot; Nothing comes close to this: it will appease hard science readers, and it will open people up to Jules Verne's overlooked literary talents. With the wealth of background information available, this edition does better by Jules Verne -- ANY Jules Verne -- than has ever been published in the English language."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"Most of Jules Verne's works were hastily translated, with many &quot;improvements&quot; made in the process, such as deletion of scientific exposition, as well as deletion of many moments deemed by the translator as dull.This, the Restored and Annotated version of 20,000 leagues, is a VAST improvement over previous English editions. The translation is very well done, and the annotations explain what has been changed and what previous translations accomplished.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"If you want to read the novel itself rather than a &quot;version&quot; based upon it, I recommend the relatively inexpensive 'Bantam Classic' edition of 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA. Although the foreword by Ray Bradbury is negligible, the Anthony Bonner translation is a graceful compromise between the 1870 French and modern American English, catching the flavor of the period without burying the reader in pseudo-Victorian turns of phrase.That said, readers who come to LEAGUES from either text, audio, or film adaptations of the novel are likely in for a shock, for the original novel is quite different. Some basics, however, remain the same: Professor Arronax, his valet Conseil, and harpooner Ned Land are coaxed into assisting the United States in a search for a sea monster said to be terrorizing shipping lanes--but the monster is not flesh and blood. The three soon find themselves in the hands of the mysterious Captain Nemo, who has created a machine that glides beneath the surface of the ocean: a submarine named Nautilus.But there the similarity ends. While there are very clear similarities between the novel and the various adaptations it has spawned, the Verne novel is less concerned with story, characters, and adventures than it is in creating a plausible vision of something that simply did not exist at the time Verne wrote: a fully functional submarine capable of navigating even the most treacherous waters. Consequently, the bulk of Verne's text is concerned with detailed descriptions of the Nautilus and the sealife it encounters.Many modern readers may find it uphill work, particularly when Professor Arronax determinedly notes the sealife he sees to the point of scientific classification. But even so, and while it may not reach the level of &quot;great art&quot; literature, LEAGUES is a fascinating novel to read--fascinating as much for itself as for what it tells us about the world of the 1870s and what was believed to be possible. The vision that Verne had would indeed come to pass: there would be submarines, and they would strong enough to brave the polar seas. It is an impressive accomplishment--and a tremendously fun read.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"This is Jules Verne's classic tale of undersea adventure, as best I can tell based on the 1873 translation by Lewis Mercier. Since that's been the standard English translation for over a hundred years, it's probably the one you remember reading way back when, and the edition you'll be familiar with.Re-reading this as an adult, and an adult who's spent twenty-plus years since then reading science fiction, I did have to remind myself more than once how amazing the then-future technologies Verne describes, like electric rifles, undersea diving suits, electric motors, etc., would have been to his contemporary readers; the book was first published in 1869, a mere five years after the Confederate submarine Hunley became the first submarine to sink an enemy warship (and sank itself in the process). At times I found myself mentally substituting \\"outer space\\" for \\"under sea,\\" just to help me analogize the situation. Despite that, the plot and action were as riveting now as they were when I first read it twenty years ago. I did find myself, now as then, skimming over much of Verne's extensive scientific descriptions of undersea flora and fauna, etc., but that might be my own failing as a reader -- when I did take the time to read Verne's descriptions, I did sometimes catch the same sense of aquatic wonder I remember from watching films like _The Life Aquatic_.From what I've read, the Mercier translation this is based on contains a number of translation errors, cuts out about 20% of the text, etc. Corrected, completed, updated ebook editions of this classic are available on Amazon, but they cost money -- I've been unable to find an out-of-copyright, corrected, complete, and free edition. For readers on a budget, though, this is probably the version you remember, and if read in the right way -- keeping in mind the era in which it was written, and skimming whenever the science gets too dry or detailed for you -- it's still quite entertaining.Verne did write a sequel, _The Mysterious Island_, also available in the kindle free store; the better translation is available here:The Mysterious Island."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"I could not believe this version of 20,000 leagues under the sea. I learned so much from this book. All the other movies and stories that I heard about Captain Nemo were not even close to all the adventures that he goes on in this book. When I think about the movie by Walt Disney and then remember the book I realize that the movie was about 1/4 of the books adventures.All the adventures that I never heard about before like the hunt on the sea floor with the electric bullets, the Arabian tunnel under the sea, Santorin Island the Grecian Archipelago, the volcanoes of the Mediterranean, the Bay of Vigo with all the treasures, the size of the mountains in Atlantis, the adventure at the South Pole, the fight with all the sperm whales, his home Island and the production of salt to run his electric engines.There is so much more to this story than what I have heard before and in this edition the foot notes are excellent. I especially like the story of Arachne and how the name of Arachnid came to mean spiders. The footnotes explain all the literary references which are helpful to understanding the characters. There is so much information here about the sea world in an adventure that makes each moment exciting.Verne must have done so much research for this book to get all the scientific information correct. I never thought they knew all those things about the sea at that time.I was surprised by the character of Nemo who never seemed to go after anyone unless he was attacked. The whole idea that he chased after all forms of warships was something made up in Hollywood. Nemo never seemed to want to even deal with people. The story of Nemo's life at the end of the book explains many of his behaviors.The description of all the types of food that they were constantly eating was interesting you never knew what they were going to catch in the Nautilus' nets.I thought the adventure at the South Pole was the best of all with the predicament that they got into. It was the most adventurous and had the most suspense.I do not know why a book like this is not required reading for high school kids they would learn so much as well as adults. There is so much science geography, ichthyology, astronomy practical uses of physics etc.I would recommend this book to everyone who likes science and adventure."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"One of the great problems with Jules Verne is that in the English speaking world he is relagated to the category of &quot;Boys' Own Adventures&quot;. On the Continent, however, he is considered a brilliant social commentator, and biting satirist, AND a man who predicted the future. This is a volume that helps set matters to the right.If you know of &quot;20,000 Leagues&quot; already, you will find little different at first. The plot is still the plot. Nemo is still Nemo, Prof. Aronnax is still pompous and fascinated by the Nautilus and Ned Land....Ned Land is a flaming socialist.This is one of the major shifts between the original French and the &quot;cleaned up&quot; English editions. Most of the science of the day was pulled out as a &quot;dull read&quot; and all the Socialism, anti-English remarks, and other commentaries of a &quot;questionable nature&quot; were excised. We Americans have unfortunately been until only very recently only able to find these poor early translations, or translations based on these poor translations. There is much more to Verne than submarines and diving suits. He is a man with a vision of his times, both scientific and political, and his books underline this strongly.English readers, demand your Verne well-translated! Do not allow yourself to be fobbed off with bowlderized versions! To be able to read as he wrote himself (well, in English, for those of us who don't read French...) is a greater pleasure than merely an amusing old science-fiction story from the 19th century. Reading this book, as Verne /meant/ it to be read, if a pleasure, but also a struggle to understand ourselves and our relationship to the oceans themselves."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"This is Jules Verne at his best, creating the enigmatic character of Captain Nemo.The setting is the mid-nineteenth century. Deadly and mysterious calamities continue to befall ocean-going vessels, with wild reports by survivors that the culprit is a sea monster large enough to ram and sink ships. French professor M. Aronnax finds himself aboard the Abraham Lincoln, a ship charged with finding and destroying the beast. Accompanying him is his loyal servant, Conseil. The ship succeeds in locating the leviathan, but it, too, falls victim to a deadly attack. Aronnax, Conseil, and a Canadian harpooner named Ned Land are the sole survivors--rescued by none other than the \\"monster\\" itself, which turns out not to be flesh and bone, but the world's largest and most technically advanced submarine.They meet Captain Nemo, the owner, inventor, and sovereign leader of the flag-less ship, Nautilus. He explains that they're now his prisoners for life, though they will be treated well and are free to roam the ship. Thus begins an underwater tour of the planet, narrated by the fascinated Aronnax. With today's knowledge of the seas, some of the action is laughable, but at the time this was leading-edge science fiction. Verne's vision of submarine technology, the use of electricity, scuba operations, and various other things is uncanny and typical of great science fiction writers' ability to foretell the future. The ridiculous episodes include traversing an underwater tunnel beneath the Suez to the Mediterranean; a visit to Atlantis; and a trip to the South Pole under the ice, where they break through the surface for a look-see. This would be difficult, considering that the ice is more than a mile thick with a continent of solid rock below. But remember that when Verne wrote the book in 1869, Antarctica had not been explored and remained a virtual myth.The enduring lure of 20,000 Leagues, though, is Verne's Captain Nemo. It takes the entire book (and then some) to learn who this genius Nemo really is. What horrible ordeal has produced such a cynical man, one driven to build the self-sustaining Nautilus, to swear off all contact with the \\"civilized\\" world, never to touch land again, and to ruthlessly and brutally defend himself against any perceived threat? At one glance we see a maniacal scientist worthy of a James Bond thriller. But at closer inspection, Verne has captured the timeless personification of angst over the errors and excesses of Man's interminable war against Nature and himself. Aspects of this same character can today be found in political and environmental activism throughout the world. Actually, it strikes a cord with us all; everyone wants at some time to build what today would amount to a spaceship and shove off from this screwed up planet, saying, \\"Adios, idiots. It's your mess now.\\" --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Big Ice."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"This is the &#34;classic&#34; old translation by Louis Mercier most of us read and loved.

The title is French but don't worry, the book is entirely in English with an informative introduction by Walter. This great new translation is wordier than the old one, but it comes as close, in English, to what Verne actually wrote in French--and it is complete. I would strongly urge you to compare them--especially if you are a true Jules Verne fan."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is a masterful science fiction classic and the crowning achievement of Verne's impressive literary legacy. While the story itself is absorbing, it is the character of the enigmatic Captain Nemo that makes this novel so successful. Many of the characters we meet in Verne's fiction are one-dimensional; while eccentric, a man like Professor Lidenbrock in Journey to the Centre of the Earth is easy to understand, seemingly driven by science and nothing else. In contrast, Captain Nemo is an incredibly complex man whom neither the reader nor the protagonist is ever really able to understand. He has forsaken all of humanity and retreated beneath the sea, yet he shows great compassion to his crewmen and to the poor on earth; he is generally self-absorbed and emotionless, yet we see glimpses of an emotional trauma that constantly afflicts him and is capable of destroying him. He has suffered a great loss at some point in his life, and his sorrow is matched only by a drive for vengeance against his unnamed oppressors. Captain Nemo is one of the most interesting, delightfully mysterious characters in all of literature.As for the story, a naturalist, his assistant, and a harpooner join a party in search of a giant sea creature which has attacked a couple of ships. They are knocked overboard and find themselves saved by the monster, which turns out to be a submarine manned by a mysterious crew of sailors. Captain Nemo requires them to stay on board the Nautilus permanently because he wants to keep the existence of his submarine a secret from the world. The three men sail on the Nautilus for ten months, exploring the world's oceans and seas. They marvel at the animal life under the waves; explore underground forests, oyster beds, deep trenches; gaze with somber eyes at great numbers of sunken vessels; fight off giant squids and dangerous sharks; cast their eyes upon the sunken continent of Atlantis; and burrow underneath the polar ice caps to emerge at the South Pole. All the while, they hope to escape and return to their homelands, although the naturalist hesitates to leave his traveling laboratory until such a time as Captain Nemo's emotions become dangerously unbalanced.All in all, this is an incredibly rich, fascinating novel with a poignant yet powerful conclusion. Contemporary readers must have been overpowered by Verne's descriptions of this unknown sailing vessel and the exploits the sub was capable of. That magical element is missing from modern reader's reactions, but this does little to hinder the overall effect of the story. There is one negative aspect to the book--the naturalist and his assistant go out of their way to name and catalogue virtually every animal, mineral, and plant they discover. This is interesting to a point, but the plot often finds itself bogged down for a couple of pages while the reader is bombarded with a veritable encyclopedia of scientific names which are virtually unpronounceable and largely meaningless to his/her ears. These interludes are the only things slowing down the story, however. It is a joy to read the adventures these men have under the sea, and it is even more fascinating to ponder the mind of Captain Nemo. Even the unseen depths of the sea cannot offer the reader a mystery as deep and powerful as that of the Nautilus' exceptional captain."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"Having seen the movie a couple times this was the first time I read the book and was surprised to see a significant number of unexpected differences. Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is arguably the first technical thriller, launching a genre which has since grown wildly in popularity and includes most of Michael Chricton's work. It is a very imaginative book, the story of the mysterious Captain Nemo -haunted by an implied but never explained past - who has built for himself and his crew the submarine Nautilus to be free of the laws of man and to live successfully and sustainably on the bounty of the world's oceans, which he intrepidly explores in all its wonders. Inevitably he is chased by the main characters, Ned the Harpooner, Mr. Arronax the professor and Conseil his man-servant, in the frigate USS Abraham Lincoln. Unlike the movie the story is told entirely by Mr. Arronax and Ned is more a minor character, and a stolid Canadian as opposed to the boisterous and fun loving American in the movie. Also unlike the movie the Nautilus does not sink the Lincoln, but in a duel vents it with steam that throws our three main characters overboard whom are then rescued after the Lincoln, ignorant to the fact they are no longer onboard, retreats from the scene.Thus begins a promising story of mystery and adventure, the possible drama of Captain Nemo being chased by worldly forces in his incredible Nautilus, the tension between the captives who are experiencing the amazing wonders of the ocean depths firsthand and their captor who cannot ever let them go without losing his own freedom, and the chance for exciting adventures. While all of these things are delivered in the book, they are done so very anachronistically (obviously), with the drama, tension and adventure being there - and being very creatively crafted - but also being very subdued and literally drowned in an ocean of Mr. Arronax describing the latin names of the sea life he sees outside the Nautilus's window. This captures the fascination of the age with Natural History versus today's focus on excitement and adventure in these types of novels. There are many times were the book gets very, very dry as the author rattles of names that you have no idea what they refer to, and even if you google them the only hits you will get are the passages in the book itself! Based on this, the fact that this translation cuts out some 20% of the book is probably not a bad thing.Nonetheless there are some great moments of natural beauty and adventure. Jules Verne showed some incredible predictive power in describing the structural design, diving operations and maneuverability, and life support systems of a submarine, being basically spot on before anything beyond the Turtle of Revolutionary War heritage had ever been put to sea. The myriad undersea \\"terrains\\" the characters experience are particularly cool and fun. Relative to the movie the giant squid attack is underwhelming, but a much better scene that never made it to the film is one where after discovering the south pole (something Verne got wrong obviously) the Nautilus is caught in between two icebergs and must dig itself out before its air supply runs out. But there are some drawbacks too. There are some shockingly dark moments for a book aimed towards younger men from the 1860's which seem to imply they are leading somewhere and could have been great plot tension builders, but they are never fully fleshed out, and neither is the character they are supposed to be windows into, the reclusive, tortured yet brilliant Captain Nemo. The book ends quickly and inconclusively, feeling like a great set up for a story that ends as more travel log than character story or adventure yarn. Nonetheless the book is short and relatively easy to read despite it's older grammatical style which can sound very strange today.The job the publisher did however is spotty. The cover design of the book is very well done, but the editing is poor with many glaring typos throughout the text.All in all the movie is much better as a movie than a direct adaptation of the book would have been, with Ned Land turned into a main character that an American audience can connect with (unlike the highly intellectual and uninspiring Mr. Arronax as main character of the book or the turgid Canadian version of Ned Land), Captain Nemo is more explained as a character and pitted more against Mr. Arronax as two opposing sides of a moral coin, and the movie has a more solid story and conclusion. But the book has it's own advantages and overall is worth reading, especially for its historical significance."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"This one of the best Jules Verne books. It is a must read for everyone. Even my teenage daughter enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"I thought that the book had one of the best plot lines I've ever seen, reguardless of the fact that there is only slight building up to the climax. The only thing that I didn't think was that good about the book was that about every other page, Jules Verne would go into a paragraph description of the animals. For example, he would say something like: I just saw a tuna. But not the normal tuna, it was yellow-bellied, had dorsal fins that went at a downward angle, etc.\\" Otherwise, I thought it was a great read and well worth the money. I will be purchasing more of Jules Verne's books very soon. I highly suggest for you to read this book. Another thing, if you enjoyed watching the 1954 \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea Film,\\" I highly suggest the book because the movie only gives a small picture of what actually occurred during their submarine venture and the book tells you everything, and the occurrences are just amazing.The novel basically tells the story of Professor Arronax, Ned Land and Conseil who get taken aboard the Nautilus and experiences many adverntures, such as going to Atlantis, an underwater hunt, getting trapped in an ice block and much more."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"Verne is the original, there's no question about that. Frankly, Verne is science fiction for people who don't like science fiction. His imagination in creating a submarine, particularly one that could remain submerged for days at a time, is almost mind-boggling. Also, he imagines something very much like real-life diving equipment for the scenes on the sea floor and dealing with the squid."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS STORY TO ANYONE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A GREAT UNDERSEA ADVENTURE BOOK.

This is my favorite of Jules Verne's novels, although I admit I have not read them all. Not only does this book inspire interest in marine biology, but it also makes one think about social and psychological issues, leading the reader to evaluate what and why things are right and wrong. This is a book that can be appreciated by young and old alike, and it is one that I keep on hand to be re-read as often as I have the chance."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"This book begins when Professor M. Aronnax and his assistant Conseil are asked to investigate ships that are being mysteriously rammed from under the water. Aronnax's conclostion is that the ships are being attacked by a giant narwhale. He is asked to come on the USS Aberaham Lincon. So he accepts the invatation and with in to weeks he is abord the newest ship in the American Navy. When on the ship he meets the canadian harpooner Ned Land. After a while they see a glowing green light this is the light the witnesses discribed before being attacked. Even though the men abord the ship are shotting the \\"narwhale\\" it didn't seem to have any effect. Suddenly they are rammed sending Conseil, Land, and Aronnax over board and puts a giant hole in the Aberaham Lincon. Then they are captured by Captian Nemo. This is probaly my favorite begining in any book I have ever read. Then Nemo gives Aronnax a tour of his submarine. It is the size of Moby Dick and is run by electric motors. Later in the book Nemo take Aronnax, Conseil, and Ned Land walking on the bottom of the sea. If you look at the origanal pictures in the book thier diving gear looks like modern scuba gear. After taveling thousans of miles under water Nemo lets Aronnax, Land, and Conseil go hunting on a small island. Here they are attacked by savages luckly they all get back to the Natilus saftly. When they get inside the boat Nemo tells them to open the hatches and lets them come in when the savages are running down the stair way the are all electicuted. This is one of the best parts of the book. I highly suggest this book to everbody."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"I read a rusty 1954 edition of this book and found it splendid. Even though this book was filled with information about electricity, how it gets it from the sea, how much the \\"Nautilus\\" weighs in tonnes, how the \\"Nautilus\\" can reach the speed of 50 miles per hour etc. it still was a marvellous book. Jules Verne puts stacks of information into this book. But here's the amazing bit of this information. This book was first published in 1871. 1871?Why 1871?Nothing like electricity was invented in 1871. Or other stuff. Jules Verne imagined science when hardly any of it was invented. None of it. None of it at all. That's why, 20,000 leagues under the sea and other of his novels were amazing.Also, the characters in this novel are likeable. The nature and the stuff Captain Nemo, Pierre Arronax, Ned Land and Conseil see under the sea seem so real while reading this classic. The peculiar but wonderful character of Captain Nemo makes this book wonderful to read.This book appeals to children and adults.In 1866, a strange thing at sea captures everybody by surprise. It is some sort of peculiar monster or floating reef. The \\"Helvetia\\", \\"Columbus\\", \\"Scotia\\" and \\"Shannon\\" all spot this creature. People wonder what exactly is it. Pierre Arronax, Proffesor of the Museum of Paris is called by Captain Farragut of the \\"Abraham Lincoln\\" to capture this gigantic cetacean with all these harpooners, especially one called Ned Land. Ned Land is strong and full of uncommon skill. He is also a Canadian. When Pierre Arronax falls off ship, after Land aims his harpoon at the creature, jets of water spray on the bridge of the ship which throws many people off into the dangerous waters. The propeller and rudder are broken. Two other people who join Pierre are Conseil and Land. The creature was actually a submarine called the \\"Nautilus\\". It takes the three into it where they meet the mysterious Captain Nemo...Further on they meet savages, giant octopuses and indulge with the wonderful sea life which makes this wonderful tale enjoyable. But all with Captain Nemo. The four take on a ride of their life. Thanks to Jules Verne people have been excited since. Buy this and treasure forever. I have an old 1954 edition.This probablyis his best book of all. Other books include Round The World In 80 Days, Mysterious Island and other Verne books.+++++By StephenK"},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"Book Review by Spencer LantosI read 2000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne. What this book is about is people who go under the sea to make discoveries. In the book they face some chalanges such as bad weather being attacked by sea monsters and being attacked by Indians. In the end of the book they find what their looking for but I can't give that away.My opinion on this book was it was good. It had lots of action and if you like adventure books I think you would enjoy this book. Their aren't very many boring parts of this book, and it almost never annoying. Whenever a good part of the book is over a new one starts and that is what I like about it.I would recommend this book because I liked it a lot.

I've wanted to read this since I was a kid, and I am sorry I waited until I retired. Some of the biological naming discussions get somewhat tedious, but as a whole the story is great! However, don't think it is quite like the Walt Disney movie version, because it is not. It starts out that way, but proceeds through the story in a somewhat different way, and ends differently.

I love science fiction and classic novels so Verne should be perfect for me, right? Well... I can't say that Verne wasn't influential and his ideas are spectacular which is why so many movies have been based on his books but I have yet to read a Verne book that exceeded or even met my expectations.First, all his characters, despite different names and motivations, are all the same; perfect English gentlemen. This is not uncommon for writers from this era but when a Canadian harpooner like Ned Land uses phrases like \`By Jove' it rings false. Rudyard Kipling wrote Captains Courageous 27 years later and created sailors that felt absolutely authentic. Verne's characters seem to be created for a specific purpose. Captain Nemo is there to explain in detail the working of his Nautilus and other inventions while Professor Aronnax's role is to gush over Nemo's discoveries. I don't believe that any of the other members of Nemo's crew ever say a single word in the book and are simply window dressing.The second big problem is that Verne's science is often dubious. I'm not talking about science that was still questionable in Verne's time but established science and physical facts going way back. Verne seems completely unaware of things like encumbrance or the effects of high elevation. In this book Verne's consistently and often dramatically increases the size of sea life. Also, it can be somewhat dull reading constant facts and figures about the speed, depth, volume of air etc of the Nautilus. The book just goes on and on with Nemo relaying fact after fact while M. Aronnax listens in rapt attention. It also spends a near eternity describing all of the flora and fauna and without an actual plot to pin it to it gets very dull. The layout of the Nautilus is very unrealistic with no apparent attempt to maximize the usage of space. Nemo has a full size organ in his spacious cabin. Actual submarines are very constrained spaces.In order to create a compelling story Disney greatly expanded on Nemo's quest for revenge which is barely mentioned in the book. Disney also greatly expanded Ned Land's role to the improvement of the story and did a very nice bit of casting having him played by Kirk Douglas. The famous scene where the Nautilus is attacked by a giant squid (multiple squids in the book) only occupies a couple of pages. Mostly the book is just the Nautilus cruising all over the world occasionally getting stuck. That's about it. It's as if Verne couldn't come up with a plot to wrap around his idea of a mysterious captain and his incredible machine.I have read quite a few of Verne's novels but this one may have the most anemic plot of them all. 20,000 is leagues is much more serious than \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" and \`In Search of the Castaways' (which I really didn't enjoy) but it's not particularly compelling.

Aronnax, Consiel, and Ned Land partake in were vividly portrayed in the book. Also the Nautilus was really amazing, in two ways. First in how powerful the ship was, and second how Verne could have created the idea for such a vessel for the period of time he wrote the book.From the underwater forests of Crespo, to the Manaar Bank, then to Atlantis and the South Pole, the book made it feel as if I was traveling along with them. In addition to the locales, the Nautilus itself was amazing, with it's speed, strength and technology. On top of that, there was also, the walks on the bottom of the ocean which were described with amazing detail.Capitan Nemo was the most complex character I've read about in a long time. Throughout their time on the ship, Aronnax, Consiel, and Land never see much of Nemo, and when they do, he's not a man of many words. He is, however a man of great intelligence, skill, and wealth, who decided to sevre all ties with civilization, for reasons that appear unknown to us.Professor Aronnax began thinking some monsterous narwhal type beast is destroying ships in the ocean at the beginning of the story, so himself, Consiel, and Ned Land set out to discover what it really is, and find themselves amidst something completely different.This book was a treat to read with all it's adverture and exploring.

You get more of Verne's politics here than in earlier translations including such memeorable phrases as: \\"The world needs no new continents, it needs new people.\\"The characters are well developed and you can indentify with all of them and how they view their effective captivity aboard the Nautilus. Captain Nemo is a wonderful character and Verne gives the reader just enough information about him to keep you enthralled but not enough to remove the mystery. The intro relates that Nemo was supposed to be a Polish aristocrat, getting back at the world for the the atrocities the Russians had commited against his family. But when Hetzel his publisher balked at the idea because of the new Franco Russian alliance Verne decided to remove any trace of nationality.What else can be said? The English is not archaic!!

During a fight, Professor Aronnax, his faithful servant Conseil, and Ned Land, a Canadian harpoon who was also on board the Abraham Lincoln was all thrown overboard. After a while floating in the sea, M. Aronnax and Conseil found a submarine. M. Aronnax had no energy left in him to climb on and neither did Conseil. Just then, someone grabbed M. Aronnax and helped him onto the submarine, and then Conseil. After recovering, M. Aronnax saw that the one who saved him was none other than Ned Land.They did not go undiscovered for long since Ned decided to bang on the steel cover. After a few minutes, a few men appeared and then dragged them down to a small room. Soon another man appeared. M. Aronnax decided to start explaining why they were there, first in French, then in English, German and even in schoolboy Latin. A few days later they saw the man again. This time he spoke in French and made them a deal. Though they were prisoners disguised under the title of guest on board the Nautilus, they had the time of their lives visiting each of the secrets the seas and oceans had to offer, or at least the Professor. After a battle with nature, the Professor and his companions floated onto the shore tom their old lives in humanity, though none of them ever forgot that miraculous trip in the Nautilus.

Even today, the story is as fresh and thought provoking as in the era it was written. A true visionary, Jules Verne sensed the intrinsic evil of unbridled science, and the natural tendency to adopt technology for military applications, or in this adaptation, a scientist's disdain for the use of weapons for military conquests. Rich, intelligent characters are blended with vivid etchings of 18th century sea faring adventures.

It was an amazing trip through the globe I have taken in several day. But the book has an ending that's leaving too many questions unanswered, which I would rather it have given me much more explainations. And the book seems to be too plain, old, because it was written such a long time ago, and the author had no intention of making the lines exciting in a way we accept today, and which is also a result of too many unrelated stories been piled together without a common base, basically, the book has pretty much no plot. That's a reason you might consider not buying the book.But I liked the book a lot, I can not understand how can the author write one story after another that just get more and more surprising, and the way he brings out each story.

But, of all his novels, the most wondrous, the most well known, the most popular and the best is 20,000 Leagues under the Sea.The book's plot is pretty well known to the literature world: Captain Nemo has built an underwater ship called the Nautilus. Three people land on the ship and are taken aboard: French Professor M. Aronnax, a famous French scientist, Conseil, his servant and Ned Land, a Canadian Harpooner. Some of the highlights of their incredible adventure include getting trapped under ice in the South Pole, battling giant squid, exploring lost shipwrecks as well as the lost city of Atlantis and encountering the undersea forests of Crespo.What is most amazing is that Verne's predicted how subs would work years later. Also, the U.S.S Nautilus went under the South Pole almost a century after Verne's Nautilus. The book is however not problem proof. It takes a while to develop. The Nautilus is originally mistaken for a sea monster. So a few are spent looking for this \\"Sea Monster\\". But this is forgivable.

But that's perfectly OK, because the rest of the book has plenty of things going for it. Jules Verne had a very good imagination. His depiction of the submarine turned out to be quite accurate with regards to what actually was turned into reality during the 20th century.

These books are very colorful, with lots of illustrations and photos of genuine artifacts, maps, and people from the era in which the story is set. Side panel text gives background information about the author, pictures and story. These &quot;additions&quot; (which do not detract from, but only enhance the story) help the young reader (and the adult too!) put the story into context. It is like getting both a classic and a pictorial history book rolled into one! The text is easy to read. My daughter is now 9, and reading the books on her own.

I think you should read this book before you leave High School. On a scale of one to five, one being the worst and five being the best. I would give it a five. I really enjoyed this book. The characters were very realistic and had life and emotion so you could relate to the characters their fear their joy and their sadness. They are three-dimensional characters. Not some flat two-dimensional characters who not feel and just act. It's easy to see why it's a classic. The book has a lot of action and adventure and even some mystery and lots of suspense. If you love any of these things, you should read this book. I found the way Conseil talks strange. Talking always in the third person I mean. Who actually goes around calling themselves by their first name? Looking up all the different animal and plant names that appear in this story must have taken forever as well as knowing where all these places were. He amazing he can fit all this information into one book an make it interesting. From reading this book, it refreshed my memory of the places in the world. The time from they were captured until they escaped only lasted six months. It seems to see all that they did see would have taken over a year. They did travel 60,000 miles. 1 leauge = 3 miles.

Can't go wrong."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"This is Verne's classic novel about Captain Nemo and his submarine Nautilus. What really fascinated me when reading this story and other Verne novels was not only Verne's contributions to the science fiction genre, but his founding of a whole new genre, one that, as far as I know, he has never been given credit. I think Verne was the first to write the techno-novel, a work that is filled with technical details ala Tom Clancy. For this novel, Verne did considerable research to describe what was known as accurately as possible. Professor Arronax and his servant Conseil board a U. S. ship that is searching for a monster that has sunk a number of other ships. They discover that it isn't a monster at all but a submarine, captained by a mysterious man known only as Nemo (Verne will present readers with Nemo once again in &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;). Arronax, Conseil, and an American harpooner named Ned Land travel with Nemo and see many wonderous things and have many adventures. Verne's &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot; has gotten some very poor reviews over the decades since it first appeared in 1869. In many cases, it was because of the translation and not because of Verne. A number of the early translators inserted their own sections with their own ideas and opinions and deleted much of Verne's own words. So, readers should be aware of the translator.

The hardcover is strong and the silk bookmark is useful. The only thing that bothers me (and is somewhat minor) are the footnotes. The translator added footnotes throughout the book to explain some words, names, and cultural references from long ago. Some were useful, but others were so painfully obvious and still part of modern cultural memory that I wonder why the translator even took the time to footnote them. Also, the translator mentions in one footnote that he chose to omit a passage where Jules Verne explains in great detail the books which are in Nemo's library. In English classes I was always taught that one of the most interesting aspects of a book is what the author had the character(s) reading. It may have been a long and painful passage, but I would have rather had the choice as a reader to skim over an unending list of French titles from the 1800's rather than have the translator make that decision for me.Additionally, there are questions included for discussion at the end of the book. Without getting off on too much of a tangent, the questions remind me of all that is wrong with shallow and inane stock questions in books. I'm tempted to cut the last few pages out of my copy.Despite my views on the footnotes and questions, I love this book and thoroughly enjoyed reading it.

After several shipwrecks, the Abraham Lincoln is dispatched to kill what the world believes to be some kind of animal. After a battle with the \\"creature\\", the three main characters, Professor Aronnax, his servant/research assistant Conseil, and Canadian \\"King of the Harpooners\\" Ned Land are swept overboard. When they awake, they find that they are prisoners aboard the Nautilus, a submersible vessel under the command of the mysterious Captain Nemo and his equally enigmatic crew.Captain Nemo refuses to allow the three men to leave his ship, but otherwise treats them well. They are allowed the run of the ship and Professor Aronnax soon becomes quite taken with the research opportunities afforded to him by the submarine. His assistant Conseil is happy to do whatever his master wishes, but Ned Land becomes increasingly agitated and determined to escape as the story progresses. Dominating the tale is the figure of Captain Nemo, a man who has forsworn his allegiances to country and humanity to command his own destiny under the world's seas and oceans.The Nautilus takes the men on many strange and exciting adventures. Verne peppers the story with scientific detail. It's mostly fascinating, although the multiple listings of fish, fauna, and flora can become cumbersome at times. The novel is at its best when Aronnax is wrestling with the mystery of Captain Nemo and his motives, as well as his own conflicting desires to remain on the Nautilus and explore the reaches of the deep or to join Ned Land's quest for freedom.Stirring in places, the story of Captain Nemo and his amazing undersea vessel shouldn't be missed by any fan of science fiction/fantasy. After all, Verne helped create the genre. The version of the novel I purchased was the Signet Classic series translated by Mendor T. Brunetti, who also provides a foreword. Walter James Miller provides a fascinating afterward concerning the inaccuracies of previous translations."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"This book is a classic. No question. That's why I chose to read it. When it came out in the 1860s, it was science fiction and gripped the imaginations of many. A ship that could travel under the water! But reading it in 2010, much of the novelty of the book has been realized. We have had submarines for nearly a century.But even aside from that, there is little plot to the novel. It reads as if it were written by a committee at National Geographic. It's a survey of all the unique items and places in the world's oceans. The little plot there is involves the protagonist trying to escape from the ship. And the ending (not to ruin it...) is a total cop-out and disappointing.I was hoping this book would stand the test of time, like The Time Machine or even Around the World in 80 Days.

The major flaws in this translation led to a slew of critiques by the scientific and literary communities (that did not refer to the original French).Fortunately now there is a new version:Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea/Completely Restored and Annotated.

The story starts when a strange type of sea life surfaces and a crew is sent out to find what this creature is. When the creature is found, the crew immediately attacks it.

It has a slower, more deliberate pace than today's readers are probably used to, but it is still a good read. I don't think I need to say much about it, because the story is pretty well known. But I will say that Captain Nemo is a very intiguing character, and people interested in Victorian Era fiction should definitely get this book."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is a masterpiece that should not be missed by anyone. In this book, the reader is taken on an unbelievable journey aboard the Nautilus, an ingeniously built submarine, venturing the mysterious waters of the world. Jules Verne chooses to describe marine life in incredible detail (or maybe even overboard in detail) in this fictional novel. One may wonder how much research Verne did on the ocean in order to write this story. I believe readers who find life under the sea interesting will best enjoy this book, but the rest may still be fascinated. Not only is this novel a great learning experience of the sea, it is also packed with surprises, which includes a visit to the legendary, sunken Atlantis. Verne even decides to include a bit of mystery in the story. During the sea-voyage, the submarine undergoes a mysterious collision that the captain refuses to tell. I found myself dreading to speed through the pages to complete the book, hoping the author would reveal the solution to this mystery towards the end. Even though I was greatly fascinated by this novel, I still admit that I was disappointed in some ways after completing it. After finishing the book, I had discovered that the title of this book might have been a little misleading. Instead of descending a total of twenty thousand leagues under the sea, the Nautilus actually travels a total of twenty thousand leagues submerged in the sea. One may even find the ending of the story a little too spontaneous and shortly written. As a conclusion, I must say that, even though I did encounter some disappointments, I enjoyed reading the book and I do not regret reading it."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"First of all, I was disappointed when I realized that we're going 20,000 HORIZONTAL leagues while under the sea (not to a depth of 20,000 leagues). But my main disappointment with this book is the lack of development or progression. It's just a travelogue. You could scramble the order of most of the chapters, and it would still read the same. And how dare Verne take us to Atlantis and spend less than two pages there? None of the characters is any different by the end of the book, and we never really find out what it is that makes Captain Nemo the way he is.That said, the nineteenth century science fiction is wonderful. Verne's visions of technology and even geography are fascinating. Will modern science fiction be so accurate in 100 years?"},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"The begining of this book, really attracts and I read it excited thinking that the rest would be interesting, but as it continued I really was getting bored, so I just read the last part and quited reading it.

While the story is, actually, quite good, the language is somewhat stilted and the book takes a while to really get going. I think many young readers will be puzzled by the vocabulary and will be bored. Eventually, the story picks up. However, I was bored in the 1950's and cannot imagine that today's youngsters will do much better. I think that the Walt Disney movie is a much better bet if you want to expose your child to a story that was a true classic. This is one of the few cases where a movie has an advantage over the written word."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"The story basically begins with the very intelligent Professor Arronax calculating basic mesuremenets. He's a modern french biologist during this time period. The professor had somewhat of an understudy, an apprentice if you will, named Conseil. Conseil was just about as skilled as the professor as far as classification, and knowing so much information about just about everything. One day, the professor got a letter that invited him to go on a select trip to hunt the killer narwhal. Mysteriously, several ships had been rammed, and had a triangular shaped scar on the spot where the uncanny shipmates had decided that the narwhal hit. So Professor Arronax and Conseil went to examine the accidents.They get on the ship and meet a Canadian harpooner named Ned Land. He told them that he was the best at what he does, and that he was ready to take out the narwhal. After a while, they come across the infamous narwhal. They find it strange that the narwhal is about three times as long as the ship they're on, and that it glows. The professor's ship is attacked, and they are stranded in the ocean, they climb aboard the narwahal to find out that it is in actuality a submarine. They finally meet a strange man named Captain Nemo, who explains to them that it is his ship and that the professor, Conseil, and Ned Land can stay as long as they go with him on a trip around the world in his submarine, the Nautilus. They begin to go on amazing trips, and don't know what exciting thing is to come up to them next."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"It is a good book, but overall, felt like half the time he was overly descriptive and made it DRY, got 70% done and tried to finish it, but had to come back to it... Felt as though the Prof does want to stay but the other part of him wants to leave, half the time is spend describing things, or fish, or coordinates, and history, it is a very descriptive book, but it does get very dry at times as you want to just move to the next page to stop reading the over drawn descriptions"},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"As someone who tends to enjoy older adventure fiction more than the average person (I quite like Conan Doyle's non Sherlock books, like most Stevenson, love Sabatini, etc.), I was looking forward to plunging into this classic tale of adventure and exploration. Somewhere near the middle its narrator captures the essence of the book with the following unintentionally prescient sentence: \\"To anyone but myself, who had a great love of the sea, the hours below must have seemed long and monotonous.\\" That's an excellent summation of Verne's story of the almost magical electric submarine The Nautilus, it's imperious and mysterious Captain Nemo, and the three outsiders who circumnavigate the globe in it. Basically, unless you have some kind of strong interest in marine biology, it is an incredibly tedious read. Granted, it is an impressive feat of imagination for its time (the 1860s), but the amazing technologies described don't pack any kind of punch for the modern reader, and the exotic locales are now the stuff of the Travel Channel.The story is very simple. There is some kind of large creature menacing sea traffic around the world, so an international expedition is launched to try and find it and capture or kill it. Among those joining this voyage are the famous French naturalist Professor Aronnax, his heroic servant Conseil, and legendary French-Canadian harpoonist Ned Land. When the American frigate leading the expedition finally encounters the beast, combat ensues and they are thrown into the water, only to wind up the prisoners of the Nautilus. Captain Nemo decides that having seen his vessel's interior, they must remain prisoners for life. Thus, they embark on a grand tour of ocean with this man who has forsaken mankind and its evil ways.Alas this tour turns out to be a barrage of naturalist classifications of everything they see, complete with Latin names and various characteristics. This is fairly evocative the first time, but by the third has gotten repetitive, and by the tenth just downright sleep-inducing. Not to mention a litany of latitudes and longitudes to mark their path, as if one were reading in one hand and following along with an atlas in the other. Which is not to say that stuff doesn't happen, it does--it's just not very interesting. They visit underwater forests, the South Pole, Atlantis, coral reefs, famous shipwrecks, encounter danger from a tricky passage, icebergs, giant octopi, and fierce island people, and yet none of it is particularly dramatic or well done.Matters aren't helped by stilted scenes where Professor Aronnax asks Nemo how some aspect of the submarine works and receives a lengthy lecture outlining the scientific basis and processes for how such and such works. There are far too many instances where Aronnax is simply playing the straight man to Nemo's genius: \\"Gosh, we're really in a jam now Captain Nemo, what are we going to do!\\" \\"My dear professor, yet again you underestimate the capabilities of the Nautilus, all I have to do is....\\" etc. In that sense, Verne's imagination is deployed in a relatively wooden manner which does little to make it compelling for the modern reader.Finally, the central conflict of the three captives versus their captor is lame. They're stuck, they can't do anything to escape, and that never changes until the merciful end, where they are whisked away yet again. Again, no tension or drama. The one really intriguing character is Captain Nemo, who rails misanthropically about mankind and refuses to divulge his nationality, and speaks to his crew in an unrecognizable language. Throughout, one keeps waiting for a revelation as who he is and why he hates the world of men, but other than brief allusion to his having had a wife and child who were killed, there's no payoff! This final straw is an infuriating end to a stultifying book. Sometimes the \\"classics\\" ain't what they used to be."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"So, nearly 150 years have passed since this book has been published... and much of it has become just boring. I'm sure back then the description of how under-sea boats and suits work was thrilling, but now it's kind of... yup, I know that.He goes into deep detail about the marine life, many a time, and I just skimmed and skimmed and skimmed. Honestly, by the end of the book I just wanted it to be over with. It could possibly make a 4-star movie with the right effects today."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"A mysterious creature is haunting the seas, and Professor Aronnax is determined to discover the origins of the beast.

As we finished the third Verne novel we have approached I found myself lamenting a brilliant story bogged down by careless prose; I found that the language was flat and uninspired, and the sentence structure was unbelievably choppy. The failings of the writing itself took away from what would otherwise have been a book full of wonders, and I believe we will leave Verne buried once and for all."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"This version is Verne's original and it is the best.

And underwater boat was unheard of. By todays standards the book is not very exciting, but for its time it is very adventerous. The endless cataloging of the undersea life and the operation of the submarine all come out of the autor's head. There is one thing to note that I first read this book in grammer school and just re-read it. It is a shame that what was once considered a childrens book, has vocabulary that most of the Worlds High School students can not understand."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"'20,000 Leagues Under the Sea' is one of those classic stories by the wonderfully imaginative and clever Jules Verne that everyone has heard of but, alas, few have read ... at least here in America. I decided to give the book a try having just read (and enjoyed) the author's other classic 'The Time Machine'. '20,000 Leagues...' is a far more ambitious novel and, overall, even more enjoyable.The story is set in the late 1860s when the book was written. Due to unusual circumstance (..no spoilers here) three men (a naturalist, his manservant, and a whaler) are taken against their will onto a (then unheard of) submarine by the enigmatic Captain Nemo. For many months they circumnavigate the globe and cross all the oceans. Along the way the encounter the fantastic, some dramatic episodes, and even fleeting moments of comedy. The author goes into great detail of describing the wonders of the submarine. While of course much of the science he describes is a bit silly most of it is remarkably true to life. I am especially amazed at his foresight into electricity years before the lightbulb was invented. Monsieur Verne was truly a genius. And thankfully, he was a pretty good writer.But this book doesn't hit all the right notes. All the in-depth descriptions of amazing underwater flora and fauna gets rather repetitive. The middle third of the book is a bit of a tedious read. Thankfully the story tightens considerably towards the end, with a very surprising climax.Bottom line: an often overlooked classic that will probably bore younger readers but will enthrall adults. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"Verne's prophetic masterpiece still thrills readers over 100 years after its publication. In this adventure, French naturalist Pierre Aronnax is taken aboard the Nautilus, a secret high-technology submarine capable of high speeds. Aronnax meets the enigmatic Captain Nemo, a renegade against society with a strong desire for revenge against the enemy that drove him under the sea. This novel is one of the first examples of modern science fiction. The world of science fiction owes Jules Verne a great debt.This edition is particularly valuable. Most people aren't aware that the standard English translation is filled with lots of translation errors which botch the science of Verne's masterpiece. Also, the standard version cuts about 25% of the original French novel. This translation fixes the errors, and returns 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea's scientific accuracy (for that time). Also, the cut parts have been restored, so we can now enjoy reading a complete version of Verne's novel.If you love classic books, and you're interested in reading about one of the greatest characters in science fiction, you have to read this. Also fans of science fiction should read this to understand where their genre came from. If you've read the old standard translation, you have to read this edition to see it the way it was meant to be."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"My (10 year old) daughter got interested in '20,000 leagues' after reading the \\"Wishbone\\" version (go ahead and laugh). I went searching for the real thing to read with her, and came across this edition. With all of the missing content recovered, plus the annotations to fill in all sorts of additional information, the result is fascinating for adult readers. If you read the usual (butchered) version as a kid, you really owe yourself this one. All of the critiques of Verne over the years that tried to belittle his knowledge of science turn out to have been based on translations that whacked out what Verne really said -- they thought it was too dry and boring. Reading what he really said, plus the extensive footnotes that describe the state of knowledge at the time, make Verne's brilliance all the more astonishing. Just consider that he wrote about the Nautilus at a time when the Hunley was the state of the art!"},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"I havent read many books in my lifetime but I'd have to say that this is the best one I' ve ever read.

This fantastic tale of the adventures of an under-sea craft (written BEFORE their actual invention) fires the imagination of readers young and old. Verne's genius was his ability to create incredible (in his time) machines, around which he'd write believable stories with admirable characters and meaningful morals. As with the submarine Nautilus, many of his machines have since become modern realities."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"I can still remember reading 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA for the first time as a kid. I was fascinated by submarines and captivated by the story of this wonderful ship, capable of making all my dreams come true. I wanted to dive beneath the waves and accompany Professor Aronnax on his incredible journey. Reading it again after many years, I find that I am still impressed by the story. Not only is it quite prophetic for its day & age, the fact that the story is STILL captivating after all these years just goes to show that great literature is timeless. In what follows, my comments shall refer to the Bantam version of the novel, translated by Anthony Bonner. This translation (or another suitably modern translation) is critical to getting the most out of this novel, as I will touch upon later.There is something for everyone in this book. On the one hand, the reader is treated to a very scientific (at times, \\"too\\" scientific for many readers) tale of undersea exploration, mixed with a tale of adventure and intrigue. The Nautilus carries us to every ocean of the world, exploring the South Pole, the lost city of Atlantis, shipwrecks, a mysterious tunnel between the Arabian and Mediterranean seas, and so much more. On the other hand, Jules Verne has also managed to flesh out a human story, one focused on Captain Nemo and his mysterious past and hatred for Western civilization. While the \\"kid\\" in you will have your eyes fixed on the Nautilus's glass portal that reveals the wonders of the deep, the \\"adult\\" in you will be rapidly trying to figure out exactly \\"who\\" this captain is and why he has built this ship, capable of removing him permanently from society.Many have complained about Verne's tendency to lose the story for endless lists of scientific classification. It is not hard to see their point. Verne does go on and on about species of fish in a manner that loses the reader's interest after a short while. But there is nothing to prevent you from skimming over these passages and moving onto the story. That's what I do and I don't think I've sacrificed a thing in doing so. Moreover, I would recommend that you keep an atlas or wold map handy when you are reading. It is much more fun to read this novel if you can actually track where they are at each point in the novel.Those coming to this novel from the movies will either be happily impressed or disappointed. While the films borrow heavily from the novel, they tend to focus on certain elements of the story (enhancing the action) while forgetting about others. This is not the tale of a madman, destined to hunt and destroy ever ocean-going vessel he comes across. It is so much more than that. In fact, my only complaint (and I have similar complaints for many authors) is that Verne seems to have been at a loss for how to end the novel. Therefore, he hands us a \\"deus ex machine\\" ending, of gigantic proportions. However, despite this minor flaw, the novel still holds up to modern scrutiny and remains enjoyable throughout.While this translation is much, much better than the cheap translations you find from the \\"bargain\\" publishing houses, I have heard that the recent, fully-annotated version is even better. Make sure that, when searching for a copy, that you get one of the modern translations (like the Bonner) and stay away from \\"quick & dirty\\" versions that you can find for a couple of dollars. Many of these cheap translations omit a full quarter of the novel and contain numerous errors. Additionally, they render the French into archaic English, ensuring that you will not enjoy the novel as much as you could. So, my advice is to stay away from the \\"bargain\\" versions-they aren't a bargain at all. But do read 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA. You'll be happy you did."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"This is a story about three friends aboard the Nautilus, a cantankerous submarine-like vessel that is commandeered by Captain Nemo, an elusive figure with a mind of steel and a impenetrable purpose in life.

And a fortress it is. Captain Nemo and his crew live beneath the sea in this fascinating underwater vehicle as solid as stone. They never touch land, and are prepared to spend the rest of their days living underwater. The world has learned of this vessel, but rumors of its nature abound.

On board are Professor Aronnax, underwater expert, his loyal subject Conseil, and a Canadian whale harpooner named Ned Land. These unfortunate characters are tossed into the sea while heavily engaged in a confrontation with the mighty Nautilus. Hours later, they are picked up by the Nautilus, having been clinging to it's topside for safety. They are held prisoner within, but never have prisoners of war had such luxury and freedom.

For many years \\"20,000 Leagues...\\" was available to us only in Louis Mercier's abridged version. It was not bad, but it was not as Verne intended it to be. But in recent times, we now have three wonderful modern and unabridged translations from which to choose: F.P. Walter's, Anthony Bonner's, and Mendor Brunetti's. Walter's is more readily accessible (both for free and for purchase) because at least one version of his translation is in the public domain. To read it go to the Kindle store and type in: Verne Vingt Mille English. The other two are both copyrighted and limited to their respective publishers which makes them more difficult to locate and definitely not free. Having said that, Brunetti's translation is particularly readable. The true Verne fan (as in fanatic) may wish to read all three to compare. Just don't expect major differences; they mostly differ in style of expression. I first encountered Bonner and liked his translation. But then I discovered Brunetti and later Walter, so now I really don't know which is best.

Some of these sightings are far apart from one another. With no other logical answer, some fear that it might be a sea monster.An expedition is established under Captain Farragut, with the U.S. Naval frigate, Abraham Lincoln. They are firm in their resolve to find this monster.Professor Pierre Aronnax of the Museum of Paris had written articles about the phenomenon of a possible sea creature and he is asked to join the others, as is, his man, Conseil, and the Canadian harpooner, Ned Land.Once they are out to sea and have traveled far in their search, something is sighted. Ned, Pierre and Conseil take a small boat from the Abraham Lincoln with Ned's harpoon. Ned tries to harpoon the object but their boat is overturned and they are picked up by the submarine, the Nautilus under Captain Nemo.They are held in polite captivity as the Nautilus travels the world. Captain Nemo has constant proclamations of where they are and Pierre tells the reader the importance in history of what they are seeing, such as, a sunken ship with riches in it. The men are anxious to be free and have their escape at the earliest opportunity.The writing style is dry and without much emotional comment. The style is so different from much of today's literature that it is challenging to get into the story line and become involved with the story.It is interesting to see Jules Verne's ideas of deep sea diving equipment and his idea of 20,000 leagues under the sea-which is more than the circumference of the earth. It is also noteworthy to see where literature and adventure fiction has come to in the last one hundred years."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"This review is for the Easton Press leather bound 1977 edition of the Mercier Lewis first english translation of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, by Jules Verne.Anil Menon notes in a 2006 examination of 'The Politics of Nemo' that, \\"Verne liked to place his human characters in enclosed, self-contained, unique spaces of one kind or the other-- heavier-than-air flying machines, isolated islands, floating cities, villages on tree-tops, the earth's core, cannon-balls to the moon, steel submarines 20,000 leagues under the sea-- and send them out for a spin. For the most part, his people are two-dimensional cross-hairs; their main role is keep track of places in the reader's mind.\\"Most English-speaking readers are familiar with the image of Captain Nemo as an escapee from human society driven by hatred to live a life separate from humanity in general. Verne appears to have endeavored to use his story as a vehicle for some sort of political message or commentary on the conditions of his era though. One quote in the book offers a glimpse of this dark motivation: , \\"I've witnessed the destruction of everything I loved, cherished, and venerated--homeland, wife, children, father, and mother! There lies everything I hate!\\"Due to the politics of his time in France, Nemo fails to properly identify precisely who inflicted the personal pain on him. It is speculated that Nemo originally intended to point the finger at Tsarist Russia for their victimization of the Polish people, but France was friendly with Russia at the time so Nemo chose to leave the identity of his victimizers to speculation. That is unfortunate, because it causes Nemo to be more of a 'stick-figure' for the story than might otherwise have been the case.Regardless of this, the story of Nemo and his submarine continues to this day to intrigue readers as it always has. The problem for us English speakers however, is that Verne wrote his original story in French and the numerous English translations differ widely in terms of how accurately they reflect Verne's original story. Unfortunately, Easton Press chose to use what is generally considered to be the worst possible English language rendition of this famous book; the Mercier Lewis translation.Mercier Lewis went after Verne's story with a scalpel, cutting and removing entire sections and altering the meaning of many French words and ultimately, the story itself. When he was done, Lewis had removed over 20% of Verne's manuscript, paying particular attention to the removal of any comments that might contradict the Christian Bible. The result is that the reader of this translation is far less likely to gain an accurate appreciation of the original novel.There are other, much more legitimate English translations available. One generally considered to be the best current English translation is the Walter James Miller & Frederick Paul Walter version completed in 1993 and published by the Naval Institute Press. Unfortunately, that version presently only seems to be available in paperback. The Easton Press leather-bound edition looks much nicer sitting on the bookshelf and that is the main reason many continue to purchase it. But if one is interested in genuinely exploring the world of Captain Nemo, the Navel Institute Press version by Miller & Walter is the way to go."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"I loved it so much that I want to read it all over again!

The book's original title Vingt mille lieues sous les mers, the literal translation would be \\"Seas\\" which might imply the seven seas.The story is told from the view point of Professor Pierre Aronnax, a famous French marine biologist. The professor accepts an invitation to join an expedition to destroy a sea monster who is sinking ships. Along for the ride come Canadian harpoonist Ned Land and Conseil, the professor's servant.The expedition fails, the monster sinks it and the Professor, Ned Land and Conseil find themselves at the mercy of Captain Nemo, who commands The Nautilus, a submarine the likes of which have never been seen.I have read 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne in two languages and several versions. I have to say that this translation beats them all.The book shows Verne's genius which is tough to translate, the characters come alive on the pages and the adventures they go through are exciting. The comedic tone and even psychology show well in this wonderful translation.As in the previous versions I have read, there are many \\"lists\\" and descriptions of the ocean life. I have to say that I did skimmed through the lists but read the descriptive parts enthusiastically. With the exception of intricate scientific names, which lend credibility to this fantasy, I found the book absorbing and engrossing. I'm glad I read it again.While submarines today are common place and almost anyone of can go and visit one (there are several older submarines which one can go on), the fantastic voyages and imagination are inspiring today as they were in 1870.What I love about this book is that the translators took their time to write an excellent introduction and, best of all, wonderful footnotes which, as I said time and time again, make a translated book into a cultural experience and raises the level of enjoyment by multiple degrees.Not many people are aware, but almost a whole quarter of the book was literally lost in translation.

Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea was a groundbreaking work. It particularly established hard science fiction at a time when technology could not help but change the way we looked at the world.And therein lies much of my criticism. With its frequent calculations of the size of the submarine and what not, it sometimes reads like a math textbook. Sadly, I do not take the same interest in the science as Verne so obviously did and other readers may. The descriptions of life at the bottom of the sea, on the other hand, make me want to visit an aquarium post-haste. Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is very much the type of science fiction that revels in the \`science' part.That is not to say that Verne does take advantage of speculative fiction to use the \\"speculative\\" portion to explore human nature. Captain Nemo is as fertile ground as Captain Ahab for this. And our narrator has even less to say about his captain--he is consistently nave, to the point that the subtleties of Nemo can be at first lost. However, over the course of the novel it becomes apparent that all is not well. We are never told what great sin civilization has done Nemo, rather we must wrestle over whether any sin could justify his actions. The action is quite light and the plot slow-placed. Most of the book is devoted to a tour of the wonders of the deep, with Nemo's gradual, swirling decline in the background.The titular \\"twenty thousand leagues\\" refers to the distance covered by the Nautilus over the course of the book--well over twice the circumference of the earth--not the depth to which it sinks. There is no good reason to think the latter, but I was nonetheless confused on this point for years.Of course any book this old will not age evenly. Captain Nemo's conservation instincts are a bit off-base. Shortly after chastising the whaler Ned Land for seeking to hunt southern whales, which he describes as \\"inoffensive creature[s],\\" he gleefully slaughters a herd of \\"cruel, mischievous\\" sperm whales. Hardly sustainability at its best. But perhaps Verne too expected us to recoil with Land at the bloodbath (how odd it is to side with the whaler over the conservationist).Verne is as successful as any science fiction writer at his predictive science and technology. Sometimes it's incredibly accurate--Verne describes a light bulb a decade prior to its invention, the crew of the Nautilus communicate with an invented language a little under fifteen years before the invention of Esperanto, the South Pole is on a southern continent, and the Nautilus is largely built and operates like modern submarines (especially the double-hulled design). Other times, it's less so--a workable electric bullet has yet to be invented. Verne also repeats errors of his day--e.g., the misplaced notion that malaria was caused by \\"foul air.\\"Verne wrote at an exciting time. The south pole had not yet been reached and the first trans-Atlantic (telegraph) cable had recently been laid. We were just beginning to understand electricity. The ocean remained a great, unknown frontier.Verne frequently uses archaic or technical terms for the sea creatures encountered. Sperm whales are called cachalots, walruses are called morse, and sea horses are called hippocampi.I read the Kindle version of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea offered free through Amazon. There are a handful of typographical errors, but not enough to be overly distracting and none that cause confusion. Most bothersome is the degree symbol is replaced by a question mark throughout--a common error as the submarine's latitude is frequently given. It includes neither a foreword nor an afterword. I also own an old Educator Classic Library edition from 1968. It contains numerous added illustrations and helpful definitions and explanations throughout the text (directly next to the relevant text in the margin so they do not affect readability like a footnote or endnote would). These are particularly helpful for an older hard science fiction novel. It also contains a \\"backword\\" with helpful information about Verne and the history of the submarine."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"I did enjoy this book and I'm glad I read it but ... the introduction by Ray Bradbury was the best part of this book. If you are going to get a copy to read - get this one - specifically for the introduction. As for the book itself, well, the action parts and story line are great. The problem is that Verne seems to have felt that he needed to include every single bit of background research he did into the book. He didn't seem to waste anything he had found in in his research.. He goes on for several pages listing the types of fish that can be found in a particular area. Whenever we come across a sunken ship we are treated to several pages of the history of the ship and the ships that preceded it into whatever cove we are in along with who actually made it back to make the report. Some of this stuff is interesting, but mostly, it's unnecessary filler. I found myself skipping over the taxonomic lessons and skipping to the actual story line.The story line is great. Totally enjoyed it. Spoiler - they get attacked by 10 giant squids, not one. They also get trapped under the ice at the south pole and have lots of other adventures you don't see in the movies. All in all a worthwhile read, but it is a bit tedious because about half of the book is devoting to listing fish and their attributes (this one had a spotted tail with a blue underbelly, the next one had rings and a white belly and on and on and on.)Do I recommend it? Well ... yeah - good story, better then what they show in the movies, you just need to gloss over the endless filler."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"Fantastic!!

It remains to be one of my all time favorite books."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"Professor Pierre Aronnax does not travel to a depth of 20000 leagues under the sea aboard the Nautilus, if that's what you thought. What he does do is travel a distance of 20000 leagues while submerged under the sea inside the mysterious vessel.Boats and fishermen all over the globe have reported a leviathan attacking ships. Professor Aronnax accompanies a warship to attempt to destroy it, but falls overboard and ends up inside the sea animal. The \\"monster\\" turns out to be a secret submarine build by Captain Nemo. As a passenger aboard Captain Nemo's craft, Professor Aronnax is witness to the wonders hidden beneath the ocean waters.Written over a century ago, Jules Verne creates a fantastic setting that leaves even today's readers fascinated about Captain Nemo and his Nautilus. Detailed descriptions about underwater life fill a majority of the book and create a rich setting, but can drag on at times.Water makes up the majority of the earth. As humans, we have only a mere understanding of the creatures and life forms that dwell within the depths of the oceans, and Verne expands on this unknown realm to create a powerful and lasting tale.Maybe it's a coincidence that I've read a lot of novels with aquatic settings (Life of Pi, The Old Man and the Sea, Moby Dick), but 20000 Leagues Under the Sea is another watery classic worth reading.8/10 -> 4/5"},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"This is a very attractive edition of this book. The physical dimensions of the book itself, it's quite large, make it very easy to read. Additionally, the large plot-driven engravings found in the book are beautiful and the smaller engravings found at the top and bottom of each page are also very attractive. The fact that this book is Vernes' unabridged edition may turn some readers off, as he does go on ad nauseam, about the inner workings of the machine. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the detail he provided."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"Submarines as we know them didn't exist in 1869. But Jules Verne had an almost eerily prophetic knack for knowing what technology would be used in the future -- and he put it to work in \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea,\\" a slow-moving adventure tale with plenty of proto-steampunk and almost fantastical undersea life.Ships in the middle of the ocean are suddenly seeing -- and being attacked by -- \\"a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.\\"Eventually the US government sends out a ship to capture the object, and during a sea battle Professor Aronnax, his manservant Conseil and harpooner Ned Land go overboard. Soon they're picked up by the Nautilus, the vast submarine that has been causing all this trouble, and introduced to Captain Nemo -- an intelligent, charismatic man who belongs to no nation.Aronnax becomes fascinated by Nemo, his ship and his library -- as well as the amazing underwater adventures that Nemo introduces them to, like pearl-hunting and fighting a giant squid. But the captain's free, lawless life has its dark side, and the three men begin to realize that they must get away from the Nautilus no matter what.It's actually rather amazing that Jules Verne not only dreamed up the idea of a semi-modern submarine long before they existed, but thought out the applications, the stealth, and the vast size. And since nothing like the Nautilus existed at the time, there's a slightly fantastical, steampunk flavor to \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\\"And as usual, Verne painstakingly studies everything about his imagined world, filling it with science (although he obviously didn't know about water/air pressure) and lovely descriptions of the Nautilus and the eerie underwater world (giant oysters, forests, Atlantis). The only flaw is that he tends to ramble on about exact measurements and travel details; there are boring patches here and there.But Captain Nemo is probably one of Verne's most fascinating characters -- a charismatic, embittered man who is a sort of noble sea pirate. He does some stuff that is totally unacceptable (sinking a random warship), but he also has little spurts of kindness and generosity towards poor and powerless peoples of the world. He's scary but fascinating.Giant submarines, charismatic pirates and an undersea world just waiting to be explored -- \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea\\" is a fascinating sci-fi classic, if you can get past the dull patches."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"ok its a good book with a plot that a 3rd grader can understand i know this because i read it in second grade so a 3rd grader should have an easier time. and as far as the word that someone complained about you need to read context clue plus they are not that hard. this is a good book and show the predictions that Verne made. like scuba diving and nuclear power in the 1860's. and btw thats scuba diving with tanks of oxygen and thin wet suits to keep you warm truely he was a genious. i would buy this book read the whole book 3 times during the year but only when i am boged down or i have trouble with my studies."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Caxton Edition)","review":"This book is, by far, one of the best books I have read in the last year.

I thought it was a waste of time back then and still do but apparently lots of folks don't. The blue prints of the Nautilus feature in Clive Cussler's book Valhalla Rising. And there's an entire website devoted to blue prints and 3D models.Closing thoughts: I much prefer the sequel to 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

The narrator, Dr. Arronax, is a French naturalist who goes on an expedition to hunt down a mysterious sea creature spotted by many sailors. However, in an interesting turn of events, he finds out that the enigma that roamed the oceans is in fact a futuristic submarine (the Nautilus) built by Captain Nemo. Dr. Annonax, along with his Flemish companion Conseil and Canadian harpooner Ned Land, are held hostage on the Nautilus and through their time aboard they experience the great wonders of the seas. Giant squids, ice caps, pearl hunts, close calls with Papuan natives, are only a fraction of the exciting events they experience.Using Arronax as the narrator, Verne gives us a look into the mysteries of the deep seas. While Arronax often gets carried away labeling and categorizing sea life, it makes the narrative seem more authentic. I felt a little cheated about not learning the life story of the brilliant and enigmatic Captain Nemo. We learn that he is driven by revenge, yet we don't know exactly why and who is his unfortunate target. However, this lack of revelation allows the reader to create his/her own theories, which can be quite fun.This book may not be for action junkies, as shown by previous reviews.

Swim with them in this watery book!Opinions:1. This amazing book tells a tale of adventure with a subsurface of mystery. There are ocean bottoms hit and secrets kept, poles reached and mysteries left unsolved. What really kept me going while reading this book was the sheer anticipation of what was yet to come. It is wonderful material for people like me to get their hands on. I like to learn a little bit about the world while still reading a book that is fictionous and fun to read. For example, it talked about the main characters going inside an extinct volcano while describing the chamber of the volcano in explicit detail.2. The book tells the reader a bit about what life was like 1866 while still being an adventure-themed and fun to read book. It described many daring actions and risks, while still giving facts on geography I never even knew about. It told me about how a boat was run back then and also spoke about some species of fish through Conseil's classification.3. Jules Verne never explained why the title mentioned 20,000 leagues. The Nautilus never went farther than 4000 leagues down under the waves.4. I believe that this book is meant for people ages 10+ because some of the things in there might not be comprehensible to a person aged 9 or lower.RecommendationI would recommend this book to people wanting to be oceanographers because it talks about some things you may not have known about the sea.

There is something to be said about his incredible imagination and his grasp of scientific principles that were well ahead of his time. 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is the voyage of Prof. Arronax, along with his companions Ned and Conseil, who have found themselves on board the Nautilus, an incredible submarine designed by the mysterious Captain Nemo. The Nautilus crew lives esclusively in the oceans and seas, surfacing only to replenish oxygen. Throughout the journey, they experience breath-taking sights, heart-pounding adventures, and perilous obstacles. Jules Verne does a beautiful job constructing this submarine world, even inventing new sea creatures to fit into his story. Scarcely a chapter goes by without some new or legendary creature sneaking in to liven up the seascape. However, I think where this story falls short is in its flow. I understand that the story is written from Prof. Arronax's point of view, which is that of a scientist, but each chapter contains several paragraphs of virtually useless information, be it readings from the nautical instruments or long lists of aquatic animals (including their class, genus, and species). This detracts from the overall flow of the story and I believe could have been left out.

Sai Sankalap in his first novel, The Kashmir Affair, places us into the life of such a man! Having lived and worked in a university town during my career where I made many international friends, I enjoyed the opportunity to read and remember the flavor of many conversations with those from India, as I followed the adventures of a terrorist who was not...Joshua Borenhdi had met Amin Bhai as head of Bollywood, the Mumbai film industry. But Amin had interests beyond making films and he expected those in the industry to support him. Instead, Joshua arrived in America, enrolled in acting school and was immediately offered a major Hollywood contract as he finished his classes! Life was good until someone tried to kill him!Having been driven from his apartment, he is fortunate to meet and find shelter in the home of Veronica, a young woman, and they soon became close friends and were considering more. It was Veronica that was beside him as he first spoke to the police about a break-in at his apartment and the clear evidence that the intruders were intent on murder. NYPD Sergeant Hoyden McDonald was assigned the case, a caring man who wanted to help the young couple. Yet, because Joshua had so recently moved to New York, there was also a need to check out his background.While the police searched for the individuals pursuing Joshua, another attack occurred, this time including Veronica. One of the men got away and went on to his next mission to set off a bomb, which he did, but not at the right target! As the search continued McDonald joined with Joshua to wind up traveling to Seattle, following the lone survivor of the terrorist group. Amin Bhai had been waiting, thinking that Joshua is already dead and that the follow-up mission had taken place as planned. Learning neither was true, he immediately moved toward further targets there.By the time things were cleared in Seattle, background searches for Joshua revealed that he had been formerly involved with Amin and that he had been part of his terrorist group! Anyone who had met Joshua, however, seemed to realize that he was not a terrorist and indeed that he had helped to capture or eliminate those with whom he had formerly been involved. Still, his innocence could not be proven; a bargain was set! If he would take on another mission, traveling with McDonald, his name would be cleared. Joshua had no choice but to agree. He had already lost Veronica when she had learned he was a terrorist-he must clear his name so he could be free to move on with his acting career.Joshua was after redemption! He and McDonald flew into Pakistan and were soon in the midst of disputes over Kashmir! While the two had many individuals there for support, it was when they met Abdul Quadir a school principal, and his beautiful daughter, Zubeida, that they received the most help! Now it was Zubeida who was beside Joshua on his redemption mission...Sai Sankalap has given us a taste of the lives affected most by terrorism. We see a good man who simply flees from the situation, only to be caught over and over because of his former brief association with the wrong man. The Kashmir Affair is a well-written first effort and the story flowed in an action-packed, delightful fashion, with a tantalizing twist at the end. I found especially interesting that though Joshua was placed as the hero, it seemed to me that the women beside him were the stronger and more aggressive individuals. This reader wondered if this reflected the cultural norm or whether it was merely the personality chosen for Joshua to live.Indeed, there were several issues that came across as unrealistic. Having a young student actor receive a $5 million contract was the first. Having civilians working right along with the police was the most unrealistic scenario. Was this again cultural differences and perceptions? I am not sure. It may have been simply that the writer needs to conduct more research into police procedures, etc., for future novels. With his talent and an effort to read similar books in his genre and research his actions, it is this reader's opinion, that he will have a successful future-but not in the $5 million contract range! That just doesn't happen that often, even in Hollywood!"},{"Title":"The Kashmir Affair: A Novel","review":"Rebeccasreads recommends THE KASHMIR AFFAIR as a unique & timely thriller filled with insights & details about Indian, Pakistani & Afghan cultures few Western writers & readers know about.Beyond being in need of an editor, it is an interesting, if unlikely, read.

The high points come from the fascinating collection of anecdotes and remembrances that are offered by a variety of people associated with the show. Sometimes, these stories are hilarious (like Damon Wayans' retelling of how he caused himself to get fired). Other times, they are heart wrenching (as in the case of the remembrances of Gilda Radner). But above all, the stories vividly covey the sense of manic energy and fun that comes across in each Saturday Night Live episode.The book's low points are clearly the contributions of the authors: Shales and Miller. One first has to question whether they should be given the title of \\"editors\\" instead of \\"authors\\", because very little of their own words are in the book. What words they do write are so fawning and uncritical that they threaten to turn the book into an unjustified hagiography. Yet, the interview material more than adequately offsets the weak contributions of the editors/authors.Fans who recently began watching the show will gain an appreciation for the struggles and the effort it took to get, and keep, Saturday Night Live on the air. Long time fans will find an entertaining and informative oral history that is sure to evoke memories. However, what both groups will discover is an appreciation for the talented people who have labored to maintain the show's status as a television comedy standard. By focusing on the human side of the story, Live From New York turns out to be a solid chronicle of this television icon."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Having been exposed to a lot of information on the show via television, articles, and the detailed book that came out in the 1980s, a lot of the information had been heard before. However, I think the best thing about this book is how it provides that information for those who did not know, but also provides different perspectives from those who were around for the various eras.* Most SNL information, like the repeats on E! and Comedy Central, tend to focus only on the pre-1980 and post-1984 years, with Michaels at the helm. It was interesting to hear information about what the show was like during the other periods.* In particular, I liked hearing from the people that aren't regularly heard from on the subject and perhaps did not have the best fit with the format: Harry Shearer, Janeane Garofalo, Tim Kazurinski, Chris Elliott. Their words provided a refreshing change of pace from the &quot;hallowed institution&quot; language one most often hears.* &quot;Different perspectives&quot; are also expressed when recalling SNL's legendary &quot;[white] boy's club&quot; mentality. You will be quite curious as to how the same situation was read differently by each individual (and surprised as to who was &quot;for&quot; and &quot;against&quot;).

There were a lot of funny and interesting anecdotes that spanned the &gt;25 years.I agree with almost all of the positive things said about the book, for example, how well Chris Rock came off - he is very straight up. A lot of the people focused on how Lorne Michaels was this way or that way, but generally helped them a lot by the mere fact of providing the opportunity. Rock takes it bottom line saying &quot;I've never been broke a day since I met Lorne Michaels&quot;.The reason its hard to give this book 5 stars is that it is so far from being a complete history. Not that the writers/compilers ever really pretended it is. You don't get nearly the full story of anyone. They spent the most time on Lorne Michaels, I'm not convinced that what's there is a nearly a full picture. However, they certainly let a few punches get through. There are a lot of things that I was left wondering, for instance I have heard rumors at Second City that Mike Myers allegedly is/was always all about himself - its alluded to in the book, but not taken up in any meaningful way.Accepting the fact that a complete unbiased history of this show would be many many volumes, I think this book is very interesting and worthwhile to read."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This book started slow (Everything you read in the intro WILL be repeated later in the book, so instead of nodding off, go directly to the first chapter.) If you have ever dreamed of writing for SNL or performing on SNL, read this book first. Sure, some are bitter (Janene Garafalo particularly hated working there, so did Chris Elliot) but others loved every minute of the experience. All writers and performers say in this book that they can't believe they made it through the experience alive.I once hoped to write for SNL; now I know I couldn't handle it.I am a mere humor columnist; I read this and was glad that I do what I do and am not working there.I did cry a little reading people's reactions to Phil Hartman's death. Was a little irritated that the authors spent more time on Chris Farley's death. They were both brilliant. But Phil Hartman's death was a shock and unbelievable; Chris Farley's death was sad yet not surprising. I still have a hard time watching a movie or skit Phil Hartman was in; I still get angry when I see a movie or skit Chris Farley was in. But I didn't work with either man, I'm just a member of the public. I cry when I see Phil Hartman; I get pissed when I see Chris Farley.My review has turned into a eulogy, I'm sorry.

The book is in interview form, so you get insight from most of the major cast members about their experiences on the show. It's also a major plus in my opinion that the writers of the show get to sound off as well. Add Dennis Miller in addition to Eddie Murphy as to the small number of people that aren't represented in the book. It would have been all the better if they had participated. That said, if you had a decent amount of exposure to the show throughout its tenure, this eminently readable book is like a time machine; reading it, I couldn't help but pair memories of what I was doing throughout the different seasons and cast changes, and was surprised at how much of SNL still resonates, bad or good. All of the controversies are touched upon--Sinead O'Connor's tearing the picture of the Pope, Andrew Dice Clay's appearance, battles with the censors and so on. The book also confirmed a few things for me--how much of a jerk Chevy Chase seems to be, how ill-fitting cast members seem to resent the show (witness the incredibly negative vibe from Janeane Garofalo)--and some performers/writers I never really thought much of before come off as incredibly down-to-earth and kind. And, as might be assumed, a lot of the focus falls on Lorne Michaels (the book's final chapter is devoted to deciphering the man, to no avail, of course). I'm kind of interested in what makes shows like this fail, and I could have had even more details from when the show really tanked, but this is a minor complaint. All around, this will probably be the SNL book to have for a long time to come."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Shales lets the cast and crew tell their stories in their own words, with minimal editorializing. It's interesting to see how different people remember the same event with skewed perspectives. A hefty, 550+ page book I could barely tear myself away from to go to sleep. Recommended."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"If you pick this book up, you will not be able to put it down. Which is definitely saying something because a)more often than not, new books suck and b)it's heavy. My only complaint: no words from Denny Dillon."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I think this is the first entertainment insider type of book that I have ever read. I bought the book hoping that it would give me insight into a successful creative process underwritten by talented and egotistical personalities. I was not disappointed; creativity only works in tension, and the story of SNL is full of eustress and distress. I did gain a better appreciation for how SNL has positively affected everything from the quality of television to the quality of political discourse in our society.The sound bites from various writers, producers, cast members, hosts, network executives and agents seemed like individual lights strung out around a tree, and I kept flipping pages back and forth to try to get a better continuity of what had happened in a given topic or situation--more visual whiplash than I am used to. Of course, the strength of this approach was to get multiple sides of a story.I was hoping for a little more historical context, beyond the first-person/second-person narrative sound bites and the authors' short italicized summaries (sparsely sprinkled throughout the interview bits). It would have been nice to see some of the other pieces of information that one might get on a complete resume and a lengthy interview, so that I could get to know the players better."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Virtually everything that has ever happened on SNL is contained within this book. A brilliant narrative assembled almost entirely of interview fragments from people involved with the show, the book is a crash course in SNL history from it's inception to the modern era.Particularly interesting is the exposure of cast conflict bubbling over onto the show into hilarious sketches, such as Chevy Chase's rise to stardom and Belushi's jealousy becoming a cold open for the show.Although it's almost 600 pages long, it reads like a much shorter book, and I couldn't put the thing down. I found myself waking up early before work to put a dent in it, and was genuinely aggravated when nine o'clock rolled around and I had to go to my desk.The book is also incredibly instructive to those interested in sketch comedy. SNL being the pinnacle of the medium, being given the opportunity to get into the heads of such an array of writers and actors is really revealing."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This book is great to pick up and just start reading anyplace. The format is excerpts of interviews with various cast members, writers, and producers placed in chronological order. The excerpts are short - maybe a paragraph or two in most cases. Great book to just have around when you have a few extra minutes to read something light."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"So many interesting stories from the past, but yet, continues the saga. I only wish it would have included more years. I really could not put it down as I have been a part of the show (as a fan) from day one. Got a tad long in the tooth towards then end, but yet I did not really want it to end. I highly recommend the book for SNL lovers, or even occasional watchers."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I'd like to see an update of the last decade, but this really does a great job of converting the first thirty years. Great oral history."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"If you are addicted to Saturday Night Live(aka. like me) then this is the perfect book for you. Let me just tell you this, this book has the EXACT quotes from the people that they interviewed. You get to learn what happened from 1975 to 2003. You don't get to just learn about Will Ferrell and Bill Murray and what happened to they during their time, but you also have Chris Farley, Eddie Murphy, Molly Shannon, and SOOO many more of them. You get to find out about how SNL came to be and about Lorne Michaels. They tell you about what happened when someone died like Gilda Radner, and the emotions that everyone felt before the show, after, and during. If you need a book to pass the time, please buy this book. It will fill you with facts that you didn't know about that you did want to know about. That's why you should get this magnificent book!"},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Hits every high and low point of SNL.

He cannot put it down! I'm sure he would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"SNL deserves a comprehensive overview that tells us how they put together the show and how/why it matters/mattered. This is not that book. The author simply has no objectivity so he can't tell us the truth. If you want to read what you already know about the show's popular sketches this is the book to read. We learn almost nothing about how personalities worked together- or not- to make the show last this long. Far too little time is spent on the first 5 years and that first amazing cast. But if you want to hear about 'Pat' and Victoria Jackson this is the book for you. A real mess."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I choose this book because it was economically priced. The book was kind of in rough condition on the outside cover, but the inside was totally fine. The description of the book was completely accurate."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"If you're interested in hearing first-hand from the cast & producers of SNL, this is the book for you. Definitely long as it deals with everything from the beginning to early 2000's. I found it distracting at times the organization of interview snippets in certain chapters, but definitely worth a read if you're a fan of SNL."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This is an easy and fun read from the point of view of the people who made the show. I just wish Eddie Murphy would have agreed to be a part of the book."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I should have glanced at this book's format before I wasted my hard-earned dollars on this junk. It's simply a huge heap of quotes, regurgitated in some order known only to the authors. The &quot;story&quot; (simply interviews ad infinitum) unfolds by seasons of the show, without any sort of context, without any stab at putting the times in any perspective, without a clue, often, how the lesser-known characters contributed.It quickly became a very frustrating read, and then became one that left me shaking my head in disbelief.It would have been a good story if the outside world had been permitted to enter into it. But it doesn't. I know the writers aren't lazy, look at all this verbiage!, but it doesn't add up to a hill of beans. Dang, the ratings system doesn't allow one to enter NO stars at all. Save your money. Terrible."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"600+ pages of snippets from cast and writers. You can just flip through it and read bits here and there -- hence the 'bathroom' suggestion.It's pretty interesting, but nothing really earth-shattering for any long-time watcher of the show."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"It seems these days that the hip thing to do in writing historical accounts of modern events where many of the characters involved are still alive, is by compiling the actual words of said characters into a compendium of interviews. In a way this is literature's version of the current Reality TV phenomenon- straight from the horses' mouths with no embellishments or fictionalization by the author. This method has been proven very attractive and potent in various books. But it is a dangerous method that poses a problem if abused or lazily brandished about. Case in point: This book.First off, the Prologue. Written in a very flowery style that over-describes everything ad nauseum, it is a very frustrating exercise in poor writing style, featuring incredibly poor sentence structure and awkward phrasing. It is a dangerous sign of things to come. And in fact, the authors comments between inteview passages continue the trend of awkwardly flowery text.Don't get me wrong, there is a ton of interesting info, anecdotes and tidbits in this book. But everything is so chaotically organized and structured that there is no real coherent fluidity to the story. Occasionally the comments of various people are interrelated, many times not. One never knows when a new subject is being touched on until one is half way through the next interviewee's comments. Dear authors: How about some title headings when the subject is about to change? The haphazard nature of the book is terribly distracting.Another issue: Too much about the writers and not enough about the actors. Also, the photos leave something to be desired - ther e should easily have been many more photo sections than only one.But perhaps the biggest problem with this book is the incessant lionizing and worshipping of the SNL deity Lorne Michaels. It almost seems that this book's true intention is to let everone know what a genius Lorne is for creating this show, when in reality it was just right place, right time, right idea. To constantly, on page after page, inform about all the amazing parties he has had, and famous people he has hung out with, and how people have feared him, and kissed his shoes, in the end only hurts the book. The writer's seem to have trouble with an objective view of SNL and its creators.This could have been so much better written and organized. On top of that, the amount of text in the book does not justify its monstrous hard cover size or price.The best book on SNL, despite its age (it covers the first 10 years), remains A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live by Hill and Weingrad. Seek it out on ebay."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Ok, here ya go, The writer's are what Makes SNL what it is. Is everybody clear on that? there, I just saved you twenty five bucks.This is NOT a book about The Show Saturday night live, this is a book about the PRODUCTION of SNL. In most instances covering Monday through Friday and NOT saturday night. It's more a book of office politics and corporate policies, at a firm that's product is a tv show. The stories about the show itself are interesting, but there are few scattered throughout the book. Of the hundreds of hosts SNL has had over the year they interview less than two dozen. Mostly it's writers talking about other writers, performers talking about writers, Lorne talking about writers. Yeah, I'd love to hear about the blown skits...the terrible hosts, bad behavior, and what you get is another story about what was for dinner tuesday night. The last chapter is an unbearable homage to Lorne Michaels...as if the first 500 pages weren't enough. Imagine somebody coming to your workplace and interviewing everyone about what happens during the week...and then writing out 550 pages of it...well that's pretty much what it's like.What did I expect? I guess more of an anthology that would give some background to what I see on the reruns. More stories about the actual PERFORMANCE of the show and not the preparation(writing) of the show."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Did you know that the writers/performers worked all night on Tuesdays? Or that Lorne Michaels was a dysfunctional father figure? Well you'll be reminded about every fifth page of this yawner. Sure there's some interesting gossip and sniping, but save yourself some time and get the cliff notes because this is about 100 pages of interesting in a 500 page book."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Ok so it's now my turn to put my two cents in. I am writing this on tuesday, December 14 2010. This is the about the first time in SNL history that fans of the show have acess to watch every single episode on netflix. So as i just said, It is possible to watch every episode ever created edited down to abput 20 - 50 minute episodes. So as of the Last few days, i have been spending my time watching the episodes from the 80's. The most mysterious episodes which any one who wasnt around when they aired hasn't been able to watch in over 20 years. All I can tell you about the 80's SNL from reading the book is that everybody hated chevy chase. and that he told \\"Terry Sweeney\\" (who is gay) that a good sketch for the show would consist of terry being weighed on a scale each week to see how much he weighed blah bla blah... because he has aids. Any ways I think that the 1980's Snl is the most interesting and very little was said about it in the book. the main problem in the book is that there were about 9 or 10 people who were in the cast for the first 5 years, so each cast member gets about 10 to 20 quotes for the 1970's parts of the book. as you fast forward in time. especially in the 1980's where they would (in some years) Get an entirely new cast. thus adding the amount of interviews and lessening the amount of quotes. So you might get about two quotes from a cast member who was only on the show for one season. Also i would like to point out that my faverite parts of the book consisted of cast members talking smack about other cast members. But frequently they dont give out names. one gem occours before the first season starts and Lorine has gotten everybody's ego's all hyped up so everybody is feeling famous even though they arent and one of the members is trying to get up the elevator, but the bell boy doesnt reconize this paticular cast member. so this unnamed cast member gets pissed and the bell boy ends up getting punched in the face. I would really like to know who this person was. I would imagine it was probably chevy Chase Or John Bulushi, but it was probably chevey because he's still alive and so you would be less likely to spill the beans about someone whos still alive. any who. heres another diddy you might not know about which very little time was spent talking about... and it concernes billy Crystal and how he was apart of the original cast but quit after the first episode. of the first season. I would have liked to know what the scene was like with billy Crystal Being on the show and smoking jays with the cast one week and then quitting the next. wouldnt you want to read abould billy crystal yelling at lorine and then storming off... wtf...man. O.K. so this book was a good read, but it leaves you with more questions than answers. they should have had a 500 page book for every decade. another thing which was left out was interviews about the musical guests, which whould have been probably even more interesting than the interviews with the cast members. last thoughts: So this book is a good first book to read about SNL. Its kinda like the beatles anthology but for SNL. the history the show presented in a way that the editors wanted you to precieve it as.... it needs more nitty gritty... ok im done now, go buy the book now"},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"there was a time when SNL was on the Cutting edge of TV.but those days have long past&too be honest the plug on the Show should have been pulled at least 11-12 years back.but in it's early days it set the standards for shows like In Living Color\\"&what you see with \\"Madd TV\\" among other shows.I always wondered why the Show had so few African-American Cast Members over the years?Eddie Murphy is Missing something badly in here for me.of course you would want too hear Eddie Murphy reflect on the show.interesting stories on John Belushi.He was something else.this book deals with alot of various topics."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This book is an interesting read that is easy to get finished in one sitting.

He's not universally loved by the cast (but also not nearly as despised as Chevy Chase, who seems to beeveryone's favorite whipping boy), but his genius is acknowledged by one and all.A lot of favorite skits and characters are discussed, as well as some legendary battles with censors, advertisers and network executives. The mix of radical comedy with revenue concious TV executives makes for fascinating reading.The chapters dealing with the deaths of cast members and behind the scene staff members are incredibly poignant, especially Belushi's and Chris Farley's, bit of whom were known to be dancing with trouble.This book also goes a long way to humanizing Chris Rock, who emerges as one of the most thoughtful and career minded members of all SNL casts. His intelligence shines through in his tales of making it by way of the show.There is a great story on almost every page of this book, and having grown up with this show, it made the memories all the more pleasant.This is a great Christmas present for any 30-50 year old who has spent their Saturday night in front of a TV."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I can't say I hated the book. I kept coming back to it willingly enough, and finished it relatively quickly. My problems with it come not from the bulk of the material itself (interviews with cast, hosts, producers, directors, and writers, cut into segments organized into some rough similiarities of topic), but from what the writers have done with it.When you have a book consisting largely of interview snippets, what you have is a cross-section of opinions. Some of those opinions may have a greater amount of concensus behind them than others. Better writers could have done real research to qualify or confirm the statements made by the interview subjects: was Doumanian's budget actually cut from the first years of the show? If so, by as much as she claims? Where did the cuts hit the most? What were the actual box office numbers of Belushi's and Murphy's movies? Have they taken later rentals and tv showings into account in saying who was more successful? Was Nora Dunn as unsuccessful after leaving the show as her resentful colleagues would like to think? (A quick look at imdb.com suggests not...)Apart from the failure to provide factual context, the writers show their own prejudices in ways that can't help to be annoying and occasionally disturbing. The bridge and introduction segments are full of the usual kind of biography hyperbole better writers avoid. SNL \\"helped bestow upon the comedy elite the hip-mythic status that rock stars had long enjoyed.\\" \\"An audience that expected to see fresh new Gildas, Belushis... refused to settle for the paltry replacements that initially dominated Doumanian's cast.\\" \\"[Belushi's death] told his friends at Saturday Night Live not only that John was mortal, but that they were too.\\" All arguable statements, of course, but statements better writers would have let the material say for them without lapsing into purple, melodramatic prose.Further, there's a distracting sense that the writers have their own over-protective issues with the show. \\"Those who hurt show bad! Those who protect show, good!\\" I can't help but wonder if Jean Doumanian and Nora Dunn suffer largely from an absence of voices other than their own to present their point of view. And while Dunn might have handled walking off the infamous Andrew Dice Clay show better than she did, the authors describing Clay's act as \\"politically incorrect\\" and \\"antifeminist\\" rather than mysoginist- which it very arguably was- is telling.The authors arrangement seems to have been written as if imagining a television show- perhaps understandable, given the choice of topic, but a poor choice for a book. When snippets of interview are presented in an arbitrary order without any knowledge of the questions that provoked those answers, one cannot help but wonder if the authors were more interested in selling a particular version than giving their readers a chance to draw their own conclusions. Again, do the authors really contribute to the material? Does this arrangement offer so much more than we could have gotten if they had just presented the whole interviews, with questions, one per chapter?Finally, there are obvious gaps in who is and is not interviewed, and how much material they are given. Again, A.D. Clay's receiving a page and a half in his own defense is telling, though I'm sure the reader recognizes by now that the topic grated on my nerves. But more, two of the show's most notable stars- Dennis Miller and Eddie Murphy- are not interviewed at all. It is mentioned in passing that Murphy dislikes talking about the show; no mention is made of the reason for Miller's absence. A better book would acknowledge the absence and their attempts to work around it. And while I enjoyed reading Tom Hanks's segments, his contributions to a chapter devoted to a period in the show's history where not only had he yet to host, but yet to become a professional actor, are extremely questionable.For all this, I enjoyed reading much of the book. Some of the interview material is insightful; some of the anecdotes are side-splittingly funny. I just can't help but wish the authors, Pulitzer-winners though they may be, didn't seem to be such hacks. Two stars for the writers, four for the material, average of three."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"The curtain is pulled back on SNL in this book to reveal (not surprisingly) that Lorne Michaels was, is, and always will be the Wizard who always kept SNL ticking. Decades of drug use, debauchery, infighting, sleeping around, desperation, and show-biz chutzpah are related courtesy of first-hand accounts of the writers, stars, agents, TV executives, staff members, and guests of the show.Not all comments are complimentary, and not all that went on behind the scenes was funny. But it all makes for a fascinating read, despite the fact that a few notable surviving cast members chose not to participate in these oral interviews. \\"Live From New York\\" is as much a evolutionary history of the business of television over the past three decades as it is an oral history of the show itself. Perhaps SNL isn't as consistently cutting edge and counter-culture as it was in its earliest years. But nowadays the show IS the pop and showbiz culture it lampooned in the past. It cannot ever really return to its fabled glory days of 1975-1979 because the entire showbusiness landscape has changed so dramatically since then. One must credit Michaels for recognizing that and still plodding ahead with the show for most of the years since the days of The Not Ready For Prime Time Players.Read this book to find the origins of many of the standard conventions and favorite moments of the show: why the band always dresses in tuxedos, the inspiration of Danny Aykroyd's buttcrack-exposing refrigerator repairman, the inhuman writing schedule, etc.This is better than an \\"E! True Hollywood Story\\" any day."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This book is chockful of juicy gossip and backstage dish with interviews from cover-to-cover of SNL cast, writers, producers, and hosts.

And how telling it is. : ) The editors keep introductions and explanations to a minimum.I was surprised about how candid many of the SNL stars and hosts were about themselves and the show.If you have ever watched Saturday Night Live, you'll enjoy this book. With its insider stories,you'll find this book hard to tear yourself out of. It's apparent that many stories of SNL players' behavior outside of 30 Rockefeller Center are not in this book, but what's there is more than enough.So get your hands on this book-- you'll find it definitely lives up to the hype."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Whether you liked SNL in 1975 or enjoy it now, this book is an amusing romp through the history of the show. Although the years have been filled with amazing talent, it's still surprising to hear from others that it was primarily the genius of Lorne Micheals, the guy behind the scenes, that got the show going and continuing. This is stuff you DON'T see on television.There are too many episodes of outlandish behavior to describe here, but suffice it to say there are things that went on that should have killed most shows. There's lots of gossip, of course, and many of the cast members embarrass themselves while trashing others and many that are a heck of a lot sweeter than you would think (Jane Curtin comes to mind). There is blatant talk of alleged 'racism', 'anti-feminism' (one member refused to do skits written by women) and outrageous drug use during, before and after the shows. In fact, in the beginning, it seems the show needed that edge to survive, or to survive, needed that edge.No matter. This voluminous collection of after-thoughts is entertaining, hilarious and sometimes sad. You can decide where the true talent was, who had the biggest heart or who was the biggest jerk. This book is full of them and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I've watched the show for years and thought I knew a lot about it, but this book took me backstage and behind the scenes in such cool detail I quickly realized how much more there was to the story of this show.

Probably the best book on a TV show I've ever read."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Once the freshest, latest thing in show business, Saturday Night Live is closing in on _30 seasons_ on the air. I was 7 when the Not-Ready-for-Prime-Time Players made their debut, and first became a regular viewer in the pre-Eddie Murphy lean years, but I've always loved the show.Until the rise of Comedy Central and hundreds of cable channels, it was the only place on TV for political satire, and one of the few places for live music.\\"Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live\\" is a chronicle of the show's history, told by (most of) the people involved. I expected the book to be narrative, but it isn't: authors Tom Shales (TV critic for the Washington Post) and James Andrew Miller structured almost the entire book as a series of interview snippets about particular people, episodes, or events.The section on John Belushi's death, for instance, includes comments from more than a dozen people, including Belushi's family, friends and writers and cast members from the show.The approach is interesting when it lets you see multiple sides of a conflict or different perspectives on a cast member, as with the extensive quotes from Norm Macdonald, Lorne Michaels, and Don Ohlmeyer, who forced Macdonald's firing midway through the 1999-2000 season.It can be quite entertaining, as well, as we hear Joe Piscopo explain that his Sinatra impression was really a tribute, then hear from the writers who couldn't believe all the things Piscopo resisted on the grounds that \\"Frank wouldn't do that,\\" including \\"Frank wouldn't eat in the Carnegie Deli,\\" \\"Frank wouldn't wait for Stevie Wonder, Stevie would have to wait for Frank,\\" and \\"Frank wouldn't jump off a building.\\" Finally, in frustration, the writers considered a sketch called \\"Frank wouldn't do that.\\"On the other hand, there are a lot of voices left out: Eddie Murphy apparently refused to participate, and of course former cast members John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Chris Farley and Phil Hartman and writer Michael O'Donoghue are now dead.It's usually the job of the author to provide an objective and critical eye on their sources. Here, that's mostly missing. Depending on whose quote you believe, Lorne Michaels is either the devil, a raging egomaniac, an opportunist who took advantage of the tremendous talent on the show, a gifted comedy writer, a creative genius, or all of the above.Still, you'll learn a lot about what happens in the manic week leading up to 11:30 Saturday nights here. What the heck does the host really do? How many sketches do they prepare in a given week?And there's a lot of SNL trivia, as well. Who was the first to say the \\"f-word\\" on SNL (I was surprised to learn it wasn't Charles Rocket)? Who was the first (maybe still the only) musical guest to lip-synch on the show?\\"Live From New York\\" also provides some interesting perspective on the show's history: When did the show shift to being a platform for recurring characters? What led to the \\"star turn\\" season with already established performers like Billy Crystal, Martin Short, and Harry Shearer?Still, if you're looking for a history particularly of the show's first decade, I would instead recommend \\"Saturday Night: A Backstage History of 'Saturday Night Live' \\", by Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad. Published in 1986, it's now out of print, but it's a very entertaining read that tells the story as, well, a story.If, on the other hand, you're curious about how the performers, writers, guests and executives behind the show look at it, \\"Live From New York\\" is the place to start.I noticed that there's also a book out now by William G. Clotworthy called \\"Saturday Night Live: Equal Opportunity Offender\\". I recognized his name -- he was the NBC censor assigned to the show in its earlier years, and the book is his chronicle of the standards and practices battles with the show."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"What we have here are several hundred brief personal reminiscences and commentaries from almost everyone directly involved with Saturday Night Life over a period of almost 30 years. They are organized by Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller within each period of that television program's evolution, extending from its premiere in 1975 until last year. Throughout SNL's history, one of its most unique and challenging features is the fact that it is performed almost entirely LIVE. Except for a brief period (1981-1985), SNL's executive producer has been Lorne Michaels (born Lorne Lipowitz), a Canadian writer whose work on Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In and specials for Lily Tomlin had attracted NBC's attention. Most members of SNL's cast and crew seem to have had a love-hate relationship with Michaels but their comments about him (both positive and negative) suggest that no one else could have guided the program as well as he has throughout the years since it first appeared.The material provides (albeit subjective) answers to questions such as these:1. Which hosts were the most enjoyable to work with? Why?2. Which were the most unpleasant? Why?3. What was a normal week's work schedule? Who was involved in each stage of preparation for the next show?4. Off-camera, what was it like to associate with John Belushi?5. Of all the cast performers, why was Gilda Radner most loved?6. How did Michaels deal with the NBC \\"suits\\" and especially with censors?7. What were the biggest foul-ups prior to or during a show?8. What do most of the cast and crew members agree are the show's greatest moments? Why?9. What has been the best and worst aspects of being involved with SNL?10. What is the consensus of opinion as to why SNL has continued for almost 30 years?Of special interest to me are the professional as well as personal relationships between and among cast and crew members, including Michaels. More specifically, as I read this book, I was curious to know what impact those relationships had on the programs telecast each Saturday night. Radner, Belushi, and Phil Hartman were three of my personal favorites. Although they made no direct contributions to the reminiscences and observations assembled in this volume, all three are quoted extensively and recalled fondly by those who were closely associated with them.Eddie Murphy offers a representative example of young people with immense but unrefined talent who are finally given the opportunity to perform. (During the 1980-81 season, one show ran short and needed several minutes of \\"filler\\" which he eagerly provided.) Almost immediately Murphy became the most popular member of the SNL cast and was featured prominently until 1984 when he began to concentrate on feature films. For reasons best revealed in this book, Murphy is probably the only SNL \\"star\\" who has since totally disassociated himself from the program.Who will most enjoy reading this book? Those who have been regular viewers of SNL throughout much if not all of its remarkable history. I also highly recommend it to those who are especially interested in popular culture in the United States from 1975 until the end of the 20th century. I can think of no other television program which offers more and better insights into the culture of that period than does SNL. To their substantial credit, Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller allow the contributors to speak for themselves. Predictably and understandably, the value of what they have to say is determined almost entirely by each reader's degree of interest in those who have proclaimed, week after week, \\"Live from New York! It's Saturday Night!\\""},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"You could probably write entire books on each individual cast member of Saturday Night Live, so trying to cram the show's entire history into just one book (even at over 500 pages) is a challenge to say the least. But the authors of Live from New York are smart enough not to try. It's constructed as a rough chronology of the show in quotable form. Credit Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller for getting stories from virtually every important living person associated with the show.There are exceptions: talented people from the show who wouldn't have anything to do with the book, like Eddie Murphy (clearly the show's greatest cast member ever), Dennis Miller, Jim Breuer, or the immortal Denny Dillon. But otherwise, you'll find a great story on virtually every page. There's enough here to keep you occupied for a good long time: Chevy Chase living up to his reputation as a complete scumbag, a staff writer's &quot;encounter&quot; with Milton Berle, Chris Farley doing something very naughty out the window of 30 Rock, Joe Piscopo taking his Sinatra impression a little too far. It's all presented here in the rawest form possible, with attitudes about the show ranging from reverential (Chris Rock) to contemptuous (Jane Curtin, Janeane Garofalo). Stories seemingly repeat themselves with new casts, or they contradict other stories from different people. It's all wildly entertaining. Having the voice of Lorne Michaels as a consistent presence throughout the book helps keep it all cohesive, with his own love-hate relationships rightly taking over as the dominant theme. You'll have an opinion of your own on Michaels once you've finished.There are some flaws here. The tone from the authors (one of whom, Shales, is a TV critic) is too reverential. Okay, SNL changed TV. We get it already. We quickly learn that fact is almost more atrributable to the show's indestructible format than a product of the show's humor. SNL, after all, is usually only sporadically funny. What the authors and subjects illustrate well is that when the show has moments that ARE funny, they become immortal in the world of comedy. And that is absolutely incredible. There is no other show like SNL, for better or for worse, this book says. It's right. No show lives off its own legend of both comedy and excess like SNL. If the show seems a little staid these days, it still has the ability to make you watch, if only in the hope that you'll see something that will become the stuff of legend. SNL is a show that lives off the hope of laughter, and every subject in Live from New York points that out either directly or indirectly. It's amazing to think that one show, with so many people involved, can have the same effect on everyone.Now, if they could just stop putting Maya Rudolph in every sketch..."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"An incredibly comprehensive history of SNL, from just about every single person who made it happen: the cast, the writers, guests, etc.Whether you still love the show, hate it, or are ambivalent, this book is for you. I found it particularly nice that everyone involved, particularly the comedians, take it seriously here. No one is &quot;on&quot;, no one tries to be funny, everyone just opens their hearts and reveal what they truly feel. I have a (new) huge amount of respect now for Bill Murray who I never thought could take ANYthing seriously - here he is incredibly serious, fortright, and reflective. His thoughts impressed me the most.All the highs and lows are covered. Reflections on lost cast members are respectful and touching.This is a great book."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"My brother told me about this Live From New York book, and being an avid Saturday Night Live watcher, I decided to pick it up.This book, compiled by Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller, is a very good retrospective of the series, and how (and WHY) it came to be. I originally expected the book to just be straightforward and biographical, if you will, but the whole thing is actually told through the testimonies of workers on the show, cast members, NBC executives, writers, and even guest hosts.There were a few surprises I found, though. One is that Chevy Chase appears to be a very arrogant person, because whenever he came back to host, to say that he insulted the cast would be an understatement (he was eventually banned from hosting ever again after 1996). As for Dick Ebersol, who replaced Lorne Michaels as executive producer from 1981 to 1985...well, a lot of people in the book say that his name seems to fit his personality. And it was also interesting that the book never mentioned anything about Martin Lawrence's risqu&eacute; monologue when he hosted back in '94.It was also revealed things like the TRUE reason why Ben Stiller pulled out of hosting the second episode of the 2001-02 season (it ended up being hosted by Seann William Scott, who was originally supposed to host the following episode), hosts from Hell like Steven Seagal (maybe that's why NBC doesn't air that episode any more) and Frank Zappa, and behind-the-scenes problems with the seemingly tight cast from 1986 to 1990 (Dana, Nora, Phil, Jan, Victoria, Jon, Dennis, and Kevin). Also, I was surprised to find testimonies from people like Nora Dunn and Norm MacDonald because I didn't think cast members that were fired would want to talk about the show at all. But I WASN'T surprised to see no sign of Eddie Murphy (what's up with his ego, anyway?).Anyway, this is a very good book. At close to 600 pages, it'll take you a few days to get through it, but if you're really into Saturday Night Live, you should like it.Anthony RupertP.S. One more thing I'd like to mention is that there are pictures in the middle of the book from various years, and one picture is taken from the 1998-99 season, and it shows a \\"Celebrity Jeopardy!\\" sketch with the caption stating that Michael J. Fox is portraying Tom Cruise. It was Ben Stiller, not Michael J. Fox."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I'm not what you call an avid SNL fan. I grew up in the eighties and loved Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo but really didn't get back into SNL until Chris Farley reared his head. Live From New York is a fascinating look into the backstage antics and sniping straight from the participants mouths (well, most of them Eddie Murphy declined). At 566 pages, this book is an incredibly fast read. I absolutely could not put this book down, although too much of it is devoted to Lorne Michaels and not enough to Chris Farley, Will Ferrell or Phil Hartman. Still, this is intriguing stuff, hearing about Belushi going to rehearsals bombed or about who actually started the infamous Chevy Chase/Bill Murray fight. Bill Murray gives some really good insight into some of the cast members like Gilda Radner. Chevy Chase comes off like a pompous ass which is a shame because he was so damn funny. Anyway, this is a very entertaining look into what it's like to be on SNL and the everyday rigors and pressures that these performers endure. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller did not author &quot;Live From New York,&quot; they compiled it--just an observation.I really enjoyed &quot;Live From New York.&quot; What a brilliant topic for a thorough book. I have sometimes loved Saturday Night Live and other times loathed it. SNL has given the world some great stars and some of forgettable ones.In compiling this book, Shales and Miller did endless leg work and then stepped out of the picture. They wrote introductions for the various sections of the book but left the text to meander as the body of the book is really little more than a list of quotes from the people who were there.Shales and Miller reached almost everybody of any stature in the history Saturday Night Live--writers, comedians, producers. (Eddie Murphy was notably abscent.)My gripe is that Miller and Shales are fine writers with expert views, I wanted to hear more of what they thought. I wanted to hear a little of their voice, and I wanted them to help me pick up on some of the nuances.I wanted to know whom they trusted and whom they dismissed. When Bill Murray and Chevy Chase got into a shoving match--was Murray reacting to Chase's arrogance or had John Belushi put Murray up to attack? What do Shales and Miller think after interviewing both men? You won't get it from this book?That said, reading quote after quote by everybody who is still alive (Gilda Radner, Chris Farley, John Belushi, and many other key people have passed away) becomes somewhat hypnotic, and you really do hear their voices in their quotes."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I'm a big fan of SNL, so I was quite excited to get into this book. It did not let me down. The reading is very easy, and the format facilitates the transmission of information one wouldn't normally know: the writers, actors, producers, etc. do most of the talking here in short interview snippets, filled in occasionally by explanations of context from the authors of the book. It's a great situation, which allows for memorable moments like Will Ferrell saying Chevy Chase was the worst host he ever worked with. It's fascinating stuff, and I'd recommend it to any SNL fan."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"'Live From New York' gives fans and haters of 'Saturday Night Live' the ultimate inside look on how such a show is created, comes together on a weekly basis, and stays intact over the years. This book offers a suprizingly candid and open look at a television show that has become an institution and a staple of weekly television.Written as a long set of interjecting interview with various writers, producers, cast members, and hosts from over the years on SNL, this book lets a lot of people give there perspective on different incidets and episodes. These views are often contradictory based on who is telling the story, and in the early years, usually blured by use of drugs and alcolhol."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Very thorough and presented in chronological order from the casting of the original show which debuted October, 1975,(is it really that many years? Yes!) to the current cast, this book presents a very large collection of recollections and musings from cast, crew, writers and some of the more frequent guest hosts. From the battles of the female writers to the varied recollections of Tom Hanks, Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin, among many others, there is also much information to be gleaned about the basic workings of a long-running television show-political satire, goofy silliness as well as much cleverness included.A large portion of the book is devoted to Lorne Michaels which is both a fascinating read and annoying in parts because I would have preferred even more focus on the Not-Ready-For-Primetime Players past and present.A cast list is included for each year but a list of guest hosts, musical guests and sketches is not and would require an entirely different style of book (and would make a great book too!).As a reference tool, occasional read and/or cover-to-cover can't put down book this is an excellent biography of what I consider to be one of the best television shows ever produced."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"As far as show biz books go, \\"Live From New York\\" explains the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth about what went on behind the scenes of this legendary late-night comedy show, and it certainly isn't all that attractive. From the excessive drug use, the obnoxious behavior,the upstagings, the feuds, the competitiveness, and how some actors become stars and others are overlooked, you will learn that \\"Saturday Night Live\\" is a very rough business. And you thought you had problems every day at your own workplace.There are very interesting facts that forever have changed our thoughts about some of the people we have originally loved on the show. It was reported that, for instance, Chevy Chase was such a mean man that he had abused other cast members with insults and vainglory, and got into a fistfight with Bill Murray when he returned a year later as a guest host after leaving the show. It was also reported that Gilda Radner didn't do drugs, but rather she was a bulimic who purged and vomited off the set. Knowing that both examples were put into this book, whether one wants to believe they actually happened, makes this book very chilling. It is one of the most spectacular show biz books of all time."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"If you like gossip books, you'll love \\"Uncensored History\\".

The thing that struck me most about reading this was how much talent Lorne Michaels had and misused through the years. He is nothing, if not short sighted!I also love how cast members and writers all just aired their dirty laundry. All of the feuds and petty arguments came through!

More of an oral history than a comprehensive document, there are insights to be gained and new facts to be gleaned from this book. I almost rate this as a \\"guilty pleasure\\" because some of the book is, naturally, gossipy, but it is a pleasure not to be missed by SNL fans. It's interesting to see the changes in the show over the years, from the drug-fueled early days of edgy, almost anarchic humor through the times when the show almost got the axe after severe dips in quality and popularity, to it's almost iconic status today. There's a lot more to this book than the overly-publicized \\"everyone hates Chevy\\" aspect. It's a big book, but hard to put down. Definitely worth a read by SNL fans, especially those who have been fans from the beginning."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This is a brilliantly entertaining first-person(s) history of Saturday Night Live, thoroughly captivating whether you love SNL, love anything about the entertainment industry, or just love reading about a bunch of really, really screwed-up, back-stabbing, self-destructive, vindictive, revolutionary, and ultimately very insecure and very funny people. Hey, who knew so many people despised Chevy Chase?But since I like to complain, I need to mention the one big negative in this book (other than the fact that Eddie Murphy refused to participate): the cloying, slobbering, overwrought, inane, incessantly irritating, and often just plain ignorant filler pieces by Tom Shales and/or James Andrew Miller that occupy most of the beginnings and endings of chapters, and intrude during the most dramatic interludes in the show's history (the deaths of cast members, mostly).The star-worship begins immediately and never stops -- phrases like \\"a towering edifice on the landscape, a place of wonder and magic, a sociopolitical phenomenon\\" and \\"MGM once boasted of 'more stars than there are in the heavens,' and Saturday Night Live could make the same claim.... Too many of them, alas, really are in heaven now.\\" But probably the single most jarring and flat-out foolish statement is made during the recounting of John Belushi's overdose: \\"Your parents were right after all, dammit -- drugs can destroy a life, excess can be fatal, self-abuse can have severe consequences, there's no free lunch, and all that other anti-hedonistic claptrap.\\"Claptrap? Claptrap? Belushi is DEAD. Chris Farley, who modelled his career, and life, after Belushi's, is DEAD. And \\"drugs can destroy a life\\" is claptrap? To admire the original cast of SNL, as Shales and Miller clearly do, that's fine -- but to shrug off the wretched excess that came close to killing far more of them than just Belushi as \\"hedonistic\\" -- as though their disregard for their health and sanity were admirable -- to flippantly dismiss the warnings of those who tried to save them as \\"claptrap\\" -- it's just inexcusable.For the conception and creation of this book, Shales and Miller deserve a great deal of credit and praise. If they had only kept their big mouths shut."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"A great behind the scenes look at one of the most enduring t.v. shows of all time.

(But if you really want a laugh, read &quot;No One's Even Bleeding&quot; or &quot;Delano&quot;.)"},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"The way in which this book is written--a series of brief direct quotes from cast members, directors, producers, hosts and others associated with \\"Saturday Night Live\\" down through the years--makes it a very quick read. So don't be put off by the girth.However, that's also it's weak point: there is so much subjectivity, and little real history here. Not that opposing viewpoints are not given, because they are, but it's still all \\"he said, she said,\\" which will make it a little frustrating for anybody who really wants to know what really happened. It's a lazy way of writing a book, really: the authors spent all of their time collecting interviews and not obtaining information from objective sources.That said, the first half of the book is interesting. Collected generally by chronology, and more loosely by topic, we learn some of what went on behind the scenes at Studio 8H in the first 10 years of the show that made it a success and actually, nearly a failure. But the second half becomes less interesting as the book covers the years when the show had become an icon. Media outlets have done an adequate job of covering the show's cast over the last 25 years, so we already know a lot of this stuff.I would have liked to have seen the book hone in on only those first 10 years, and to present the information in a more objective manner."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This is one of those books that once I started reading it, I had to finish it. The authors interviewed nearly everyone involved in the making of Saturday Night Live, from the beginning up through the present day. There are some exceptions of course -- some people have passed away, and then there's Eddie Murphy, who seems to want to forget that he ever WAS on the show. At any rate, the book is revealing and entertaining, as it consists primarily of the words of the people involved. This isn't a book written by the authors so much as it is a book by two people who interviewed the people on stage and behind the scenes, and then printed what they had to say. A typical chapter consists of a paragraph or two by the authors setting the stage, and then quotes from the people who were there -- that's the majority of the book. There's a lot of inside detail, and a lot of things you probably don't know, about the show and the people behind it.If you're a fan of this show, during any of its incarnations, check out this book."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I'm the same age as SNL, and I've always felt a little personally attached to it-I was born the Friday before it premiered, and my mom watched it in the maternity ward. Anyway, after watching the show in repeats and live for years I was very interested in the cast, particularly my favorites (whether they were my favorites on the show or later through their film/comedy careers): Bill Murray, Chris Rock, Eddie Murphy, Al Franken, Phil Hartman, Michael Myers, Dana Carvey, Dan Akryroid (sp?) and many others.I really did enjoy the book, and so will anyone else who is a fan of the show/cast. It's rather amazing how much drama was going on behind the scenes, and fun to learn about what the guest stars were \\"really\\" like, and about the creepy mystery that is Lorne Michaels, a man who finds it nearly impossible to give any real approval or positive feedback to his employees, and yet has to inspire your respect because he *is* SNL. As Chris Rock says, it's his show.There were sensitive and moving parts, like Chris Rock talking about how he felt when Chris Farley died, or Bill Murray talking about how much he loved Gilda Radner, or Jan Hooks talking about how she felt when Phil Hartman died, or Jim Belushi talking about his late brother. Yes, the show has seen a lot of tragedy and the book doesn't try to hide that.There were also great dishy moments, like when we found out Chevy Chase is a jerk and made homophobic and sexist comments on the set, and that Stephen Segal is even more of an idiot than you might think (the segment on his guest-hosting is priceless), or how whiny Janeaine Garofalo was on the show. I liked her in \\"Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion\\" and some other stuff , and maybe she was just at a bad point in her life, but she did have a terrible attitude when she was there. Other people that want to blame SNL that they weren't funny on the show are Jon Lovitz, for example. I know a lot of people who like him from the Critic, like my husband, but I think he was terrible.Some of the parts of the book upset me, though, because listening to some of these guys talk you realize that many (not all, especially not my favorites that I listed at the beginning!) of the writers/cast members/guests are shallow, self-absorbed, and bitter. They seem to really enjoy having the opportunity to put everyone down here and air their dirty laundry rather than share positive experiences. Some of the commentaries are by complete jerks and that is why this book loses a star. One of them claimed that women are simply genetically less prone to being funny, which really made me steam. Maybe he was just trying to annoy women, whatever, but it worked. (I blame the presence of Janeane on the show when women as funny as I am are around and could have been used!)There was also the part where we found out how bitchy everyone was to Victoria Jackson, which made me mad, and other general unnecessary nastiness and broken ruined friendships. Not to mention jealousy. There was a lot of obvious jealousy that some people left the show and had Adam Sandler's/Chris Rock's/Bill Murray's career and some people left the show and we don't know their names anymore, or the only thing they did recently was \\"Master of Disguise\\", one of the worst-reviewed movies in memory.So it was a bittersweet experience and I wish I didn't know some of the details (e.g., Dana Carvey started to resent Michael Myers, presumably because despite Dana's arguably equal talent Myers became more successful; my knowing this taints Wayne's World!) but overall much recommended, and a lot of fun to read."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"For anyone who was in New York City in the early- to mid-seventies, it will probably be remembered as a period of darkness and danger. Crime was rampant, every union went on strike every other week, and the threat of fiscal calamity was ever present. At its darkest moment, when &quot;Ford to New York: Drop Dead&quot; hit the headline, something astonishing exploded from NBC studios: Saturday Night Live. Somehow this one show made urban life a little more bearable, and a television legacy was born. And, somehow, New York had saved itself.Authors James Miller and Tom Shales collected nearly thirty years worth of quotes and interviews, and amassed them in this terrific book, &quot;Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, as Told By Its Stars, Writers and Guests&quot;. For a hefty volume (over 600 pages), the book is a very quick read. While a good deal of time is spent honoring the deceased cast members, the tone never gets maudlin nor nostalgic. In fact, it was refreshing to remember some of Belushi's, Radner's, and Hartman's antics. Not surprising, drugs and ego clashes abounded. Talent + money + 1970s = celebrities on controlled substances, after all. What was interesting were the comments by the guests.

It is sooo much better to hear the story straight from the horses mouth rather than have some author do all the research and write a biography and puttin' his own little twist and pervesion to the story.Before I even bought the book, while at the store, I sat for three hours just savouring all the juicy detail and stories I could before the store closed. I didn't have the money with me to buy it at the time but I was almost willing to sell my body to someon........O.K. maybe that's going just a little too far, but, I did immediatly come in as soon as possible the next day and hope that the book didn't disappear so I could get to every last crumb in this very salty and flavorful bag of chips."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"What an incredible account of the people and content that went into making SNL great during its prime years (though now it has gathered some great soon-to-be-classic cast members too). An intense read and difficult to put down."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I used to be a big fan of SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE . . . soit was with some degree of enthusiasm that I began toread LIVE FROM NEW YORK by Tom Shales andJames Andrew Miller.Fortunately, this is one book that matched the hype . . . andthe subtitle: AN UNCENSORED HISTORY OF SATURDAYNIGHT LIVE . . . Shales (long one of my favorite TV criticsthat I only regret that I can't read more often because hiscolumn is not run in my local paper) and Miller bringtogether stars, writers, guest hosts, and contributors forthe first-ever oral history of the program . . . they traceit from 1974, when it was just an idea, through 2002, whenit has long become an institution.Mike Myers, Chris Rock, Bill Murray, Tom Hanks, Adam Sandler,Billy Crystal, Dan Aykroyd, Steve Martin, and Paul Simon were just a partial listing of the stars interviewed . . . writers Al Franken, Conan O'Brien and Larry David were also brought into the project.Lorne Michaels, executive producer of the show, was interviewedas well . . . in my ways, this is his story . . . I'm justglad that he was never my boss . . . he comes across asone tough cookie that lives and breathes his work, often withlittle regard for his or anybody else's personal life.A fair amount of \\"dirt\\" is presented (e.g., on John Belushi), but it seems to have been presented objectively . . . there's a great collection of pictures (do I ever miss Gilda Radner!) . . . and it left me wanting what will hopefully be a follow-up book that will profile the many music guests that have appeared.There were many memorable passages; among them:Lorne Michaels:I had to shoot Ford saying \\"Live from New York\\" and \\"I'm Gerald Ford and you're not\\" for the show. And I suddenly find myself in the Oval Office, and it's just me, the president, and this little crew. There's security too, I'm sure. And Ford does it, but the line reading is wrong,and I realized that it's just the same as working with anybody else and getting them to relax and do the line properly to camera. We'd done two or three takes, and to relax him, I said to him--my sense of humorat the time--\\"Mr. President, if this works out, who knows where it will lead?\\" Which was completely lost of him.John Landis:I've seen this attributed to John Lennon, but I know Michael O'Donoghue said it, because I was there when we heard Elvis died. My secretary came in and she said, \\"Elvis is dead,\\" and Michael O'Donoghue said, \\"Good career move.\\"Elliot Gould:Gilda became a very close friend of mine. She was the greatest. Just the most lovely and sensitive human being you could imagine. Gilda told me that when she couldn't sleep, she would order food at about two or three in the morning, and she was so bulimic she would order enough for six or seven people, even though it was just her alone. And then when the delivery guy came and rang the bell, she would say, \\"The food's here!The food's here!\\""},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"The number of interviews is quite astounding. This is a very informative work and I believe it's probably highly (if not totally) accurate.The format is a little unusual. They interviewed dozens of people and then printed fragments of conversations together (grouping them by &quot;subject&quot; area)."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Though I have always loved Saturday Night Live, up til when I read this book I had little known of its behind the scenes life, history, etc. This book, through the view points of almost all involved (some are dead or in the case of Eddie Murphy, trying to pretend they were never involved) shows a pretty good picture of how life was at Saturday Night Live or as it was occasionally reffered to in the darker periods, Saturday Night Dead. From the days of Chevy Chase, Gilda Radner, and Dan Akroyd to the days of Jimmy Fallon, Rachel Dratch, and Horatio Sanz, this book covers it all. If you love SNL, like me, but would like to know more about it, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I was sucked into \\"Live from New York\\" within a few seconds and didn't let go until I was done. It appears that other reviewers have mixed feeling about this book, which consists of outtakes from numerous interviews with the producers, cast and crew of \\"Saturday Night Live\\" arranged in a roughly according to theme, citing other books that do the job better, but I liked this one just fine.Perhaps it's my own personal trashy streak that makes me love it so. I love dirt. I love behind-the-scenes action. I love knowing the story that few people ever get to see. There's a lot of that sort of thing here. Dirt on guest hosts, dirt on the cast. Who were the favorite guests? Who were the worst? Which cast members messed up onstage and had to be fired? It's all here.The beauty of this book, as compared to a straight history, is the fact that the editors (calling Tom Shales, and James Andrew Miller \\"authors\\" is being way too generous) do not strive for truth. Alternate versions of each story are told by concerned parties and observers alike, so the book resembles a huge comedy-themed \\"Rashomon\\". We may never know the truth, but it's enormous fun sifting through other people's memories.One flaw I noticed was the fact that the book is fairly bottom-heavy; the early years are covered in minutes depth and detail, while the most interesting years on the show (the \\"lost years\\" of Charles Rocket, Randy Quaid, Julia Louise Dreyfuss, Anthony Michael and Janeane Garafalo) are barely touched upon. And the current cast is noticeably silent, perhaps because the fear repercussion or reprisal.If you like gossip and Saturday Night Live, this book mixes them together beautifully."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This book may look big in size but it is a quick read. It is mostly old cast members, writers, and hosts talking about the show. It is the most honest look at the show that I have ever seen. It is sweet, touching, funny, and raw. I couldn't put down. I was fascinated by people who actually knew John Belushi talking about his last days. Also Adam Sandler's dismissile from SNL. No matter what cast is your favorite this behind the scenes book will give you a new perspective of the show."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I expected one of two things: a thick piece of &quot;fluff&quot; filled with funny backstage antecdotes, or an expose with bitter memories from those no longer associated with the show. I got neither.Don't get me wrong, the book is packed with both the funny backstage stories, and the bitterness from ex-cast members. But as it turns out, the book, overall, is a detailed glimpse of how to do the impossible (throw together a 90-minute ensemble sketch comedy show in six days, see it come to an end in the blink of an eye, and start all over again the following Monday) 20 times a year for 28 years.The authors/interviewers especially made a point to select quotes from all the interviewees to give the complete story, not just a biased-towards-the-show attitude. Janeane Garafalo says the show is anti-women, Fred Wolf retorts basically saying Janeane is a comparably lazy performer who seemed to search for negative messages that didn't exist in skits she hated.The interviewees are astonishingly honest, never hesitating to say &quot;That was a bad episode&quot; or &quot;We weren't doing our best&quot; in their recollections. As a result, you come out of reading the book with a new respect for everybody ever associated with the show. It seems as though strength, both emotional and physical, play a big part in the show's survival."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"For such a big book, this was a surprisingly fast read.I love this book. I love the way this book is put together. I used to love the show... let's hope it improves. As this book shows, SNL has survived bad seasons before.The most intersing thing I learned from the book revolved around the Dick Ebersol years. Even though they weren't the best, they seemed to have dissapeared from reruns. It's not my imagination. The book tells us that Lorne Michaels owns the rerun rights, an aside from an occasional Eddie Murphy sketch, we're not going to get anything from the Dick Ebersol- Eddie Murphy- Joe Piscapo years.This is a great whatever-happened-to book as well. This book made the wise decision to not only include the better known cast members as contributors, but the lesser known ones as well.Especially enlighting were cast members recollections as to who were good hosts and who were bad host. Guess they won't be asking Chevy Chase back to host any time soon.This is a treasure trove of information and trivia for any TV buff.Included are poignant reminiscants about former cast members who have left this world- Chris Farley, Gilda Radner, John Belushi and Phil Hartman.Also- find out who said [the \\"F\\" word]... on TV first. Hint: it was on SNL and it wasn't Charles Rocket. Think bald bandleader.Wonderful throughout."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"If you, like me, have been around long enough to have enjoyed SNL since the beginning (of course with cable reruns, this includes nearly everyone), you will enjoy the behind-the-sceens look at how this long-running cultural event comes together each week. I have loved this show even when it was rotten, because I sensed that the cast and writers new it stunk too. This book confirms my suspicions and provides great insight to the creative process that makes SNL mostly good, sometimes bad, and always unique. Terrific book. An absolute page turner."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This book feels like a reunion of old friends, telling their stories at a dinner party that you are fortunate enough to overhear.There is so much history in the years of SNL that there is an anecdote for every fan, but this book recognizes Loren Michaels as being the true genius behind the creation and development of the show. He's not universally loved by the cast (but also not nearly as despised as Chevy Chase, who seems to beeveryone's favorite whipping boy), but his genius is acknowledged by one and all.A lot of favorite skits and characters are discussed, as well as some legendary battles with censors, advertisers and network executives. The mix of radical comedy with revenue concious TV executives makes for fascinating reading.The chapters dealing with the deaths of cast members and behind the scene staff members are incredibly poignant, especially Belushi's and Chris Farley's, bit of whom were known to be dancing with trouble.This book also goes a long way to humanizing Chris Rock, who emerges as one of the most thoughtful and career minded members of all SNL casts. His intelligence shines through in his tales of making it by way of the show.There is a great story on almost every page of this book, and having grown up with this show, it made the memories all the more pleasant.This is a great Christmas present for any 30-50 year old who has spent their Saturday night in front of a TV."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This is an excellent oral history of one of the seminal programs in television history. I have watched the program off and on since junior high and have witnessed many of its ups and downs, but this book delves much deeper into the program then what is actually shown the viewer every Saturday night. I think the gossipy details of cast romances, drug use, office politics and the tragic deaths of some of the show's alums are interesting, but what really makes this book unique are its insights into the production of a television program and the television business. I have no interest in pursuing a career in tv, but I think this would be a great introduction for anyone who does. The style of the book, being an oral history with only a loose chronology, fits well with its subject matter and it is nice that the voices in the book are those of the people actually involved--the real talent--rather then the author's manipulating interviews and filtering information to fit their own opinions. It is a very quick read that will entertain any reader and is very insightful. I would recommend it to any fan of Saturday Night Live, people interested in the entertainment industry or readers who enjoy good stories and story tellers. This is one of the best books I've read this year."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Live From New York is compiled by James A. Miller and Tom Shales in such a giddily readable manner, you're as hooked by it as one of those VH1 Specials looking back at the history of a cultural movement. Conceived as a one-quote-after-another recollection from each significant period of Saturday Night Live's long history (leading up to the book's writing in 2003), Live From New York fascinates you with the revelation of one personality after another - it's safe to say that even in the celebrities you thought you knew well, these interviews and stories evoke something surprising about each of them, and manage to highlight the rather wonderful pretentiousness by which SNL was bourne. Conceived by Lorne Michaels and Dick Ebersol as a chance to showcase edgy, youthful comedy that skewered the world around it, Live From New York shows that SNL's goal of biting the hands that feed it remains gleefully a part of the show's DNA in spite of how commercial periods of its run have been. So with that, Live From New York has the power to be comprehensive and merciless - its 1981-1985 Dick Ebersol years show Ebersol's surprising tenderness and respect while mocking his inability to determine if anything's funny. On the flip side, the book may wind up souring fond thoughts you had of Chevy Chase's various appearances over the years. I found myself deeply drawn into one era after another of SNL while reading this book, yet despite the years flying by over hundreds of pages, something unfortunate happens to the book as it gets \\"current\\" - it turns out it's not so current. Though this is mostly the result of the time the book was written, the Will Ferrell/Molly Shannon/Cheri Oteri cast doesn't really have a lot to offer in terms of perspective, and thinking that this was the \\"end\\" of a show that has risen back to its peak rather undersells the show's great longevity. The actors in this section talk as though champions doing a victory lap, and it, honestly, makes the pages more soggy than the ones that preceded it, feeling rushed to get in all the highlights of recent years. I also can't help but wish for a supplement to the book to get up to more recent times - Tina Fey as Sarah Palin, or the Lonely Island digital videos. Still, I can't say that's a fault of the book - it was written when it was written, though the slowing impact on the book's excitement is unignorable. Live From New York at its dullest can spend far too long on overcooked grievances and insecurities; why Janeane Garofalo - a very talented actress who had the misfortune of starring in a very bad year of SNL - gets so much ground to whine about... well I'm not sure, is beyond me. At its best, however, it wraps you in extraordinary fly-on-the-wall stories that make you feel like an insider revelling in all of SNL's endless relevance."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This book, comprised mostly of interviews with people that have worked on the Saturday Night Live over the years, really works thanks to the editing. As one person tells an anecdote, Miller & Shales follow it up with someone else telling a contradicting story, or with more details from another source.The story spans 28 years of the show's history, and does so in great detail. However, Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad's \\"Saturday Night: A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live\\" does a better job of chronicling the earliest days of the show."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller have, with \\"Live from New York,\\" provided the reading public with an utterly fascinating account of \\"Saturday Night Live.\\" This groundbreaking program electrified the country when it first appeared in 1975, combining as it did (and still does) hilarious jokes, political commentary, overt bad taste, up-to-the-minute music and superb talent.Shales and Miller have interviewed practically everyone who ever had anything to do with the show, from creator Lorne Michaels to the stars to the guest hosts, writers and musical guests. We see the hatching of particularly well-known skits like the Czech \\"wild and crazy\\" brothers played by Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd, Gilda Radner and Bill Murray's loopy \\"nerds\\" couple, Belushi's Marlon Brando impression, right on up through Eddie Murphy's linguistically-challenged Buckwheat, Joe Piscopo's self-satisfied Frank Sinatra, Molly Shannon's nervy Mary Katherine Gallagher, and Julia Sweeney's beloved hermaphroditic \\"Pat.\\"They're all here and then some, and while that's a lot of fun, what is almost better are the behind-the-scenes goings-on. The account of the writers dying with laughter while they write Buckwheat's rendition of Lionel Richie's \\"Three Times a Lady\\" is alone going to make most readers happy (\\"Unz, tice, fee times a nady\\" went the immortal lyrics). Writer and performer Al Franken's account of his daughter's baby shower (where he showed up with a doll, proceeded to smash the doll on the coffee table, and scared to death every guest who thought the doll was, in fact, the sleeping baby) is priceless.There are sadnesses, too, harkening back to the old adage about people in pain producing the best comedy. We see in-depth the problems of John Belushi and Chris Farley, and get chills reading about the untimely demise (at his wife's hand) of the brilliant Phil Hartman. We squirm at the unhappy tenures of both Harry Shearer and Janeane Garofalo, both of whom were a bad fit with SNL's culture (Garofalo seems still puzzled and unhappy with her experience, while Shearer has a light touch--when relating that he left for \\"creative differences,\\" he says, \\"Yeah, I was creative and they were different\\").The only problem with the book--and it is rather a big one--is that Eddie Murphy refused to be interviewed for its pages. That this colossal talent's voice is missing from the book means we get only everyone else's perspective on him. It's instructive, but it would have made the book utterly complete had we had Murphy's own recollections of his 1980s stint on the show. Still, this is a wonderfully written (and judiciously edited) book."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I loved this book. When I saw the 'first-person reminiscences' format I didn't think I'd be able to deal with it. But after reading just a few pages, I was hooked. If you like gossip, you'll like this book. With the exception of Eddie Murphy, every actor, writer, guest host, producer, and network executive involved with the show cooperated in sharing his or her thoughts about a television program that has profoundly affected our society. And, like him or loath him, Lorne Michaels might be the most influential cultural arbiter of the last quarter century."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"When I skimmed this book in the store trying to decide whether to buy it, it seemed like a fun collection of anecdotes about the show.It's not.Be warned -- virtually everyone who ever worked on SNL appears to have some deep-seated issues about the show and about their relationship with the show's producer, Lorne Michaels and a fair chunk of the book is given over to letting them vent.It's clear that Lorne Michaels is an odd man and hard to deal with. But he's not really odd/difficult in any sort of interesting way, he's just a type --- the distant, manipulative boss who tries to keep everyone divided and off-balance. So hearing the details is pretty dull -- \\"I didn't understand Lorne.\\" \\"Lorne didn't understand me.\\" \\"Lorne always made people wait hours to see him\\" \\"Lorne would only rarely compliment a sketch.\\" \\"Lorne didn't like to fire people.\\" \\"Lorne didn't like to criticize directly\\" \\"I couldn't tell that Lorne had hired me.\\" \\"I couldn't tell that Lorne had fired me.\\", \\"Lorne like to hang around with big stars.\\" \\"We had to sit on the floor in Lorne's office.\\" \\"Lorne liked to vacation at St. Barts.\\" et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.Similarly, there's lots of complaining of the \\"It was awful to do, a bad part of my life, Lorne was hard to deal with, but of course, it made my career so I don't really resent it\\" variety. Again, hearing this over and over is just uninteresting.In between we learn .... that John Belushi was a mess and everyone was sad when he died, that Gilda Radner was charming and everyone was sad when she died, that Chris Farley was a mess, idolized Belushi, and everyone was sad when he died, that Phil Hartman was a great guy, and everyone was sad when he died.What else? Well, there's always a lot of competition among the actors and writers to get on air. The women don't always feel they have a fair shot. Neither do the African-American performers. Everyone gets tired a lot. In the 70s a lot of people used drugs, not so much now. People yell sometimes.So we mostly get told the obvious. There is really very little true anecdote in the book --- very few new interesting stories that bring you inside the show and/or illustrate the people involved.By the end, reading the book feels a lot like being forced to attend your spouse's company Christmas party -- just standing around listening to work problems that don't matter to you and hearing minor office gossip that you're already heard from your spouse and wondering how soon you can leave."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I find it interesting that everything I've read about this book harps on &quot;Chevy Chase being a jerk&quot; or something to that effect.When in fact, the book hasn't painted him out to be a jerk at all. There were people that resented him, but it was sheerly out of their own, personal pettiness.They resented him because he got famous first. That reflects poorly on those that resented him, not on Chevy Chase.What I also found interesting was that none of what I've read has mentioned how mean John Belushi could be. Maybe people won't mention this because he's dead...but it doesn't keep it from being evident.At least Belushi had a rather redeeming quality about him. Belushi was on most occasions sweet and lovable.It's Harry Shearer that really seems to be the biggest jerk with the biggest chip on his shoulder to match with his huge ego. He, unfortunately for the people that worked with him, doesn't have any redeeming qualities.The book has been a great insight to what actually went on in Rockefeller Plaza. Some people's stories contradict...but you can gather what's the truth when you read all sides of each story.The only reason I'm not giving the book a 5 star rating is because it's sometimes written chronologically out of order. Which makes it a little confusing, not to mention odd.But alas, if you've ever gotten into at least one season of SNL you'll enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Personally, I think the Doug Hill/Jeff Weingrad book &quot;Saturday Night&quot; gives a much more detailed, much clearer picture of how SNL came together and what it meant as a television staple. That book ends, unfortunately, in the 80's and, thus, can't offer perspective on everything that came since; but it's chronicling of the early days and it's portrait of Lorne Michaels is much more detailed and probably more honest.NEVERTHELESS... with &quot;Live From New York,&quot; Tom Shales &amp; J.A. Miller have carved up a fun, fascinating read. You can open the pages to any point and find some interesting bit of gossip or history. When it hits trade paperback it will be a required addition to any pop culture fan's bathroom bookshelf."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This book is full of fascinating anecdotes from many of the most gifted comedians, writers, and writer/comedians still living--with poignant reminders of those, perhaps most notably John Belushi, who didn't live as long as SNL has.My main quibble with the authors is that the talented production design staff who created so much of the &quot;look&quot; of &quot;Saturday Night Live,&quot; such as veteran Akira Yoshimura, were not interviewed. Why not? Are the authors planning a second book on this subject? Perhaps they should consider it."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I'm a recent SNL fan (2001 onwards) but have developed a strong interest in the show and bought this to find out about its history and behind-the-scenes appeal. I certainly wasn't disappointed!Even though I was often reading about characters I'd never actually seen for myself, or about cast members I'd never heard of, I still found the stories really intriguing. There could perhaps have been a bit more from recent and current cast members, but I suspect some of them were reluctant to talk too much about the insider goings on. Plus, there is maybe less controversy and dirt in the relatively sanitized current show.Contrary to what other reviewers have said, this show isn't a homage to Lorne Michales - plenty of people take digs at him, some better concealed than others. Also, it isn't all sweetness and light on the show, there is clearly a lot of tension within the show and some real knives in the back.Overall, I loved the fact that I started to see the people behind the characters, and I got a real feel for the highs and lows the cast and sho have gone through over the years.I loved reading this book and regularly dip into various chapters. On the negative side, I wish it could have been divided up in a more readable format with more sections, and some more photos would have been great. They probably didn't do this because a photograph-laden book already exists, which I also really recommend.I really enjoyed this book, it's a must for SNL fans."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"It is difficult to not be impressed by the gargantuan task undertaken by this book's authors to complete lengthy, detailed interviews with what appears to be almost everyone who has ever had anything to do with \\"Saturday Night Live\\", including former cast members, writers, producers, musicians, network executives and even former guest stars. Equally impressive was how the authors edited these interviews to form a cohesive whole, keeping the book in chronological and thematic order. This is just about the fastest 565 pages I've ever read.Particularly when detailing the show's creation through its first five years, the reader really gets a true sense of what the day to day process was of working on the show - from the immense amounts of cocaine used by all but a few to get through the all-night writing sessions, to the pre-AIDS era bed-hopping that was done between cast and crew members. The book provides more detail on some well known stories (most people know that John Belushi had a drug problem, but until reading this book I didn't understand the true depths of his addiction) as well as providing many surprises (I would have never pegged Harry Shearer as someone who was so universally despised during his time on the show nor did I realize how catty Nora Dunn and Jan Hooks were towards Victoria Jackson).One of the fun aspects of reading \\"Live From New York\\" is hearing differing perspectives on the same story. For example, first you'll hear Janeane Garofalo discuss what a horrible working environment \\"SNL\\" was during her brief time on the show, followed by one of the show's writers explaining that Garofalo was something of an insecure nutjob who created her own bad experience. Likewise, you'll hear former producer Jean Doumanian described as \\"Ayatollah Doumanian\\" by those who worked for her during her tenure as executive producer, followed by Doumanian herself describe how she was set up to fail. Some people might get frustrated by the lack of an objective \\"truth\\" presented in some of these stories, but this seemed to me to be more true to real life, where often the \\"reality\\" of a situation is dependent on your own perspective. Also very interesting was reading about the perceived weaknesses in the current \\"SNL\\" program in the opinion of some of the writers, including an overreliance on sketches involving recurring characters, too many \\"surprise\\" appearances by celebrities who are being parodied (as in the real Robert DeNiro \\"surprising\\" a cast member who is doing a parody of Robert DeNiro), and a lack of political bite that once defined the show.If I have anything negative to say about the book, it is only that the early sections, regarding the first few years of the show, spoil the reader in terms of the immense detail presented there that is missing in the sections dealing with the program's later years. In discussing the first few years of the show, the authors give great detail on how virtually every cast member came to be hired, what their history was before the show, how they got along with fellow cast and crew members, and whether or not the indulged in many of the bad habits that went on during the show. As the book gets to more recent casts, often the book would just mention that so and so and so and so joined the show, without much detail of how that came to be, instead choosing to focus on major controversies in the shows recent history, such as Nora Dunn walking off the show in protest of Andrew Dice Clay being invited to guest host, Sinead O'Connor tearing up a picture of the Pope on air, the deaths of Phil Hartman and Chris Farley, and NBC West Coast President Don Ohlmeyer's single-minded obsession with getting Norm McDonald fired from his \\"Weekend Update duties. If not for a sentence or two, you could go through the whole book without realizing that Dennis Miller was ever on the show. This is one of those rare books where, even at nearly 600 pages, the book seems too short. I would have gladly read several hundred more if it meant that all periods of the show were given the same depth."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"i hope this review finds it's way to the write place..I enjoyed this book/found it thought provoking and moving&lt;sprinkled with a fair bit of humor and real life drama.

I am big SNL fan and was very disapointed by this book.Tom Shales is too lazy to do any writing! each chapter is a nothing more than a series of extended pull quotes from interviews. these interviews are then chopped up and dispearsed through the chapters. this means you get a lot of people saying the same thing over and over. (I didn't find the contradictions anywhere NEAR as interesting as other reviewers did.)The book is broken up into strange 3-7 year spans which are chapters and then ends with an outrageously long and repetive chapter on Lorne Michaels! there is an index (thank God!) but it's pretty ignorant and not that useful.there are NO graphics. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not some troglodyte that needs pictures in all the books I read, but I AM a graphic designer who understands how some information design and charts AT LEAST linking names to faces would help in the understanding and appreciation of the book. the only thing that comes close is a text only year by year listing at the very end of the book.I want to see clearly who had sex with who, who did what drugs, who won the fist fights between chevy and bill murray, etc! charts are SUCH a necessary thing here. I know it's not supposed to be a coffee table book but please, it SHOULD be. this format was completely a pain in the ass to read.on one page you have Sheri Oteri talking about how she would cry herself to sleep everynight and then three paragraphs later Anna Gaustayer is talking about how Will Farrell was that era's Phil Hartman. It's totally incoherent and non-linear!Thank God I went to the library to get this. I want a book that actually goes through the trouble of TELLLING a story, not lazily copping out and cobbling together a ream of disconnected quotes.This book sucks.

Both books tell the same story. For instance, Gilda Radner was most favored. She seemed like a demure, healthy, innocent, nice girl in an environment infested with drug addicts, drunks, egomaniacs, and assertive people. Then, as expected, someone like Chevy Chase gets all the heat as a mean man bringing everyone down. However, Rena Fruchter's recent biography of Chevy portrays him as a nice man with a harrowing upbringing, and if you believe Ms. Fruchter, then most things written about Chevy in both books are a pack of lies, and Chevy thinks they are, too. We see Bill Murray as a rough-and-tough fighter, Jane Curtin as an assertive woman who takes no nonsense from anyone and let's you have it if you mess with her, John Belushi, as of course, that wild and crazy, self-destructive drug addict, Laraine Newman and Garrett Morris as aliented drug abusers, and Dan Aykroyd as a Hell's Angel getting into fights. And that's the original cast depicted in both books. Cocaine was heavily used. Only Jane Curtin and Gilda Radner were smart enough never to touch that dangerous drug. I've learned over the years that Bill Murray is more of a marijuana person than a cocaine person, so he hasn't always been as innocent as Curtin and Radner.After the original cast departed in 1980, a new cast and a new producer came along with disastrous results and near cancellation. We should definitely put a shrine on Eddie Murphy for saving the show, and what could have been a comedy/variety show that went of the air with new cast members trying, like \\"Laugh-In\\" (which is often compared to SNL), is a legendary staple that goes on and on like the Second City of Chicago, always boasting new cast members searching for stardom. Also, as the years went on, drugs have diminished (with the exception of Chris Farley, who died a death eerily similar to John Belushi's), but there are temper tantrums around. I am very lucky to have a nine-to-five job in an agency with compassionate people, although I, like anyone else, can have a bad day here and there. But if you are looking for a place to work with nice, innocent people and a friendly atmosphere, \\"Saturday Night Live\\" is not the place. All in all, both \\"Live From New York\\" and the previous SNL book, written by two authors for each book, depicted the casts mostly in an unfavorable light, stressing more on the negatives than the positives of cast members."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I have only read part of this book so far (and loved it), but the reason I am writing this, is to let people know that it is $2.99 at The Christmas Tree Store. I bought 4, so if my family is reading this, you'll have a good idea of what you are getting next year."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"You may think that a book about Saturday Night Live would be fun or perhaps even entertaining. Well this one is not. I hate to disagree with the other reviewers but the book was just huge, boring list of commentary. These authors should not be acclaimed for throwing together a scrapbook of things that other people said. I COULD HAVE DONE IT MYSELF AND SAVED $26! The worst part of the book is looking at the pictures of the authors. They look duller than the book itself!"},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"When I began to read this book, I was expecting a superbly written historical account of the Saturday Night Live television show, and instead got nothing more than a plethora of transcribed interviews with people associated with the show.When I began reading this book, I was hoping the authors would include a listing of all of the people who have graced the show as regular performers, or one of all of the guest hosts, but none such information was offered.Apparently all it takes to write a best-selling book nowadays is a tape recorder, and a word processor, because that is all this book is comprised of.A court stenographer could have written it."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"The subject could not be more interesting -- a fascinating show with many interesting characters.This book is an abject failure however. Overwritten, dull, and self-indulgent it cannot hold the reader's interest.I was totally disappointed in this book. These so-called writers could have and should have done a far better job with the material. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I grew up with SNL, so this book was a nostalgic trip down memory lane. It was also very interesting in giving you insight or validation on hunches or suspicions. I knew I didn't like Chevy Chase for a reason!I appreciated that the cast members, guest hosts, writers, etc., were allowed to give THEIR take, rather than have it processed through a writer. The end result is a lot like SNL; you're not really sure what you'll get from page to page.Overall, I felt this was a fitting tribute to a pop-cultural fixture in our society."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Finally, I finished this book. What took nearly three weeks for me to complete, this book deeply covers the highs and lows of one of our nation's greatest comedy programs. \\"Saturday Night Live\\" began as a simple comedy show that introduced late night viewers to something other than reruns of Johnny Carson. It was satirical, it was in your face, it was raw, and it was beautiful. It was the way comedy needed to be. It gave a platform for those ideas unspoken to finally be acted out on stage in front of a live audience. It gave immediate star status to those like Chevy Chase, Dan Ankroyd, Bill Murray, and the great John Belushi. Through the fun and not-so-fun moments of this program, we are given a intimate look at what happened behind the scenes of comedic history. We are given rare glimpses of the insanity of running such a program, the politics of television, and the power of a celebrity. While this is interesting for the first hundred pages, slowly, at least for me, it began to grow old.This was a fascinating book to catch that rare glimpse of a show that looked like it was the best job on television. It created this light over the actors while also dampening the scene with an array of dark clouds. It was jittery, jumpy, and at times, extremely hard to follow. Let me explain. During the first couple of pages you are introduced to an onslaught of different producers, instrumental creators, and relative unknowns that you are expected to remember who they are from page 50 to page 489. At times, this was tough because there are whole pages directed to just these people, and honestly, that was the reason I bought the book. After just listening to Jay Mohr's \\"Gasping for Airtime\\", I wanted to hear the jokes, the sadness of loosing cast, and the power of the program ... I didn't want to hear these multi-millionaire Hollywood hitters talking about how hard it was to go to work everyday because it was too much stress. I would have loved to have their job, no matter if I was on air or if I wasn't, the fact that you were making history should have been good enough for everyone. Apparently not.There were moments when I learned something new about the program (that Larry David was once a writer and nobody understood his humor) and there were other times where I left the page disgusted that I ever watched the show in my life (aka the entire Eddie Murphy/Joe Piscapo section). I guess it was good to learn about the show from the ground up, but you honestly leave this book with the impression that what was once a great show has really fallen flat on its face. You can never compare the most recent cast with that of what it started with, or what it was ten years ago. The humor has changed, the jokes are less funny, and the younger actors seem to be disrespecting the roots on which the program was brought up on.Overall, I thought this was a decent read, but not what I was hoping for. I needed more emotion, more stability, more excitement about the program. I feel that I just finished reading 500 pages dealing with the fall of \\"Saturday Night Live\\". I hated the fact that Chris Farley and Phil Hartman were given a whopping two pages that dealt with their death (maybe a tad bit more ... but I NEEDED MORE). I would suggest anyone that is a fan of the show enjoy the first two chapters on how this program began, the excitement of the original cast, and the villainous actor known as Chevy Chase. It demonstrates the power of comedy, while the remaining sections of the book just seem like a long, hard punch in the gut. I am sorry \\"Saturday Night Live\\", but you have been funnier and stronger in the past, and this book proved that!Grade: ** out of *****"},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Does the phrase quick and dirty mean anything to you? Well, on a number of levels it describes this massive, stream of consciousness tome that, despite its prodigious length, reads as quickly as a bag of street vendor caramel corn (can't you just smell it!), and leaves you feel just about as queasy two thirds of the way through.Don't thank the authors for much. All they did was cut and paste snippets from interviews with people associated with the show, loosely organizing the tome by bundles of years. I heard Tom Shales in an interview suggest that this format--unending verbatim quotes from cast members, writers, producers, network executives, and hosts--was somehow carefully arrived at to accomplish the task at hand. If that is true--and I highly doubt it--their thinking processes must have been affected by ink vapors. Lots of ink vapors. This book really answers the question: What book would two extremely unmotivated and uninsightful people with a tape recorder and a stream of narcissistic interviewees put together with the chief objective being work as little as possible?But despite the obvious laziness of the authors, what fascinates about this book is the bizarre and curious characters that inhabited (and continue to inhabit) the Saturday Night Live universe. There is nothing jaw dropping here. A lot of it is People magazine-style trash, with a sprinkling of R-rated snippets for good--or not so good--measure. (I did not need to know that Milton Berle liked to show off his \\"anaconda.\\")While you do learn about the show and its ups and downs, you also get glimpses into what may be the real personas behind many popular stars, and just how vain, egotistical, and shallow they may really be. (Mike Myers and Fred Silverman come off as perhaps the biggest blowhards of all the male stars (what normal person uses the word \\"homage\\" to describe their work?), but neither even comes close to the balloon-headed arrogance which suffuses from the words of Janeane Garofalo and Jan Hooks.) You also get a glimpse into the vain, egotistical, and seedy world of the writers, too. Some of them are worse than the performers. (The one writer who left the most offensive stench for me was Fred Wolf. He's both arrogant and places the most lip-holds on Lorne Michael's proverbial rectum. It's also clear that he drips with envy for the stars, missing no opportunity to make himself appear superior.) Of course, there are people who acquit themselves well, including the suprisingly gracious and insightful Alec Baldwin, Victoria Jackson, Kevin Nealon, Will Ferrell, and Dana Carvey.The other part of the book that was enormously disconcerting was the near canonization of Gilda Radner. She sounded like a decent, kindhearted person. But against the backdrop of the entertainment industry revealed in this book, she really is, by comparison, Mother Theresa."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I usually write reviews of books that deal with theology and Christian apologetics and other really side-splitting kinds of subjects that, I suspect, provide endless amusement and delight to both of the people who have read them.But I'm wandering outside my usual field because I found this history of a culturally influential television institution to be quite interesting. It is, at times, funny and-reflecting the reality of what happened-at times, sad.\\"Live From New York\\" basically tells the story of how Saturday Night Live started and it takes the reader through the various eras of the show.It seems that I'm in the minority among many of the people I know, but I think some of the more recent eras of the show and some of the more recent mixes of cast members are just as funny-and perhaps even funnier-than the early days with Belushi, Akroyd, Chase, and the gang. My friends who disagree with this assessment will, no doubt, snort and wave their hands dismissively. Sometimes I say things that these people disagree with just to watch the snorting and hand waving. When you lead a slow-paced life, little things go a long way.In telling SNL's history, the book relies heavily on quotes from numerous cast members and writers, past and present. The behind-the-scenes stories of various people who have been involved with the show over the years are captivating for someone like myself who has enjoyed watching SNL in its various permutations over the past several decades."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This is a great history of Saturday Night Live, told in oral form: with quotes from the participants themselves. It is a meaty volume and covers the entire history in detail -- from the 1970's the the present. Like any provocative story, it raises more questions than it answers: Why did someone as talented as Larraine Newman not make it big after the show? How did such good comedy come out of such a competitive atmosphere where people were constantly pitted against each other?The main drawback is that the authors don't let the oral portions of the story speak for themselves. There are too many distracting inserts where the authors attempt to summarize events, which usually can be gleaned already from the quotes. Worse yet are little philisophical pontifications attempting to encapsule these events. We readers can supply this for ourselves, since we have been given the information from the participants. These sections might be acceptable if the added passages were only at the beginnings of the chapters, but they are inserted throughout the book and add little to the content. Legs McNeil's \\"Please kill me: the uncensored oral history of punk,\\" available elsewhere on Amazon.com, does a much better job with this approach."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"The library I patronize bought only two copies of this book. One doesn't circulate, and the other is always out, so I broke down and bought this. I only wanted to read it because I love gossip. I didn't expect much of the writing because this is an oral history, and I wasn't disappointed. However, you wouldn't want the authors/editors to do too much editing, or the voices wouldn't sound natural. But when one of the people from the show who's labeled \\"writer\\" says, \\"Each one was their own boutique,\\" I cringe.Some of the reviewers don't give the compilers of this volume much credit. I think they deserve more. First they had to do a lot of legwork just to get interviews with these people and get them to talk about meaningful stuff. I assume they taped all this. Words don't just jump from an audiotape to the printed pages of a book. All the \\"and-ums\\" had to be deleted. Probably some of the language had to be cleaned up. Useless repetition had to be cut. All this editing had to be done without killing the spontaneous feel of the material. Seems like a big job to me. My only complaint about the authors is that they're a little too reverential in their short pieces between the speakers.The first time I ever saw Saturday Night Live, I thought the musical act was one of the comedy sketches, and if I hadn't been told differently, I'd think so still. My son-in-law tells me he's heard other people say the same thing. If the musical acts are supposed to be taken seriously, they're completely out of sync with the rest of the show, none of which is to be taken seriously.The one thing that almost every speaker dwells on is the fame and money garnered by the players who went on to become big names in entertainment. Fame and money are their gods. There's no mention of whether these successes ever did anything of quality. ... Not one of them has been on a level with Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, Robin Williams, or Bill Cosby. And no one ever even mentions the one Oscar nomination to come out of this company: Dan Ackroyd's performance in \\"Driving Miss Daisy.\\"I've never been a big fan of SNL. My favorites were Gilda Radner and Phil Hartman. I absolutely loathe(d) Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, Chris Kattan, Rob Schneider, David Spade, and John Belushi. They are or were all loud, stupid, vulgar, and disgusting. But I still watch occasionally, hoping to see something funny. I seldom do. The commercials are overlong. The music is awful. The humor is never subtle. When did vomit become funny?Nevertheless, I think the book is worth a read, especially for those who are just aching to know what went on among these people after hours. It's a long book but a fast read."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This book seemed to be one long love letter to the brilliance of Lorne - kind of off putting. There were lots of great anecdotes, but to a guy in his early 30'swho grew up watching Saturday Night Live in the early 90's it was hard to identify with the stories from the 70's and early 80's. Additionally, the kindle edition probably takes away from the book itself - I found myself having to go online to see pictures of who these people were so that I could identify them."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I read the book when it first came out but wanted to reread it. Instead of reading the original I decided to get the paperback version since it was expanded.I've found the book to be as eye-opening, interesting and entertaining as I did before. The accounts in this book are either darling like the story Alan Zweibel told about Gilda Radner helping him out in a pitch meeting or hilarious like almost anything involving Al Franken and Tom Davis.This book is a good read if you're an SNL nerd like myself, but it's also good for people who want to know how TV shows get made."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Purchased as a gift for my SNL-loving spouse, it's a great bathroom book, because of the short excerpt format. If you are looking for a flowing chronology of the history of Saturday Night, it might be hard to stick with it. It's very broken up, the voices change with every page or two, making it feel disjointed. Because our memories and someone else's memory of the same event aren't always the same, you get amusing perspectives from different egomaniacs claiming to have the same great ideas. Nice background of behind-the-scenes as promised, lots of dirt on the sex and drugs, as expected. Not something I would have purchased for myself, even though I'm a fan, but compared to the other offerings out there, this one really is the most authoritative, closest to the source, and most accurate."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"560 pages of new interviews with the living cast members, past and present, from the show (no old material from the dead), as well as Lorne Michaels and writers. It's a fairly interesting bit of reading, going from the show's origins in '75 to the 2002 season, and getting views from everyone except Eddie Murphy, who will not talk about the show ever for some reason. There's a lot of gossip, anecdotes about the crazy all-night sessions, backstage sex, backstabbing, and so forth. And plenty of tributes to, and aspersions of, Lorne, the literal father figure to so many of them. The gossip and dirt does get a bit repetitive at times, and a few more insights as to the actual production of the show might have been a welcome relief. A single sentence on Lorne switching the order of sketches and cutting them, for example, whets the appateite for more of how this process works. So this book is more a long puff piece than an investigation of any kind of practical information. Still, as puff piece, it's quite readable, and amusing at times. It's interesting to note three constants throughout the show's history: Lorne lording it over everyone, Chevy Chase being an ass, and everyone hating Harry Shearer. It did occur to me while reading this that a true look at the dirt behind the scenes would involve interviews with the make-up people, prop masters, and stage hands --- all people close to actors and totally under their radar. If they were kept anonymous, what sordid stories could they tell?"},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This book gives you all you would ever want to know from everybody who was involved in SNL since the beginning and what they really think and what they experienced at this cultural cornerstone of comedy. The work that Lorne Michaels and the writers and the performers is unmatched anywhere in the world. The show has had its ups and downs and we get to hear from all the people who made it great, and even from the suits at NBC. There is lots of insider stories, the format is easy and fun to read and as a long time viewer, I am the same age as the players in the first shows and was an improv performer myself in those days. The work on SNL is not always great but when they hit it right, it is brilliant satire and an important cultural treasure.

As an avid fan who began watching in the mid-90s, I was intrigued by the diversity of opinions of the cast members, writers, producers, etc.. While gossip-like, you finish reading the book with a sense of the chaotic, zany, emotionally exhausting processes that each individual goes through in preparing for the show.The honesty of everyone interviewed was refreshing, and at times, shocking. It rekindled my love for the show, and the extraordinary people who have sustained it for so long. Now if only I can find a way to be an audience member, just once!"},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This book is structured as just a series of responses from an interviewer's questions that weave together to tell an almost 3 decade long story. At first I was skeptical but once you are into it you find how seamlessly the editors piece it all together, you enjoy the fresh format. At times it is a bit repetitive because it is a lot of people telling the same stories from different angles but it proves to give a fuller picture of events than a single viewpoint.I would definitely recommend this to any fan of SNL."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"SNL has been around for decades, so of course any thorough history of the program would be long.

However, I didn't get that much new information, I read 'wired' 15 years ago, so I knew about drug excess, etc.Personally not a big fan of Belushi, who the authors seem to love, my all time favorites are Phil Hartman, Bill Murray, Will Ferrel in that order.Some observations-the book is organized very lazily, snippets of interviews of mostly unknown writers, producers, agents that are not strictly chronological. I guess it was easy to just transcribe their interviews without trying to weave a narrative but I find it distracting and unprofessional-Al Franken stories reinforce that fact that he is a born a-hole.-find it amusing the excuses 'nobody knew you could die from cocaine'..please, showbiz types feel they are entitled to do whatever they want and love to make excuses after the fact.I guess I would give this a lukewarm recommendation, little bit interesting if you need a beach book or something, but not one 'wow' moment in the entire book for either content or writing style."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I'm a big fan of Saturday Night Live, especially the era when I grew up in the 80's and early 90's with Dana Carvey, Jon Lovitz, Phil Hartman, Adam Sandler, and Chris Farley. I really enjoyed a lot of the insights in this book about all the backstage goings-on at this amazing show. This book was written as a series of quotes from various performers and writers involved with the program. Because of this, the narrative was somewhat disjointed, and never achieved a level where I just couldn't stop reading. I found myself skipping sections from writers whom I had no idea who they were.There is a lot of good information here, but like shopping at T.J. Maxx, you have to sift through the unnecessary stuff to find the occasional gem.This book reminded me of the very similarly written book by former NBC President Warren LittlefieldTop of the Rock: Inside the Rise and Fall of Must See TV.

The stories and anecdotes come straight from the cast members, producers, writers, and everyone else involved with the show.

Among the highlights, we get the dish on: the Bill Murray, Chevy Chase fight, the deaths of Jim Belushi, Chris Farley, and Phil Hartman. The romances, the drugs, the parties, the mistakes, the successes, the most loved hosts (Christopher Walken), the most hated hosts (Chevy Chase, Robert Blake), the rivalries between the writers, the competition to get sketches on the air and the rotating door of cast members.This book is great light reading, and would be a great gift for that SNL fan in your family."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This really should be an excellent book, but I really feel that it suffers from a horrible choice of concept and presentation. There is so much to like, there are a lot of great quotes and info but as the book goes on and on it gets lost as the reader is forced to gleam what topic the various interview bits are heading toward. Too many times there seems to be a theme, like a particular cast member, then all of a sudden the next two or three quotes are completely off topic before it switches back. This bumpy road makes the flow of the book start and stop way too often.I also don't like the implication of the subtitle of the book that this in an uncensored history. It seems like all of the \\"uncensored\\" topics aren't delved into, but merely skirted around. Apparently there was a problem between Dana Carvey and Mike Meyers with Wayne's World. What was the problem exactly, well I don't know for sure, I can only assume, which to me is a censored recollection of the events. It's not my job as a reader to fill in the blanks.This book feels like a compendium of, or the companion piece to a book that doesn't exist, a book that would basically be the history or biography of SNL. Though it's an interesting concept, and I'm sure it averted the headache of libel or misquotation, having the entire text be snippets from interviews with the participants ends up very disjointed and makes it very hard on the reader to keep up with the timeline of events. It also created a lot of repetition as different cast members say the exact same thing on the same topic. Yes, apparently there were a lot of all night writing sessions. Yes, apparently there was a lot of pressure to get your work on the show. I think a lot of this has to do with the authors' hands off approach, their unwillingness to put their perspective on the material, that in the end makes this book a very dull read.The other thing that bugged me was that a lot of the cast members seemed to be left out of the history as far as how they joined and where they came from. Sure I understand that some probably either didn't want to be involved or couldn't be reached, but it's up to the authors to fill in these blanks, which they don't. Even if the '81 cast is considered bad and unsuccessful that doesn't mean that they shouldn't be represented."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"You won't know exactly who to believe when you read this book, but in the end, it really won't matter. Yes, there are some oversights in the information here; the later seasons are given short-shrift, and, just as an example, Victoria Jackson gets what amounts to the last word on some in-fighting behind the scenes during her run. Some of these oversights you can chalk up to who was willing to talk in their interviews and who wasn't. Other times, it seems to be a fault of the editorial decision to move on to the next subject before the previous one is exhausted. And yes, the first five years get the bulk of treatment here, but that's to be expected, I think--they are, arguably, the most \\"romantic\\" of the periods, when it was less a business and more a crusade. And besides, people are a lot more inclined to comment on the [stuff] they pulled twenty years ago than stuff that's relatively current.Still, this book is fully deserving of the perhaps too-often-ascribed label \\"page turner.\\" You'll be able to put it down, of course, but you won't want to. You'll want to keep going, even if your head is swimming with factoids, innuendo, inside information, and some of the best tossed-off stories of famous people behaving badly. All the \\"dirt\\" aside, though, it's the more positive stuff I really relish about this book--the good stuff about Gilda, John, and the rest. There are some nice tributes here, and they really shine.Of course, if you're a huge fan of Chevy Chase, you might avoid this book, because, as others have said, he gets torn apart pretty well here. To his credit, he admits that he's been a jerk in the past, but still, from year one to now, he's been reviled by most of the cast. For me, I'm still a fan of his work, but I don't think I want to be in a cast meeting with him. With all the stories, positive and negative, it comes down to who you're going to believe. For the most part, the editors let you decide, and haven't seemed to make a decision for you. And in the end, as I said, it won't matter. It's still a good, solid read."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"A legitimate page turner. As a fan of SNL I enjoyed each moment.

Don't get me wrong, I loved the originals and the Crystal, Guest, Short and Shearer years were fabulous, but Farley and Murphy and Gross and MacDonald and Sanz and Meadows and Ferrell and Morgan and Kataan and Fey and Fallon and Dratch are also great. It has big problems of course, too many hosts whose movie is opening that week, and characters repeated too often, but on the whole, it's always exciting and funny.

Eddie Murphy is the only major SNL Not Ready for Prime Time player missing as an interviewee. Baby Boomers who have watched the show from its beginning may not learn anything startingly new that they have not probably read in the gossip columns and tabloids these past 27 years, but the Gen X &amp; Y SNL viewers of today may be amused by how the show was created and how it evolved.It is not surprising how many of the people interviewed for the book, including all of the major creative and artistic SNL participants, claim credit for much of the show's success, while pawning off failures and disasters on others. The book is strongly focused on the early years, concentrating on Lorne Michaels and the original seven cast members, then moves more quickly through the 1980s and 1990s. The authors provide little of their own commentary, preferring to let those interviewed tell the story from their perspective."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"All history is subjective, of course, but here you get to see what historians are up against when they try to reconcile dozens of conflicting views to try and tell a story. Wisely the authors don't try to tell the story of Saturday Night Live - they let the participants' words speak for themselves, so you hear from those who loved it, those who hated it, and those who, as time has passed, see it with more objective eyes. I would have liked to have heard from some of the missing names: Charles Rocket, Eddie Murphy, etc., but I can only assume they chose not to participate. (The authors don't explain why they aren't represented, or what their interview methods were. I would like to have seen comment on both.) All in all, though, it's an excellent overview of the show's history in the words of those who were there."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This is a fun book, though not nearly as important a contribution to pop culture as some would like to think it is. The book is littered with great gossip and juicy tidbits: Milton Berle's large \\"package\\"; Chevy Chase's apathy towards the show and its cast members; the cocaine use by the cast members and writers during the 70s and 80s; Chris Elliott and Janeane Garofalo's inability to to gel with SNL; Lorne Michaels' shift from laissez faire manager in the 70s to corporate work-horse in 80s, 90s, and 00s, etc. The book pails in comparison to another NYC-related gossip-tome: McCain and McNeil's \\"Please Kill Me\\" (about the punk rock scene). Because SNL is still going, access to the REAL gossip will not be granted (i.e. the real nature of the drug abuse, nasty pranks and sexual proclivities of the cast members). Also, there are some glaring omissions here. There's barely any mention of Danitra Vance, (I think) the first African American female cast member and the third SNL alumni to die (yes, to date, 5 SNL alumni have died: Belushi, Radner, Vance, Farley and Hartman; she died of breast cancer in 1994), or Tracy Morgan. There's barely any mention of Ben Stiller, either. Also, the book reinforces the stereotypes of SNL as a \\"boys club\\" by having very few contributions from Jane Curtin, less representation of Gilda Radner, Nora Dunn, nor any of the women cast members from the not-so-popular years of '80-'83. Eddie Murphy is treated well despite not making himself available for the book. Despite all my criticisms, it is a very fun read, and it is particularly insightful as to how show business works, particularly the huge networking and talent scouting that goes on to find these great comedic talents."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"A great source of info, gossip, and history of SNL. Very enjoyable; it was hard to put this book down for the first 400 or so pages. Recommended.A little criticism: The pictures were great; a few more (esp. of the writers) would have been even better.A medium criticism: No treatment of the infamous &quot;Fire Don Pardo On The Air&quot; scheme that didn't quite happen.A larger criticism: The &quot;bumper&quot; paragraphs by the authors are horrible. Little information, lots of unsupported editorializing. The books stands much better alone than with these entries.A big-time criticism: Did the editor take a nap when it was time to chop away at the last 150 pages? Holy moly that content could easily have been halved without losing any substance at all, especially the last chapter.I just watched a re-run of SNL; it was even more fun after reading this book."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"...but ultimately fascinating document of our generation's most beloved variety program.The stories are told primarily by those involved, in their own words, verbatim, including cast members, writers, hosts and producers. Some surprising tidbits include an almost universal dislike of Chevy Chase, Nora Dunn's harsh treatment of co-stars, and Eddie Murphy's grudge against the show (he is the only cast member who would not appear on the 25th anniversary special and is not interviewed in the book).The book reads like an interview. There is almost no narrative from the authors. It's like reading a filmed documentary where the camera switches back and forth between the interviewees. This format fails only rarely, and the comments are usually placed somewhat in chronological order, and occasionally are lined up together, highlighting common viewpoints between participants where they exist.Most of the memorable, gossipy events are covered, such as Nora Dunn's exile from the show when Andrew Dice Clay appeared, Jean Doumanian's brief stint as producer that almost got the show cancelled, Norm Macdonald's ousting as Update anchor, Sinead's unanticipated Pope-bashing, etc., etc., etc.A fascinating read that will make you look at the show in a different light once you finish it. May also make you feel a bit misty-eyed, as you link SNL memories with memories of where you were and who you were as you witnessed them live."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I actually had to discipline myself to resist just blowing off my work and simply reading this book non-stop. The amount of times I laughed out loud to the point of actual tears was many! It was so frustrating to find it too late to call a friend and read a passage from the book to them that I found either hysterical or extremely enlightening. Many thanks to the authors for a book long overdue!"},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Because this book is so large and covers such an interesting subject, you basically will live with it for a couple of days, having feverish dreams about being a cast member or writer, trying to make Lorne happy. Certainly, SNL deserves such a comprehensive book, and the authors interviewed everyone they could. However, the book drags interminably after you finish reading about the original cast. There are certain things that get repeated a million times by several people. By the time you reach the end of the book, you say to yourself, I just don't care that Gwyneth Paltrow was scared but had a great time hosting.In addition, the authors do something I have never seen in journalism before, which is to let people and places mentioned in interviews go past without any referencing. For example, at one point someone is talking about Gilda Radner and &quot;Gene.&quot; Granted, most people know she was married to Gene Wilder, but it is very surprising that the authors wouldn't add in brackets [her husband, actor Gene Wilder]. They never add anything in brackets, ever, or have any footnotes. There are DOZENS of these dangling throughout the book and it gets very annoying.Also, perhaps this is too much to ask for, but there is hardly any cultural context. The authors add a few weak transitions between interviews, and that's about it. I hesitate to even use the word &quot;authors&quot;--they are interviewers and compilers. A truly important HISTORY would include some analysis.So because of the lack of referencing and the weak narrative, the authors seem lazy, like &quot;Oh let's just throw all these interviews together and readers will just have to figure out what happens when.&quot;Last but not least, I am very disappointed that most sketches and characters were not discussed specifically. It is very surprising that the authors didn't seem interested in what was in FRONT of the camera. The book is much more interested in gossip and office politics. When the interview subjects do talk about the creative genesis of certain famous sketches (John Belushi's Samurai, or Pat, or the two wild and crazy brothers, for example) the book really comes alive. But there are SO few of these!! If you are looking for stories about any of Chris Farley's characters, for example, forget it. You will hear only about his personality. Want to hear anything about Father Guido Sarducci? Not a peep. Dan Aykroyd in recent years got together with John Goodman to tour as the Blues Brothers--anybody think this is a cheap sellout or have any opinion on this?? Couldn't tell you.The writers were hardly ever discussed as creative beings--just drug using (or not), scared of Lorne, bickering, etc. You get very little sense of how they came up with characters, or wrote jokes for Update, or collaborated with the actors, or decided what was too offensive, etc. Instead you hear for the hundredth time about how they stay up all night on Tuesdays or whatever."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Live From New York was one the best books I have ever read. Although an obscure format, (The story is mainly through the quotes of ex-stars and writers) I couldn't put the book down. Through the sex, drugs, and scandals, I was enthralled in the lifestyle they lived. It was scary. It was true. It was live.Although the beginning was confusing and long, it really set up the end and turned out to be an amazing piece of literature. Because I am only 14, I was not alive in 1975 when the \\"Magnificent Seven\\" were around. With this book I could relive those times through the best authors; Gilda Radner, John Belushi, Dan Akroyd, Garret Morris, Chevy Chase, Jane Curtain, and Lauraine Newman. I do feel however, that there should be an updated version of the book. Each year the cast changes, and this book ended in 2001. I think it's about time for a revised edition.Other reviewers believed this book to be too long, but for me it was quite the contrary. I couldn't put the book down, and at the end I was yearning for more. For about a week and a half my life was Saturday Night Live. Never before had I been part of such a book; when I read it I felt like I was on the show. I couldn't give anything but praise for this book. So, \\"Live From New York, It's Time You Buy This Book!\\""},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This book is great for avid Saturday Night Live fans especially the ones who constantly watch the old episodes on basic cable. It goes through the show's history in mostly an interview format with bits of prose throughout.The interview format is distracting and redundant, since many of the cast members give similar comments. A fan of SNL will appreciate this format, giving an insider look at the show such as details about Norm Macdonald's firing which cannot be found in other books on SNL, while those wanting to know more about the show will find it irritating especially since the interviews do not go in any logical order.The format may be irregular and several comments superfluous, but because none of the prose books offers the insight that this one does, it is the best book on SNL out there."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"LIVE FROM NEW YORK is a book that immediately doesn't live up to its potential. Authors Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller had what seems like unprecedented access to just about everyone involved with Saturday Night Live other than Eddie Murphy and those who have passed away. Their set of interviews had the potential to be the foundation of a well-researched history. What is presented instead amounts to an oral history consistently mostly of paragraph-long anecdotes told by the cast, writers, producers and hosts of the show. While this alone is inherently interesting, there is little interpretation, little context, and virtually no other research in this book. As a result, much of significance is left out and too much irrelevant is left in.Although I'm sure the authors edited out some (probably most) of the words told to them by their interview subjects, they (the authors) would not interrupt a stream of thought chosen for inclusion in the book. As a result, all the \\"ums,\\" \\"you knows,\\" fractured syntax and bad grammar that aren't noticed in conversation make otherwise bright people seem stupid and hard to understand in this book. The flip side of the inclusion of this type of unintended language is that the context of several stories is often left to the reader's outside knowledge. This is especially a problem as it relates to stories about specific sketches. Sketches would be discussed, but rarely explained. Those unfamiliar with these sketches will have little greater understanding after reading this book. Overall, the specific sketches and routines that define the show were really under-explored in favor of behind-the-scenes personality stories. All this is interesting enough, but also not nearly enough.Outside critiques of the show are mostly unaddressed. Some of the people interviewed acknowledge vague criticisms, but those criticism are not really explored. Oddly, one internal criticism that crops up is a sense that some of the show's sketches tend not to end well, while the idea that sketches go on too long or ride one joke too far is completely un-addressed. Even the photo section of this book comes up short, as it features mostly photos of the bets known cast members while others who appear throughout the book, but are less well known remain faceless phantoms.The biggest disappointment about this book is that it could have been so much more. The authors could have done some more secondary research, discussed the show's context during its times, and woven together a story in which the gaps (like the absence of commentary from Eddie Murphy, or some of the deceased stars) were less noticeable. While reading this book I kept contrasting it to Bob Woodward's John Belushi biography, WIRED. WIRED may have had a malicious slant, Woodward may not have appreciated Belushi, and he may have included untrue stories (as Dan Aykroyd asserts) - but it was a better story.Despite all that's wrong with the book, I thought it compelling enough to plow through in a few days. I have probably never read a nearly-600 page book so quickly. Again, the material is inherently interesting, but ultimately the product is disappointing."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This oral history compendum is a valuable resource on the behind the scenes goings on of one of television's most impacting programs. These recollections and confessions, angry tell-alls and celebratory walks down a raunchy memory lane present a well-rounded picture of what went on over the last thirty years at SNL. There are a few things told here most people probably would as soon not have known about, but all in all any fan of the series or student of recent popular culture will be glad to read this insightful book. There is always special emphasis placed on those cast members who are no longer with us, from Bill Murray's poignant tale of the last time he saw Gilda Radner, to some absolutely disgusting anecdotes about the walking train wreck who was Chris Farley, to the shock and pain universally shared by all who knew the warm-hearted man of a thousand faces, Phil Hartman. This is a big book but it goes by quickly and never drags. It is well-written, frequently hilarious, and definitely worth the price."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Rather than compiling a linear, cohesive history of SNL from the words of the actors, writers, and guests who lived and created it, the authors of Live From New York went one step fewer and offer what amounts to a digest of loosely categorized interviews. Kudos to Shales and Miller for getting so much input for the project; the only SNL notables whose names I didn't see as contributors were Eddie Murphy and Dennis Miller. Everyone else is there, in varying degrees of self-adulation and delusion as to the significance their stint with the show had vis-&agrave;-vis its history.The great thing about the interviews is that the book's whole is greater than the sum of its parts: everything that was remembered by only a handful of people would otherwise be lost to the ages if the book tried to capture SNL's story from an objective, 10, 000 foot view. What is lost in consistency is gained in detail, not to mention cattiness (there is an awful lot of dirt dished here). However, recognize that a lot of objectivity is lost by the fact that there is no omniscient narrator here, and the only checks and balances are personalities pitted against one another.This book is likely to do two things to the reader: One, make him lose respect for many celebrities whose work he formerly enjoyed, once the extent of their egos is realized. Everyone knows that Chevy Chase is a petulant, borderline-talent egomaniac, but did you know that equally loathsome are Harry Shearer , Nora Dunn, and Jan Hooks? Al Franken is a scheming, petty little cutthroat. Jon Lovitz has no sense of humor about himself, and is his own biggest fan. Chris Rock blames everyone but himself for his lack of success on the show. Victoria Jackson had rocks in her head. Lorne Michaels is a heartless snob with loads more creative vision than human emotion or care for his fellow man. One of the few personalities who seems really to have been as decent a person as he was a comic talent was Dan Aykroyd... it's just too bad that a consistent string of bombs like Blues Brothers 2000 have shattered all that credibility and respect.The second effect this book will have is to surprise the reader to learn how much work goes into all of the skits, particularly the bad ones. Bill Murray describes in great detail a Nick the Lounge Singer skit that was resurrected for the opener to the 25th anniversary special, explaining how a group of the 70s greats got together at Paul Schaeffer's place in New York for a week, writing, rehearsing, and having a blast putting together a masterpiece. I saw the skit a few weeks after I read this book and couldn't believe how painful it was to watch. Genius is certainly in the eyes of the creator, if not beholder."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Having been a fan of SNL from the begining I found this book fascinating. SNL began as a cultural phenomenon, and although it has lost it's cutting edge impact over the years it remains a comic institution. The anecdotes of egos, intrigue, politics, genius and endless toil have heightened my appreciation of the show."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I was very interested in the book as I have watched SNL for years, but found the Shales book dull, slow moving and frankly, I don't want to read the mundane contributions from &quot;stars&quot;, mostly about nothing in particular. I also do not share the adulation of Belushis talent and ego - it does get better in the latter half of the book which is why I rated it 3 stars. Probably a little high."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"When Saturday Night Live hit the airwaves back in 1975, it changed everything. The young Not Ready for Primetime players poked, ridicule, teased, lampooned, and vocally criticized the natural order. Overnight, no celebrity, politician, or world leader was safe from the jabs of SNL.Over the years, it has developed, matured, and improved. SNL has always been on the edge of comedy, letting inexperienced yet emerging comics step onto the national stage with fresh and innovative styles and characters. Creator Lorne Michaels will go down in history as the pioneer of modern American comedy.At 600+ pages, this book is a beast. This book is almost entirely filled with interviews from former cast members, writers, producers, and hosts. You cannot get a more honest look at SNL, its production, its sketches, or its cultural impact.Though I enjoy the firsthand accounts, after a few hundred pages I began to really appreciate the work of a good editor who could have whittle down the interviews into a concise yet very interesting account on the power of Saturday Night Live."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"It's a good read if you like a gossipy view on the people behind SNL, but lacks any semblence of structure or insight. I was disappointed it didn't have much on the actual skits, hosts or role the show played in the pop culture of the time. Mostly it was writers complaining they were underappreciated and actors complaining they didn't get enough skits. Again, just gossipy.Would have been better if they included a pictures of each of the actors."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Maybe I'm in the minority, but after reading every couple of pages of these very interesting interviews, I found myself saying \\"They're talking about SNL, right?\\" I mean, this book reaks of self-aggrandizement after you realize that their only contribution to the modern lexicon in the past five years is, \\"Schwetty Balls.\\" Come on! This is SNL! But with the reverence some of these people are granting it, it sounds like they're talking about World War II. Indeed, a lot of people compare their experiences on the show with going to Vietnam (come on, you got a little coked up and you wrote some hilarious \\"Conehead\\" sketches. You didn't go anywhere near Vietnam.)What's undeniable, however, is the amount of really talented people who passed through its doors. That's what really makes this book interesting: Larry David, Bob Odenkirk, Conan O'brien, Norm Macdonald, Robert Smigel, all the good cast members, Chevy, etc. Without SNL, they might not've had the full careers that they've gone on to. But still, it's plain to see that they weren't being used to their full potential. I mean, even they had Proust on their staff, or Faulkner, or J.D. Salinger, I imagine their recollections would be the same. \\"I wrote out a hilarious sketch that was smart and had an ending, but Lorne said it wasn't topical enough and got me working on a cheerleader sketch with three other people including Cheri O'teri.\\"With some memorable time periods aside, I've always considered SNL to be a dumb show, where people go to get famous quickly, and where hilarious catchphrases are expected to be churned out weekly. Shales' ogling should be reserved for at least the first five years of SNL, or Monty Python, or Mr. Show, or Upright Citizens Brigade, or Kids in the Hall, or SCTV, or somebody else that deserves it."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Given the reputations of those involved, especially Shales, this is a hellacious disappointment and certainly not worth the hardcover price at any discount. They couldn't even get Murphy to talk to them and, given that he saved the show, that is a major problem in a book of this size and alleged scope. O'Donoghue, who was viciously brilliant, is reduced to a parody. There's nothing here you couldn't have figured out from reading years of tv commentary or watching the show."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"My title of this review is a crude impression of how this book reads.While offering some good information about the early days of SNL and how it works to this day, the book is basically made up of interviews lifted word for word from a tape recorder and pasted onto the pages of the book along with every conversational filler word known to human kind, the most prevalent being \\"like.\\" I had no idea that the word \\"like\\" was such a force in the American lexicon since almost everyone quoted in the book uses it so freely and so often. The editor of this book also seemed to have something against sentence structure and you are constantly hit with fragments of sentences that should be a continuation of the previous statement. After a short time of reading sentence fragments and endless use of the word \\"like,\\" I was ready for this book to be over.With that said, those interviews do contain the main points of interest regarding the show. You learn how the show was created by NBC as a relief to showing \\"Tonight Show\\" reruns on Saturday nights. You learn that almost every cast has one person who stands out as \\"The Star.\\" You hear from former cast members who both enjoyed their time at SNL and those who have hated it. You gain a new appreciation for the performers who fight each week to get their sketch on the air and the writers who try to slip some intelligence into the humor instead of relying on dumb/toilet humor. You'll learn about the cast members who have passed on and the grief felt by those that knew and worked with them.All in all, I'm glad I read this because I enjoy the show and it was nice to get a behind-the-scenes look into the making of it. If you are a fan of SNL and can get past the word \\"like\\" and the poor structure of the book, give this a try."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Yes, this book certainly is marvelous, but not \\"mah\\"velous. It gives a very interesting account of all things SNL: the cast, the writers, the antics, the drugs, the highs, the lows and, of course, Lorne Michaels, the man behind it all.When I picked up this book , I thought I was just going to skim through it, you know, pick and choose what I wanted to read. But as I read, I realized that almost everything was interesting. The scenarios are usually very humorous, or dramatic, so you can't really go wrong when telling about them. Even the people I wasn't familiar with(writers and producers as oppossed to the performers) were interesting to hear from.Although everything was entertaining, I wish they had discussed certain things in greater depth. Whenever the creation of a certain character was discussed (such as the Czech brothers or the ...plumber man) it was interesting as to how the performers wrote it, and how the cast perceived other people's character's and how people pereceived their own characters. Not much time was spent on this, and I felt that if more attention had been paid to actual sketches (such as \\"The Thing That Just Wouldn't Leave!\\" or \\"Linda Richman's Coffee Talk\\") instead of discussing the overall process of writing for SNL over and over again (long nights, fierce competition), then the book would have been far more insightful and entertaining and less repetitive.Overall, the book is entertaining, but don't expect too much. Basically, its the same few topics and a few key events (i.e. the deaths of Belushi, Hartman and Farely, and \\"What do you perceive Lorne Michaels as?\\") discussed by every cast member and writer twenty differnt ways.You'll enjoy the actual reading of \\"Live from New York\\" but its aftertaste is a little sour. \\"Live from New York\\" is good as far as it goes, but it left me wanting much more."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I try to remain neutral about this topic, because of the way that SNL has changed over the years. What was once a dynamo on Saturday night and what changed it to a mediocre program, to one that is still trying to find itself, given the politics of the Hollywood games and players. This is essentially an oral history of the groundbreaking show from the early days to the present. Nearly 600 pages of interviews from the writers and comedians who made the show what it is, and the book includes gossip as well as tributes to deceased cast members likeBelushi, Farley and Hartman. A lot of crude language and anecdotes. I don't know what they're there. Maybe someone thought it was funny, but it detracts from the overall book."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This book would only appeal to a hardcore SNL fan but if you are that then this book is for you.The story about Milton Berle is worth buying the book for.

While some of the things it contains are indeed quite unique, the way it is written is also very frustrating. Indeed, since it is composed of short citations by the major players involved, on the one hand it provides with more inside and first hand information than one would find elsewhere but on the other hand it lacks the structure that a more biographical account would bring. Also to some degree, it never really goes in-depth. Thus it remains something that one reads not in one go, as a book, but as another reviewer said, in the bathroom. one issue is also the respect shown by the authors is excessive, because it is true these were extremely talented people but not without faults. Other books such as Wired probably went too far in the other direction but there is probably still the definitive book to be written on SNL and that would probably be placed in-between. It si true that for seomeone who is a fan of the show it does contain some great quotes and thus is indispensable."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This book is a full one, with numerous quotes from many participants themselves who were cast members of the famousTV show, but the information provided is a bit limited.The format consists of hundreds of brief quotes, clusteredaround a linear time-line, so there isn't much of a feel ofliterature about the book at all.The disjointed format lessens the interest in reading it, butthe quotes provide a first-hand look at one of our popularinstitutions.If \\"unnamed sources\\" had told some of these stories, no one would believe them. There are such sorid tales of massive drugabuse and routine, non-romantic sex, taking place during thewriting and rehearsals, that they would sound like wild exaggerations. Outsiders wouldn't believe a TV show could beput on the air with such inattention and such casual attitudetoward public performance, but the participants detail a longlist of abuses and excesses.There are more confessions in this book than in a Catholicchurch, and if salacious detail interest a reader, then thisbook is a place to start.The format prevents it from being as readable as it should be,but some interesting facts are here. But this book, as a serious subject, is only for the true fan of the TV show.The displays of self-indulgence behavior and selfish attitudesdetailed here will repel many potential readers, so approachthis book with caution. It won't hold the interests of manyreaders very long.It is almost like a pasted-up version of a supermarket tabloid,and the only redeeming feature is that the details are providedby those who were there doing all those stupid, selfish thingsto themselves and fellow staffers.As I said, for the serious fan of the show only."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"First and foremost, thank you Amazon App for putting international stores on the iPhone app - if they hadn't then I wouldn't have been able to buy this fantastic book. From the first hundred pages or so that I've read so far, this book is proving to be the authoritative book of all things SNL. The interviews are comprehensive, by almost every person involved in Saturday Night Live through the ages with only a few notable exceptions like Eddie Murphy. It has been constructed in chronological order and is very easy to dip in to. One word of warning though - this book covers the bad times as well as the good. If you'd prefer to think of Belushi etc with rose tinted glasses then consider buying a different book This one has all the people involved giving their honest opinions. Therefore you'll learn that Belushi hated working with woman, Chevy thought he was the star and everyone was shagging everyone else.You should buy this book - Lorne Michaels approved and contributed lots to it.

It made a great addition to my other books, and is enjoyable on its own."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Background:The authors interview most of the living cast and crew from SNL and gather/mold the various responses into a kind of oral history of what went on behind the scenes of the show from day one. The book also takes a look at what was happening at the network level and the encounters that Michaels and the other producers of the show had when corporate sensibilites clashed with comic creativity. The version I read also has an extra 30 pages or so of what various people think about Lorne Michaels.----This was a pretty interesting book if your like me and werent even born when the first show came and only really became aware of it in the mid 90's. It does a pretty good job of showing how the show changed (it seems in the casts eye's first) from a show were you did envelope pushing comedy to a place that was more of a spring board to a movie career. The book also does go into detail on most of the famous feuds, deaths, bad hosts/good hosts, and other incidents that have popped up over the years. A great majority of the book deals with how the show comes together, which I think is the most interesting part, and how all the people somehow manage to work together depiste massive pressure and somtimes conflicting personalites. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes SNL and wants some background info on how the show came to be in its current form and perhaps those who might want an idea of what happens on the road to stardom.m.a.c"},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This is a big sprawling nonfiction book told in highly readable \\"sound-bites\\" more than 25 years after the heyday of the ground-breaking television show Saturday Night Live. The author rounds up everyone involved (with the exception of the poor dead people like John Belushi, Gilda Radner, and Chris Farley). So you get an interesting then-and-now view. The participants put their work into perspective with the passing of time. One thing that impressed me was how much this show has influenced American pop culture. Also noteworthy: how incredibly pressured the job was. These people (notably Chevy Chase) ran roughshod over each other, and then had to put up with each other. This is what happens when you get a lot of creative types, big egos, and (yes) recreational drugs at the same table, and then put yourself on a killer schedule. Fans of the show will find this especially fascinating to read."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This is a terrific oral history of the show. Gives you a sense of how it got off the ground, the insane competition for performers and writers to get sketches into the show, and gossipy stuff like politics, obnoxious hosts, and drug use. Reflections on the deaths of Belushi, Gilda, Farley, and Hartman are tremendously moving. I started this book at about 9:00 p.m., did not put it down until 6:30 a.m. the next morning."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"A well crafted behind the scenes commentary by several cast members, producers and writers and hosts. The backbiting politics is probably the best info derived from this book. Interesting how Eddie Murphy decided not to get involved here. Its a shame that he's turned his back on SNL even, apparently, if he had a falling out with Lorne Michaels.This is a great read."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Since it first premiered in 1975, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; has been immortalized with tv specials, rip - offs, movies and dvds. But not one person involved with the show has come forward to tell the stories that emerged from behind the stage. Until now.&quot;Live From New York: An Uncensored history of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, as Told By Its Stars, Writers and Guests&quot; is as engaging as it is informative and witty. With commentary from hosts, writers, cast members and even Lorne Michaels himself. The cast commentary is especially compelling. The stories that influenced were the ones concerning the infamous and controversial moments surrounding &quot;SNL&quot;, like when Nora Dunn refused to appear on the show because Andrew Dice Clay was hosting, and when Sinead O'Connor tore up the picture of the Pope. And Victoria Jackson's commentaries on Nora Dunn and Jan Hooks is acid - tinged intrigue at its best. There are also touching tributes to John Belushi, Chris Farley, and Phil Hartman. It is not without flaws. The newer cast members could've gotten more of a say, and Eddie Murphy contributed to it as well.But I still think this is an enjoyable book. It;'s perfect for anyone who ever dreamed of saying, &quot;Live From New York, It's Saturday Night!&quot;"},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"(Actually, I give it an &quot;A&quot; ! - but reading this book &amp; remembering the &quot;bee&quot; sketches of 1975 was just so great, I had to have a little fun.)I was a fan of this show from its start, watching it religiously when I lived in New York from the mid 70's to the late 80's, and so I found this book to be, in the first part, a highly enjoyable trip down Memory Lane. It evokes the feeling of the show so vividly!The style of the book, with the various players, writers, producers and hosts all talking in turns, is perfect for getting a sense of what was going on with the show, both behind the scenes and in front of the cameras, as the years progressed. This style is also very conducive to the &quot;night-table reading&quot; I did - reading a few pages of it every night.The scenes and people described all felt so familiar to me as the narratives and reminiscences journeyed through those years when I watched the show weekly, and I'd find myself saying &quot;oh yeah, I remember that!&quot; as sketches and sayings I'd not thought about in ages were mentioned. It was also a fascinating eye-opener on the behind-the-scenes machinations, personality clashes, and lifestyles, as well as a vividly brought-to-life catch-up on what I missed from the late 80's on when I moved overseas and so lost touch with SNL. For someone like me, who had never even realised Adam Sandler and David Spade had been SNL alumni, nor ever got to see Chris Farley, the book gave a great sense of what the show was like in &quot;their time&quot;. I was also very moved by the description of the first SNL broadcast after September 11.Therefore, whether you watched SNL ever, always, or never, I highly recommend this book - pure and intelligent entertainment!"},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"The best 'dish' on one of the best shows ever! The most interesting parts, I thought, was when reading things from the writers' perspectives... the unseen, unheralded talent behind it all. (Just an opinion.) Highly recommended.Also recommended - NO ONE'S EVEN BLEEDING and DELANO"},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This books shows very well that SNL was not the mystical, magical place it was purported to be. I've only really liked the original cast, and the mid 1980's cast with Murphy, Piscopo, Guest, Short, etc., etc.. In this book, you really get the feel of SNL, and how really difficult a place it was/is. No one romanticises the experience, and most people seem to have a only a few good memories and a lot of bad ones. The show is not necessarily a spring board to greater success. Only a handful of people from SNL have gone on to the big time. Most of them vanish into obscurity (Jan Hooks, Kevin Nealon, Tim Meadows), or end up doing horrible work (Rob Schneider and David Spade, anyone). Chevy Chase comes across the worst here. By all accounts, he's a real piece of garbage. Janeane Garofalo, surprisingly, gets raked over the coals here. She was only on the show for 6 months, so you would think she wouldn't have made much of an impression. But she managed to alienate nearly everyone on the show during her brief tenure, including calling members of the press and complaining to them on the record about the show, which is not the brightest thing in the world to do. Granted, at the time SNL was garbage, but she could have been more professional. Personally, I've never found her funny in a comic/comedian type of way. I think she has a lot more depth than most people give her credit for, but no one at SNL thought that, and she comes across as extremely insecure.Anyway, after reading this book, you realise it's a miracle that SNL comes up with a show at all, considering all the backstabbing, back biting, tension, stress, drugs, etc., etc. that permeates the scene. If you're a really big fan, you may not want to read this book, because it's not all roses and peaches here. The show is almost unwatchable these days, which is a shame, considering how well it started. Kind of sad..."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This is not a bad book, but it does not even begin to cover SNL, explain its influence on television and culture, or discuss its stars or sketches. Since it consists almost solely of interviews, there is little structure to the book, with topics changing abruptly to new and unrelated topics. There is also a lot missing, such as information about the death of Chris Farley, discussions of popular sketches, or many of the extracurricular activities (e.g. \\"1941,\\" \\"Gilda Live,\\" etc.). There are some interesting tidbits, but it's generally not as revealing as one would like. \\"A Backstage History of SNL,\\" while out of print and only covering through the Ebersol years, is a MUCH stronger and more enjoyable book. (How about a second volume?)."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I would have to say that I wanted to give this book 4 stars, but I didn't want to ruin its perfect rating so I gave it the five star rating. It is a very good read and it is very informative about the comedy show that we all grew up with.I wish they would have spent more time on issues like least faorite guests and things of that nature and I wish they would have organized the book more by topic than by chronology.All of the above things aside I think it is a wonderful book and would highly recommend it to all those that grew up loving SNL. It wears long after about page 450, but it is easy up to that point. It is full of little fights and things about the crew you never knew.It really makes you want to go back and watch some of the first episodes now that you know what they were going through at the time.RECOMMEDATION: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"If you took out every comment by cast, writers and producers on trying (unsuccessfully)to figure out Lorne Michaels, this heavy tome would easily be cut in half. Too much whining, too little interesting, historical information for me, a long time fan of the show."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"The book starts strong and does a great job of covering the early years (the part I suspect most readers will care about) but seriously bogs down as it moves into coverage of the early 90's.Ultimately, it could have been at least 100 pages shorter. By the time I got to the 20+ pages of recollections on Lorne Michaels, I couldn't take it anymore."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Any Comedy, SNL or TV lover in general will adore this book. It has comedic insight, and above all is a fun, fun read."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I agree with whoever wrote that this book was way too long and unorganized. I was hoping to learn more about the behind the scenes works, and boy, did I. Drugs, partying, sexism, racism, it's all here and more. There are some great gems among all the trivia people already know.But it's all quotes from the different actors, writers and producers. There are some photos to break things up, but nothing else. No cute little sidebars or anything. Heck, if it's good enough for my school textbooks, why not put some in here. I don't have ADD, but it got tedious after awhile.The format makes for an odd read. You get things like someone rapsodizing about what a \\"beautiful person\\" John Belushi was a couple paragraphs after someone reminiscing about the time he set stuff on fire and passed out in a drunken stupor. Oh well."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller seemingly provided an opportunity for free therapy sessions to all former and current SNL staffers. The whining, moaning and venting about how hard their lives are is more laughable than most of the SNL skits they've ever performed in.The book provided nothing interesting in how the show actually operates. Sniping at one another seems to be the only reason for most cast member to even agree to be interviewed for the book. Missed opportunities by not interviewing lesser cast members (though they might have turned down the authors) could have painted a complete other picture.The special on Biography (on A&amp;E) was more interesting than this book - and was only an hour. Catch that instead."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"A 600+ page book about Saturday Night Live can seem rather intimidating. But once you open it up and see the style with which it is written you can easily understand why it's so long. The book is comprised of excerpts from interviews with cast members new and old, just about every writer that walked through the building, and most executives at NBC. This all culminates in a very interesting read. However, one can get antsy reading over 100 pages of talk about the show before it was ever on the air. Once that is over with, the juicy stuff starts. You'll learn who was well respected and who was not. But at the same time you get conflicting views of the same person so it's hard to create a mental image of any particular individual. For instance, Lorne Michaels is a central figure in all the talks, yet I feel like I would be better off reading a biography on him than reading this book. Sure, you only get one angle, but sometimes that's the easiest to ingest."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"It takes a lot to hold my interest for 608 pages but this behind-the-scenes look at this iconic TV show definitely did just that. Many books promise to dish the dirt and fall far short. Not in this case. Having watched the show (religiously in the 70's & 80's, sporadically after that) I was intrigued by the inner workings of putting together 90 minutes of live television every week. Just the process itself was fascinating and then on top of that, we get a very intimate look at the talented and often troubled personalities who so brilliantly entertained us. I was impressed with the willingness of the cast and crew to participate and the honesty of their recollections. Clashes of egos, backstage romances, creative insecurities, power struggles...it's all here and then some. If you're old enough to remember Roseanne Roseannadanna, a couple of wild and crazy guys and \\"Land shark!\\" you will love this book."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This was a good book. That said, it didn't tell me a lot I didn't already know. I was surprised to find out what a tool Chevy Chase is, but the book really only glossed over that too. Mostly, it's a lot of producers, writers and network execs giving divergent accounts of why stuff went right or wrong. It's hard to tell who the liars are, but obviously there are plenty of them here since so many people contradict each other. Quotes from the actors make up a minority of the book.The whole idea that the book is \\"full of juicy gossip\\" is wrong IMO. It's actually full of TV execs talking about why they think everything was someone else's fault."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Good stuff - some funny, some serious, but all the little \\"stories\\" you've never heard from behind the curtain at SNL!"},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Read this book fairly quickly and loved the parts about the original cast from the first five years as the originals ar always the best. Chevy Chase is portrayed as a major jerk who poisoined himself with his fellow cast members amd remained unpopular with future casts even after leaving the show. Will Ferell goes on a lengthy explanation of the behavior that made Chase such a jerk in the eyes of the future generation of SNL cast members and a gay cast member told a story in which Chase suggested a sketch where the gay man contracted AIDS and they would weigh him each week to see how much weight he had lost.A lot of the stories in regards to Chris Farley are depressing and just down right sad as it seems he was hell bent on following Belushi to the grave in the same fashion where as, according to those who knew Belushi and are featured in the book, Belushi had a problem and simply made a mistake. Apparently Farley once stuck a pool cue up his butt at a party, then took it out and began licking it. Based on what's said about Belushi in the book, I highly doubt he would have found Farley very funny.I recommend this book to anyone interested in SNL and anyone who isn't. The cadt and crew tell their own story rather than a biography with an author's opinion."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book and felt like I got an insiders look into SNL. The book allowed everyone to say their peace and give their side of the story. It was interesting to see all of the dynamics from the executives, to Loren, to the writers and the actors. I felt like i could really form my own opinion based on the testimonies of the people involved. It was an easy to read format with little blurbs from each person involved in a particular topic/cast/year. The writers would all a paragraph here and there to help transition between topics."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"What an interesting book this is! I have been a \\"casual\\" fan of SNL since its beginning and remember all the actors and actresses who were on the show from the beginning. This book is about them and the producers, directors and guest hosts of this show since 1975. The writers/editors of this book did interviews with the directors from Lorne Michaels to Dick Ebersol, the actors from Dan Ackroyd to Jimmy Fallon, and guests hosts from Chevy Chase (cast member of the 1st season) to Lily Tomlin, Alec Baldwin, Tom Hanks, and more. This is a fascinating story of those who created Saturday Night Live in 1975 and how it expanded the horizons of live, in your face, funny Television. The road they tell about has alot of bumps, twists and turns and new ground that was laid. The behind the scenes were crazy, full of turmolt, hostile, funny, sad, tragic, and triumphant. From the drugs and sex of the 1970's to the back biting, back stabbing that happened more than a few times, this show always produced great seasons, not-so-great seasons, and nearly great seasons on television every saturday night. The cast and crews comments on deceased members is sad and fascinating to read from John Belushi, to Phil Hartmann, to Chris Farley are told. The opinions of Billy Crystal,Lily Tomlyn, Mike Meyers, Dana Carvey, and others enhance this book as well. So much is in this book that it would take a few more pages of this review. Overall, this is a fantastic book to those who are interested in the history of television, comedy, and those who are just fans of Saturday Night Live."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I agree with the many positive comments. This is a fascinating and entertaining history of one of TV's great institutions. You can either dip into it or, as I did, read it from cover to cover. There are many fascinating anecdotes, but also plenty of insights into the key particpants. Warmly recommended."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"First up, I don't watch SNL anymore. Ever since Norm MacDonald left, I just didn't care. These days, I watch the occasional video online when I hear of a good sketch, but that's about it. Basically, I'm not much of a SNL fan. With that being said, this book is excellent.Nearly every living SNL star ever, such as Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Adam Sandler, Chevy Chase and Will Ferrell, to more obscure, members like Chris Elliott and Janeane Garofalo are all interviewed for the book. Alongside the actors are directors, musicians, actors and of course, Lorne Michaels. Basically everyone but Eddie Murphy gets involved.The book takes you from the beginning glory years to the crappy years to the beginning of the Tina Fey/Jimmy Fallon years. It was hard for me to put this book down, and I cruised through it in a couple weeks. It's large, but endlessly entertaining. You find out about a lot of controversies and arguments, drug use, romances all of which are told in a surprisingly candid way. The people involved are more honest than I thought they ever would be, and thankfully it's not just a bunch of asinine PR talk where everyone loves each other.What I really enjoy about the book is that there are no long winded explanations by the authors of the inner workings of SN. They let the people involved tell the stories themselves. It's a fast moving, entertaining read.Even if you don't like watching SNL (like myself), but are a fan of at least a few of the performers from the show, or have an interest in TV or movies at all, I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I loved this book! It was like sitting around the fireplace listening to old war stories from your grandpa and his buddies as they remembered all the things they did. The stories you hear are not just the front-line of the war and the gunshots, but the planning, day to day operations, and the relationships that were built over the years. Of course war stories are much more real and can be scary, but these stories that are shared in this book are compelling, interesting and personal. When you read this book you can hear the voices talking.I should point out that I am not a huge SNL fan, I liked some of their work and see the show once in awhile. I grew up in the 70's and 80's and can remember when the show first came on the air and how amazing and groundbreaking it was. I was born in 1968, so was still young at the time, but grew-up with Saturday Night Live as a staple part of my Saturday Nights (or Sunday Mornings once Tivo came along) and now just watch the clips on Hulu.Though I am not a big SNL Fan, and consider myself just a casual viewer, I think this book was one of the most interesting entertainment books I have read in a long time.If you are a fan of SNL you will LOVE this book as it takes you behind the scenes, into the lives of the people involved and lets you experience what was going on during the years this show was growing up and becoming what it is today. If you are a huge fan of SNL, you probably have already read this book so I probably should ignore you for now.If you are interested in entertainment or the television industry you will find this book to be really interesting as they take you behind the scenes of one of the most groundbreaking shows in the history of late night television, and let you peak at the personalities and egos that were there making this happen. The stories that are told get into a lot of details behind the scenes of the show and talk about the founding and growth of SNL and the many players throughout the years that had a hand in making the show so much a part of our entertainment culture.If you just like to read stories about people and their lives (biography or diary), you will find this book to be really fun to read. It is in effect a bunch of verbatim's from people that were involved in the making of SNL over the years. You can feel the emotions and relationships that existed and the stress and frustrations that came with the territory of producing a live television show.Regardless of who you are, I strongly recommend this book for anyone that is interested in modern culture and/or history, but doesn't want to be bored with another politics book or story about the Kardashians.Check it out, it is fun and interesting at the same time."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This book is a great read - If you're reading it while watching Saturday Night Live.I originally just started reading it alone, and while it was interesting I also found it a bit hard to follow sometimes. Because the book begins at the beginning of SNL's history, and because it's more a compilation of interviews then a straight-up story, it's hard to remember who everyone is. Unless you can sharply remember the first season's cast, some of the ponderousness will surely go over your head.Instead, in my opinion the best way to read this book is to either track down all 30-odd seasons on DVD, or sign up for Hulu Plus for a few months, and watch every episode of the show, reading the book along the way. It gives a fantastic insight into the show, why it was awesome for a few seasons, why it sucked at other periods of time, and it gives you a deeper understanding of the writers, the performers, and the executives in the show.Overall, it's a fantastic book to read if you actually know what they're talking about."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"It is oftentimes tougher to piece together a book based on interviews than to write a narrative. Live From New York is an oral history of the show, with chapters to denote the years and subsections to introduce topics.The book works with this approach and probably couldn't have been penned in any other way. The candidness and pointed opinions of the people involved needed to be heard in their own words.There is a wealth of \\"insider\\" information on how ideas were developed, the feuds off the stage that ignited the work before the audience and why grudges from years past have never been settled.What is particularly interesting is how the program evolved over the first five years, since that foundation is how SNL has been measured since.After being written off numerous times, the TV icon that is SNL continues to forge ahead, which is how the book concludes. A fan of SNL or a person wanting to explore a continuing piece of American pop culture can't get any closer to the program."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I could go on forever about this book (and the show). SNL was an inspiration to my career, so this book was a must for my collection.Some people are shattered by the harsh accounts given in this book. For real SNL fans, there is nothing too new here. What is nicely done is that the telling of these backstage stories are quite complete and nicely pieced together. For example, if there's an story about a specific cast member...you will read from several people (fellow castmembers, the person itself, agents, producers, etc.) on the issue. This clears up a lot of the gossip and explains in-depth the &quot;truth&quot; (or at least a more objective compilation) of how some of these historical occurances came to be.SNL is a fascinating institution. You will quickly understand the impact this show has made on pop-culture, comedy, politics, and many things we take for granted today. More importantly, you will understand what it was like at the time as it was happening to these people who all thought they were going to the be the cast that ended the show that of course still goes on years after them. SNL has transformed from the rebel of television to the standard of what sketch comedy and late night entertainment has become. It refreshed the variety show days and brought players from the Second City and other such troupes to the mainstream audience.This book is probably the best account you will ever get of what its like to work in this sort of high paced enviroment. It is always intersting to see the collaboration, frustration, and artistic struggle of all the writers, performers, guest hosts, producers, and even agents that are all representing in this thick compilation.This book does also include many personal stories that reveal more of the human side to this fraternity of SNL alum...and beyond the protected PR world. Petty cast squabbles, working for a man like Lorne, and sadly the loss of Belushi, Gilda, Hartman, Farley, and others.Its an easy read, easy to pick up and flip around in any order. You will likely find yourself reading this book for hours at a time (yes, it is a thick chunk of pages!) and soon Cross-referencing people and stories (in a VERY detailed and useful index!) Take all the fluff stuff you saw on E!'s true Hollywood Stories and People....and look up the real deal here in this book. There will be &quot;his side and her side&quot; and therefore somewhere the truth.If you like SNL, get the 20th anniversary book...if you love SNL, this book will test that love. You will either feel at home, run screaming, or just have mixed emotions for us entertainment business types."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I was excited when I found this book, not only because I had watched Saturday night live for as long as I can remember, but I was eager to learn what went on behind the scenes. And I received more than I bargained for, in all good ways. The great thing about this book is it is told by the cast, writers, producers, and NBC executives. It is from their mouths. It isnt rumored tales or reporters speculating. Of course there are different opinions and feelings, but for the most part, all the cast members seem to have the same feelings. They feel a brotherhood to eachother. When you watch the show, and see the sketches, one believes these people are just having a grand old time, and you dont realize how much is involved until you read this. It starts back in 75 with the original cast members, those who are still alive, talking about what it was like. Drugs involved, pressures, etc. It goes over deaths of Gilda Radner, Jon Belushi, Phil Hartman and Chris Farrley. Almost all the cast memebers ever on the show speak in this book, with the exception of Eddie Murphy who, for some reason doesnt want to be any part of Saturday night live, even though thats what made him. For most of the cast members SNL was their platform to stardom. There also is alot of bitterness present, as with Janeane Garafalo. Most of all the cast members and the writers feel pretty much the same about Lorne Michaels, the exucutive producer. He is the creator and the father figure. They all greatly seek his approval, which is scarce. But most look back at him in kindness.It is a great read, soooooo much information you would never have known otherwise. I really thought this would be one of those books that would last me a while and I looked forward to that, but because you know so many of the cast and are so interested in the words from their own mouth, you really cant put it down. Dont pass this one by!!"},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Anyone who has been a fan of SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE should enjoy this book, whether you're an original cast fan, an Eddie Murphy fan, an 80's or 90's fan. It's all here. You'll read the stories the performers and writers tell and then watch the reruns with a new perspective.I remember watching the first SNL when I was in junior high and have been a fan ever since (I have two favorite casts: the original Players and then the Phil Hartman/Jan Hooks/Jon Lovitz/Dana Carvey period).The book is 565 pages long, but I kept wishing for more insights into a lot of the classic characters and sketches. A good place to find that kind of detail is in another book that came out in the late 1980's called SATURDAY NIGHT: A BACKSTAGE HISTORY OF &quot;SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE&quot; by Doug Hill &amp; Jeff Weingrad (definitely worth reading for the early history of the show).But the behind-the-scenes dramas and brawls here are irresistible. I thought Bill Murray's comments had a depth and thoughtfulness while I still wonder how Chevy Chase can keep going back to host with his boorish and obnoxious behavior (when recently interviewed by Fox News about his rude past documented in this and other books, Chevy said probably the most suspicious thing any celebrity could say: &quot;I don't read them...they're all lies.&quot; Huh?).I really appreciated reading about how the deaths of John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Phil Hartman and Chris Farley affected the other performer/writers.Definitely worth checking out."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I would've given this tome 5 stars had it not given short shrift to lesser-known and/or less successful ex-cast members (i.e., Ellen Cleghorne, David Koechner, Mary Gross, Charles Rocket, etc.) who might've provided more brutally honest and assumedly bitter versions of how things operate over at \\"SNL.\\" Sure, there are a few - Tim Kazurinsky and Gilbert Gottfried pop up with comments on the disastrous '80 season and the unbalanced \\"Eddie Murphy\\" years - but, as a comedy nerd, I'm far more interested in how so much great talent gets neutered in the SNL machine. It seems from the book that, on this show, it's not enough to be brilliantly funny... one must be brilliantly funny AND ruthless. The details of the pressure-cooker, snake-pit atmosphere in which the show runs certainly goes a long way to exaplain why it is more often unfunny than funny. Anyway, the tales that are told between the covers are highly entertaining and it's difficult to put the book down! If you've read the fine Hill/Weingrad book on SNL, the second half of the book, detailing the Billy Crystal/Rich Hall/Pamela Stephenson years to the recent Tina Fey/Tracy Morgan/Horatio Sanz era is the most enlightening (meaning, packed with things you've never heard before). Recommended."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I thought only Stephen King could keep me up nights, but this book is keeping me up wanting to read &quot;just one more&quot; anecdote. If you're a long-time SNL fan like I am, or just like the show now and wonder how it all got started, this is the complete oral history. It's an easy, fun read. And if you have a long memory like I have, you'll find yourself laughing out loud remembering skits you didn't even know you'd forgotten."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Good points first (and there are good points): This book is truly an insider's view of the show, the politics surrounding the show, from virtually every perspective possible. It's an interesting primer on how shows are created, their evolutions, the tension between the &quot;suits&quot; and the creative types, among the creative types, and so forth.Weak points: This book needed a lot of editing. It's as if raw tapes were transcribed; the comments and views could have been tightened up substantially without losing any of the flavor. Every once in a while, the authors (Shales and Miller) provide a bit of commentary, but it's not enough...kind of like a Christmas fruit cake with too many jellied fruits and not enough dough.Another weak point--probably not Shales' and Miller's fault, but due to the way the book was created--is that you're given the sense that what appeared on the air was generally &quot;the best of the best&quot;...that the process of winnowing down all the material left most of the gems on-air (as well as many that regrettably didn't make it). I was mostly a fan of the earlier years but, after reading the book, I watched many of the shows on satellite (Comedy Channel). A lot of the shows and a lot of the bits were pretty weak. My point: There's a real disconnect between what many of the writers and performers recall and what the tape actually reveals."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Despite the length of this book (565 pages not counting the cast lists and index), I read it in just a few sittings over a few days. The format is excerpts from interviews with the key participants, chopped up and arranged in chronological order, in most cases with the same events described from different perspectives placed next to each other. This style allows the distortion of memory (or flat out dissembling) to become blatantly obvious (e.g., Fred Silverman's account of his response to Al Franken's \\"Limo for a Lame-O\\" sketch on p. 182 contrasted with Lorne Michaels' account immediately preceding it and Warren Littlefield's account immediately following it). The personal filters are obvious as well in the accounts of Harry Shearer and Janeane Garofalo versus those of the others who were on the show with them.I highly recommend this book to anyone who's a fan of SNL or its writers or stars. Seinfeld fans will want to check out the stories about Larry David's season as a writer on the show."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I'm not one to spend the money on a hardcover book. Honestly I'd rather wait for the paperback or check it out from the library. But, my wife and I are big SNL fans, and the reviews I've read piqued my interest. This was worth every penny and honestly one of the best books I've read in a long, long time. What I enjoyed most was the different points of view shown by the cast members, writers, hosts, and Lorne himself. The details are sometimes shocking, but always entertaining. I laughed out loud at least a dozen times. A must for any SNL fan or entertainment industry buff."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I have to say I really enjoyed \\"Live From New York\\"...for about 350 or so pages. But like too many of the current SNL skits, it just begins to drag out, and the book becomes a chore to finish.I really enjoyed hearing about the original cast and crew, how the show got started, the challenges faced by Lorne Michaels and the cast in simply getting skits on the air. And while I'm very familiar with the cast and crew from the first five seasons, I found some of the most interesting parts of the book dealing with the fumbling around of the 1980 season, and the Dick Ebersol era as well.No punches are pulled, you get all of the highlights and all of the low-lights straight from the mouths of the crew, cast and creators. I liked that nothing was glided over, from the drug abuse by various cast members, to the pressure and horror of writing and producing a 90 minute live television show every week gets a thorough treatment.I will say it took me awhile to get into the \\"interview\\" style of writing, I am used to a more \\"narrative\\" type of writing. I guess the biggest issue I had with this writing style and the format of the book is that it offered quite a bit of repetition. For instance when the 1980 season is looked at and we get offered a plethora of opinions about Jean Doumanian and her reign as producer, everyone chimes in on whether Jean was a good choice, was the season a total failure, who were the breakout stars, etc. And by the end of the section you realize you've just read 30 pages of people either saying \\"Jean wasn't a good choice\\" or \\"Jean did the best job she could've under those circumstances\\"....only repeated like 50 times by a variety of people. So, yes while it may be interesting to hear Gilbert Gottfried's opinion..when it's basically the EXACT same thing as said by Joe Piscopo and by Dick Ebersol and several other to boot, it kind of gets stale. And this happens over and over again throughout the book on every topic. Something along the lines of \\"Jean was in over her head, and most of the 1980 cast agreed.\\" would've gotten the point across.....and saved the reader quite a bit of time.The only other complaint I have regarding \\"Live From New York\\" is the final chapter on Lorne Michaels. Okay, I understand SNL is Michaels...and Michaels is SNL, but talk about repetition!! Why do we have to read from about 100 different people that Lorne is the \\"father figure\\" around SNL??! I think we could've gleaned that info from about 10 cast members just as well, instead, we read over and over again how when it comes to praise Lorne is kind of skimpy...but when he does praise your performance or your writing...it's really great. Ugh...that got old quick.Still, as a fan of the show, I enjoyed this book. I like the behind the scenes info, and it really is amazing that SNL is still thriving...he'll it's been almost 10 years since this book was published!! If you are a die-hard fan of the series, you'll enjoy this book, and if you wonder just how in world SNL has survived almost 40 years this book is worth picking."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"This book is almost all great and shows the inception, creation, and evolution of a cultural landmark. Whatever you think about SNL today it is hard to deny its effect on the comedy and pop culture landscape of the late 20th century into the 21st century. The oral history format allows for many people from many different viewpoints to be heard. Almost everyone in SNL's history has been interviewed with the glaring omission of Eddie Murphy who refused to be interviewed. This gives the reader a look at those who did not become stars or did but not through the avenue of SNL. It shows that the system in place while successful is not for everyone. The most interesting bits often come from those who the average person doesn't know about from SNL. Anyone interested in comedy and how it is created and produced should read this book. The only problem with this book is the final chapter that focuses on Lorne Michaels. There should not have been a chapter devoted entirely to him as a coda. Lorne is such a massive figure throughout the book whether he is present or not that we get a clear picture of him. The book is in a way a stealth biography of Lorne and his relationship with the show that came to define him. The chapter serves to pad out the book and the chapter itself is kind of a slog. If the statements used in this chapter were sprinkled throughout the book it would have been more palatable. Even with this problem the book is highly worth reading even if the Lorne chapter is worth skiming through unless you love people talking about Lorne Michaels"},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Shales and Miller provide extensive, rarely seen detail of what goes on behind the scenes of America's most influential and enduring comedy television show. This hefty volume includes commentary from almost all the surviving writers, cast members and many guest hosts. Also, much space is devoted to memories of John Belushi, Chris Farley, Phil Hartman, and others who had not survived to 2003 when this book was published. This book's style may not be the easiest to follow, although I had no real problem. I think it highlights the transitions from one era to the next, for example, the age difference between Nealon, Hartman, etc. and Sandler, Farley, Spade, and Rock in the early nineties exposes a generation gap. What is fresh and hilarious to some is merely \\"juvenile\\" to others.The most prevalent feeling I came away from reading this was probably envy. These people got to be part of a small fraternity/sorority that everyone else envies. Bill Murray is quoted saying,\\" Having the experience was probably the greatest thing.\\" Instead reading this book is the closest thing to being a fly-on-the- wall I'll ever experience. The show is a pop culture icon, and since it debuted in 1975, there's much territory to cover. The book allots large space for the first legendary cast and especially Lorne Michaels. You might argue with that, but I won't. Shales and Miller definitely give you and appreciation for Michaels, love him or hate him his show has stood the test of time.The book is long. It deserved more editing in my opinion, although any fan could pick out cast members, characters, or even eras that deserved more space. It's a dilemma, with so much material, what to include or leave out. Saturday Night Live has constantly reinvented itself and remains relevant even today; there's never been anything else quite like it on TV."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"If you're a hardcore SNL fan who is interested in learning the history of the show, this book is for you. If you want to read about what happened the behind-the-scenes--the sex, drugs, and so on--this book is for you. I liked the way the people involved told the bulk of the story. I loved the first 25-30% of the book but then it felt like I was reading the same story from one season to the next: this guy did these drugs, this woman was sleeping with this guy, this one wasn't too popular with other cast members ... and then that season ended and another began. I couldn't finish it."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Saturday Night Live, now nearly 30 years old, has had its ups and downs. Some years the show was hilarious, others...well, not so much (remember when Robert Downey Jr. was a cast member? no? maybe he doesn't either). Cast members have come and (with the exception of Darrell Hammond) gone.Trying to tell the story of Saturday Night Live would, no doubt, be an enormous challenge. So, why not let the cast and crew tell the story themselves? That is the aim of this book, with a well put together chain of short stories and anecdotes that, for me, seems to capture the spirit of the show both on stage and behind the scenes. Kudos to Miller and Shales for letting the people tell their own story, with very little interruption from the \\"authors\\".You'll read stories from producers, writers, the cast, guest hosts, and more. You'll learn of the love-hate relationship people have with Lorne Michaels, the competition among writers to get their work on the show, opinions about several infamous incidents on the show (remember Sinead O'Connor's little \\"bonus\\" she put at the end of her song?), and which guest host was particularly proud of his...ahem...manhood.For fans of the show, I honestly can't imagine a better way to read about the history of Saturday Night Live."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"I loved the book. Living in the mid west, you're not privy to rumors and stories in the local paper about SNL. I loved reading inside stories and such.

It was hard with the lesser known cast members that were quoted, and trying to remember who they were."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Live from New York is an excellent history lesson in television culture. This book shows every five years of SNL and the obstacles cast members faced while working on the legendary Saturday Night Live.It goes behind the characters we all admire and we find out their deep dark secrets like Gilda Radner's eating problem or the conflicts leading up to Lorne Michaels quitting.It also has a in depth, touching view by the surviving cast members who tell their side of the story after Belushi, Radner, Hartman, and Farley's deaths.If you love SNL or biographies of your favorite celebrities then this book is for you.

All in all, this book doesn't seem that exciting.Contrary to what one might think, it's a truly fascinating saga of one of the most beloved shows ever to grace television.You delve in from the beginning, hearing the contradictory stories of who came up with the idea for the show and who knew what people to get Saturday Night Live on the air.There are stories and recollections from every aspect of the show imaginable. The producers, the writers, performers, hosts, network executives, etc. Seemingly, everyone that has ever been involved with the show, (with the exception of Eddie Murphy), is avaialbe to tell the tales of behind the scenes of the most famous sketch comedy show.The most beautiful aspect of the interviews that make up the book, is that nobody holds anything back. Everyone there tells what they see/saw as the truth of the matter at the time.You get to find out what happened backstage when Chevy Chase and Bill Murray ran into each other as Chase came back as host. Joe Piscapo and the rules of Sinatra impressions. The drugs, the sex, the bitterness, the love, the hatred, the demise of so many people throughout the history of the show.Some of the most fascinating and interesting peope are the ones you'd never expect. Conan O'Brien, Tim Kazursky, Lorne Michaels, Jeneane Garafaolo, Dick Ebersol, etc. all have wonderful ways of pouring out their hearts and minds about what it truly was like in studio 8H for the past 30 years."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"Live from New York is a hefty volume collecting the experiences of the numerous cast members, guest hosts, writers, producers, and others involved with the show since 1975. This book helped me understand how hard it is and has been to keep SNL on the air. Although cocaine and other stimulants are largely absent in the SNL offices today, as we're told to believe anyway, the show still mandates at least one-nighter and four days of incomparable stress to produce one and half hours of TV on Saturday night. This work regimen has produced some of the funniest moments in TV history and has established SNL as a cultural icon.Almost every important person involved with show throughout its history except Eddie Murphy was interviewed for this book, and the entire book save maybe 10 pages consists of clips of these interviews. We get to read about Lorne Michaels' and Dick Ebersol's early struggles to put the show on in 1975. We learn about the greatness of the original cast and its drug-induced wildness and internecine warfare. The book then does a great job in describing the lows of the show during the Jean Doumanian and Dick Ebersol years and SNL's subsequent resurrection during the years of Phil Hartman, Dana Carvey, Jon Lovitz, Mike Myers, etc. The new cast surprisingly gets quite a bit of space in the latter part of the book considering its competition in the previous pages. The authors also spend a number of pages presenting various people's reactions to the deaths of John Belushi, Gilda Radner, and Chris Farley.Live from New York does a great job of letting us know about the unseen drama that has occurred behind one of the greatest shows in TV history. Using the interviews as the actual text was a great idea because the interviewees' words came through unadulterated. My only criticism of the book is that at almost 600 pages, it's a bit long, but that's it."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"The perfect book for anyone that has grown up watching one of the most successful television shows of all time. It provides a a behind the scenes look at the creation and production of Saturday Night Live, through a oral history of the producers, writers and actors who have come and gone over the years. The book has an interesting narrative style, which takes a bit of getting used to but totally makes sense when you think about the daunting task it must have been to compile all this information in the first place. The book is not a critique of the show and generally lets the participants tell when they had it right and when they didn't. It is wisely divided into time periods, which also makes sense when you think about it. My only criticisms of the book is that it does not get into more critical detail of the show or how the writers and actors were treated and I also found the last chapter, a salute to Lorne Michaels, to be rather self-serving and unnecessary, as if it were a condition for writing the book in the first place.Again, this is the perfect book for anyone who can remember watching the very first episode and who grew up staying up late every Saturday night just to watch this show. A great job."},{"Title":"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live","review":"this book is one for only true snl fans, like myself. it isn't just full of lines like: &quot;oh, i remember when this happened...&quot; or &quot;then on this episode...&quot; you get a complete picture of how the show works; how it was created, the day to day schedule and some behind the scenes gossip. although there are some &quot;remember when&quot; moments, it's not all reminiscent. when i first heard of the book, i figured it was going to consist of a lot of gossip about who was dating who, and who hated who, etc, etc. there was some of that, and truthfully, i would have liked to know more. as a younger fan (i was born nearly 5 years after the show's conception), i missed all the controversy in the show's beginnings. on the other hand, this book will please those fans who have been with the show since the beginning. it covers everything from the beginning of lorne michaels' career, memorable characters and moments straight through the book's publication, why you won't see anthony michael hall in reruns, and why you should be suprised you see eddie murphy. there are interviews with writers, cast and crew members and guest hosts both old and new, along with complete cast lists. buy this book for any of these resons, or if you're just interested in the way things work; you'll see the show and it's cast in a whole new light. you're gonna love it."},{"Title":"Principles of Transport Economics","review":"Let me begin by saying that texts of economic subfields come in two varieties: the excessively simple and the mathematically precise. The former is meant for a survey course for freshmen or sophmores, the latter is meant for a serious student in a dedicated field of study.This book falls in the latter. While there are a small number of obvious (and annoying) errors, if you work through the derivations of the formulas as you should, instead of blithely copying them down, you will catch the bulk of them.The surveys of research are thorough and fairly complete, and since the authors represent European universities there is a fair amount of European literature included (some from non-English reviews). The formulas are a welcome addition, explained thoroughly and so complement classroom lecture or a serious student of mathematics and economics.If you aren't too solid on the math, I'd recommend a good review of mathematical econ, ie Takayama's classic tome."},{"Title":"Billy","review":"I don't know WHAT book the others read but this is a fantastic story of growing up.

Second Revised Edition. Edited by Dan H. Laurence.Vol. 1: 1876-1890. 958 pp. Introduction by Dan H. Laurence [pp. 7-22]. Editor's Note [pp. 23-25]. Editor's Note to Second Edition [p. 26].Vol. 2: 1890-1893. 986 pp.Vol. 3: 1893-1950. 925 pp. Appendix [pp. 773-783]. Biographical Index [pp. 787-803]. General Index to the entire edition compiled by Ralph Bateman [pp. 805-925].First published thus, 1981.Second Revised Edition, 1989.=================================================Now this really IS the definitive edition of Bernard Shaw's musical criticism.I have rambled a lot about about Shaw's opinions on music at other places, so here I will repeat again that every serious admirer of classical music simply MUST have these three volumes on his or her shelves, and that's that. Believe me or not, it is worth every cent of its price, and much more. What follows are bibliographical details which should convince that the edition does deserve the strong adjective \\"definitive\\".Now, to put the matter succinctly, the major portion of Bernard Shaw's musical criticism consists of four different works, one them being a three-volume set though:\\"London Music in 1888-89 as heard by Corno di Bassetto\\" (1937)\\"Music in London 1890-94\\" (1932, 3 vols.)\\"The Perfect Wagnerite\\" (1898)\\"How to Become a Musical Critic\\" (1960, ed. D.H.L.)The first two of these collect Bernard Shaw's musical criticism from his nearly seven, so to say, \\"professional years\\" (1888-94) during which he earned his living as a musical critic for \\"The Star\\" and \\"The World\\". The third of the above volumes is Shaw's book-length essay on Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen and the fourth, and the only posthumous one, is a collection of hitherto uncollected writings on music, first published in book form in 1960 thanks to the editorial work of the great Shavian scholar Dan H. Laurence, hereafter referred to as D.H.L.The three huge volumes of Shaw's Music reprint in chronological order every single word of the four works above - and more. Both before and after - and even between - his two tenures as a professional music critic Shaw wrote prodigiously on the subject for various periodicals; his earliest criticism ever was done anonymously for \\"The Hornet\\"in 1876-77, when he was but 20 or 21 years old, and his last piece on music was written few days before his death at the age of 94 in 1950. D.H.L. collected many of these pieces - including some \\"professional\\" ones Shaw omitted from the four volumes published during his lifetime - in his marvellous collection \\"How to Become a Musical Critic\\". What he did miss then is included here.Few details about the contents are probably worth mentioning. The pieces collected here for the first time amount to the staggering 125 000 words. (Well, many of these HAD already been published before, in \\"How to Become a Musical Critic\\", so the amount of really previously unpublished material is rather more modest than that.) Many paragraphs that Shaw deleted for one reason or another from \\"London Music 1890-94\\" are restored here, though basically the pieces remain as edited by Shaw himself, that is his many omissions of irrelevant passages from the original newspaper articles are retained. There is only one substantial omission and this is a report of Andrew Lang's lecture on literature which, inexplicably, was included in \\"London Music 1890-94\\". Also of note is that the version of \\"The Perfect Wagnerite\\" reprinted here is the final one from 1930; please note that the popular Dover paperback edition reprints the Fourth edition from 1923; the prefaces to the first four editions are included here.The Introduction and the Editor's Note - the previous paragraphs are heavily indebted to both - by D.H.L. are exemplary in every aspect; many an editor might learn a good deal from them how an editorial work should be done. The only disappointing thing, but understandable and indeed admitted in a footnote, is that the Introduction is a slightly revised version of the one written in 1960 for \\"How to Become a Musical Critic\\"; but since this is an excellent piece I have no right to complain. Another fascinating thing is that D.H.L. has given a title to each piece - most of Shaw's columns were originally untitled - and he even has supplied the text with footnotes that explain obscure historical details or Shaw's elaborate puns; all pieces contain a date and a source under their titles too, sometimes enlarged to include relevant historical or bibliographical details. Also compiled by D.H.L., and also a slightly revised version of the one from 1960, is the Biographical Index which consists of short biographical notes about many a musician, perfectly forgotten today, who surface regularly in Shaw's pieces. I have to say that both the footnotes and the Biographical Index leave something to be desired and might have been more extensive, but let me not get carried away with nitpicking. The idea about the titles is indeed wonderful for it immediately gives one an idea what the piece in question deals with and makes any desultory reading of the volumes much pleasanter than it would otherwise have been. As far as possible, the titles were extracted from phrases in the text; much as I dislike a title like ''Liszt the Charlatan'', I have no right to complain here either, for that's precisely what Shaw said.It goes without saying that a fine index is absolutely essential for any scholarly edition of such imposing proportions. I am happy to report that the General Index compiled by one Ralph Bateman is simply stupendous. It takes 120 pages and is greatly superior to any index in previous volumes. Each entry about a composer consists of general references, specific ones about different aspects of his personality, and finally all works by him ever mentioned by Shaw, many of which have separate entries also. Please note that the third volume contains the index to ALL volumes; the first two volumes have no separate indexes. Therefore, it hardly makes any sense to acquire anything else but the complete set. Similarly, the Introduction of D.H.L. and his important notes are to be found ONLY in the first volume.Physically speaking, the edition is nicely produced, on a thick paper and in a surprisingly large font, both very comfortable for reading at any rate. The only drawback is the paperback binding. It is indeed a MAJOR drawback: handling nearly a thousand pages in paperback is monstrously inconvenient. Now the edition was originally published in 1981 and in hardback, but I have not been able to discover so far that the Second Revised Edition (1989) has ever been published in anything else but paperback.One is bound to ask the obvious question. What is the difference between the two editions? This is concisely and lucidly explained by D.H.L. in his Editor's Note to Second Edition and I certainly can't do better than to repeat his words. The only major difference between the two editions are four additional pieces that were discovered after 1981; these are reprinted in the Appendix to the third volume of the 1989 edition and occupy altogether ten pages. The pieces are perfectly fascinating of course - one of them is a scathing criticism of a performance by the Bach Choir which Shaw thought too severe to be reprinted! - but I doubt they justify a whole new edition of a work nearly 3000 pages long. D.H.L. also mentions a number of corrections in the text and in the index, but I suspect, though I've never seen it, that the old edition from 1981 is pretty much as good as the Second Revised one. And it's available in hardback.By way of conclusion I should like to quote the last paragraph of D.H.L.'s Editor's Note. It contains a charming quote from Shaw but it is a wonderful tribute to him because of the editor's last sentence:\\"At the front of the first volume of Music in London in 1932 Shaw inserted a brief note: ''There are people who will read about music and nothing else. To them dead prima donnas are more interesting than saints, and extinct tenors than mighty conquerors. They are presumably the only people who will dream of reading these three volumes. If my wisdom is to be of any use to them it must come to them in this form. And so I let it go to them for what it is worth.'' The disclaimer is reprinted here to complete the record. It is probably, however, the only time in his life that G.B.S. underrated himself.\\""},{"Title":"PROKNOT Outdoor Knots","review":"The compact size of this little knot book is perfect.

It'll be in my backpack next to the paracord for every outting."},{"Title":"PROKNOT Outdoor Knots","review":"In no way does this little card set replace books or experience, but for field use for common knots, (especially in a stressful situation) it's priceless. I've already needed it on so many occasions (work and around the yard), that I moved one of them from my BOB to my small EDC pouch. If you're anything like me, \\"kind of\\" knowing how to tie a specific knot can get you into more trouble than not having tied the darn thing in the first place! I had to secure some items for an typhoon and boy did this thing come in handy. *All* of my ropes and knots stayed tight unlike my usual post-storm assessment of finding them untied and strung out in the yard! Yes, you could probably make a set, but these are nicely printed on credit card like material (albeit a bit thinner) and are really legible and handy. If you have a BOB, this is a MUST have (especially for those you think you need 300' of 550 cord in your BOB).Four stars because I wish you could separate the cards for easier access."},{"Title":"PROKNOT Outdoor Knots","review":"We bought this just for fun for my son. We cut a long piece of rope and gave him these cards. Hes a little young, but he tries regularly. The rope and cards are usually on the dining table.

They're perfect for learning all the helpful knots and for hora of entertainment! :)"},{"Title":"PROKNOT Outdoor Knots","review":"It's been 50 years since Cub Scouts, and I've forgotten just about everything I knew about knots. Fortunately, I found this. It really doesn't make much sense to stock my supplies with plenty of 550 cord if I can't tie anything more complex than a granny knot. With this in my camping kit or GO BAG, I believe I can tie just about anything. And the cards are made from a durable material and riveted together. I am very happy with this product."},{"Title":"PROKNOT Outdoor Knots","review":"I am no outdoorsman. I was just looking for a quick guide on tying knots, and this pack was very helpful to me.

I am impressed with the quality of construction too, they don't feel flimsy."},{"Title":"PROKNOT Outdoor Knots","review":"Hard to add anything to the discussion, as it has all been said. This was a good purchase. I will make one comment I didn't see elswhere: the brass rivet that holds the cards together has a big enough opening to thread a piece of 550 through as a lanyard or threaded onto the hank of rope in a pack."},{"Title":"PROKNOT Outdoor Knots","review":"I like this knot card set simply because I find it fun and useful to learn a variety of basic knots to use around camp. This is great for bushcraft knowledge, and the ability to tie a good knot to a variety of situations can save your gear, or your life! It gives simple, clear, concise, easy to read instructions for every knot. The diagrams are great for showing you how to tie the knot in conjunction with the instructions. This set is fool proof.

It comes with six double sided waterproof cards that are attached by a rivet to hold them together. On each card is the name of the knot, a brief description, and a diagram. The version that I have includes the following 15 knots:1. Bowline2. Tautline Hitch3. Square Knot4. Water Knot5. Buntline Hitch6. Rolling Hitch7. Clove Hitch8. Constrictor Knot9. Sheet Bend10. Doubled Sheetbend11. Double Fisherman's12. Trucker's Hitch13. Figure Eight14. Mooring Hitch15. Bowline on a BightIf you are new to knots and want to learn the basics then Pro-Knot is a good starting point. Carrying these cards along with some paracord allows you to practice anywhere to improve your knot skills. If you learn the majority of knots listed on these cards you will be well ahead of most people with your knowledge of knots. If you really get into knots there are tons of books and resources available to advance your skills even further. If you have difficulty understanding the diagram you can go to YouTube and usually find a video showing how to tie the knot. Also, the Pro-Knot website has video and instructions on how to tie most of these knots. Once you get the idea you can then use these cards as a reminder if needed.If you go camping, backpacking, or hiking you should always have rope and a set of these cards with you during your adventures. They also make a great addition to any everyday carry (EDC) bag or bug out bag (BOB) that you may have for an emergency. Knowing which knot to use for a particular situation is a great asset to have in your tool kit. Having this knowledge can make your adventure easier and safer by using the correct knot.I highly recommend Pro-Knot: Best Rope Knots as a valuable piece of gear to have in your kit."},{"Title":"PROKNOT Outdoor Knots","review":"Knots for any situation, depicted with easy to follow diagrams.

Very useful."},{"Title":"PROKNOT Outdoor Knots","review":"I've been carrying this around with two 24\\" lengths of paracord to practice/learn knots in my free time. It's been perfect for that. The only thing someone could complain about is the choices of knots and that their favorite knot isn't included. Since these cards got me interested in knots, I've learned several that aren't in these cards and probably would have made different choices for what to include. Specifically, these cards don't include any instructions lashings, and could have done without the half-page used for the rolling hitch with the 3 other hitches included.That's just nit-picking though.

The process North offers can be done effectively to achieve success in grand business collaboration, to create positive intended outcomes vis a vis a full spectrum of short-term personal goals, or to discover a creative path that will deliver on an individual's life purpose.The Smart Spot is an experiential read, in that it carves out a clear path for consciously claiming and directing enormous freedom to yield desired outcomes with integrity. Stories from North's professional consulting practice spice the information liberally with real-life examples of how the process generates intended results. The implementation exercises, in combination, could be summed up as an indispensable manual for harnessing and focusing energy to hit the bulls-eye every time. Readers will recognize and trust the solid logic that emerges as they test out this fluid magic.Deceptively simple and highly accessible, this book will be exciting and encouraging to anyone bent on realizing their dreams and having a good time doing it. The practical applications are unlimited because the method can be taken, layer by layer, to greater depths. This is a joyful book, destined to delight the hard-boiled pragmatist and the self identified &quot;mystically attuned&quot; with the same human punch and universal force."},{"Title":"The Smart Spot: 4 Steps to Setting Intentions and Using Intuition to Achieve Success","review":"The Smart Spot is an easily read book, written in simple language with simple instructions. The book is written with a friendly, enthusiastic tone. What The Smart Spot does best is to straddle both the business world and \\"New Age\\" type thinking which stresses the unseen but powerful energy of the individual and what it can accomplish, if only certain mental exercises are followed.Skeptics may be won over by the success stories recounted in anecdotes. Business leaders report that they access an intuition from within themselves to make important decisions. The author dissects this process and makes it available to all, through a step by step process. Helpful details to the four step process are given, including using the color gold in visualizations, because of its particular \\"energy.\\"The Smart Spot stresses collaboration, not ruthless competition as a basis for success. The book emphasizes the best result for all concerned, as a refreshing change from those books which promote business strategies designed to conquer the competition. I think this would be a helpful book for a person in a decision-making capacity who is looking for a guide to help with important choices."},{"Title":"The Smart Spot: 4 Steps to Setting Intentions and Using Intuition to Achieve Success","review":"The Smart Spot sets forth a clear and simple process for using intention to manifest the things one wants in one's life.
