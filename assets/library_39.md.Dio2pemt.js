This book is more ambitious in that it integrates his source material into a coherent thesis: that words are powerful ways in which we can hurt each other if we are not careful. One of his most useful insights is in illustrating how even true information can be used as a weapon. On a macro level, his advice would be welcome in the public arena. On a micro level, this book should be read by every parent and every lover and friend. Sticks and stones can break your bones, and words can sting for years if we don't use them wisely."},{"Title":"Words That Hurt, Words That Heal: How to Choose Words Wisely and Well","review":"First and foremost, thank you for writing this book, Rabbi Telushkin. Buy this book, folks.When you've read it, buy a copy for a friend or loved one. Then reread this book. Underline and mark passages liberally.Absorb the contents and make them your own. Do your best to put into daily practice whatthis book advocates. Tell a friend about this book. Tell a loved one. Tell a stranger.I love this book. Rabbi Telushkin does a great job in not only making this book highly informative, but alsofunny and very entertaining. I must say that I treated this book much like a textbook, at times. You'll find underlined andhighlighted passages throughout, check marks here and there, and a myriad of other notations marking important passagesand information that I want to have handy at a moment's notice. But more than a textbook, the book is peppered withwonderful stories that buttress important moral and ethical concepts. What a wonderful touch that simply makes the bookan absolutely irresistible read.Have you ever been the subject of gossip? Have you ever gossiped about someone else? If so, you need to read this book. Thisbook addresses the destruction that follows not only gossip, but other negative speech patterns, as well. Itgives practical tips on how to criticize and accept rebuke, how to control one's rage and anger, how to fight fair, thedangers of humiliating others in public, how parents and children should interact, lying, how we can incorporate words thatheal and ethical speech into our daily life, etc. and so forth and so on. It's truly an amazing book that has the capacityto change lives.I've hurt so many people with my words in the course of my life. I've helped to destroy the world with my callousnessand shortsightedness. But books like Rabbi Telushkin's helps to articulate common sense, which is so often commonlyignored by so many (including myself). I learned a great deal from this book, and it will now have a permanent placeupon my bookshelf and within my conscience. If the world could internalize the concepts within the pages of this book,we'd have taken a very large step towards making the world a better place for future generations. Jewish traditionhas much to say on this topic. For everyone's sake, let's please listen."},{"Title":"Words That Hurt, Words That Heal: How to Choose Words Wisely and Well","review":"The best book around on this subject. Intelligently written without being scholarly and academic. Get copies for yourself and all of your friends. The Bible and Jewish tradition have much to say about speech and that muscle in our mouths that causes so much trouble. Applying the wisdom in this book can change one's life. Be quick to listen, slow to speak. Heed the words of Proverbs and James 3:5-6. Speak like you want others to speak to you. Speak words that build up--not those that tear down."},{"Title":"Words That Hurt, Words That Heal: How to Choose Words Wisely and Well","review":"Rabbi Joseph Telushkin has written a healing,and spiritually moving book,of profound wisdom,sensitivity,compassion,that offers more psychological insights,than any Freudian Psychotherapists might unearth from their &quot;bag of tricks&quot;!

I wished that I had read a book like it many years ago."},{"Title":"Words That Hurt, Words That Heal: How to Choose Words Wisely and Well","review":"Very few of us think before we speak, and Rabbi Telushkin limns the consequences in this compelling volume. The old adage about sticks and stones aside, words DO hurt. They may not make us bleed physically, but their damage is real and can be lasting.Unfortunately, we live in a society that values winning above all else. Political candidates smear each other on the campaign trail, the rich and famous publish tell-all biographies to get back at family and ex-lovers, and when we feel like we're losing an argument, we cripple our opponents by criticizing them, not the behaviour that offended us. (\\"You're a liar\\" vs. \\"I don't think you're telling the truth.\\") The end result can be a ruptured family, traumatized child, or destroyed reputation, not to mention the erosion of one's own status as an ethical being.Being a rabbi, Telushkin liberally underscores his points with Jewish-themed anecdotes and rabbinical commentary, but the lessons imparted are invaluable to people of all colors and creeds. I've been guilty of a lot of the behaviours that he cautions us against, and this book has inspired me to try being a better person.Words have the power to make or break our personal and professional relationships. \\"Words That Hurt, Words That Heal\\" is a wakeup call that warns us to use the gift of speech wisely and benignly."},{"Title":"Words That Hurt, Words That Heal: How to Choose Words Wisely and Well","review":"The book reminded me of the importance and power of my words.

This is an absolute must read not just for those of the us who are Jewish; but for anyone who struggles with the truth or is incapable of telling it. I have given this particular book many, many times. Only recently I thought of a business arrangement involving a particular couple who would benefit from this book. I have ordered this book for them and hope this reading sets them free."},{"Title":"Words That Hurt, Words That Heal: How to Choose Words Wisely and Well","review":"I truly believe if everyone would read this book, the world would be a better place.

It not only looked at what the rabbis taught, but why they taught it. The author gave examples of people whose lives were ruined or built up by words. This powerfully underscored the point being made.The book discussed how words are powerful, how we speak about others (gossip, true but harmful comments, etc.) and how we speak to others (anger, fear, criticism, accepting rebukes, etc.) can effect relationships and lives, how words can heal, and how to apply what we've learned.I thought this book was very thought-provoking and that the author had a good grasp of human nature--why we gossip, etc., and that people aren't going to be able to change habits overnight. I'd highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Words That Hurt, Words That Heal: How to Choose Words Wisely and Well","review":"Rav Telushkin seems to have an innate sense of issues within the Jewish community that need discussion and this book is just another example of that.

It's an easy-to-see type, and written at a level that even a grade-schooler could understand.2. CONTENT: Of course, even though this is an easy read, that does not mean that there isn't anything to this book. Inside you will find page after page of sound advice for the greyhound adopter.

I didn't learn anything new--and I am certainly no expert on greyhounds. I was disappointed in the content of this book."},{"Title":"Adopting the Racing Greyhound","review":"This book has good information on racing greyhounds, but most of it is general dog care and training. I would like it if the potential problems with adopting a racing greyhound were laid out more clearly, especially the possibility of danger to small dogs and cats. The rescue people do a good job of trying to evaluate dogs for this problem, but they simply can't offer a guarantee. Greyhounds are very sweet and generally easy keepers, but they do suffer from improper early socialization. Clearly the book wants to encourage adoption, but as with any adoption, people need to know there can be problems."},{"Title":"Adopting the Racing Greyhound","review":"Excellent and informative.However, the 'as new' copy of the book I received was written in and the text was highlighted in several places."},{"Title":"Adopting the Racing Greyhound","review":"Wonderful Advice and Great Information!

Interwoven with all the factual material in this book is the sense that Cynthia Branigan loves these animals with a passion.

I don't think filling the book with horror stories of greyhounds being abused would have improved the book. I adopted a greyhound after reading this book cover to cover, mainly because a greyhound is the type dog I wanted...not just to rescue a dog.

Note: the newest edition is several years old, but the only part that is out of date pertains to medical care (e.g. flea and tick prevention & treatment) - that section still provides a good foundation and you can find more timely information on greyhound adoption websites or from your rescue center."},{"Title":"Adopting the Racing Greyhound","review":"This book was recommended by the adoption agency I got my greyhound through, and I'm glad I picked it up. It's a great start to learning about the special needs of these dogs.Racing greyhounds have a different lifestyle than most dogs we're used to, so they have a few special needs. Don't let that turn you off. They make awesome pets.After reading this book, I kind of felt alarmed. \\"I'm going to have to teach a dog to walk up stairs?!\\" However, with Branigan and the adoption agency's help, it's no big deal. These guys adapt really easily as a rule and I now have, probably, the sweetest, most patient and well behaved dog I've ever met.

For a book that was already the best one on the subject, it is now even better! I especially appreciated the updated, in-depth, veterinary information. I have a medical background and Branigan's explanations of various veterinary disorders is absolutely accurate. What's more, she dispels the rampant mis-information circulating about Greyhounds having underactive thyroids. I hope that nonsense is now put to rest once and for all! Mainly, though, what shines through each page is her dedication to the breed and her first-hand knowledge of adoptions--both as an adopter herself and as the head of an adoption agency. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Adopting the Racing Greyhound","review":"Though I don't own this book, I've read it cover to cover and it is wonderful.

Though many people don't, I appreciate the background on the breed along with the short and insightful history lesson Branigan provides. This breed's past helps to clarify its present situation and needs.For first time adopters, the insightful advice given in &quot;Adopting...&quot; has been extremely helpful, and we've found that every Grey owner with whom we've spoken since only reinforces and concurs with Branigan's philosophy on these spectacular dogs.Bottom line, I would heartily recommend this book to absolutely anyone who is - like my wife and me - considering Greyhound adoption. This book's simultaneously broad and detailed look at doing so will make the process extremely enjoyable! Well done, Branigan!"},{"Title":"Adopting the Racing Greyhound","review":"This book is a must read for all potential adopters!

Branigan does an excellent job of taking you through the post-adoption process, including all of the hazards one may encounter if not prepared - - stairs, supplies, and sensitivity to certain medicines. Although there is a lot of information available on the net (that I also read), I would strongly suggest reading this book as Branigan compiles everything you need in one concise book.

I am not a greyhound owner (yet) but certainly this book gave me a lot of useful information that will be handy when the time comes to adopt! I like the author's discussion about cooking for dogs, medical information and questions to see if you are actually informed and prepared to adopt. The only shortcoming (and reason for four stars) was the author's &quot;glossing over&quot; of the racing industry. She gives a rather sanitized view of what is primarily a money making machine at the expense of these beautiful animals. While reading the chapter on &quot;The Racing Life&quot; I couldn't help thinking something was very fishy below the surface. I partially agree with the person below who stated that perhaps the author didn't want to offend anyone. She did in a later chapter admit that the animals &quot;don't always get the best of care&quot; but I think that's a bit of an understatement. Greyhound racing should be abolished entirely. I fear that because of all the rescue efforts, most people who go to the races assume that &quot;oh well, I don't feel bad for these dogs, because when they retire they'll all go to good homes.&quot; The sad truth is, many, many DO NOT end up in good homes. People need to be educated about this. I hope this book continues to inspire people to adopt these loving, gentle creatures, and I truly hope that someday this evil industry will be done away with so that this won't be an issue at all. Unfortunately, I doubt that this will happen anytime soon."},{"Title":"Adopting the Racing Greyhound","review":"I am a first time Greyhound adopter and I'm so glad this is one of the books that was a pre-adoption requirement.

This book is probably the best of them. It is inclusive and informative on virtually all topics of general interest to Greyhound owners, and is a good starting place for more specialized Greyhound-related topics. (In addition, any adoption group will be more inclined to regard you favorably if you've already read this book!)Adopting the Racing Greyhound covers everything from track life to pet health. With this book in your hand and your mind, you can avoid some of the pitfalls of Greyhound ownership, and locate and develop the best relationship possible with your very own needlenose. There's simply no other resource available in any format that can provide such a good overview of Greyhounds in pet life.This will not be the only book you'll need once you have your hound. (You may want to purchase, for example, Care of the Racing Greyhound by Blythe for medical topics, and Playtraining Your Dog by Burnham for training topics.)

END"},{"Title":"Adopting the Racing Greyhound","review":"This is, by far, the best book on greyhound adoption that I have read. Cynthia Branigan does an excellent job of translating her 10+ years of greyhound adoption experience into a manual that is clear, concise and very easy to read. She takes you through the adoption and adjustment process practically step-by-step, from choosing the right dog to helping both you and your new pet adjust to life away from the track. I especially appreciated the information concerning insecticides and anesthesia - I don't believe my veterinarian expected me to have as many questions on the subject as I did! I don't believe that Cynthia glosses over the racing industry or the abuses these wonderful dogs often face, as the purpose of this book is not an expose on the horrors of greyhound racing. (As anyone who is involved in greyhound adoption will tell you, you will learn about all of that soon enough the minute you take an interest in these dogs.) What this book WILL provide is the best information you will find on how to welcome these &quot;greyt&quot; dogs into your life. As a volunteer with Make Peace With Animals and the owner of three greyhounds, I highly recommend this book to anyone who currently owns or has considered adopting an ex-racer."},{"Title":"Adopting the Racing Greyhound","review":"Several years ago my partner and I were looking for a large sized dog to keep in an apartment. After quite a bit of research we learned about racing greyhounds. We ended up acquiring two of them. Then we got a house and had three. The original two got old and passed away and we now own our fourth and fifth. Greyhounds can be kind of addicting.I've read pretty much every book ever written on Greyhounds and one time or another, and have searched the web extensively. When greyhound adoption first became popular Branigan's book was the only published reliable source. Since then other good books have been written, but I still think anyone interested in greyhounds should start here.The book provides good advice on dealing with the greyhound when you first get it home and get it accustomed to living in a house. However, I'm not a big fan of crating my dogs. In our home we have actually made the dogs their own area where we sometimes confine them, although it is more of an in-house kennel complete with couch dog beds and doggy door (and windows for squirrel watching). They do actually like having some degree of confinement, and Branigan is correct in suggesting that the dog needs time to adjust and a degree of confinement. After all, they lived in a crate until they came to the house.She also provides, as others have noted, quite a bit of good medical information. Not only is the thyroid information important, but I have spoken with every vet about the greyhound's sensitivity to anesthesia.Every greyhound owner, or anyone thinking about owning a greyhound, should read this book."},{"Title":"Adopting the Racing Greyhound","review":"Adopting the Racing Geyhound has given the most comprehensive and complete(as well as compassionate)guide to determining whether a racing greyhound is right for you or you for them!

They told me it wasn't necessary to even test him for an underactive thyroid--his shyness alone was proof of the disorder. Well, they gave me the thyroid supplements and I assumed they knew best. What a mistake! Within a week he was pacing and panting. Within two weeks he was agitated and becoming very aggressive.Thank God I happened across the book Adopting The Racing Greyhound. In it I read all about the myth that most Greyhounds have an underactive thyroid gland. I took my Greyhound to the vet right away and he, too, assured me that what the group recommended was very dangerous and could have lead to my dog having a heart attack. We did a proper thyroid test (it came back normal), and we weaned my dog off the supplements. I took him for some basic obedience training to get him socialized, and I am giving him more time, and more love, to get him over his shyness. Guess what? It is working!Thanks to Ms. Branigan's book, my Greyhound and I are really enjoying each other's company."},{"Title":"Adopting the Racing Greyhound","review":"Ms. Branigan's book offers a lot of wonderful informationfor anyone considering adopting an ex-racing greyhound.She explains many of the different scenarios you canexpect when you first bring your new dog home and offersadvice as to how to acclimate your greyhound to lifein a home.

Told by greyhounds at the track to their puppies and their puppies' puppies there was a secret place called \\"home\\" where everything was warm and soft and comfortable...I loved this book and am overjoyed to be bringing my greyhound to his final home soon in December, a home filled with light and space and love.

The book never uses the N word, but things like colored people which was the appropriate term in that era that was NOT derogatory.

Part of me wants to address the parents of the children this book seems to be directed to. And part of me wants to treat this book as a historical reference.To take the easier path first, let me talk about the American Boy's Handy Book's place in history. The book was written by Daniel Carter Beard. Carter was an artist, naturalist and early founder of the Boy Scouts of America. His love of the outdoors and empathy for youth is evident right from the start of the first chapter: he writes, \\"[I]t is a pleasant sensation to sit in the first spring sunshine and feel the steady pull of a good kite upon the string, and watch it's graceful movements as it sways from side to side, ever mounting higher and higher, as if impatient to free itself and soar away amid the clouds.\\"And it was his concern with the lack of structure and supervision of city kids that caused him write this book. His own childhood was in antebellum Ohio. When his life took him to the city of New York he despaired at seeing the news boys sleeping on the wet streets and he began writing all sorts of articles for children's magazines of the time.Eventually, he was urged to collect these pieces and to put them in a single volume. The American Boy's Handy Book is the result.Chapter Headings, under the major seasonal divisionsSpring1. Kite Time2. War Kites3. Novel Modes of Fishing4. Hand-Made Fishing Tackle5.

Home-Made masquerade and Theatrical CostumesYou might wonder why I list this chapters. I do it first because I have not found them given anywhere else. And you need to see, as Historians or History enthusiasts the scope of activities that are covered. Carter really provides, in my opinion, a look into both indoor and outdoor activities of the times. These are the activities that the boys and men going into Civil War would have known about. What they would have done to pass the evenings at home, and it gives a precursor of the basic field skills they might have had.Now, for the parents and adults that are considering this book for children. Let me say that this is not a 19th Century equivalent of \\"The Dangerous Book for Boys\\". This is a book written before there were Warning Labels and you will have to assess the readiness of your child to read the book.What I mean by this is that The \\"American Handy Book for Boys\\" is filled with activities, some of which should not be attempted by anyone under 12 years of age. While some projects like the costumes and \\"phunnygraph\\" and kites are more or less timeless and safe activities, there are others like making your own boomerang and outdoor oven, that require tools that most of us don't normally hand over to youngers.And there are other activities that ought not to ever be engaged in, even with adult supervision. Blowing up balloons using natural gas comes to mind. Similarly there are other activities that ought to only be engaged in under adult supervision, like dissecting a bird and stuffing it.There are other activities like making costumes and whirligig's that are harmless. But I would suggest this book for the mature, young adult. Perhaps someone interesting in the times of Huck Finn.I highly recommend this book for it's unique view of the past. It would make a great gift for someone like myself who is interested in the sociological side of history. Or the older child, like an Eagle Scout, who might want to experiment with making their own oven, boat, blow gun, camp bed, etc.Pam T~mom and reviewer at PageInHistory and BooksForKids-reviews"},{"Title":"The American Boys Handy Book: What to do and How to do it.","review":"I was given a first edition by my grandfather in 1973.

Even for a 20th century suburban kid, the book opened up a world of possibilities for projects and activities. It is hard to express how refreshing it was to find a perspective from a time when boys were assumed to have craft skills, initiative, and to be responsible for their own safety through common sense.Some of the projects I carried out were an aquarium of local fish, homemade boats, bows & arrows, blowguns, fish spears, ice-fishing gear, fire without matches, primitive camping, snow forts and homemade fireworks. The book is also a good guide to the habits of various animals.It is worth mentioning that the prose is excellent, with a higher vocabulary and more complex sentence structure than in childrens' books today.I have also browsed \\"The Dangerous Book for Boys\\" and the few projects it describes are watered-down, liability-conscious versions of the sort you find in this classic (though its non-project sections are interesting). If your kid is a tinkerer, go for the original and let him know that you expect him to be responsible with the knowledge therein -- my experience is that boys will be as serious as you expect them to be."},{"Title":"The American Boys Handy Book: What to do and How to do it.","review":"This is an extraordinary book - written before TV invaded our homes. Reading this book was a bit sad - the skills assumed of a 12 year old boy then are rare today; even among scouts and free range kids.As with the Dangerous Book for boys; it is not a book that you can hand to a child and expect them to be able to follow or remain interested in. Once they have completed a few projects and discovered the joy of doing something themselves even though it is difficult then they will most likely continue these types of activities.WARNING: if you do not trust your child with their own pocket knife you will probably not get the full benefit of this book!"},{"Title":"The American Boys Handy Book: What to do and How to do it.","review":"I read this book in 5th grade when I checked it out of our school library.

Reading it later as an adult I wish that I had given it more attention when I was a kid because it is a wonderful book. It has a place in every home, particularly homes with children(big and small alike) Another interesting point is the languauge of the book. Being that it was written well over 100 yrs ago the book has a bit of a different dialect. However it's pleasant to read. It's nice to see even a book on leisure topics written more formally and it's a shame more books aimed at children and parents aren't written this way.This book would be a great gift to any family looking to do something on a weekend other than watch TV.

The book was originally published in 1882 and is filled with black and white drawings. While I think it's wonderful to introduce young boys to the joys of the outdoors, they will have some difficulty with the language of the book. The chapter on Knots, Bends, and Hitches starts like this: \\"The art of tying knots is an almost necessary adjunct to not a few recreations. Especially is this true of summer sports, many of which are nautical, or in some manner connected with the water.\\" This book is more suited for older boys or nostalgic men.Daniel Beard was one of the founder's of Boy Scouts. He was born in 1850 and lived until 1941. He received the only Golden Eagle badge awarded by the Boy Scouts. He believed in allowing boys to create their own toys and he loved the outdoors. There is a mountain peak in Alaska named for him."},{"Title":"The American Boys Handy Book: What to do and How to do it.","review":"This book goes back to the eartly 1900's.

It was written in 1890 and it's totally outdated. As an interesting browse in the library or book store, maybe. The stuff it talks about is simply impractical for most kids.

We never hurt anyone, poked out an eye or did property damage from projects in the book. Yes there are some racial references that we may consider as politically unfortunate now.

Anyone who has children or enjoys \\"outdoorsy\\" and nature-related activities, whether you have kids or were ever a boy or not, should get this. Yes, it's outdated in many ways, but it is still very relevant in many others and the nostalgia aspect more than makes up for the irrelevancies. I would love to see an update of this book so that presently-accessible materials would be included, but I fear that updating it would require taking out, or modifying too much, some of the best parts of it because of modern ideas about safety and such. It's not that I want my kids to put broken glass or knife blades on the tails of their kites for kite wars, or feed a bullfrog a perch, but I think that taking that type of thing out would be a travesty. Anyway, I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys the outdoors and do-it-yourself type of books, especially if you have children, are a child at heart and/or enjoy nostalgia."},{"Title":"The American Boys Handy Book: What to do and How to do it.","review":"Some things simply never change. \\"The American Boy's Handy Book\\" is a guide for young boys who still find the time of playing outside highly appealing.

A wonderful guide to doing things yourself, and a welcome antidote to today's passive consumer paradigm of childhood. A fair number of the materials called for are hard if not impossible to find today, but the spirit of adaptation and improvisation that imbues this book will inspire the reader to find substitutes. Some parents may suspect the fair number of projectile- launching devices described, but the book is infinitely less violent than most child-oriented television shows and never fails to stress safety. My friends and I learned a lot of practical mechanics and crafting skills, developed our hand-eye coordination, and never shot anything more fragile than a plastic figure. We did a heck of a lot more damage to each other and our environment playing soccer and broomstick polo.

The emphasis is on building things yourself, and to that end it is an extremely valuable handbook for our increasingly passive society. There are definitely things here that will give you pause or that are culturally dated -- like making a blow gun, trapping and raising wild animals and taxidermy at home -- but that is where parenting comes in, and all-in-all I would say this is a valuable and exciting book for kids, filled with pragmatic insights and a fun historical document as well.

What followed was the most heinous of crimes committed by two 10 year old boys whose actions shocked the entire world with their brutality. Mark Thomas, a reporter for Britain's Press Association, followed the story up to the sentencing and punishment of the young criminals. This book, whilst not going into graphic detail of the crime, attempts to analyse not only the reasoning behind this crime but also the degeneration of youth and what future generations may NOT look forward to in terms of public safety.While Ralph and Denise Bulger still work through the grief of losing their son, society has to wonder if this type of juvenile recklessness might become a growing trend. 'Every Mother's Nightmare' touches on the reasons for this - broken homes, lack of parental discipline, lack of positive role models, lack of moral fiber in both homes and schools, and of course, a severe lack of positive education. Still, the question remains, did these two pre-pubescents do what they did out of some inability to distinguish right from wrong or were they really just products of their environment? Despite being tried in Bootle's South Sefton Magistrate's Court and showing no remorse for their actions, other than distress over their capture, did they ever understand the ramifications of their actions or how this crime affected everyone involved?The reader discovers that not only were they not concerned about future consequences but that their actions were carefully pre-meditated and that, when questioned, neither was willing to admit guilt but rather place the blame upon the other. The reader also has to make their own judgements in this case as Thomas, true to journalistic integrity, maintains straight facts without taking sides - something to be commended when writing about such a despicable crime.As previously mentioned, this book does not go into the gruesome details of the death of little James Bulger but is still shocking enough to move even the most ardent fan of true crime (such as myself). But don't read it for shock value - read it as a stunning expose of the collapse of morality and the loss of innocence."},{"Title":"blackbeard's ghost","review":"From the back cover: \\"Aum, Aum, Aum... Mananan verbum fohat... kali yug! Oh, come to us, ghost of Blackbeard, the greatest pirate that ever lived!\\"J.D. chanted the magic spell... and behind him appeared a huge figure wreathed in smoke, with wet strands of seaweed hanging from his shoulders. Aldetha Stowecraft's spell had worked! J.D. had conjured up Blackbeard's ghost!======================================The story opens up with a couple of chapters set in the early 1700's which detail the exploits of Blackbeard and the way in which he met his untimely end. After that the scene changes to the present day (well, the present day circa 1965) when best friends J.D. and Hank are exploring the ruin of Blackbeard's tavern (slated for demolition), where they find a mysterious parchment hidden in a wall. And then all heck breaks loose....This is a pleasant little diversion, a fun light ghost story. While Blackbeard the pirate was a rather terrible person in life, readers cannot help but feel sympathetic towards---or even fond of--- his ghost. And I greatly appreciated the subtext of historical architectural preservation.This was made into a Disney film in 1968, which I've surely seen though I've forgotten all the details. But from reading the summary over on IMDB, it would appear that the plot of the film differs substantially from the original text."},{"Title":"blackbeard's ghost","review":"A great book for young readers, and those who like to to read to youngsters or read young reader's books , too."},{"Title":"blackbeard's ghost","review":"For those who loved the Disney movie of the same name starring Peter Ustinov, you're in for a bit of a surprise; the story line, while similar in overall effect is quite different, but wonderfully so. Having been a fan of the movie since childhood, I couldn't wait to read the book (once I finally found and bought a copy on Amazon.com from a used seller). The book is a delightful read from start to finish (it's a real page-turner, so it won't take you long) and probably appropriate for 10 and older (I'm well over the target age and still enjoying it thoroughly!), and would be fun for the whole family to read out-loud. I would also recommend its sequel which I'm currently reading - Ben Stahl's \\"The Secret of Red Skull\\". Buy yourself a copy of this today and enjoy it for years to come."},{"Title":"blackbeard's ghost","review":"An enjoyable and easy read.

Only more so."},{"Title":"Global Sex Workers: Rights, Resistance, and Redefinition","review":"Global Sex Workers is a series of pieces by a variety of authors on sex worker issues around the globe. The term &quot;sex workers&quot; has been used deliberately by the editors and contributors, as it emphaises the work in sex work and to some extent avoids the stigmatization associated with the term &quot;prostitute&quot;. The editors and contributors' perspective on sex work is radical in its opposition to traditional ways of approaching the question. Rather than advocating abolition of prostitution because prostitution always violates women's rights, the contributors take a more nuanced approach, acknowledging that some sex work takes place in conditions of oppression and indeed slavery, but that much does not. Furthermore, crimialization of sex workers, their clients and those associated with sex work (eg pimps and madams) hamrs the women involved in sex work, although such laws are often said to be for the benefit of sex workers.The book exmines a variety of issues in the area of sex work - theoretical approaches to sex work; migration of women for sex work; sex tourism; sex workers' organizations; and issues of AIDS prevention and sex workers' empowerment. The chief virtues of the book are twofold: first, its global perspective is refreshing, in a debate that has so often centered on the experiences of sex workers in the west; and second, the focus on sex workers' organizations themselves. Much that is written about prostitution ignores the voices of women involved in sex work, and it is good to see that trend being countered in this book.Countires discussed in the book include Japan, Cote d'Iviore, Cuba, the Caribbean countries, Thailand, Ecuador, South Africa, Mexico, India and Malaysia, to name some. The book will be of interest to anyone interested in sex work, though it is probably of most use to academics and activists."},{"Title":"Global Sex Workers: Rights, Resistance, and Redefinition","review":"if you want to learn a little about how prostitution is done in the world, what types of prostitutes are desirable in each part of the world, what conflicts and problems prostitutes faced whether cultural or international, and how prostitutes live, this is the book for you. i gained a lot of knowledge from this book, especially about prostitution in south america. highly recommended"},{"Title":"Global Sex Workers: Rights, Resistance, and Redefinition","review":"This book claims to want to show the 'nuance' of the sex trade, so therefore it must use complicated words such as 'debt bondage' to in fact describe what is an inhuman situation where people are threatened with death and beaten and raped in order to be forced to sell thier bodies to pay off a non-existent death. Essay after essay encouraged prostitution as 'sex work' and claims that if only all prostitution were legal there would be no sex-slave trade in young girls and no forced prostitution. This is strange becuase in the Netherlands, where prostitution is legal, it turns out there is just as much sex-slavery and beatings and rape. This book also tries to claim all the talk against prostitution and the sex slave trade is 'racist'. But how it is racist when Thai girls are sent to 'work' in Japan and Russian girls sent to Saudi Arabia and Columbian girls to Spain is not clear. It is racist in the sense that rich Europeans, Arabs and Japanese are the buyers, but that is not what the authors wrote.As typical of anything that is examined by academia this text has to dry all things down so nothing is ever what it seems. A woman who is raped at the age of 11 by wealthy 'clients' and kept chained to a bed for five years until she gets AIDS, this is called 'western sensationalism' and in addition is described as 'sex work' and 'debt bondage'.It is too bad that none of the authors of any of the essays experienced sex work first hand as one of trafficked people.Seth J.

I was doing some research on Wilhelm Dilthey and found myself looking at several thousands of books devoted to the history of philosophy. At that moment I began to have some idea on how difficult it is to acquire a magisterial overview of any field of inquiry. It takes a lifetime of study and the mastery of several languages to develop have such an overview. And sadly, that knowledge sometimes gets pored into a book that relatively few people ever read.This book by Georg Iggers represents that level of learning. Iggers specializes in German intellectual history but has read deeply in the historical work done in Italy, France, England and the U.S. of A. as well.What he is trying to do in the brief book (147 pages of text, 23 pages of footnotes) is to give an overview of the most influential approaches to history of the last century. His work is divided three main parts. The first section covers the latter part of the 19th century and the early 20th. This period is dominated by the influence of Ranke and his ideas. Iggers also discusses the influence of Weber, Troeltsch, Meinecke, Karl Lambrecht, Parrington, Beard, Becker and many others that were involved in these early disputes. Obviously, Iggers can only cover a few of these people in any sort of depth but he seems to have a gift for summarizing the main point of a debate in a few lines.One note of caution: with any such survey, I cannot help but wonder how accurately the author is expressing the views of those s/he is writing about. Iggers interprets Dilthey in a way that I disagree with but which is common enough. This is the only time in this book that I found myself disagreeing with his presentation except for that on Hayden White. More on that later.The second part of the book covers the period just before and after WW II when the other social sciences began to make their influence felt in way history was practiced. Iggers talks at length about the body of work surrounding the journal, Annals . He also covers the work of the Historical Social Science school in Germany (Hans Wehler, Eckert Kehr, and Jurgen Kocka among others) as well as Marxist historiography from that period (people like Maurice Godelier in France, E.P. Thompsom and Christopher Hill in England).This second part of the book was the most informative for me. I was ignorant of many of the Germans and obviously haven't paid enough attention to the work of Braudel. Iggers is great for orienting yourself to explore some of these schools of history.The last section is on the postmodern critique of history, the development of schools of microhistory, and the rise of schools of history focusing on women or ethnicities that are outside the grand narrative of Western History.I found the most interesting subsection to be that on the Italian school of microhistory. Carlo Ginzberg is probably the best known proponent to those of us who can only read English. Proponents of this school feel that large scale theories about history do not represent accurately the life experience of the actual actors of history. Their focus is on a much smaller scale- the semiotics of a village during the lifetime of one person.And now for Hayden White. I have never been able to read Metahistory. That may be more of a reflection on my inadequacies as a reader rather than White's as a writer. Iggers summarizes White's argument as something along the lines of all historical writing must use the same rhetorical devices of emplotment as does fiction therefore it has no more truth value than fiction. If this is really what White's argument amounts to, it borders on the absurd. I find myself wanting to give White another try just to confirm my suspicion that this does not really represent his argument adequately.This is a bit of a quibble however in regards to this excellent volume by Iggers. This survey could profitably be read by most sophomores or juniors majoring in history or philosophy in college. The writing is clear, the scholarship is daunting (especially in regards to the German historians) and the presentation is pithier than my review (sigh). Iggers may be a little unfair to some of those he discusses but he does his job as well as it can be done, I suspect. It really is up to the reader to go from there.As for myself, even though I have read in the philosophy of history off and one for over twenty five years, I still learned quite a bit. If nothing else, I was reminded about just how little I really know"},{"Title":"Historiography in the Twentieth Century: From Scientific Objectivity to the Postmodern Challenge","review":"Excellent overview of 20th century historiography, and particularly impressive in its dealings with German and Eastern European works.

Flipping through this book one will probably become intimidated by sheer volume of \\"difficult math\\".

If you have a good instructor, he or she will probably be able to simplify things for you, otherwise the book will teach you nothing. Many of the problems/examples, however, seem to be simple enough and can be solved using simple equations, so one wonders why the text goes in to so much detail using esoteric mathematics.

In this format however, they take on an added dimension and explaination of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia and its commander, Robert E Lee.Gallagher begins by examining Lee's Maryland campaign, Fredericksburg, Gettysburg and the army's campaigns in 1864. His conclusions on the Battle of Gettysburg and its effects on the Confederate home front are particularly interesting. He concludes that the battle was not the overwhelming defeat to the Army of Northern Virginia and the Confederate home front that it would later be portayed as by historians. He makes the argument that the loss of Vicksburg was seen as a vastly bigger loss and Gettysburg was more seen as a small defeat or even a victory because of Meade's failure to chase the Confederates in retreat.Gallagher also includes an interesting essay evaluating the claims of some historians that Lee was not fighting a modern war with modern tactics and if he had done so, the Confederacy would have been better off. He ably demonstrates that indeed Lee did understand the difference in technology such as the minie ball and its impact on strategy and tactics.However, the best essay is Gallagher's essay on the Lost Cause &quot;myth&quot;. Gallagher explains that many of the claims that were later associated only with Lost Cause historians such as Jubal Early or Douglass Southall Freeman, were actually developed during the war and immediately following the war prior to any claims made by Early and others. Thus some of the &quot;myths&quot; such as the overwhelming numerical superiority of the Union as part of the central cause of the Confederacy's defeat, is actually true. He draws the wonderful and correct conclusion that to dismiss the Lost Cause myths in their entirety does a major disservice to the historical profession and that discussing those Lost Cause claims that do have a basis in fact is not in fact giving any legitimacy to any neo-Confederate point of view concerning the centrality of slavery to the origin of the Civil War.The one quibble, and the reason I gave this book four stars instead of five concerns Gallagher's essay &quot;Fighting the Battles of Second Fredericksburg and Salem Church.&quot; I really couldn't find a point as to why this essay was included in the book, unless it was to demonstrate a hard and fast friendship link between Early and Lee that Gallagher does build upon in his essay on the Lost Cause. However, I still think the essay about Fredericksburg really doesn't belong in this format."},{"Title":"Lee and His Army in Confederate History (Civil War America)","review":"With the skill of a surgeon, Gary W. Gallagher dissects the myths and legends surrounding Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia, past and current, to reveal a fascinating new look at the \\"marble man\\". Positioning himself squarely between the Lost Cause proponents and the current pack of revisionists, Gallagher relies on primary sources (newspapers, diaries and letters of civilians and soldiers, official correspondence) and careful, well-reasoned analysis to discover the real truth surrounding Robert E. Lee, and in the process lands an effective blow worthy of the general himself upon both sides. Gallagher's claims that Robert E. Lee was indeed an able proponent of modern warfare (though I would dispute the term modern) and also a capable administrator fully capable of being as strict or lenient with his subordinates as the case required breathes new life into the continuing quest to discover this fascinating man and effectively destroys the myths held by both sides (ironically enough, both sides often seem to wind up arguing both sides of the same coin) that Lee was first of all a member of the landed Virginia gentry far too short-sighted and stuck in the past for command of the Confederacy's main eastern army as well as being far too gentlemanly to deal strictly with subordinates. In fact, Gallagher presents Lee, through his own words and letters, as a man fully aware of the forces arrayed against him and as one who from the beginning knew full well that the Confederacy needed to marshall all of its resources in order to win the war and gain independence and that tough decisions and hard sacrifices would be required, and that a strong government would be required to take charge in order to ensure this was done and coordinate everyone's effort. Also, the idea that Lee \\"bled\\" his army to death (the fact that Lee's army at the beginning of the 1864 Overland Campaign was basically the same size as it ever was seems to have escaped the notice of many) also comes across as rather weak thanks to Gallagher's fine research. The weakest argument Gallagher refutes is that Lee's myth was wholly created after the war, and he does this by proving most emphatically that Lee and his army were indeed the primary source Confederates looked to for hope as well as the national symbol of the Confederacy (much like Washington's Continentals) worldwide. The fact that the main part of Grant's thrust against the South hit here against Lee proves this as well. However, do not mistake Gallagher as a Lost Cause proponent in disguise; though he defends the points Lost Cause proponents make that are actually rooted in fact, he spares them not his swift, sharp sword in pointing out the concerted effort to preserve and protect the memory of the Confederate armies, and Lee in particular, by shaping history through their own eyes. Also, he cuts like a knife through as many of their arguments as those of the revisionists, who, in their zeal to cut through the myth of the Lost Cause (and rightfully so, since we must be as objective as possible) often go too far and wind up rejecting legitimate conclusions and research in favor of their own modern myth. In conclusion, Gallagher, the good professor has taught us all a valuable lesson; look not through the lens of your own eyes to view history, but search ever more diligently for the real facts and take nothing for granted. Though I'm sure we all carry our own biases (I fully admit my admiration for Lee, and I fail to see how anyone can remain truly and completely aloof), we can all separate ourselves, at least partially, from our opinions in order to get at the facts and reach reasonable conclusions, as Gallagher has so beautifully done. Good job, Professor Gallagher."},{"Title":"Then Comes Marriage","review":"A Little Personal History to Begin, or, Why Is a Middle-Aged Male Reviewing Rgency Romances?When i was twenty (which was rather more than half my life ago) and stationed at the Naval Shipyard at Norfolk, i read an article in a science-fiction fanzine about Georgette Heyer, a british author of romances. The article included a rather fractured but hilarious plot-summary of a book entitled \\"Sylvester, or, the Wicked Uncle.\\" I, being bored, checked the Navy Exchange's book racks and discovered a Hayer book entitled \\"The Talisman Ring\\", read it, and was hooked. ((It was some years later before i found a copy of \\"Sylvester\\", which proved to be even more gloriously silly and complex in plot than the article i had read had implied...))Anyway, having read every Regency or Georgian romance and all of the historical novels the late Ms Heyer published (her mysteries are a different and, i'm afraind, unfathomable, thing entirely), i came to the conclusion that she basically wrote two types of story: Romps and Sweets, as i called them.Sweets were iminently readable, consisting primarily of relatively lowkey action and devastatingly-drawn observations of society and drawing room wit/comedy of manners writing.Romps had the comedy of manner, but usually also featured wilder elements, such as gender swaps between brother and sister in order to hide in plain sight, military officers taking over the opeation of a country tollgate on a whim to discover where the missing gatekeeper is, abductions of various sorts for various purposes, smuggling and various other nafarious activities, a young woman married to a man she'd never seen till fifteen minutes before and thenm widowed less than an hour afterward, and murders, duels and fisticuffs of various and sundry sorts. And love stories.So what, you ask, does that have to do with a review of a Kasey Michaels novel? Just that this is a Regency Romp that is *almost* as good as one of Heyer's.And *almost* as good as Georgette Heyer is readable indeed.There are, in fact, familiar elements of Heyeresque plot scattered througout this book -- and at least one neat little bit of dialog that my wife and i are both sure is a tongue-in-cheek reference to Heyer's \\"These Old Shades\\", possibly the best of her romps.Brady James, a typical Heyeresque heroic non-pareil, is attacked and thrown, weighted, into the Thames to drown, barely escaping with his life.Arranging with friends to fake his own funeral, he retreats to his country house to recuperate and to plot the discovery and punishment of whoever tried to do him in.He suspects that the attack may have something to do with his enquiries into the background of a Miss Regina Bliss, a young lady apparently incapable of telling the truth when an outrageous lie will do better who was rescued from the streets by friends of his in a previous book.As he recuperates, he and Miss Bliss work out a scheme in which he will be his own foppish distant cousin, newly returned from France with his inheritance of Brady's title and estates and she will be his ward. Together, they will discover his own attackers; and Miss Bliss, who has an agenda of her own, will also look for revenge on old enemies of her own whom Brady knows nothing of.And, as anyone can predict, though the path of True Love will hardly run smooth, it will happen.Lots of fun, well worth the attention of anyone who likes Heyer and has run out of her books."},{"Title":"Then Comes Marriage","review":"Kasey Michaels has a witty style that almost manages to win over the reader. I say almost because, unfortunately, her sense of humor does not make up for the lack of character development and slow pace that characterizes Then Comes Marriage.Brady James, the Earl of Singleton, is attacked on the streets of Regency London, beaten, wrapped in chains and cast into the Thames. But Brady lives and spends the rest of the novel closing in on his would-be killers. By his side is penniless actress Regina Bliss, whose parents apparently died at the hands of Brady's assailants. With romantic sparks flying, Brady and Regina team up, along with Regina's traveling player friends, to expose the villains. To amusing effect, Brady impersonates his fictitious cousin Gawain Caradoc, an effeminate dandy whose ridiculous clothing and wimpy manner soon becomes a joke that's beaten to death.It's hard to stay interested in the story because Brady and Regina are given almost no inner life until very late and then not enough. The plot drags slowly on, and then the reader is never given a credible reason why the villains tried to kill Brady; he'd uncovered nothing when asking questions about Regina's past (the motive or rather pretext for his attack).Then Comes Marriage shows that even fairly entertaining banter cannot save a story whose characters and plot never achieve a feeling of reality."},{"Title":"Then Comes Marriage","review":"Feeling pity when Viscount Willoughby Rutland and his wife Abby saw the innocent looking Regina Bliss begging for spare change outside the theater, they hired her as a maid. When Earl Bradley James sees Regina working for the Rutlands, he asks her what brought her to such a crisis?Regina, an actress, relates her tale of woe, but Bradley does not believe her. He makes a few inquiries and draws the attention of the wrong people. Soon three aristocrats abduct Bradley and toss him into the Thames to die. He survives and devices an ingenious plan to flush out the culprits with Regina's assistance as she too has a score to settle with these thugs. As they work together to catch a killer, they fall in love, but a relationship will have to wait to see if they survive their endeavor.Adored by readers for her Regency romances, Kasey Michaels provides her audience with her best work to date in THEN COMES MARRIAGE. The relationship between the lead couple is hilarious due to their witty repartee that camouflages their true feelings for one another. Also amusing is the straight-laced Brady takes on the persona of Gawain Caradoc, a frivolous dandy so that he can move freely among the Ton. This is more than just a strong regency; this tale is an engaging historical romance that should be on everyone's short list.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Then Comes Marriage","review":"\\"Then Comes Marriage\\" actually starts with the previous book, when the hero, Brady, first meets the heroine, Regina Bliss. Miss Bliss is found acting as a destitute and disabled child trying to make some money on the streets who turns out to be a perfectly normal young woman. After she's adopted by Brady's friends, he gets curious about her background and goes digging for information. That catches us up to this book, where Brady's curiosity gets him dowsed in a river. Intent on finding who tried to kill him, he teams up with Regina to find out why people didn't want him asking questions about her.The book follows several common romance themes, especially how a good woman can redeem a bad boy (or just a selfish boy, really). Kasey Michaels reintroduces the readers to old characters from previous books while watching Regina learn to trust and Brady learn that marriage is good.The problems are many, however. Brady's character development is hurl-inducing, not to mention horribly stereotypical. This books spends pages and pages and pages talking about how single men are selfish brutes who can't get in touch with the feelings of themselves or others. Only married men can truly enjoy life! I find that insulting, and I'm a woman. Then there's the fact that Ms. Michaels can't hint at moods or feelings or anything, really. She has to smack you upside the head with it. The reason that Jane Austen and Georgette Heyer are so wonderful to read is because their wit is subtle - they actually trust the reader to figure out the joke. Michaels, however, does not and constantly has her characters spell out why the situation is supposed to be funny. Talk about a comedic killer. Add on a cast of side characters who are not nearly as funny as they're supposed to be, and this book is just boring.If you like your books chock full of sentiment, you might like this one. I had to fight to read it and really just skimmed the last 50 pages. If you enjoy a realistic view of the world in your romance books and comedy that isn't spelled out for you, skip this one."},{"Title":"Then Comes Marriage","review":"The comic relief best friend plus a minor female character from Someone to Love get their own book.

Allowing society to believe he'd died, he transforms into a frivolous dandy, aided in his acting by the female lead with a convoluted past and some hilarious one-note traveling actors, to go undercover as his own heir and attempt to discover who'd wanted him dead and why. It was fun but lacking in some grounding in reality. It was a nice touch that the actress was genuinely an actress though and not the long lost daughter of nobility, as so often happens in these types of stories. I do wish the cheerful, gentle trickster types of characters would be allowed to stay more true to type when switching from a side character to a main character. This book did a better job maintaining some degree of his inherent hilarity than other books of this type, but it still seems to be a necessity that every romantic hero have an exaggeratedly angsty back-story, and that gets trite and tiresome."},{"Title":"Then Comes Marriage","review":"I started out liking this book. It was different, it had a story, and the writing is good, engaging, well paced.But now I'm not so sure. Should I even finish it?The writer has the heroine reading a Jane Austen book. I've seen this done before and it aggravates me to no end. In her time, when her books were being published, Jane Austen's name was NOT on the book. Not until several years after it was published did Jane's name appear on Pride and Predjudice.Please authors, do a simple Google search before you put anything so easily checkable in print, for God sakes! It makes everything else in the book HIGHLY questionable."},{"Title":"Then Comes Marriage","review":"Kasey Michaels has come back again with a charming romance about pretense and deception, and the power of a good disguise. When Brady James is badly injured in an attack, he lets everyone bleinve he is dead to hunt for his attackers. Actress Regina Bliss not only knows who attacked him, she is perfect person to help him become someone else in order to hunt for the villains. Thus emerges the exceedinly silly Gwain Caradoc, and his ward, Regina Felicity.The best part of the book, in my opinion, is the beginning where Regina comes to nurse Brady, and to exchange witty quips. Once Brady and Regina travel to London, the plot gets a little thin. A good book to laugh and to love a little. Buy this one."},{"Title":"Elephants (Naturebooks: Safari Animals)","review":"Simple book design, good quality photographs, and well written. Covers the basics of habitat, African/Asian, characteristics, trunks, etc. Includes some interesting elephant facts. For example, elephants can't jump. There is a glossary, web site list, and index. Karen Woodworth-Roman, Children's Science Book Review"},{"Title":"Spotlight","review":"Spotlight takes us through the tormetned and bittersweet life of Devin O'Keefe as he escapes the violence of Northern Ireland, makes a life for himself, and finds love.Devin O'Keefe watches helplessly as his older brother is killed on Bloody Sunday in the name of peace. From here, Devin's life takes several twists and turns. His closest friend is injured in a freak accident and he discovers that the woman he loves has deceived him to extremes.Fonda Blayne has a dream. She has no intention of spending her life working for someone else, even if it is as a photographer for one of the hottest music magazines. Fonda has an eye for the very best and she intends to put that to good use. Tragedy strikes her as well when her twin brother is killed in the line of duty.Things finally look up when Fonda is offered the chance of a lifetime. She is hired to do a photojournal of the hot rock and roller from Ireland. Devin O'Keefe makes it clear right off that she better stay out of his way, because his music will always come first. Neither Fonda or Devin are emotionally prepared for the attraction that consumes them. A bond is forged and the couple begin a life together, with plans to marry. But all is not so simple. Devin is already married and his wife is a member of the IRA. All hell breaks loose when the band's manager is arrested on charges of terrorism. Devin must face his most horrifying demon and prove to the world and the woman he truly loves that he is all he says he is.Devin and Fonda make a solid foundation for this novel of great importance and political realism. Carole Bellacera takes characters from one of the world's most misunderstood cultures and blends them dramatically with the equally tormented Americans of our own society. Superbly well-rounded cast.This beautiful and poignant tale of trauma and triumph is written with such style I found myself held captive with each word. SPOTLIGHT is an engrossing tale of horrifying proportion and bittersweet victory. Carol bellacera has an impeccable talent as a story-teller with writing skills to match.Ms. Bellacera took me by the hand and led me through the life of one of today's finest hero's. I felt the pain, I cringed in disgust and I heard the very music that filled the pages of SPOTLIGHT. Conviction and determination set a stunning platform for a brilliant career for this writer. Not something I would normally read, I have to urge everyone to pick up this book. Every reader deserves this kind of book."},{"Title":"Spotlight","review":"I am taking a writing course with this author and wanted to see how she writes. I'm liking it a lot. :)"},{"Title":"Spotlight","review":"Carole Bellacera's exciting novel about a young, beautiful journalist and a rock star was delicious reading. Spotlight has a exciting and original plot as well as sexy characters. The suspense went up to the last minute and made it a great reading experience. Thanks Carole, keep 'em coming."},{"Title":"Spotlight","review":"&quot;Spotlight&quot; is one of the best books of the year. I loved &quot;Border Crossings&quot;, the author's first book, and &quot;Spotlight&quot;, the second, is every bit as good. You simply cannot put it down. She captures the Irish experience as few others have."},{"Title":"Spotlight","review":"I enjoyed reading this novel and considered it well written and very good. However, the hero, Devin, is such a perfect person that I had trouble making him real in my mind. He is an Irish Catholic rock star who is more popular and better looking than Bono of U2. He gives most of his money away to peace seeking charities. He also has not had sex in several years since his wife was caught on an IRA terrorist mission as a perpetrator. Devin lives like a monk despite women literally ripping their clothes off in front of him and throwing themselves at him. The only bad things one can say about him are that he's moody sometimes and that he doesn't tell the heroine the whole truth about his life until forced to do so. By contrast, Bellacera's other novel featured a Trinity college professor as the lead, who had his priorities in life confused, and let his own stubbornness and misplaced loyalty get him deeper and deeper into the Irish Catholic cause at the peril of losing his wife and child. I preferred the intimate, human scale of &quot;Border Crossings&quot;, with its well rounded hero, to the superstar setting of &quot;Spotlight&quot; and its superhuman hero. Nevertheless, Bellacera is a very good writer and wrote a rousing tale with &quot;Spotlight&quot;."},{"Title":"Spotlight","review":"Carole Bellacera has done it again! She has followed her outstanding debut novel, BORDER CROSSINGS with a book that's as good, if not better. Wonderfully romantic and suspenseful, SPOTLIGHT is the story of American Fonda Blayne, a writer/photographer for an American rock magazine, Spotlight. She has been assigned to do a book on charismatic Irish rock star Devin O'Keefe who, despite growing up in Northern Ireland advocates peace instead of violence to deal with &quot;The Troubles.&quot; However a woman from Devin's last is using him, without his knowledge, to further her cause which includes bombings and other violent acts.As Devin and Fonda's relationship escalates from a professional to a personal level, can Devin tell Fonda the truth about this woman from his past and still hold on to her love?This is an outstanding book from its haunting prologue to its exciting conclusion. I absolutely could NOT put it down and was up until 3AM finishing it. I highly recommend this book as one of the best books of the year."},{"Title":"Damien: Omen II","review":"Just in case you do not know already, Damien: Omen II is an adaptation of the movie of the same name. Damien: Omen II is a sequel to &quot;The Omen'. The original Omen movie started out as a novel, while Damien: Omen II started out as a screenplay which the novel is closely based on.The story takes place seven years later in which Damien the Antichrist is now thirteen years old, and totally in the dark about his diabolic heritage and destiny. He now lives with his uncle, who runs Thorn Industries, his second wife Ann, and his cousin Mark. As usual, anybody who steps in Damien's way to his destiny or knows his true nature is promptly knocked off in ingenious and gruesome ways. WHile a huge black mastiff lingers around Damien in the first movie/novel, now a monstrous raven hovers ominously nearby.The biggest change in the novel from the movie is the Joan Hart character. In the film, she was merely just a reason for the producers to stick in another gruesome death scene. In the novel, her role was expanded. Her association switched from the David Warner character in the first movie to the archeologist Michael Morgan in the second film's prolouge.Another change is Ann Thorn. In the film it is suggested that she was in league with the DEvil and was dispatched when her usefulness was over. In the book, it is not clear what her true motivation was in the story's finale.Earlier editions contains photographs from the movie, which you may be able to find in used book stores.Overall, the book is a good read, even though it lacked the religious details and atmosphere of the first movie, the book still ended with an evil note like the first one, in which evil triumphs."},{"Title":"Damien: Omen II","review":"The storyline might not be as good as the original...but it was better written and more exciting to read. The original explained more in detail, but this book had me on the edge of the seat! Excellent read!"},{"Title":"Damien: Omen II","review":"This novelization of the second film in the omen series is a professional job, it just isn't that scary (a problem the film it's based on had as well). It was also written by Joseph Howard, not David Seltzer as listed above. Fans of the series will want to search for it anyway, for there are minor differences in the story that will no doubt be of interest."},{"Title":"Damien: Omen II","review":"A good follow up to the original and a good story. But it borrows too heavily from the good versus evil earlier theme of Damien's guardians striking down anybody who learns of his dark secret. This story is interesting because young Damien finally comes to realize who he is and gradually accepts it, then relishes it. Now as a young adult with his destiny set before him the stage is set for the next sequel."},{"Title":"Damien: Omen II","review":"I ordered a book from this store and it appears to have been mailed via covered wagon! The time lag is appalling and I attempted to contact seller to find out when the book would arrive and received no response. I only received an automated email saying that the store is very busy and they would email back at their convenience."},{"Title":"Damien: Omen II","review":"The sequels, unfortunately and not unsurprisingly do not live up to the original.As far as The Omen series goes, stopping at one will generally do you, no need to get this book."},{"Title":"Starman: Grand Guignol (Book 9)","review":"This is the aptly-titled climax of the series, as the elaborate plans of the Shade (or are they?) come to fruition, and everyone gets into the act fighting for or against him. Folks die on both sides, and the action hurtles forward even with repeated and frequent digression issues on one or another cast member's past, or the past of the Opal itself. This is epic comic writing in a class of its own, with more backstory and foreshadowing than you can shake a cosmic rod at. Though it's way late in coming, I applaud DC for (3-4 years later) reprinting it. One more volume, and we should be set (and ready to reread the whole thing again)."},{"Title":"Starman: Grand Guignol (Book 9)","review":"Like other comic junkies, I gobbled up this series (at least in trade form...). I really enjoyed the series overall, but not this one. Yes, it's an epic battle to save Opal from the bad guy.MILD SPOILER:But the bad guy was invented for this plot line, not an old villain returned or anything clever, and I HATE that trick. Why not *really* make Shade the bad guy? Robinson also brings in WAY too many side characters, and takes a long time to tell this story (back story is fine, but it can be overdone). For example, Adam Strange's appearance could have omitted and the story wouldn't have suffered.You could stop reading Starman with book 8."},{"Title":"Starman: Grand Guignol (Book 9)","review":"You get what you pays for, with this title. Big fight, and dead people, brought about by plotting and scheming, with the Shade-powers, Jack, and the local hero-cop family in the middle.Opal City is a wonderful looking place, but now is the time it really needs its heroes. You know what Guignol in the title is going to mean, as well."},{"Title":"Starman: Grand Guignol (Book 9)","review":"I didn't get a chance to read this storyline when it was first published by DC. (I quit buying comics when Robinson's Starman series was only beginning.) I am so glad I have bought this volume, and its predecessors, in trade paperback form. Starman is an grand, epic adventure story, but Jack Knight himself is a believable and likeable individual. He is not your typical superhero, and that's a very good thing!\\"Grand Guignol\\" does not disappoint. Readers of the previous 8 volumes and fans of good superhero comics in general will treasure this book. Without giving too much away, we experience the tragedy of bombings and a full-scale criminal assault on Opal City, which is Jack's hometown and also the enigmatic Shade. Has the Shade really went off the deep end, returning to his super-villainous ways? Or is there a darker evil lurking?To say that this is an excellent addition to any comic book collection is an understatement. This is one of those rare collected editions that make me proud of the industry, and it gives me hope that there is (and always will be) a market for quality monthly comics in the superhero genre. \\"Grand Guignol\\" is the type of action-packed, fun, and poignant trade paperback which elevates comic storytelling into an artform.Recommended without hesitation!"},{"Title":"Starman: Grand Guignol (Book 9)","review":"This volume collects twelve issues of the magazine and the story is about . . . -- well, I'm really not sure *what* it's about. There's Jack Knight, an apparently non-superbeing (since he has to rely on some kind of unnamed tool-weapon to fly and is otherwise vulnerable to the usual threats of violence), whose father was an earlier version of Starman -- but there are several alluded-to earlier, future, and alternate-world Starmen. He apparently has a girlfriend, and he apparently got some other chick pregnant, but those themes are just dropped into the script without explanation. And someone Bad is attacking Opal City, but I have no idea why. The prose is excessively purple, the artwork is mediocre even by the 1960s style it resembles, and I lost patience halfway through, just giving the remainder a skim to see if I could pick up the plot somewhere. Yes, this is not the first volume published (there were sixty issues of the comic before this), but nearly every other middle-of-the-story book I've seen makes at least an effort to provide some backstory, if only by adding an introductory \\"catch up\\" chapter. Unless you are intimately familiar with all that went before in this series -- which I am not -- save your money."},{"Title":"Dark Rain","review":"This is both a tense, gripping thriller, written very persuasively in the style of a noir detective story, and a timely, thought provoking eco-thriller that explores the dehumanization of man, and the abuse of power in a society gripped by fear of an external threat. This is a book that can be read on different levels. As a straight thriller it is a damned good read that will keep you turning the pages into the wee hours. As an eco-thriller, it is a dark, frightening vision of a possible future. This is one of those books that could become a classic, and is so visual it will certainly become a movie. Read it!"},{"Title":"East Meets Southwest: Natural Fusion Cuisine","review":"Walters is to commended for this work, which expresses her evolution in cooking and encouragement for the rest of us to do the same. To this end, she provides helpful hints and recipes to begin.There are some eighty-five recipes here, primarily exhibiting this east meets southwest theme, e.g. East Indian Potato Pancakes with Cucumber Raita; Tempeh Curry with Potatio Chapatis; Red Chile Lemon Chicken; Fresh Mango Mousse.Delightful little cookbook to explore."},{"Title":"East Meets Southwest: Natural Fusion Cuisine","review":"I bought this book after purchasing the author's other cookbook, Cooking at the Natural Cafe in Santa Fe, without knowing that the books are 99% the same. Same number of pages, same recipe titles (I didn't check to see if any ingredients were changed as too time consuming). This edition actually has dropped some of the drawings. Only the bibliography is longer by half a page. If you already have the previous cookbook, you don't need this one.

It was funny, depicting a nuclear family and all the ups and downs of children interacting with each other and adults. In many ways it was another sixties simplistic depiction of family life, where the situations were amusing but never traumatic.The modern reader may look back at the cartoons in this collection and consider them quaint and in many ways they are. However, that does not change the humor or essential reality of the situations, for children and responsible parents of any era are still children and responsible parents and the dynamics of their relationships has not changed for hundreds of years. Therefore, in that context, these cartoons will never be completely obsolete."},{"Title":"Prize Game, The: Lawful Looting on the High Seas in the Days of Fighting Sail","review":"This book is a good resource for history buffs or anyone who's been drawn into the world of historical nautical fiction created by the likes of Patrick O'Brian or C.S. Forester. 'Prizes' were vessels of a rival nation captured by naval warships and privateers (private vessels operating under letters of marque and reprisal from their government). The taking and disposition of prizes were strictly 'regulated' by international law. The author: seaman, soldier, lawyer, businessman, politician and publisher, gives a good overview of the intricacies of prizes during the age of sail. He uses several case studies to discuss the practice of ransoming vessels, sea cartels, the distinction between piracy and privateering, prize courts, blockades, and the rights and responsibilities of everybody involved in the taking of prizes at sea. He concludes with a chapter that summarizes the rules of the prize game. His discussion focuses mostly on American actions during the period from the Revolutionary to Civil War, but that discussion invariably involves U.S. relations and interactions with England, France, Denmark and Norway. While the narrative lacked the excitement of the chase and capture that I find so addictive in Horatio Hornblower, it provided a historical foundation to make Hornblower's exploits that much more enjoyable. The work is well annotated for those wanting to dig deeper into the history or law of the naval prize."},{"Title":"Prize Game, The: Lawful Looting on the High Seas in the Days of Fighting Sail","review":"I found Donald A. Petrie's book to be very informative on how captured ships during the times of wooden ships and iron men era was dealt with. The time period in question lies between 1776 to 1815 although the book does covered some element of the American Civil War as well. The rules of taking ships during the time of war proves to be a highly complex affair as each nation seem to have their own rules andlaws. But on the whole, they generally followed the lead of the British navy since the British navy ruled the waves.The book proves to be well written, well researched and the author takes pains to explained how it worked. He gaves example cases to reflect his points. He shows the difference between a legal privateer and an illegal pirate, how a ship can be \\"ransomed\\" on sea and how such claims can be held as legal debt even after the war. The author make pains to explained how a privateer have certain set of rules which govern his actions, rules that clearly separate him from a common pirate.For any readers interested in naval history, this book should be a welcome source of knowledge. For anyone who's a fan of Hornblower, Aubrey, Bothilo and Rampage, this book will explained much."},{"Title":"Prize Game, The: Lawful Looting on the High Seas in the Days of Fighting Sail","review":"What is the relationship between lawyers and marauders? Well nowadays someone would end that with a witty punch line. But at one time they did work closely together.This is a book relating to the laws and customs of war in the age of sail especially with regard to the taking of prizes. It gives fascinating details, such as cross ocean lawsuits after hostilities(at one time their was a suit by an American privateer in a British court over the validity of a ransom promised to him), the issueing of letters of mark, and the condemnation of prey in prize courts.As might be expected in a book about legal matters it can have dry writting at times. But it also has interesting anecdotes and a great deal of information about a specialized aspect of war on the high seas."},{"Title":"Forgotten Faces: A Window Into Our Immigrant Past (Forgotten Faces - America's Lost History)","review":"Forgotten Faces offers a surprisingly detailed look into our history. The text is easily read. Although the portraits are the heart of the book, the author's descriptions and insights enliven the images.I was impressed by the breadth of knowledge about the portraits.

For me it was not just the historical aspect but also the genealogical. I was raised in SF and while growing up went with my parents to visit our departed friends and family in the Colma Cemetaries every other Sunday. The faces on those stones and in the book were very familiar to me, one face and account I knew well, the others I had always speculated on. It was wonderful to finally place them and read some of their stories.I went ahead and gave the book five stars, even though there were numerous typos, they did not distract from the overall message of the book. Since the author was very exact in his research and the telling of my Aunt Bridie's story, I would assume the other stories are as accurate as well. I would have loved to have a hard bound edition but was unable to locate one.I whole heartedly agree that all memorial portraits should be valued as true works of art, they are indeed a beautiful final testament to a loved ones life and death. Overall it contains an interestingly wonderful collection of historical portraitures and engaging stories.

This by itself made me feel sad. Second, the book seemed so short, it could in no way get close to covering everything the Koran mentioned. Then the translation seems too colloquial it takes away the holiness of the book. True, this could be easily understood by a common English reader but if someone is going to read this and think this is &quot;The Koran&quot; hence the title, then I'm starting to feel sorry for the translator. Other reasons you should not read this translation is that it is not certified by anyone, it does not have any footnotes, and it is a feeble attempt of a translator to convey rhyming English verses over actual deep meaningful ones. Once again try Yusuf Ali's translation attempt, in which the English footnotes are very helpful even for an Arabic reader."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"This book isn't entertaining in the least.

Dawood's translation of the Qur'an is as close to being worthless as it is possible for an English translation of the Qur'an to be. The errors and mistranslations are such that many consider it to be perilously close to blasphemous. At best, it is absolutely impossible to get a clear understanding of what the Qur'an is really saying from Dawood's attempt to render the Qur'an into modern English.He changed the traditional Sura order to the chronological Sura order (i.e. the Suras in the authentic Quran are not arranged in the order in which they were revealed). This indicative of his excessive license with the work, as well as his clear contempt for the original. An Iraqi Jew, Dawood excercises considerable self-aggrandizment with his claims that Jewish and Christian teachings influenced the Prophet. These and other liberties demontrate his unwillingness and incapacity to produce an accurate and unbiased translation.His mistakes of translation are beyond ridiculous: e.g. 'bani Adam\\" (correct translatied as 'children of Adam'; from al-Araf 7:31) is rendered as \\"children of Allah\\". In Al-Baqarah 2:191 'al fitnatu asyaddu minal qatl (\\"oppression is worse than slaughter\\")' is mistranslated as 'idolatry is worse than carnage\\". Space does not permit me to list the dozens and dozens of other errors which would be amusing if applied to any other book.As a Muslim, my disgust for his translation is so adamate that I refuse to permit a copy of it in my home.Because if this, I have absolutely no animosity or ill feelings towards any of those who posted vitrolic invective about the Qur'an: simply because they never read the Qur'an. They read N. J. Dawood's worthless poetry; which, of course, cannot provide them with a shred of useful information with which to make an informed choice in the matter. I will not hold people's ignorance against them.With all the sincerity at my command, I advise all, Muslim and non-Muslim alike to shun Dawood's translation as you need not mere diseased swine."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"I thought I had ordered the hard back version but got the paper back.

The stories are irrelevant, this book teaches forgiveness, kindness etc the same as the western religions. I reccomend the read, there are some very nice passages at the end of the book and the early ones although hard to follow are also good reads."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"I had no real interest in Islam until 9/11, after which I picked up and read Islam: The Straigh Path by John Esposito. I then did an independent study of Sufism, which is what sparked my interest in Islam enough to read The Koran, its central text.Although I cannot comment on the other reviewers' differing views on the accuracy of this translation, I can write that this translation does convey something of the thunderous power that Muhammad's earliest listeners must have heard and experienced when these suras (speeches - the Koran is a collection of 114 speeches given by Muhammad, which Muslims believe were revelations given to him by God) were first delivered.There are a number of things that one could mention content-wise, as each sura deals with something slightly different. God, women, human relationships, one's relationship to the non-believing world, Judaism, Christianity, and Arabic paganism are all touched upon in the Koran (along with other topics). It reads much like the Bible at points, and many of the more familiar Biblical stories are here, along with extra-Biblical legends. The Koran really isn't a bizarre religious text, but very much belongs to the genealogy of monotheistic, prophetic writings.One of the things that I really liked about this particular translation was the way that Dawood cross-referenced relevant Biblical texts from both the Tanak/Old Testament and the New Testament. The footnotes detailing Arabic pagan practice were also helpful, as were the footnotes giving basic historical information. One certainly gets a feel for where the Koran was coming from and who it was going to when it was first delivered.In reading this, it is worth reflecting on how a passage can lend itself to multiple interpretations. There are very few passages in the Koran that make any mention of war, and far more passages that assert that one should leave judgment to God. Yet, in our own time, these passages on war seem to be used - in some circles, at least - far more often than the passages that counsel one to merely give warning and leave the rest to God.I think that the Koran is worth reading, especially given the current socio-political climate and I found this particular translation to be helpful due to Dawood's many footnotes. Regardless of the translation you end up buying, at least check this one out as it will give you an important insight into the world of the early Muslims, which continues to shape our world today."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"N.J. Dawood's translation has been held in high regard throughout the English speaking world (though not by English speaking MUSLIMS). It certainly achieves the translator's stated goal: to render the Koran in contemporary English. In comparison to Abdullah Y. Ali and especially Muhammad Marmaduke Pickthall, Dawood's translation flows easily and naturally, while retaining in some part the forcefulness of the original Arabic.However, a key point missed by some who run across this book in the store is this: Dawood has heavily edited and OMITTED portions of the Koran that he felt were repetitious or unnecessarily lengthy. While that's fine for a general audience, completists and orthodox Muslims will be irked by the omission of parts of the text. In short, this is NOT a complete Koran.That being said, the language and diction of this translation is certainly to be admired. Dawood's offering is clear and eminently readable. Although this book is inappropriate for any serious study of the Koran, it is more than adequate as a first Koran for the non-Muslim taking an interest in Islam."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"Reviewers complaining of inaccuracies here are off base. For example, Dawood never translated 7:31 (\\"children of Adam\\") as \\"children of Allah.\\" This is impossible, as one of Dawood's nice touches is that he has always translated Allah (correctly) as \\"God.\\" (By the way, Yusuf Ali made this same wise choice in his translation, but the holier-than-thou revisers of his work who continue to publish it under his name have mucked up this & a whole lot else.)Dawood's knowledge of Qur'anic Arabic is deep and subtle. As another reviewer has noted, a remarkable feature of his translation is how much it has improved over time (over the successive reeditions put out by Penguin). For this reason, definitely buy this book new. Usually, when translators go back and fiddle with their work, they make it worse. But Dawood's labor of love is evident in the gradual progress he has made towards the clearest and most accurate phrases and rhythms to capture the original.Dawood does not put on a show by dressing his text with long, technical, or argumentative footnotes (as do many editions of the Qur'an). But his knowledge of traditional comment on the sacred text (and of philology) is the equal of any other translator's. Add to this, the fact that Dawood's English is graceful and limpid (moreso than the work of Arberry, Pickthall, et al.).Why only four stars? I await the day that a philologically astute translation appears with proper annotations. Look at the study edition of the New Jerusalem Bible, or at the New Oxford Annotated Bible, and you will see what readers of the Qur'an (in English) are sorely lacking."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"When I decided to read the Koran, I studied the various translations available, trying to find the most readable, reliable version available. I downloaded all available public domain translations from gutenberg.org and carefully compared them against the translations currently available in print. I bought several, but not all, the translations, and settled upon this translation to read. I chose this translation because it was one of the most readable and because of my long experience of the reliability of Penguin translations.As one who knows next to nothing about Islam, I was struck by three things: The moral teachings; the martial teachings; and the figure of Jesus.First the moral teachings: They are quite similar to the moral teachings of the Christian Bible. Indeed, the Koran explicitly recognizes the scriptural nature of the \\"Torah\\" and the \\"Gospel.\\" The moral teachings don't seem to be as plentiful in the Koran as in the New Testament, but I think there's a very good explanation. Mohammed was at war most of his prophetic career, therefore quite a lot of the Koran deals with warfare.Second, the martial teachings: They are quite prevalent, and one could easily read the martial teachings to the exclusion of all else in the Koran. Something that struck me about the martial teachings was that they stressed non-aggression. The good believer is to fight only in self defense, and only enough to accomplish the defense. After defeating the enemy, then the good believer must be forgiving and merciful.Martial teachings prevail in number over moral teachings in the Koran because Mohammed was persecuted in his lifetime, driven out of Mecca, attacked in Medina, and forced to defend himself in a bloody war. Quite naturally, if he's engaged in a war during most of the time he's revealing the Suras of the Koran, he's going to be talking about warfare. Thus, warfare can become a significant aspect of Islamic theology.Third, the figure of Jesus: Jesus occupies a place in the Koran superior to all the prophets who preceded him. Muslim belief about Jesus is very similar to, but also quite different from, Christian belief. So near, yet so far apart.Reading the Koran isn't going to make you an expert on Islam any more than reading the Bible is going to make you an expert on Christianity. But given the political, religious, and cultural climate of today's world, it is worth the effort to try to learn something about the beliefs of approximately 1,000,000,000 of our fellow-beings on this planet."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"This is a very readable translation of the Quran. For the Western reader, it is much more accessible than translations such as that of Shakir. This translation attempts to capture some of the literary style and beauty of the original. The footnotes are especially helpful in pointing out the meanings of difficult words or phrases. Often, the footnotes clarify who is speaking and about whom or what. I find that difficult passages are best understood by comparing several translations and this translation is often the most helpful. An example is Quran 4:3 where Shakir says \\"what your right hands possess\\" whereas Dawood translates it as \\"slave girls\\". I fault Shakir for obscuring the true meaning by his overly literal translation. My only frustration is that Dawood changed the traditional order of the chapters, and this makes cross referencing rather slow. I highly recommend this book, especially for who are reading the Quran for the first time."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"While I suppose that there may be some inaccuracies, I find this to be the most easily read version of the Holy Quran currently available."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"Dawood's translation was, I believe, the first one that I ever read. As I am not a Muslim, I can't judge very well on matters of interpretation, but on a scale of 1 to 10 I'd say:Accuracy - 5. Given a choice, Dawood prefers clarity to accuracy. Please understand that translating everything the Quran says, or even a small part of what it says, is impossible.Poetic Sense - 8. Dawood is really pretty good in letting some of lilt get through.Depth - 3. It's just not there.I'd probably recommend him over Pickthall, even though Pickthall was a Muslim. Pickthall was very aware of the sense behind what he was translating, and he tried to bring more of it through than could be done; he also has a bit too much baggage from the bible with him. My favorite translation is Yusuf Ali, who is interested in being as clear and accurate as possible even at the expense of elegance. If you want elegance too, learn Arabic and read the original."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"The Koran is a very compelling and mysterious book, for better or worse (depending on your personal beliefs of course), but I think for anyone exploring Islam, this book is a good start, particularly for those who are new to Islam.Mr. Daewood's translation is very beautiful and poetic, when compared to other translations I have seen. I also like the unconventional format of this book, in that the shorter chapters go first. This is intended for the new readers, so they do not get stuck on long, difficult chapters like The Cow, or Women.However, for more scholarly interests, this book might not be the most accurate. Difficult words and phrases tend to be translated in a way that is more dramatic or literary sounding, but may detract from the original meaning. This could be problematic for those trying to discern the authorial context of the passage.In any case, I did very much enjoy reading this version for what it is: a literary translation for the uninitiated. For those new to Islam, this is a good place to start. For others, I recommend looking elsewhere. :)"},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"... I believe that this translation has merit in that it relays the Koranic message in a way that is easy to understand. Those wishing to explore more precise, and thereby more complex versions, should ideally look to the original text, or a dual-language version, where there are adjacent columns of Arabic and English. Since the Koran is originally presented in verse, one may wish to read a tranlation which also presents the text in verse. But, for those who wish to study the text in a relaxed fashion, I would recommend this prose translation. Incidentally, another reviewer's comment clarifying the meaning of the word Qawamoon as truly meaning \\"have been charged with\\" is correct, based on my own research. BUT do not let this demerit the entire translation, for this is not the only translation that makes such a mistake. In general, I find this to be an excellent translation for the beginner."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"The Koran (Penguin Classics)I am a non-arab Muslim and I was searching for a good and linguistically modern translation of the Koran.This translation by N.J.

It is very readable, coherent and limits the use of archaic and intimidating language."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"This is a very poor translation of the Quran. I found errors and missing/additonal words/phrases. It is clear that the translator doesn't think that this is a holy book that needs utmost care and effort. This is a careless translation, probably done in haste while the translator was sipping his afternoon tea.Let me give you a small example:He translates part of verse 24:31 as \\"to draw their veils over their bossoms\\". The word \\"their veils\\" here is ambiguous and to many it implies covering the face. But the Arabic word \\"Khomorehenna\\" means \\"their headscarves\\".Then in 33:59 he translates \\"Prophet, enjoin your wives, daughters, and the wives of true believers to draw their veils close around them\\". Never mind the superfluous \\"true\\" where the Arabic text just reads \\"the believers\\", but notice the use of the word \\"veil\\" again! The Arabic word used here is \\"Jalabeebehenna\\". This is plural for \\"their Jilbabs\\". A Jilbab is the long outfit/dress still worn by Arabs in Gulf states today like a long dress.How both a \\"headscarf\\" and a \\"dress\\" both got translated to the word \\"veil\\" is beyond me, but it shows the translator was not keen on accuracy.I recommend this translation of the Quran instead:\\"Translation of the Glorious Quran -- by Ahmad Zidan and Dina Zidan\\". This was done by TWO people. An Arabic-speaking man and his English-speaking wife. Together they brought strength in both langauges and their team effort has resulted in a much more accurate translation than the one you have here. Oh and notice that they describe the book as \\"Translation of the Glorious Quran\\", not arrogantly calling it \\"The Koran\\" as if it is the same as the original revealed text."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"Do NOT buy this book, it is riddled with remarkably blatant changes to the Qur'anic text.

That verse is changed to \\"...Idolatry is worse than carnage.\\"This translation of the Qur'an is a fine example of demonazation of the religion.If you truly wish to read the Qur'an I HIGHLY recommend \\"The Holy Qur'an\\", translated by: Yusef Ali.

But alas, it finally dawned on me that many muslims of today do not follow the Quran, but mostly rely on Hadith and Sunnah to explain the book! That is why Islam is so misunderstood today. Their own innovations.. It is sad but true, and Dawood also has come to rely on these made-up rules by scholars to explain the Quran in his footnotes. I have stoppped reading his Quran and have gotten the best translated Quran that I know of, by Dr. Khalifa. And it doesn't hurt to continue comparing translations, there is much one can learn by doing so."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"This translation leaves out text, mistranslates other text, and has no explanatory footnotes.

(Try reading Shakespeare without footnotes -- and that was only 400-some years ago!)This one is short and cheap, true, but it doesn't accurately convey what the Koran says. The best translation out there is Muhammad Asad's \\"Message of the Qur'an.\\" Asad was a Polish Jew before his conversion to Islam, and he has great explanatory footnotes and a really accurate translation that's easy for the Western mind to understand without sacrificing meaning, as Dawood's translation does."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"don't waste your time with this terrible translation. this is a propagandistic version of the koran, aimed at giving islam a bad name. many verses are purposely mistranslated in the worse way possible.

For a more accurate translation I would recommend Muhammad Asad or Nooruddin."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"10-Point Rating: (3.5 - 1.0 for its message, 9.0 for its intellectual importance)The Qur'an is without a doubt the single most influential book ever written (the Bible is not a single book written by a single author). The sad fact is that it is also easily the most violent of all the world's religious texts. There has been a popular push lately to convince people that Islam is a peaceful religion and that the Qur'an is no more violent than other holy books. Much of this effort has been undertaken by individuals who have never even made any serious inquiry into either the message of the Qur'an or the life of the historical Muhammad (a certain president comes to mind).The question at root is not whether Muslims are more violent than non-Muslims - human beings of any religion can be equally brutal, rather the question concerns whether the ethical theory of Islam as presented in the Qur'an is more permissive of violence than the average religion (e.g. Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, etc.). This core question regarding the ethical system qua theory can only be answered by actually reading the Qur'an. In this sense, and in this sense only, I highly recommend this book.In order to keep this review as brief as possible, I will focus on the ethics involved in one simple sentence from the Qur'an: \\"Idolatry is more grievous than bloodshed.\\" (2:191b). The first thing to notice is that this is a generalized ethical statement, i.e. idolatry (worshipping other divinities instead of/in addition to Allah) in general is worse than bloodshed (killing said idolaters) in general. It is not a statement concerning any particular instance, but is rather a valuation rule for all instances of both idolatry and bloodshed (context bears this fact out).There are two things I find ethically significant about this simple statement. The first is so obvious it might be missed: both are grievous. One is not good and the other bad, both are bad. By direct implication this means that God is placing the believer in an ethical scenario where they must commit a grievous act. Either they kill the idolater (less grievous), or they let the idolater live, inevitably to continue their idolatry (more grievous). There is no third option because if the idolater is suffered to live (even shackled, imprisoned, etc.) he will continue to be an idolater - belief is internal. If the believer simply does nothing, he will be allowing the idolatry to occur and this falls under the more grievous heading (context makes this clear). The author of the Qur'an understands this as he gives no third option either. If God puts the believer in such a lose-lose scenario, what else can we say but that God is wicked (which is by definition absurd). The second ethical significance is the valuation itself which in effect says that a particular state of belief (Islam) has more worth than life itself. In essence, life has no worth at all without such belief states, and by inference life has no intrinsic nobility or value. It is the belief state alone which has intrinsic value. This is ontologically backwards - beings have belief states, not vice versa.In summary, I find much wrong with the ethical system of the Qur'an, which is overtly destructive, violent, and brutal. This violent stance even pervades the cosmology of the Qur'an, where the act of divine creation itself is described destructively (21:30). And don't even let me get started on the status of women in the Qur'an. Read the book and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"You have to give the Qur'an credit--few books in the desert cave canon can match its retro charm. Though controversial at first, it went on to become the Dianetics of its day. Ignore the naysayers--the Qur'an's flat-earth cosmology, slave-care tips, and streamlined attitude toward divorce helped build today's Middle East!As others have noted, translating Arabic to English requires a rare depth of knowledge of each culture and language. This shouldn't stop readers from enjoying the inflexible legalism and vivid descriptions of Hell every seeker of sacred truth longs for. The subtle yet unyielding force of the original Arabic, hopefully, was adequately conveyed by the dozen or so exclamation points per page.At the risk of putting an orange safety cone on the sturdy iron bridge of everlasting Peace between Western liberal democracies and the friendly, easygoing republics of Islam, I did find the Qur'an's skeptical view of Jesus Christ (a.k.a. the King of Kings) troubling. My faith in the Good Shepherd's redeeming love remained unshaken. But you know us Protestants, raised with the stubborn, self-aggrandizing belief that we're entitled to question, change, and improve things from time to time, since we're the ones who have to live on this earth.Another theme of the book--slaying infidels and idolaters--failed to warm my heart. In a world of jealousy, infidelity, crime, greed, warfare, and missing-child cases, it's hard to get all worked up about a frieze, bas-relief, or sculpture here and there. The serenity and good will in the Buddhas I've seen in art museums seem to bear a message of timeless peace. I, a mere mortal, can appreciate the masterful skill of polytheistic Greek or Hindu artists without being threatened or wanting to start bowing, going into a wild dance, and sacrificing animals. The Ten Commandments said not to kill. If we have an enemy, Jesus said we should love and pray for them. Pretty simple to understand, and if we lived by it the world would have peace. It was kind of strange for the Qur'an to take a total U-turn in this area."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"Great book for understanding this religion. They are peaceful people.

Other than the fact that this translation replaces \\"Allah\\" with \\"God\\" to make it more palatable for the less enlightened, it appears to be an accurate translation that reveals Islam's true nature and avoids the temptation to obscure the passages that reveals the dark nature of Islam."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"I am not familiar with other translations. I read this translation twice; once some years ago, and again recently. Having done some other reading in the meantime, my reaction was different the second time.One thing that strikes me is that, in the edition I've looked at, the order of the chapters is changed by the translator to appeal more to the literary tastes of western readers. My impression is that later edition(s) by Dawood may have the original order restored.The introduction is very short, and deals very little with early Muslim history. A very short chronology of the prophet's life is included, but contains some surprizing entries, such as Dawood's statement that, in the massacre of one of the Jewish clans in Medina, only one man saved his life by converting. I cannot recall another historian who has suggested that the massacre was religious in nature. My understanding is that its origins were political, in the war between Mecca and Medina. (Most all western writers seem to agree on the deplorable nature of the event.) Dawood also states here that the Jews of Khaybar were put to the sword. J. J. Saunders, by contrast, suggests that these were treated with comparative moderation, allowed to work their former lands as tenants, but deprived of ownership thereof.The expansion of Muslim military power in Arabia during the time of the Koran's composition (a period of over twenty years) was characterized by numerous battles with animist-led armies (those of Mecca and the desert). To a considerable extent, Muslims fought defensive battles at this time, but the precise extent to which the fighting was defensive is a matter of interpretation. See J. J. Saunder's History of Medieval Islam, Karen Armstrong's Islam, Desmond Stewart's early Islam, Cecil Roth's Short History of the Jewish People, and Chaim Potok's Wanderings for more details (though occasionally contradictory).The Koran often refers to fighting with unbelievers, which I suspect may be a commentary on actual battles with animists, after the fact, rather than a call to attack, without provokation. The Koran states twice that a Muslim may not attack another who has not attacked him first. Its (far more frequent) references to fighting &quot;unbelievers&quot; may, I assume, be a reference to the fact that the overwheliming majority of Mohammed's enemies were animists rather than Christians and Jews. My bias is to interpret these matters as a liberal, and I am far from an understanding of them.One of the most outstanding calls in the book is to revere the Torah and the Gospel. So great is this repeated praise, that it could easily sound like a counsel to read these books, though perhaps this is a false impression.In short, I see a great need to approach this book with some historical background; this is not provided to as great an extent as it could have been by the translator.Sopme readers may be surprized that Muslims do not regard this book as containing the teachings of Mohammed himself. These, they suggest, are contained in another book, called the Hadith, of which there are numerous versions."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"this book provides nice and comprehensive rendering of the qur'an. it has the most authoritative rendering of qur'an i have ever read. best for the first time reader of qur'an and regular readers as wel."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"The words and passages in this book have inspired untold thousands of wanton murders and oppression throughout the centuries, ranking alongside other notorious publications such as 'Mein Kampf', 'Dianetics' and 'The Book of Mormon'.

You are much better to go with translations from Marmaduke Pichthall or Yusuf Ali. This is a very poor translation and hard to read."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"Not only does Dawood distort the meaning, he leaves out a lot. The reason this translation is attractive is that it's short and readable. But it's not the Quran. So if you want to understand what the Quran actually says, this is not the translation to get.So much of the Quran is incomprehensible to the lay reader (even the Arabic-speaking lay reader) that footnotes are really essential to make any sense of it. For instance, the Quran sometimes just refers to historical figures or events but doesn't name names or go into details. Or, sometimes a verse may be in response to a specific circumstance that was taking place at the time (keep in mind that not one word of the Arabic Quran has been changed from the time it was first compiled 1400 years ago); the verse may no longer be applicable or it may have even been rendered obsolete by a later verse. That sort of thing is impossible to know without footnotes, and Dawood not only leaves out explanations, sometimes he leaves out text that would have helped make sense of a passage.I agree with other reviewers that Yusuf Ali is more accurate and even somewhat poetic. It has good explanatory footnotes. I probably prefer that one over any others, overall (I have a degree in Islamic studies and have five translations at home). I like Arberry, too, in terms of style, but it's not as clear and concise as Yusuf Ali's version. You might want to try John Alden Williams' &quot;The Word of God.&quot; It's his own &quot;translation&quot; (the Quran can't really be translated!) of Quranic passages that are arranged as excerpts with Williams' straightforward explanations alternating between them. I think it might be a better introduction to the Quran -- for someone not too familiar with it -- than reading the Quran itself (especially Dawood's version) cold. Williams' book is short, too, But if you want to go straight to the Quran, get the Yusuf Ali translation. Avoid this one."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"I ordered the book from Amazon.com early on a Sunday morning. The book arrived at my place of work on the following Tuesday. Holding the Koran in my hand, it came to me that \\"this is the heart of Islam\\". It felt somehow different from holding our own Bible. What arcane ideas would I find in its pages? Would the contents be shocking, dismaying, maybe giving credence to our hate-emailers? What would I learn? Surprises were in store for me. Encouragement of hatred toward Americans, Christians, and Jews, is found nowhere in the Qur'an. Muslims are exhorted only to stand apart from unbelievers [the same warning is found in the Holy books of other religions]. The Qur'an presents a clear description of a true Believer. Page 223: \\"He that comes before his Lord laden with sin shall be consigned to Hell, where he shall neither die nor live. But he that comes before Him with true faith, having done good works, shall be exalted to the highest ranks. He shall abide forever in the gardens of Eden, in gardens watered by running streams. Such shall be the recompense of those that keep themselves pure.\\" Right here is drawn the line which seperates al Qaeda from all straight-path Muslims. The preemptive attacks waged by al Qaeda are prohibited by the Qur'an. Page 237: \\"Permission to take up arms is hereby given to those who are attacked, because they have been wronged.\\" The Qur'an is most clear on this. For the most part, the Qur'an makes simple statements which cannot be interpreted, misconstrued, or twisted to fit an unbeliever's agenda. In all respects, this English translation of the Qur'an should be a must-read for scholars who cannot read the Arabic original."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"Many believers in the Koran have criticized this translation as not being the \\"real\\" Koran because they say that it can never be translated accurately. They even suggest that one cannot possibly understand the Koran unless you study Arabic with some scholars. I have news for these people. This is an old superstition about languages which has absolutely no basis in fact. Any linguist will tell you that anything in one language can be translated into another language and that there are no superior languages or more expressive languages. Just as Islam followers would like the whole world to bow facing Mecca in an act of subordination (\\"Islam\\" means submission, not peace, by the way) to one of the most undeveloped and uncivilized areas of the world, so they would love Arabic to be held up as some sort of superior language, the only language that the Koran could rightly be studied in. This is absolute nonsense. Any idea in one language can be translated into any other language. What is really going on here is: 1) a fear that the Koran would actually be submitted to modern critical methods and be found wanting (see any of the books by Ibn Warraq and you will see that there is much about the Koran that scholars find less than divine). This cannot be done in the East where scholars are put to death for investigating the Koran. 2) A fear that the Koran would get away from the iron grip of Islamic fundamentalists and any sort of liberal, moderate interpretation might take place. In the East, the usual punishment for doing so is death again.3) A fear that the believers in the Koran might actually understand its literal message and find it wanting. As is usual in most religions, the average believer knows very little about their own faith. Finding out the truth would cause a crisis of faith. In the Arabic countires, education is in a very poor state. Many people are illiterate. Many women are denied education. The masses rely on the authorities to find out what to believe. Without literacy or democracy or equality of the sexes, you have an ignorant mob that is easy to control. If that mob ever learns to read and think for themselves, the religious leaders could be in big trouble. Keeping the Koran mysterious is to their advantage. This is why they tell people that you need a scholar to understand the Koran or that you can only read it in Arabic and all translations are inadequate.Don't fall for any of this. Dawood does a fine job of translation. It is easy to see exactly what the message of the Koran is. Is the Koran permissive of violence? Yes. Are the stories in the Koran a confused jumble of Old Testament, New Testament, gnostic and pagan stories? Yes. Read it for yourselves and see. And you don't need an Arabic scholar to read it with to see that."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"Having read this monstrosity, I get tired very quickly of all of the reviews trying to convince non-moslems that the Koran is a peaceful book. Don't tell US that Islam is peaceful. Start telling your fellow moslems. They are the ones that need convincing. Having read this, it seems to me that the Koran is a very violent and intolerant message. It is also anti-woman, anti-science, anti-gay, anti-jewish/christian, anti-peace. I can see clearly from reading it how followers could use it as an excuse for war. Don't tell me that Jihad means \\"struggle\\" and not war. I never heard of the word until moslems used it to mean war and NOT struggle. Convert your own people if Islam isn't violent."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"In trying to find a good translation of a classic it is absurd to find those who criticize a religious text as if they were writing a book report.

The hypocracy of ignoring similar statements in the Bible, while promoting one's own political dogma is no review at all."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"The Quran is what I grew reading and memorizing. It is where I got my inspiration; no wonder I choose to be an \\"infidel\\" on my own. Read with me some verses of the Quran and get inspired on what it has to say on Women on the 4th chapter (sura) verse 34:As for those from whom ye fear rebellion, admonish them and banish them to beds apart, and scourge them.Did you read it? It says plainly to scourge the wife under some circumstances. Beat her up! And yet there are some dumb American women who would tell me that they found the Quran more inspiring than the Bible. That is absolutely DUMB!Here is another verse in the Quran in the 9th chapter about how Muslims will subjugate Non-Muslims under their rule and \\"HUMILIATE\\" them. Get it! It is verse 29.29 Fight against such of those who have been given the Scripture as believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, and forbid not that which Allah hath forbidden by His messenger, and follow not the Religion of Truth, until they pay the tribute readily, being brought low.This is a plain command to the Muslim to FIGHT non Muslims until the Non Muslim is twisted in his arm and has no choice but Islam or Isalm. It says in Arabic \\"wa hum sagheroon\\" i.e. with humiliation. Humiliate the Non Muslim while paying tax tribute till he succumbs to Islam.And I still hear dumb people getting carried away by what is Un-American, just the very fact that it is Un-American to them and the grass to them is greener on the other side of the fence! since we live in the Bible Belt and people drool over what is exotic! That is dumb!"},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"I cannot compare this work to other translations of the Koran because it is the only one I have read. Nor, can I compare it to the original Arabic rendering. However, my thoughts are that the Koran is a [borrowing] of another people's god. The Koran states that the Holy Scriptures were given to the Jews and later the Christians, but that these people were not following the message or word of God correctly. What I see here is a political motive. Hebrew writings were around well before Muhammad and the New Testament writings were available some 500 years before the Koran was written. So, it comes as no surprise that these scriptures could have found their way into Arabia. Muhammad and others simply adopted these writings as their own with changes to reflect the Arab culture at that time. Most likely, due to the fact the pagan religions of the Arabs at that time were not as complex or documented.It can also be said that Christianity also hijacked the Jewish faith, but in this case it was different. The early Christians were a Jewish sect. The Romans regarded Christianity as a Jewish sect. The two religions were not formally separated by the Romans until Constantine made Christianity the state religion. Judaism, at the time of Christ, comprised of three main sects...the Pharisees, the Sadducees and the Essenes. So, it is not surprising that Christianity would naturally form a splinter group. Many believe that Jesus and his followers were Essenes. It could also be they were a group totally separate from the three main sects, but did share beliefs and ideals with them. I believe all of these sects, especially Christianity, drew heavily from the Pharonic religions of ancient Egypt. Especially, when considering Gnostic Christianity but also the accepted Christianity of today.The Koran and Islam are a different matter. The Koran does not delve into the real source of these faiths, but rather draws from Judaism and Christianity. Basically, intended to supercede both while finding flaws with these two faiths, or how they were being upheld. If Muslims read the Nag Hammadi Library, I think they would see where some of the ideas and beliefs of the Koran were derived. Those who know Christianity well, would know that there could not be another prophet after Jesus Christ. One is not needed. Those that are familiar with the Gnostics would know the meaning behind \\"another\\" dying on the cross while Jesus looked on. The so-called \\"twin\\" who took the place of Christ. Well, the twin simply means the body, which is the twin to the soul. Jesus had what we now call an \\"out-of-the-body\\" experience. His body died on the cross, but his soul lived on. In the case of Jesus, his soul was part of the Trinity that makes up the Oneness of God.In summation, the Koran was written by men for political purposes. This was not an uncommon act. The ability to have your god supercede the god of another people was important in those times. It is not possible to pull off such a stunt in today's world because people would write Muhammad off as a nut. The Koran brings us nothing new and nothing that wasn't written well before 600AD. With the exception of cultural items and customs of the Arabs in those days that were blended in."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"I do not think the man who \\"translated\\" the Koran here is a true Muslim. One cannot shuffle and reorder the Suras to suit one's own taste. This man does not have the right to mess up our Holy Book in this way. Plue the style of writing is not nearly as engaging as the Ali version. I have not been in a Mosque yet that had this version of the Koran on its shelves. You can go into any Mosque in this country and pick up a copy of the Ali Tranlation for free. Why waste your money on this Infidel sham version?"},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"IntroductionI write this as a believing christian giving my honest reaction to reading the text. Having found other religious texts pleasing and sometimes insipirational (Buddhist texts in particular), I was open minded to receive something similar from Islam's relgious text. My earnest hope is that Muslims will show similar curiosity and open our Bible as well.Claim to clarity?One of the key claims of muslims is that the Qur'an is clear. Indeed, this claim for clarity is important because it is one of their basis basic arguments against jews and christians that they cannot agree about the meaning of their texts. A basic function of the Qur'an in Muslim tradition is its clear teaching about Divine matters. Now, does a reading of this book prove or disprove their point? I am afraid a careful reading of the book shows that the claim for clarity is manifestly and blatantly untrue.As scholars of classical arabic point out, 20% of the book does not at all make sense. Some of this can be put down to the assembling of the suras by the compilers under Uthman, the third caliph, but a good measure of it must go down to the workings of the brain of the messenger himself. A careful reading shows frequent mental shifts taking place within the context of single paragraphs - a kind of mental gymnastics. I am not referring here to the short (so called Mecca suras) which are quite pleasing and poetic but to the so called Medina suras. Another point is that the text is full of places where the translator is really taking the best guess. No one knows what the text means, not even the Hadith compilers (circa 150-200 years post the messeneger's death).Grammatical issuesAnother important claim of muslims is that this is the most beautiful and unrepeatable texts ever because it proceeds from the mouth of God. And yet, as scholars point out, the book has grammatical errors in itRecyling of religious material from jews and christiansA Jewish or Christain reader of the Qur'an cannot but be struck by the degree of recyling of jewish material from the Old Testament. Not only that, the same stories re Moses, Noah, Lot, Joseph etc get re-told in different variant forms. Not only that, the stories often rely for meaning and clarity on the assumption that the reader knows more than is the Koran. Indeed, if one does not know more than what is in the Koran, one is left baffled. Why is this so for a text which is claimed to be perfect?The rule of abrogation and the claim that Islam is a religion of peaceThe attentive reader of the text will be struck by contradicitions (Muslims Scholars vary on the numbers, ranging from 5 - 250 or so contradictions). Leaving aside the allowing and then disallowing alcohol, the famous Medina Sura of the sword (when the messenger was poweful and strong) is often contrasted with the religious tolerance of the Meccan (when the messenger was in a weak position politically) sura. The scholars well aware of these contraditions propose the rule of abrogation usually simplified to the later sura knocks out the earlier one. The problem with the Sura of the Sword is that is the later one and its encouraging the slaughter of the infidel should logically abrogate the tolerant and earlier Meccan one. My reading outside the Qur'an on the opinions of muslims scholars on this point have not given me a good answer to this. Logically, the claim that islam is a religion of peace is a claim to be proven.The key underpinning of Islam is one of recapitulation and clarity?The frequent references to the Jewish stories together with the key Jewish prophets, the support for the Torah and for the gospel (noting here that Jesus is really a cardboard cut our figure in the Qur'an) leads one to legitimately to ask the question: what is the purpose of this text?If the purpose is one of recapitulation, it fails. Whilst the Meccan suras are pleasing and rightfully proclaim the grandeur of God, the derivative nature of the rest of the material, the fact that the recyled material is re-told in a manner which is less clear and less satisfying than as told in the Jewish scriptures, the fact that the content of the gospel is completely lost means that the claim that this book is a clear recapitualtion of what God had formally revealed before the messenger is utterly preposterous!"},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"If some salesman personally known by a Moslem today were to claim that they received a book from an Angel, they would be laughed to scorn. The salesman's reason for making such a claim would be attributed to some wild business scheme to be pulled on the foolish and credulous. Why, oh why, do they then believe the same claim when made by some salesman they do not know and never met (Muhammed), who lived hundreds of years ago? It is a fact that it is just as easy to tell a big lie as a small one.Leaving aside this question why anyone would be so uncritical as to believe that this book was given to a carpet salesman (Muhammed) by an angel when there is no more proof for that assertion than for Joseph Smith's assertion that an angel did the same for him (and history reports at least another half dozen claims by men claiming to receive books from angels. They might just as well have claimed that they received gift fruit baskets instead of books. The absurdity is the same), one would only wonder at a book whose effects upon the ignorant is to lead them to attempt mass murders, destroy democracies, kill innocent lives, stone women and children to death, erase all art and music, rob humanity of the most innocent of joys, and become the biggest threat to peace in the last hundred years if it were not for the fact that the reasons for this are easily found within these pages. One doesn't have to read very far in this volume before noting the profound barbarianism of the author and, by implication, anyone who takes this literally.

What would be left would be a horror that would be the dream of those fanatics who hate life and embrace the skeletal arms of death. There are people who want war in the name of this book. For those who love freedom and life, it may be time to give it to them and to give it to them with the same fierceness that they are willing to do so in the name of the god they believe mirrors their own depraved, twisted, and poisonous minds.

All it consists of is words from Muhammed (or people who wrote the book and claimed to be Muhammed) with words and truths from the Old Testament mixed in. Those who study religion should know of J. Smith who founded Mormonism. He, like Muhammed, took the faith that was passed down from the Jews and Christianity, and whipped up his own religion, and just like Muhammed, claimed revelations from an angel as backing for his heretical views.When it comes down to it, anyone could do what Muhammed did and rewrite Sacred Scripture in their own words.

Also there is the blatant errors of ancient cosmology which are proof in themselves that this and other religions are anything but divinely inspired. So, do I have contempt for religion? Yes.

Without the Arabic beside the English it has a slight drawback, however the index more than makes up for any problems, making it easy to search for your favorite subject, may it be slavery, war, or Jihad.

When read in the ancient texts, the same friend (head of the Muslim Student Association at Rice University) also let me know that the Quran, Hebrew Bible, and Christian New Testament all read with the same literary style. This is a very accessible translation that keeps the poetic style intact, but there are better embodiments of the grace of this Holy Book.That aside, I was surprised at how similar the Quran wa to the Biblical scriptures. The stories can almost invariably be found in the Bible, with additional interpretation and context given by Muhammad's revelations. The identity of God moves from One to Three in the New Testament, then to One almost as 'We' in the Quran. I doubt that this is the tone of the original work, but at times God sounds very much like the Borg in Star Trek, speaking with all of his angels simultaneously. I was also surprised as to just how much of a place Jesus has in the Quran.Definitely worth reading.

Yusuf Ali is *soft* in his rendering, and you're going to need supporting books like the Tafsirs, Hadiths, and Sira to get as much understanding of Mohammad as possible. Make no mistake, Islam is Mohammad and his belief system. Know the man behind the cloak of this religion, and you'll have a far better understanding of the images coming out of Islam on a daily basis. A Koran might be a gateway, but it will not bring you to understand Mohammad's character; that will be more clearly revealed by his Sunnah.Good luck, and fasten your seatbelts; it's a very bumpy ride."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"If you're going to read the Koran in English, this is certainly the translation to get: Penguin's Dawood translation. Among students of Middle Eastern affairs, it has a reputation as being both clear and accurate.I read somewhere that 1 out of every 5 sentences in the Koran is gobbledy-gook. Perhaps this is true; if it is, there's hardly anything Dawood, or any faithful translator, can do about it. But Dawood's lucid style and natural-sounding prose will reduce any necessary strain to a minimum.This is, by the way, the Koran that Robert Spencer recommends reading for clarity and accuracy. Here are some quotes about it from hisThe Complete Infidel's Guide to the Koran:\\"Some people -- both Muslim and non-Muslim -- dislike it because Dawood uses \\"God\\" for Allah, although since Arabic-speaking Christians use 'Allah' for the God of the Bible\\" (p. 19)\\"[This] translation is the most smoothly readable English translation.\\" (p. 19)\\"Dawood generally doesn't whitewash the Koran's more jarring passages.\\" (p. 20)\\"Many Muslims dislike this translation simply because Dawood was not a Muslim.\\" (p. 20)Four other advantages of this edition:1. There are footnotes at the bottom of every page keyed to anything confusing in the text above.2. Dawood avoids the high-blown style and Biblical rhetoric that plague so many other translations (e.g., M. M. Pickthalls'). \\"If thou hast obeyed, thou wouldst . . . \\" becomes \\"If you obeyed, you would . . .\\" This makes things a deal easier for you if it's your first time reading the thing.3. Resilient binding.4. The introduction isn't worth mentioning, but there is a helpful index.Here's Wikipedia about the translator:\\"Nessim Joseph Dawood was born in 1927 to an Iraqi Jewish family in Baghdad, Iraq. He emigrated to England in 1945 as an Iraq State scholar, and settled there. He graduated from the University of London. He is known for his English translations of the Qur'an, Tales from the One Thousand and One Nights, and his edition of the Muqaddimah of Ibn Khaldun. Dawood's translation of the Qur'an, titled 'The Koran', was at one time the world's best-selling English translation of the Qur'an. In the first edition of his translation of the Qur'an, in 1956, Dawood rearranged the chapters (suras) into more-or-less chronological order, as to make it easier to determine which verses are abrogated. Later editions restored the traditional sequence of publishing the surahs in order of length.\\"This Penguin edition, by the way, is the latter."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"I commend Mr.Dawood on his efforts to translate the Quran from Arabic to English, which is no easy task by any means. I don't purport to suggest that Mr.Dawood may have missed some critical meanings in his translation on purpose, but rather out of an unbridged gap between English and Arabic words, and how they relate in context. I am a Muslim, and I speak, read, and write Arabic fluently. I have excellent command of the language, as well as English too. Overall, the translation does an adequate job. However, allow me to point out one critical example that was not translated correctly. In the chapter of Women, verse 34, he quotes \\"Men have authority over women because God has made the one superior to the other...\\". He uses the word \\"Superior\\" to explain the parallel Arabic word \\"Qawamoon\\". In fact, \\"Qawamoon\\" doesn't mean \\"Superior\\", it means \\"have been charged with\\" or \\"are responsible for\\". There is no parallel in the Arabic text that mentions anything about men having authority over women either. The full context should come out to mean that: Men are responsible for taking care of women, rather than saying men are superior to women. In other words, men are required to work and maintain a comfortable living status for their wives and families. A woman can work if she desires, but she is not required to spend her money on supporting the family if her husband works. God has released her from that obligation, but if she chooses to support the family, along with her man, she can do that too. Two very different concepts. The Arabic word that matches \\"Superior\\" is any derivative of the Arabic root \\"Fadl\\", which means: better, superior, favorable. Hence: Afdal, Mufaddaloon, or Mufaddaleen. God makes no distinction between Men and Women; neither one is superior to the other, but rather complementary to one another.My advice to any person who cannot read Arabic is to read the Quran translation as a topical, overall, and extremely generalized translation. It is the little details, such as the one I mentioned above, and how they're understood, that are critical in forming an opinion. This translation is full of such examples.In conclusion, a translation of the Quran should never be the goal to understanding Islam, but rather a vehicle to take towards understanding it. Understanding the true tenets of Islam for Non-Muslims can come from learning Arabic or speaking with a learned Muslim. I wish I can recommend a more accurate translation, but I am still searching for one myself."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"While reading _The Koran_, I found myself shifting back and forth between two reactions. On the one hand, the message of the book, particularly in this literal translation, comes off as a bleak outlook on humanity's ability to live with one another. The \\"infidels\\" are consistently attacked in _The Koran_ and those who believe in the \\"true God\\" are encouraged to cut off relations with the \\"unbelievers\\" and, if necessary, even take up arms against them in the name of this \\"God.\\" Of course, the term \\"unbelievers\\" is not simply an attack on atheism. Rather, it is an attack on those who do not follow the teachings of _The Koran_ and Islam. Reading this text through, I found myself having trouble digesting all of the violent language, language that is repeated endlessly to drive a certain mantra home.On the other hand, despite the numerous violent passages and threats contained in these pages, there are also passages of poetic beauty that arise out of these dark pages like rays of sunshine:\\"This present life is like the rich garments with which the earth adorns itself when watered by the rain\\" (149).Thus, like many primary religious texts, _The Koran_ offers diverse and conflicting viewpoints that allow for an entire people to find meaning in life. I will not comment on this text regarding its religious content. That is not my aim. But I believe that reading _The Koran_ can be a beneficial activity for the religious and secular alike. For the religious, it provides another spiritual interpretation of the monotheistic tradition, an interpretation that may inspire those searching for meaning or help flesh out the spiritual gaps of the particular religions they practice. For the secular, studying any primary religious text can help bring one into a deeper understanding of that religion and its followers.For both of these aims, N.J. Dawood's translation will prove useful as it appears to be a fairly literal translation. While lacking the poetic sense of some other translations I have seen, this version makes up for its wooden translation by adhering to descriptive meaning."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"The Penguin Classic translation of the Koran by Daewood differs considerably from other versions.

Most notably, Daewood translates Sura 6 (\\"The Women\\") as recommending that a husband beat an \\"uppity\\" wife. Elsewhere, Mohammed seems to recommend extermination of Islam's enemies, including Jews. To be sure, there are other passages which ameliorate such injunctions, but for a non-Muslim, non-Arabic speaker, the issue is not so much whether Mohammed is right or wrong, but whether the Arabic original actually says what Daewood puts into English.When I first looked into this book, I thought that Daewood was an English name, but apparently it is transliterated Arabic and Daewood is a Muslim. Hence, to the extent that the translation says thing which would make a modern non-Muslim cringe, one suspects that the translation is accurate. But of course \\"statement against interest\\" is a very weak reed upon which to base a conclusion about the accuracy of the translation. At least it is worth noting that Daewood's translation seems both more readable and more idiomatic than other versions of the Koran which I have browsed."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"I have been a Muslim for 10+ years and have used various Quarans. Dagwood's translation is so easy to read and allows one to \\"visualize\\" the events as well as the overall message.

I highly recommend that this is the Koran to purchase!"},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"This translation is [not expensive], but you get what you pay for.Because I was curious about Islam, I decided to read the book that lies at its core, the Qur'an. I picked up this English translation which is the one most readily available in the US. I tried twice, 11 years apart, to read this translation and neither time got even half way through. I could not for the life of me understand how or why 1 billion of the world's people loved this book, and concluded that the admonition that the Qur'an can only be read in Arabic must be true and something must get seriously lost in translation.Then recently I discovered Muhammad Asad's \\"The Message of the Qur'an\\". I've only read 3 sura (chapters) so far but I am beginning to see what all the fuss is about. I'm finally gaining some insight into Islam and finding the Qur'an fascinating. Asad's translation is much longer, much heavier, and much more expensive, but if you want to gain some understanding of the Qur'an, not just make fun of it or use it to insult different beliefs, the Asad translation is very much worth the expense. His footnotes are extensive and very helpful. The Asad translation makes sense to a Westerner and does not leave you scratching your head like Dawood's."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"After reading this translation, I knew something was wrong, i've read the koran before but never found it to be so bad. Then after doing some research found out that this is a propagandistic version written by a non muslim(mr. Dawood is acutally Jewish i found out). Many passages are poorly translated(i believe purposely), to give the worst view possible about islam. You would be better off reading any version other than this(also like the plague, to avoid anything written by Robert Spencer, who also spews propaganda against Islam, and is a well known Isamophobe). If you want a Well written translation of the Koran that is easy to read, I would highly recommend Quran by Yahya Emerick.

More credit can be given to the good introduction of this book which is informative to those who aren't acquainted with the divine nature of this Koran or Quran, as well as the simple and effective blurb on the back of the book.This Koran translation/interpretation reads like a good novel and is likely to spark more interest for the first time reader than some of the more detailed interpretations/translations of the Koran because of this. If you wish for a more detailed version of the Koran/Quran in English than I suggest you go for \\"The Holy Koran Interpreted by S.V. Mir Ahmed Ali\\" or \\"Quran: The Final Testament, Authorized English Version with Arabic Text, Revised Edition IV by Rashad Khalifa\\" as these two versions capture the scientific knowledge [proof of divine authorship] of the Quran as these translations were performed with the foresight of knowing about modern day science and it being contained in the Koran/Quran. This is lacking (scientific interpretation) in Abdullah Yusuf Ali's outstanding but some what dated translation.Despite what the academics say about this translation it is published by a western publisher and will find its way into the hearts of non-Muslims probably more readily than most other copies of the Koran as it is also available in a Penguin classics version [some bookstores have an entire shelf dedicated to Penguin classics] with parallel Arabic text.It was my first copy of the Koran which I obtained when I was in year 3 and will always be special to me [back then it had a different cover and was the only available copy in the country]. The Koran/Quran is also mathematically composed as further evidence that it is a speech from God/Allah.P.S: Rashad Khalifa left out two verses in Surah/Chapter 9:128-129 of the Koran/Quran for good reason. I was always taught that two false verses were injected into the Koran/Quran by bad people and his translation provides evidence why they don't belong there. I was taught this before seeing Dr. Khalifa's evidence."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"This book is much too violent and very cruel. As an infidel, I was personally horrified by its passages. However, it gives a good understanding for the conflict in the Middle East."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"The Bible, Bhagavad Gita, Dhammapada (Buddhist) scrptures will all elevate anyone who bothers to study them. THIS, however, is so devoid of any spiritual content that it is absolutely stunning that anyone could declare this to be the word of God - any god! This is a scripture so crass, so vulgar, so lacking in spiritual inspiration that only a threat of decapitation (the preferred method of converting the infidels) could get me to take it seriously. Why is anyone supposed to think that this came from an angel? Did Mohammed perform miracles? No. Did he live an exemplary life that inspires? No (unless you think an adulterous, murderous conqueror is worthy of emulation). Do his followers live such industrious, peaceful, loving lives that one wishes to know their secret? No, a thousand times no. Is the text itself proof of its supposedly divine origin? Far from it - errors and abominations are evident throughout (polygamy, murder of unbelievers, extra taxing of christians, anti-semitism, etc). A faith that \\"converts\\" by giving people a choice of death or conversion hasn't the most basic understanding that religion is in the heart and not on the lips. Look at the countries ruled by Islam and see what life is like. Then, look at those that have gone through the protestant reformation. It is clear that this book is a death sentence for freedom, women's rights, freedom of thought, happiness, freedom of religion, gentle spirituality, science, etc. That is why followers have nothing left to do but blow themselves up. Their countries and culture are dying - left stuck in the middle ages and there is no way out as long as this book is ruling over them. The arab countries must either give up Islam or give up any relevance in the modern world. All that is left them to do is to strike out in a desperate, frustrated, hate filled last stand against modernity before they sink into total irrelevance."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"One of the questions which puzzled the ancient Arabs was, \\"Where did the sun go when night time came?\\" The Qur'an gave them Allah's answer.He [i.e. Zul-qarnain] followed, until he reached the setting of the sun. He found it set in a spring of murky water.(Surah XVIII ( Kahf) vs. 85-86)We agree with Muslim scholars that Zul-qarnain refers to Alexander the Great (see Yusuf Ali's appendix on this subject in his translation of the Qur'an). According to this surah, Alexander the Great traveled west until he found out what happened to the sun. It went down into and under the murky waters of a pond. When it was completely covered by the water, darkness fell upon the earth.To the early Muslims, this surah gave the divine answer as to why darkness fell when the sun set in the West. They assumed that the sun, like the moon, was the size perceived by the human eye, about the size of a basketball. Darkness came when with a mighty hissing roar it went down under the dark waters of a pond. They boldly and proudly proclaimed that this marvelous answer proved that the Qur'an was indeed the Word of God.Today, modern Muslims are quite embarrassed by this passage and try to ignore it or to quickly dismiss it as poetry. But the passage is not part of a poem. Thus it cannot be dismissed as figurative language or poetic license. In the context, it is part of a historical narrative which relates several historical incidences in the life of Alexander the Great.The mistake was based on the erroneous assumption that the earth was flat. The authors of the Qur'an did not know that the earth was a sphere which revolved around the sun."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"1. It has a picture of pretty rugs on the cover.

Another translation to consider is M.A.S. Abdel Haleem's Oxford University Press edition: it is less literal, but makes for smoother reading. All of the other \\"literal\\"-style translations are simply a waste of time, as they are so awkwardly done that you won't know whether to laugh or cry."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"Dawood, a translator of Arabic folklore (like One Thousand and One Nights) seems more interested in preserving the grandeur of the phrases than transmitting the true meaning of the text. Dawood often distorts the message. He turns observations about wartime activity into commands of aggression. He transforms passages regarding the natural love between husband and wife into suggestions that women are soley for a man's pleasure.Those who want to appreciate the poetry are best off reading the orginal Arabic (or buying a taped version so they can listen to it without having to learn Arabic) Those who are interested in a translation that preserves the beauty of the language and an accompanying in depth explanation should read \\"The Message of the Quran\\" by Muhammad Asad. By virtue of being a translation, it too has its faults, but it considered the best thing short of learning Arabic."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"Mr. Dawood is a Jewish Iraqi scholar who came to England after World War II. He has a command of both Arabic and English, which makes this translation much more readable than others by people less fluent in English.Unfortunately, it is also inaccurate. I can read but not understand any but the most basic Arabic, but when Sura 7, verse 31 starts \\"Ya baani Aadamaa\\", I understand it immediately as \\"O children of Adam\\", whereas Dawood (mis)translates it as \\"O children of Allah\\". I find this fundamental inaccuracy perplexing in a native Arabic-speaker, and am concerned about what more subtle mistranslations (poetic license?) lurk that can alter the meaning and interpretation of th Quran.The translations most commonly read by muslims in the US (I would guess the majority of them do not understand Arabic either, and thus depend on translations, like myself) are those by Marmaduke Pickthall and Yusuf Ali. If you want to get a feeling of the \\"style\\" of the Quran (which is very different from the Ancient Testament, itself very different from the New Testament, let alone Buddhist Sutras or other sacred texts), this translation will do fine. If the details and nuances matter, do yourself a favor, and get one of those. They may be slightly harder reading, but they are also much more accurate translations by mainstream muslims (Pickthall was a British convert). They can also be found online, for instance on www.sacred-texts.com."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"Dawood's 1956 translation of the Qur'an has seen several editions and revisions, and many printings by Penguin Books. It's not the most popular, nor the most esteemed by academics, but has sold well and endured so presumably is seen by most Arabic linguists as reasonably accurate to the original text. I can't personally confirm the accuracy of translation, as despite having worked in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states my Arabic language skills remain basic and not up to the task.For the curious reader unfamiliar with the Qur'an, this might be a good place to start as this edition is inexpensive, light and portable, and easy to read. The pages lack the extensive footnotes and commentaries found in more scholarly translations but this is no disadvantage to the reader who simply wants to read the text and get a flavour of the message.As many readers will know, the Qur'an was originally \\"revealed\\" (or \\"channelled\\") in episodic bite-sized chunks known as \\"Suras\\", variously written down on palm leaves, pieces of cloth or stones, or simply committed to memory. The original Kufic script used to write all this down contained very limited vocabulary and no vowels, so various interpretations are possible and recognised by scholars as of equal merit. This is in contrast to for example the Old Testament mainly written in Hebrew, a very precise language allowing little nuance or ambiguity, and the New Testament written mainly in Classical Greek, a language with a huge vocabulary and sophisticated grammatical structure allowing precision of meaning unmatched by any other classical language. Inevitably, the limitations imposed by the ambiguities inherent in the original Kufic script lead many suras in the Qur'an to be given a range of meanings all considered equally valid, so in short, dogmatic insistence on any one meaning would be futile as no-one really knows for sure precisely what they say.The suras were assembled in various random ways until some common agreement was reached under the caliphate of Othman around 650 AD and a kind of \\"authorized\\" order for the 114 chapters was agreed. Dawood abandons this \\"traditional\\" arrangement and changes the order in which the suras are presented according to his own system, beginning with the \\"more biblical and poetic\\" and ending with the \\"much longer and often more topical\\" chapters. His claim is that, like many before him, he has tried to represent the chapters chronologically as they were \\"revealed.\\" He is, of course, absolutely entitled to do this, as at the end of the day the Qur'an does not tell a story, but is a series of pronouncements explained and elaborated on various aspects of how you should live and what you should believe, so as with the Kufic translations, any order of presentation is as good as any other.On the content, many readers unfamiliar with the Qur'an may be surprised, even shocked by the frequently bloodthirsty and violent narratives threatening damnation and torment for unbelievers in contrast to eternal rewards for those who accept the message and do God's will. The text is very simplistic \\"stick & carrot\\" probably because it was aimed originally at an unsophisticated audience and wanted to get the message across. Many suras repeat the texts of various parts of the Hebrew Old Testament verbatim, and some refer to parts of the New Testament. There is a great deal of repetition, especially in the heavenly rewards v infernal damnation department. Some of the suras though are quite poetic, and the whole text much shorter than either of the major parts of the Christian Bible. Everyone should read the Qur'an at least once, and due to its brevity and pocket-size portability, this is a good edition to consider if you want to buy one."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"An excellent translation of the Muslim's Holy Book. More than a rich works of poetry, this is a call to seeing the world of truth as perceived through the mind of the God Allah of Islam. Where unblemished nubiles wear raiments of flowing silk, where crystal-clear streams of water flow through golden sands, where we prostrate ourselves before Allah, a God more powerful than any man or idol, and where we take up shining arms in defense of our Faith- this is Islam.One of the most important aspects of critical exegesis which is most commonly overlooked is the ordering of passages in a manuscript. This Penguin Classics Revised edition excels not only in the linguistic translation, but also in its ordering of the chapters, which is not only justified, but very effective.What most Westerners do not understand about Islam is how deep it goes, from the Sufi mystics to the reasons for its cultural mores. Muslims are perhaps one of the largest group of scapegoated and misunderstood peoples in the world, when in fact with the Koran they hold a spirituality which begs for commonality, community, peace and brotherhood. While the mistreatment of women by a few selected Muslims needs correction, true Islam is meant to protect the sanctity of womanhood, and to respect woman's most private natures, not to abuse them and make them public pop-culture property as we have in the West.I am not trying to convince you of Allah's might, nor of its truth. That is for you to experience and decide, or to not. But only in being familiar with the Koran and the world of Islam will you be qualified to discuss its worth, or possible problems."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"Following the 7/7 London suicide bombings there were several articles in British newspapers by British Muslims saying that the bombers were not \\"true Muslims\\" as there is nothing in the Koran to justify such actions. Following the attempted bombings of 2 weeks later, it was reported that one of the failed bombers told his neighbour: \\"If a man dies loyal to Allah, he gets 80 virgins and goes to paradise\\". I decided to read the Koran for myself.Here's what it says about fighting. \\"Slay them wherever you find them. Fight against them till idolatry is no more and God's religion reigns supreme\\" (Sura 2:190), \\"Seek out your enemies relentlessly\\" (4:103), \\"Make war on them till idolatry shall cease and God's religion shall reign supreme\\" (8:36), \\"When the sacred months are over slay the idolaters wherever you find them. Arrest them, beseige them and lie in ambush everywhere for them\\" (9:5), \\"Believers, make war on the infidels who dwell around you\\" (9:121), \\"When you meet the unbelievers on the battlefield strike off their heads\\" (47:3), \\"Prophet, make war on the unbelievers and the hypocrites and deal sternly with them. Hell shall be their home, evil their fate\\" (66:7).For those that may not be up for the fight, there are words of encouragement: \\"Fighting is obligatory, much as you dislike it\\" (2:216), \\"Believers who stay at home are not equal to those that fight for the cause of God\\" (4:93), God's will is mentioned in Sura 8:12 as \\"Give courage to the believers. I shall cast terror into the hearts of the infidels. Strike off their heads, strike off the very tips of their fingers\\", \\"If you do not fight He will punish you sternly and replace you by other men\\" (9:37).Should a believer decide not to fight: \\"Anyone who turns their backs on infidels on the march, except for tactical reasons, will go to Hell\\" (8:12), \\"If anyone thinks that God will not give victory to His apostle in this world and the world to come, let him tie a rope to the ceiling of his house and hang himself\\" (22:14).Now, what about paradise. Apparently the believers are to be treated to \\"goodly mansions\\" (9:72), \\"soft couches, bracelets of gold, garments of fine green silk\\" (18:30), \\"bashful, dark-eyed virgins, as chaste as the sheltered eggs of ostriches\\" (37:48), \\"rivers of purest water, and rivers of milk for ever fresh; rivers of wine delectable to those that drink it, and rivers of clearest honey\\" (47:15), \\"young boys of their own, as fair as virgin pearls\\" (52:13), \\"dark-eyed virgins sheltering in their tents\\" (55:66), \\"jewelled couches and there shall wait on them immortal youths with bowls and ewers and a cup of purest wine\\" (56:6) and \\"they shall be attended by boys graced with eternal youth, who to the beholder's eyes will seem like sprinkled pearls\\" (76:9), \\"high-bosomed maidens for companions\\" (78:31), \\"pure wine to drink, securely sealed, whose very dregs are musk\\" (83:22).One thing I found odd were the references to fine wine in paradise, as Sura 5:90 declares that \\"Wine is an abomination devised by Satan\\".So far, it seemed to me that yes the Koran justifies suicide bombing, and yes there is the bait of virgins in paradise to hook in young men to perform such a deed. But there was more to disturb me!According to Sura 65:4 if a man wishes to divorce his wife and his wife has not started menstruating then he has to wait 3 months. A footnote at the bottom of that page states that child wives were common. It appears then that pedophilia is permissible in Islam, so long as the perpetrator marries his victim. The footnote to Sura 33:50 states that Mohammed had 9 wives, apart from his slave girls; Sura 33:50 states that God gave Mohammed slave-girls as \\"booty\\". (I read in the book \\"Saharasia\\" that one of Mohammed's wives was a 9 year old girl who brought her toys with her when she moved into his tent.) Sura 4:1 states that a man may have up to 4 wives if he treats them equally, but if he can't treat them equally then he can marry any number of slave-girls.The one scrap of positivity I detected in this book was in Sura 51:18 which states that goods should be shared with the beggars and the deprived.Islam now appears to have split itself into sects (Shia, Sunni, Wahhabi). Therefore, according to the Koran, no-one should believe in it because of the following statement: \\"Have nothing to do with those who have split up their religion into sects\\" (6:158). Therefore, according to the Koran, it seems that no-one should have anything to do with Islam. Cool!"},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"I am not an expert in Arabic, but I have read two different translations of the Koran, one by A. J. Arberry and the Penguin classic edition translated by N. J. Dawood. The Penguin edition is far superior in readability, although the basic teachings of the Koran can be recognized from either translation.Most striking to me is how disjointed and random the teachings seem to be in comparison to the Bible (with which I am far more familiar). \\"Love your enemies\\" and \\"Turn the other cheek\\" from the Bible stand in contrast to the more militaristic tone of the Koran which encourages adherents to \\"Make war on them [the unbelievers] until idolatry shall cease and God's religion shall reign supreme\\" (The Spoils, 8:40; see also Prohibition, 66:9). Heaven is pictured as a place of sensuous delights designed especially for men, who \\"shall sit with bashful, dark-eyed virgins, as chaste as the sheltered eggs of ostriches\\" (The Ranks, 37:48). Although women have some protection and rights in the Koran, God has made men superior to women and given men permission to \\"beat them\\" (Women, 4:34 or 4:38 in other translations).There are numerous allusions to people whose names appear also in the Bible, but always with a different slant. Abraham's significant son becomes Ishmael instead of Isaac, and Jesus is mentioned, but his relationship to God as the Son of God is denied (The Believers, 23:91). In stark contrast to the biblical emphasis on salvation by grace through faith (Eph. 2:8-9), the Koran teaches that salvation comes to those whose good deeds weigh heavy on the scales. Those whose deeds are light forfeit their souls and abide in Hell forever (The Believers, 23:104). In the Koran, the earth is created in two days instead of six. Revenge is acceptable. In divorce, he gets the children! Most disturbing, perhaps, are instructions on what to do with those who abandon Islam and have become disbelievers. \\"Do not befriend them,\\" \\"Seize them and put them to death wherever you find them\\" (Women, 4:90). The Koran does, indeed, make for significant reading."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"I rarely write these types of things, however I'm prompted to do so by the several other fanatical outings posted here by individuals spouting blind ideology rather than anything resembling a book review. I'd just like to state for the record that this seems like the wrong place to try and espouse your biased viewpoints, as a street corner seems a more appropriate venue for the types of rantings some have felt compelled to subject us to here.That being said, I have found the Dawood translation of the Qur'an to be concise, clear, and to the best of my limited knowledge, a good translation to turn to for the Western student seeking to begin to understand the vast complexities of Islamic thought and from whereupon they originate. As it states in the book's preface, Dawood's translation is the first in contemporary English, published in 1956 and since selling over a million copies world-wide. He has also in more recent years worked to contribute Arabic translations both ways, from English to Arabic and vice-versa, and has adapted children's stories from the Arabian Nights as well as contribute to specialized English-Arabic dictionaries, giving his translation a fair bit of weight in my opinion. I'm uninformed as to how the Arabic-speaking Muslim world feels about this particular translation, but for someone with little to no background in Islam, it's written as cleanly and as easily as any of the other great religious literary works of history. Coupled with work from Rahman, Lapidus, or others, one can begin to put things into perspective as to the meaning of the surahs, and the historical context that the words of the prophet Muhammad were born of. In all, I would recommend this translation to anyone seeking to begin to garner knowledge about the 1.5 billion Muslims in the world, and how they structure their belief system. This belief system fundamentally begins with the Qur'an, which was reputed to have been delivered as the inalterable word of God to the Prophet Muhammad via the Angel Gabriel between the years 610-632 CE. Existing for some years as a purely oral tradition, the Qur'an was conscripted by the Caliph 'Uthman a few decades after the prophet's death, and has been altered only to allow for slight changes in grammar and spelling since, in it's original Arabic. Therefore, one can hope that in even this English translation, as much as possible the mood, inflection and tones are as close as they possibly can be to the original text, and Dawood seems to have the apt translation skills enough to get it across to the Western reader as it was meant to be heard.Back to the previous point concerning religion, it seems that in this modern period with its many complexes and problems, understanding can only be reached through a pro-active effort to comprehend the varied and sometimes strange (to the uninitiated) beliefs, delivered from history to the present, of our fellow co-inhabitants on this planet. The disdain, ignorance, and spitefulness exhibited by some of the other review critiques here is completely unacceptable, and only serves to widen the gulf between people and views until that gulf is uncrossable and untenable. As concerns the modern dilemma revolving around \\"radical\\" Islam and the self-righteous fervor it has ignited in the West, I'd like to point out that Western cultural hegemony and imperialism in various formats, coupled with extreme prejudice towards foreign beliefs and practices, has undoubtedly helped to land us in the predicament we face today. However, people with any grasp of history know that nothing is that easy to sum up, but my own personal feeling is that trying to use a verse from the Bible to refute a verse from the Qur'an is, historically speaking of course, idiocy in the highest degree."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"I am in no position to judge the value of this particular translation. I read the first edition before the revisions were made. As a person coming from a Mormon background, I find this book to be structured like the Doctrine and Covenants, a Mormon scriptural book that consists of a series of revelations given to Joseph Smith in Kirtland and elsewhere. Here we have a series of revelations given to Mohammed in Mecca and Medina. The book is extraordinarily repetitious. Certain standard phrases appear again and again. I see no more reason to be upset about this book than about the Smith book. Either one believes it or one does not. There is no need to have a cow over it. In past centuries the Europeans referred to \\"the Alcoran of the impostor Mahomet\\" in sneering terms. Thanks to the events happening since 2000, there has arisen a sharp increase in Islamophobia in the West. I am writing this a day after the Toulouse event. One can hardly be objective about the Koran or Islam. In 1966-67, I lived for more than a year in Morocco, a beautiful and fascinating country. The people liked the Americans in those days. I came near to the entrance of an Islamic shrine and saw a sign saying \\"Interdit chiens et Juifs\\" but otherwise things were cool, except for a few Jews lynched here and there during the 1967 war. I saw the last Jews in Rabat before they fled to Israel, a Gypsy-looking lot who shouted \\"Auschwitz\\" at me as I passed through the Mellah (ghetto). I suppose they thought I was a German tourist. My introduction to Islam was pleasant enough and I cannot draw a connection between the terrorists of today and the Moroccans of 1967. The Koran is not an evil book, nor is Islam a cult."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"I equate a lack of knowledge of the Koran on the same level as a lack of knowledge of the Bible (as far as a world literary perspective goes.) A huge percentage of the world's population takes this as their scriptures and to judge those people without first reading this book is the height of ignorance. It is a fascinating read. If I had any bone to pick with this edition (usually I love the Penguin translations and they are extremely trustworthy) it would be that it is written in modern english. It is probably just a personal problem but I prefer to read books of this type in King James english. However not even knowing if there is a reliable translation of that type available, I would still recommend this book and edition."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"I got this for Christmas one year as a gift (I had asked for it) because I am somewhat of a student of religion. I like to at least have an idea what the other religions say. So I don't necessarily read them in a \\"religious\\" way or as a 'religious' text. I read it as a 'novel' more than anything. Having said that, I am glad I read it. It (at least this translation) is clear reading, easy to understand, and a very good read. I, like others, don't know how good or bad the translation is as I only own this one copy. But if the main nuts and bolts of Islam are there, I will take it. I would eagerly urge anyone to read this (the Koran in general if not this one in particular) just so one can have an understanding of Islam. Most of our problems stem from ignorance, and if we take the time to listen to what others have to say, even if we do not agree with them, then perhaps this would be a better world to live in."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"Now, regarding the Quran and other scriptures, you know from the start it's going to be a slow read. Writers like Mohammed, St Paul, and others were not word-savvy and couldn't make a gripping read like Ian Fleming, JK Rowling, or Jean Auel. Nor did they care: their mission was to &quot;speak God's word&quot; not to entertain their converts.Nevertheless, when I picked up this book, I soon realized that even Mohammed was better with words than this. He was, after all, an Arab, and the Arabs has long cherished the word as art (hence their beautiful calligraphy and poetry). But this book was beyond dry. Even though I was prepared for repetitious narrative, like that in the Bible, I seriously felt like I was reading a telephone book.

I immediately dropped it and went for a better translation."},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"As an Albanian Kosovar, first of all I am an European then a Muslim so nothing like middle-east people - a fact that makes me think that we're more devoted to God then them because in comparison with them we don't do bad things in the name of God and then claim false excuses as some horrible so-called muslims do. I mean according to the Koran I've read people like those who we see in the news will swallow fires into their bellies because they are evil and they just want to justify their ugly deeds by the Holy Book Koran. That's such a crime and I wish people like that all get hugged by the long and unescapable arms of LAW in this life as in the other life they will surely belong to hell for their evil actions against a peaceful and civilised world.The proof that Koran isn't what the terrorists claim is that since I've read it I've become a different person. I was empathic,peace loving person, good doer to anyone no matter rich or poor, ugly or beautiful - now I am more empathic, and a better person than I ever was and my love for people regardless their religion or beliefs is stronger than ever before. Before I was terrified by the thunder now after I've read the Koran I don't close the curtains and hide from the lightning. I praise God for that and I find a tremendous joy seeing it. Then, I used to get disguisted by almost everything, now I don't make funny faces when I see someone eating lemon like an apple. I have been blessed in so many ways since I've read the Koran.The Koran is a book of God, so anyone who reads it and understands it as it is not as you would want it to be - will find an enormous joy in life just as I did.Before I give you some sayings that I took from Koran, I'd like to say that the translation wasn't that bad as some people claimed. &quot;Man are impatient&quot; - says God so perhaps that was the reason why they were so fast with their judgements.&quot;God does not love evil doers&quot; - 3:51&quot;Speak for Justice even if it affects your own kinsmen&quot; 6:149&quot;Help one another in what is good and pious not in what is wicked and sinful&quot; 5:1&quot;God desires no injustice in mankind&quot; 3:109Basically, Koran is filled with beautiful and extremely smart saying such as those that I have mentioned...therefore Koran is a delight to the people who feel they have gaps in their lives.Enjoy"},{"Title":"The Koran","review":"i am a muslim myself. I have read the 'real' Koran several times and have much of it memorized. Muslims around the world take pride in the fact that the Koran can never be really translated, that its that unique. Well now i know they have a point. It's like a translation of a fine work of poetry. It simply can not capture the true beauty or depth of the Koran. I have read several other arabic books translated in english in both languages and i can assure you that those translations are fine, they manage to capture the beauty that is portrayed. The Koran is a magnificent holy book, unfortunately this translation gives it a poor image and does not understand what the Koran really says.

Why does the koran have no prophecy? Yes thats right..NO PROPHECY! You find 1/3 of the Bible has prophetic statements that predict the rise and fall of empires and nations. It calls a Persian king by name (Cyrus) and predicts that he will reign hundreds of years before he was even born. It predicts the fall of cities like Tyre, Nineveh, Babylon, etc. Its historical accuracy is validated by archeology time and time again.I ask again...why does the koran have no Prophecy? BECAUSE IT IS CAME FROM ONLY A MAN - NOT FROM GOD!!! If allah is a true God and the koran is the \\"final revelation\\" to man....then why would this god allah not tell us what is going to happen in the future? Why does the koran not have in it writings like the Book of Revelation in the New Testament? Christians know what is going to happen soon on the world scene because of the Bible's Prophetic content.My poor Muslims...your god is a weak dead god who cannot see into the future.

He found it set in a spring of murky water.(Surah XVIII ( Kahf) vs. 85-86)We agree with Muslim scholars that Zul-qarnain refers to Alexander the Great (see Yusuf Ali's appendix on this subject in his translation of the Qur'an). According to this surah, Alexander the Great traveled west until he found out what happened to the sun. It went down into and under the murky waters of a pond. When it was completely covered by the water, darkness fell upon the earth.To the early Muslims, this surah gave the divine answer as to why darkness fell when the sun set in the West. They assumed that the sun, like the moon, was the size perceived by the human eye, about the size of a basketball. Darkness came when with a mighty hissing roar it went down under the dark waters of a pond. They boldly and proudly proclaimed that this marvelous answer proved that the Qur'an was indeed the Word of God.Today, modern Muslims are quite embarrassed by this passage and try to ignore it or to quickly dismiss it as poetry. But the passage is not part of a poem. Thus it cannot be dismissed as figurative language or poetic license. In the context, it is part of a historical narrative which relates several historical incidences in the life of Alexander the Great.The mistake was based on the erroneous assumption that the earth was flat. The authors of the Qur'an did not know that the earth was a sphere which revolved around the sun."},{"Title":"The Gospel of the Holy Twelve (Dodo Press)","review":"I had bought this book a while back and dismissed it as a hoax without really examining its contents. But upon careful review of the passages in the text, I am convinced that this is the unadulterated text before it was edited by the \\"correctors\\" for their own selfish means and motives. I present the following evidence:I have cited the following passages from the book which bear close resemblance to the Gospel of Thomas. Now bear in mind, this book was published in 1892 and the sayings of the Gospel of Thomas were made available in 1945 and a small selection found in 1897. Therefore, the author could not have quoted form the Gospel of Thomas since it was not in existence when the Gospel of the Holy Twelve was published.1) \\"And I say unto you, Except ye fast from the world and its evil ways, ye shall in no wise find the Kingdom; and except ye keep the Sabbath and cease your haste to gather riches, ye shall not see the Father-Mother in heaven.\\" (Lection XXVI, Gospel of the Holy Twelve)\\"If you do not fast from the world, you will not find the Kingdom. If you do not observe the Sabbath as Sabbath, you will not see the Father.\\" (Saying 27, Gospel of Thomas, 1897)2) \\"And Jesus said, I stood in the midst of the world, and in the flesh was I seen and heard, and I found all men glutted with their own pleasures, and drunk with their own follies, and none found I hungry or athirst for the wisdom which is of God. My soul grieveth over the sons and daughters of men because they are blind in their heart, and in their soul are they deaf and hear not my voice.\\" (Lection LXXXVIII, Gospel of the Holy Twelve)\\"I took my stand in the midst of the world, and I appeared to them in flesh. I found them all drunk yet none of them thirsty. My soul ached for the children of humanity because they are blind in their hearts and do not see.\\" (Saying 28, Gospel of Thomas, 1945)3) \\"And he said unto them, Blessed are they who suffer many experiences, for they shall be made perfect through suffering.\\" (Lection XXXVII, Gospel of the Holy Twelve)\\"Blessings on the person who has suffered and found life.\\" (Saying 58, Gospel of Thomas, 1945)There are many more sayings on this Gospel that has parallels to the Gospel of Thomas, proving that the former is the authentic gospel preached by Christ and only fragments and variations of his sayings have come down across the centuries due to suppression and extinction by the institutional Church for its own agenda.Please read this book."},{"Title":"The Gospel of the Holy Twelve (Dodo Press)","review":"It would seem improbable - given the humane instinct of countless Christian saints - that their founder should have had so little to say about the fate of other creatures.In that sense, there might be ample scope for suspicion that the accepted Gospels could have been edited by the type of Christians who tend to take a rather culinary view of non-human beings. If 'Jesus was a Vegetarian' as PETA and others would claim then the Gospel of the Holy Twelve provides an opportunity for today's Christians to approach a fuller concept of the life and spirit of Jesus Christ.However this work (which was first serialised in 1898) has no known manuscript basis and merely develops a theme that the author outlined in preceding publications over a twenty year period. I have traced the Victorian origins of Rev Ouseley's 'gospel' through related tracts and articles which anyone interested may wish to investigate in my own book: 'Familiar Strangers: The Church and the Vegetarian Movement in Britain (1809-2009)'Make of either publication what you will, maybe both texts are 'inspired' in their own way!!!"},{"Title":"The Gospel of the Holy Twelve (Dodo Press)","review":"I really enjoy this book and who knows it might be closer to the truth than we think.

The People -- the characters from another world who populate this book and Henderson's other tales -- are what you might call the gentler, better and more spiritually-developed side of humanity. This first of the People books tells of how the People arrived on Earth; this and subsequent books [No Different Flesh; Holding Wonder] contain loosely-connected stories of how they gradually reunite after having been scattered throughout the southwestern US in their hasty retreat from their disintegrating home planet.The People have wonderfully developed powers that Earth-bound mortals have long dreamed about, such as levitation, mind-reading, fire-making and other such useful accomplishments. You will enjoy the People books more if you have some Biblical knowledge, as there are numerous scriptural references throughout. Emphasis is mostly Old Testament, but the People's motivation closely parallels Christian teachings of love and forgiveness.If you are looking for monsters, mayhem and general weirdness, akip this book.

Ellin would write little and polish a lot. His single annual short story was almost always worth the wait.At about the same time, readers of _Fantasy and Science Fiction_ waited with baited breath for the next story of the People by Zenna Henderson that came at the rate of about one a year. _Pilgrimage: The Book of the People_ (1961) is the first collection of People stories. There are six in all: \\"Ararat\\" (1952), \\"Gilead\\" (1954), \\"Pottage\\" (1955), \\"Wilderness\\" (1957), \\"Captivity\\" (1958), and \\"Jordan\\" (1959).As you may have gathered from the titles, Henderson's stories have thematic connections with the Old Testament. The first story alludes to the ark (spaceship) that set down on the mountain (Earth) in years past. The second story is about the gift of healing (the balm in Gilead). The third is about the importance of birthright and heritage and the dangers of denying them. The fourth is about various ways of wandering in a psychic wilderness. The fifth is about various ways that we may hang our harps by the waters of Babylon. The sixth is about the aching for the promised land.The stories are imbedded in a \\"frame story\\" about a troubled and suicidal young woman named Lea who is helped on the road to recovery by several of the People. Part of her process of recovery is to listen to the tales of the People (alien exiles who have landed in the American midwest). Part of the healing process is symbolized early in the novel when Lea asks permission to wade in the creek. It is a therapeutic experience:Lea sighed, gathered up her skirts and stepped cautiously into the pool. The cold clean bite of the water caught her breath, but she waded deeper. The water crept up to her knees and over them. She stood under the cottonwood tree, waiting, waiting so quietly that the water closed smothly around her legs and she could feel its flow only in the tiny crumblings of sand under her feet. She stood there until another leaf fell, brushed her cheek, slipped down her shoulder and curved over her crumpled blouse, catching briefly in the gathered-up folds of her skirt before it turned a leisurely circle in the shining water. (47)A moment later, Lea falls into the water. Water can heal, Henderson is saying. But first it must be troubled, stirred up. Henderson's People stories are filled with individuals-- sometimes whole communities-- that need need healing. But often there must first be a troubling of the waters. Somebody must step in and upset the status quo, challenge the communal norms. The healer in \\"Gilead\\" who challenges established medical knowledge, the teacher in \\"Pottage\\" who challenges her students to live a life of joy, the outsider in \\"Wilderness\\" who has the gift of shining, the crippled young woman in \\"Captivity\\" who challenges the values of a juvenile delinquent... All are necessary troublers. For only then may the healing begin.How well done is the frame? Well, it's not the greatest thing since Scherazade wove her tales during the Arabian Nights or since Chaucer sent his pilgrims on the road to Canterbury. But it is better than frames used in a lot of other fixup novels of this sort. It does not seem sketchy or artificial.Henderson is sometimes accused of being a bit sentimental in her People stories. I believe that this is an overstatement. But there is a bit of _wholesomeness_ that sometimes wears a little thin. There is a scene in which a young woman named Karen barges into Lea's room and rouses her from sleep. When Lea asks what is the matter, Karen cries out: \\"Nothing's the matter! Oh, come and be joyful!\\" (119) Had I been Lea, I would have been sorely tempted to punch Karen in the snoot. But a complaint about wholesomeness is a small bone to pick. These stories are classics, worthy of being reprinted many times over.This book (or, more precisely, the story \\"Pottage\\") was the basis for a 1972 television movie called _The People_, starring Kim Darby and William Shatner. Frequently, when I make notes of such movies, I also note (a tad grumpily)that the movie is poor or mediocre. Not this time. It was a low-budget production, but it was well-written, well-acted, and with decent special effects. It did a credible job of capturing Henderson's humanistic message. Do yourself a favor and get the movie as well."},{"Title":"Pilgrimage: the book of the people ([Doubleday science fiction])","review":"I know this book is out of stock, but if you enjoy any/allkinds of science fiction, I think you should give ZennaHenderson a try.

One of the pioneering women writers of sci-fi, and a Hugo Award winner, she crafted these beautifully moving stories in the 1950s, all connected here in the framework of a novel, that have the authentic emotional kick of any contemporary novel.Also, forget the weird cover - it's got nothing to do with the events of the book, and way off in its eerie tone.The setting is out west, where lost teenagers and small town teachers find themselves tested and connected in ways they weren't even aware could be. The stories are full of moving scenes of confusion and compassion, and the central theme is of people unfolding into their gifts. Henderson was a teacher herself, and you can feel how she wanted to lift her students out of the limited confines of their doubts and fears.The basis is science fiction, but it plays out more as stories of sensitives, telepathics, and healers discovering how what's tortured them for so long is actually a mark of their gifts.I discovered Henderson when reading up on Alexander Key, who was strongly influenced by Henderson and later wrote \\"Escape to Witch Mountain.\\" It's very much the same story, with the scattered survivors of a UFO crash generations ago trying to find each other in a world that only fears them.Here's an excerpt.***\\"There's a doctor at the Tumble A Ranch,\\" Joel said faintly. \\"He's taking a vacation.\\"\\"Go get him.\\" I held Joel with my eyes. \\"Go as fast as you know how!\\"Joel gulped miserably. \\"Okay.\\"\\"They'll probably have horses to come back on,\\" I said. \\"Don't be too obvious.\\"\\"Okay,\\" and he ran out the door. We heard the thud of his running feet until he was halfway across the schoolyard, then silence. Faintly, seconds later, creek gravel crunched below the hill. I could only guess at what he was doing--that he couldn't lift all the way and was going in jumps whose length was beyond all reasonable measuring.***The name of that story is \\"Pottage,\\" and you can find it online.Here's another excerpt.***\\"No telling how many others there are all over the world waiting to be found.\\"\\"Hiding, you mean,\\" I said. \\"You don't go around asking to be found. Not after the first few reactions you get. Oh, maybe in the first fine flush of discovery you hurry to share the wonder, but you learn quickly enough to hide.\\"***Such longing for connection and understanding is something we can all relate to, and Henderson goes deep in the telling.(There's also a new collection of her stories,Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson.

The immigrants we learned about were from Europe and most of them settled on the East Coast. I was fascinated by these people who were so brave or desperate (or both) that they would abandon their homes, most likely forever, and start all over again in a new country where many of them didn't know anyone, or know how they'd support themselves. It was a terrific gamble but they came in droves. They still do.While Las Vegas isn't known as a destination for immigrants, it has a population as diverse as Los Angeles or New York. How did this happen? The Peoples of Las Vegas, an anthology about some of the groups that populate Las Vegas, takes on this question. Essay by essay, it becomes clear.We start by learning about the Southern Paiutes, the tribe that lived in Las Vegas before it was Las Vegas. Although the lessons in school about the Native Americans didn't hold my interest like the stories about the immigrants did, I found it eye-opening to read about how the Paiutes were captured and sold as slaves to the first European settlers by the Utes, who also lived in the Southwest. Like so many other Native Americans, they ended up on reservations in undesirable conditions, and in recent years have found some success by building and running a casino on their land. It's easy to see how Indian casinos in states without legal gambling are be a goldmine, but I was surprised to discover that the Paiutes' casino was also quite profitable, even so near Las Vegas.Chapters on the Mexicans and the Chinese tell stories of hard work and assimilation. African Americans had to deal with segregation until 1960. We Westerners are often surprised to learn that there was segregation here as well, not just in the South. But while segregation was still the law until 1964, the casinos and hotels ignored the law when it no longer suited them. In other words, it was starting to affect their profits, and had to go whether the lawmakers were ready for desegregation or not. The lawmakers eventually followed the lead of the casinos, something that still holds true in Las Vegas.The chapters on the Italians and the Jews go over familiar ground, since these groups pretty much made Las Vegas the gambling town it is and the stories of gangsters and ruthless businessmen have been told many times. I skimmed these chapters quickly, because it's the underdog aspect of the immigrant stories that always appealed to me. Italian and Jewish immigrants were certainly underdogs in many parts of America, but not in Las Vegas.Las Vegas is not typical (when is it ever?) when it comes to immigrants. For instance, few immigrants make Las Vegas their first U.S. home. Most settle elsewhere and then move to Las Vegas when they learn about the many opportunities it has to offer people who have little education or job skills and who may not yet speak English, but who are willing to work hard. A significant, if small, percentage of newcomers to Las Vegas are refugees from places like Bosnia and Sudan who settle wherever the government and the aid agencies tell them to. Imagine the double dose of culture shock that any refugee would get from being plopped down in Las Vegas.Another atypical aspect of immigrant life in Las Vegas is that there are very few ethnic neighborhoods or geographic concentrations of nationalities, other than the African-American \\"West Side\\" (which, as a result of Las Vegas spreading out in all directions over the years, is more accurately the North Central Side.)Essays about immigrants from Greece, Croatia, Poland, the Indian Subcontinent, El Salvador, Chile, and the Philippines round out the collection. The editors are hoping this will be the first edition of a series that explores the stories of many more of the groups that are populating Las Vegas. Although The Peoples of Las Vegas is a university press publication, written mostly by professors and academics, it is quite readable. Many of the authors are members or descendants of the groups they write about, so there is a personal touch to the writing that is engaging. I can't wait for the second edition!"},{"Title":"More William","review":"i agree with what Reesez said about the book so just read his or her review to see what i think about the book."},{"Title":"More William","review":"The only problem is that the producers had the name of the author wrong; it's a by Richmal Crompton not Richard Crompton.The book is a return-to-childhood experience which I enjoyed.

He writes that to follow Jesus, Mohammad or Bhudda; is in principle similar to a man wanting to marry Cleopatra. The former men lived during a different period of time in history and to \\"know\\" them intimately by altering/worshipping your life is essentially impossible and meaningless.He also clarifies why his followers wore Orange, not to complement Bhuddist priest traditions, but rather to mock it. His followers were happy and excited, as opposed to dry and dull; and this caused a lot of confusion in India.This is only two points brought out from this extremely rich book."},{"Title":"The Blessing Stone","review":"I am a huge fan of Ms Wood's books, but was a bit disappointed by The Blessing Stone.My criticism is mostly about the two prehistoric stories.1) Why is she explaining constantly about the things the people in the first book did not have any knowledge of? It seems a little patronizing towards the reader.2) Is it really true that up to the time when the second books ends (10.000-8.000 BC?) people did not have any idea where babies came from?The rest of the stories was better, but still not up to her usual standards. Maybe Ms. Wood was limited by the short stories? I liked Sacred Ground, The Dreaming, The Prophetess, Perfect Harmony, Green City in the Sun and Virgins of Paradise much, much better and am looking forward to her next full length novel!"},{"Title":"The Blessing Stone","review":"Very well researched, but too much extraneous detail that at times didn't seem to add to the plot. Liked the historical accuracy."},{"Title":"The Blessing Stone","review":"This was one of those books that I read through as fast as I could to get it over with. I had a hard time connecting with a few of the main characters in the book. The author seemed to try to strike a balance between giving us a rich environment and well developed characters, but it just did not work for me. I did like the strong female characters. As for the stone, the \\"Interim\\" paragraphs at the end of each chapter actually took away from the stories, because it absolutely caused a disconnect between where the stone was and where it ended up."},{"Title":"The Blessing Stone","review":"I bought this book at library sale. Simply the best book I have ever read. The descriptive settings and characters bring life to semi historical periods in time. All strong women. All different ethnicities and periods in history and pre history and different religions. All stories evolve from a mysterious blue stone that has been carried over millions of years by different women in different settings. Simply stunning book"},{"Title":"The Blessing Stone","review":"I had previously read two Barbara Wood novels, Soul Flame and Green City in the Sun, and enjoyed them so much I decided to read another. From the first page of The Blessing Stone I was hooked and found myself turning the pages into the wee hours of the morning. Each of the stories about the mystical blue stone and how it affects the lives of each person possessing it is unique, well written and researched, with occasional liberties taken regarding actual facts. Remember: this is a work of fiction. From her vivid descriptions I could tell Barbara Wood travels to the locales she writes about. I was impressed with the way she weaves each of the stories together connecting people from different cultures and places in time. If you are interested in learning about the evolution of man and civilization, religion and ancient history, enjoy Indiana Jones-type adventure films that are exciting yet tongue-in-cheek, and reading stories that celebrate strong women, you will love this book. I highly recommend it! I think I'll read it a second time because once wasn't enough."},{"Title":"The Blessing Stone","review":"This has become one of my favorite books of all time.

The first chapter might be a litle slow when the author has less historical facts to draw upon. But the book makes up for it with intriguing and fascinating tales that are interwoven through the passage of the years. The fact that no two stories are the same and that they are so colorful and detailed is what made this book so interesting for me. I will look for other books by this author."},{"Title":"The Blessing Stone","review":"Great book! could not put it down!

I hated to see it end"},{"Title":"The Blessing Stone","review":"From 3,000,000,000 years ago, to the &quot;wild&quot; west, this stone has seen it all...Everyone of the stories captured something wonderful, survival, love, hate, passion, faith, hero's and heroine's, villians and nature.I enjoyed the stories all by themselves, but it was so cool to read the history of the world through the travels of the &quot;Blessing Stone&quot;, and to see it come full circle and back out again to enchant someone else's life.I really enjoyed every story and every character, I think most people will...so read on!Enjoy,Debbi :)"},{"Title":"The Blessing Stone","review":"Barbara Wood has too many stories to tell. For some authors, that could be a problem. For the redoubtable Ms. Wood, it is a challenge, and with &quot;The Blessing Stone&quot; she rises to that challenge superbly. The mysterious blue stone of the title connects the stories as it moves from hand to hand throughout the ages.We begin at the dawn of, er... Woman, with an early human woman named Tall One who finds the stone and with its guidance (or at least it inspiration) leads her people to water and safety. The tale progresses to pre-Biblical times where we visit with some people who might be the ancestors of the Hebrews. (Was it the Reed sea or the Red sea? Hmmm...) The story pulses with the charm of a well-told folk tale as we learn the (unlikely?) origins of wine and beer. Ms. Wood's eye for the interesting detail is ever sharp, and her sense of humor holds sway even during the most dramatic episodes. On through ancient Rome to an England under siege by Vikings, we visit a Turkish harem, the island of Martinique (beware of pirates) and take an arduous journey through the American west along the Oregon trail.If all of this sounds like too much, then heed the words of Bono when he sings &quot;too much is not enough,&quot; because the author leaves us happily wanting more.In her latest book, Barbara Wood touches on some familiar themes and visits some familiar settings, but what's most familiar here is her deft control of the narrative thread as she weaves this enchanting tapestry. Some of the episodes are quite short, others nearly novelette length, but all are perfectly constructed to bring home Ms. Wood's overiding statement that, in any age, sisterhood is powerful and women are indispensable.Yes, &quot;The Blessing Stone&quot; is a gem."},{"Title":"The Blessing Stone","review":"I loved this book. It had something for everyone. It was part clan of the cave bear, part history novel, part romance, part fantasy and a really good read. The book is divided into several vignettes that follow a central character's journey. I worry I'll never find anything as good as this again."},{"Title":"The Blessing Stone","review":"Three million years ago, a meteorite journeyed through the atmosphere of the third orb around the sun. The remnants of the meteorite crash on the planet leaving as its survivor a blue crystal. 100,000 years ago in Africa, The Tall One finds the crystal that somehow saves the life of her ailing Old Mother. Over the millenniums, the gem is passed from one generation to another, ultimately crossing the Mediterranean to Europe, eventually to the Middle East, and finally the Atlantic during the California Gold Rush to America. A hundred plus years later in an upstate New York hamlet the jewel resurfaces on the handle of a hippy's roach clip.THE BLESSING STONE is actually an anthology consisting of eight solid tales that are tied together by the blue stone. The stories are well written though a few are obvious as to what will happen. The three BC \\"books\\" are incredible while the Roman and Dark Ages tales are terrific. Though the remaining trio is well done, they feel too \\"modern\\" (even with one in the sixteenth century) to focus on the mystical jewel until that 1969 farm with a half of million strong. Still Barbara Wood provides an engaging history of the world.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Blessing Stone","review":"I love Barbara Wood's books and this is the best one I've read in a long time, I hated to finish it!"},{"Title":"The Blessing Stone","review":"I had never read any of Barbara Wood's novels until a friend lent me The Blessing Stone.I thoroughly enjoyed the interesting premise of an ancient stone making its way through history and the effect it had on different people along the way. Some of the \\"vignettes\\" offered up by each stone holder were so intriguing I wanted to hear more, but I did enjoy Wood's use of \\"interims\\" used to clear up the loose ends, condense times and sequence into the next time period and next stone holder. I also liked the fact that Wood told her story through the voices of both men and women -- early on in the book I thought perhaps all the stone holders would be women.Overall, this was a delicous, enjoyable read, the kind in which you read the last chapter very slooooowly to savor every last bit."},{"Title":"The Blessing Stone","review":"Early in our world's life, a meteor crashed into the Earth's surface leaving mass destruction in its wake. Buried among the mastodon and mammoth fossils was an enchanting stone that would be uncovered only after centuries of wind and rain. Possessed by dozens of women throughout time, the stone embodied a unique power for each of its guardians. Some believed it to give them extrasensory abilities, others imagined it contained the soul of their religious icon.Considered responsible for the successes and failures of whoever held it, the stone was involved in many of the turning points in history. One of the most captivating aspects of THE BLESSING STONE is the accuracy of the depictions of these events. Barbara Wood has done an admirable job of telling this inconceivable tale in a believable way. From her stunning descriptions of an ancient city with unlimited wealth to her agonizing portrayal of a starving nomadic clan in Africa, Wood inundates the reader with tremendous imagery.The story of the blessing stone is more than just a tale about a precious gem. It is also the story of the development of civilization, the changes in organized religion and the evolution of women's roles in society. Through each character's tragedies and triumphs, the story of the blessing stone unfolds and a new chapter in history is written.As the stone is passed from hand to hand and travels from country to country, Wood masterfully weaves a legend destined to make THE BLESSING STONE a bestseller. Rarely does an author manage to combine so many vignettes into one book of such excellence.--- Reviewed by Melissa Brown"},{"Title":"The Blessing Stone","review":"I have read and enjoyed several of Barbara Wood's previous novels. My favorites have been Domina, Green City in the Sun, and Virgins of Paradise. Those books have held my attention with interesting plot development and settings which enhanced rather than detracted from the story telling.In contrast, The Blessing Stone is a series of vignettes set in different periods of human history. It reads like a novelization of an anthropology textbook. The first several stories illustrate specific developments in human history, with the emphasis being on why certain changes in societal organization took place. The characters were one-dimensional and did not hold my interest.I did enjoy the stories of Lady Amelia, set in the Roman Empire, and of Abbess Winifred in pre-Norman Conquest England, but these didn't come up until halfway through the book.The use of the stone as a unitary device between the stories seemed contrived. The connecting sections were very choppy and didn't contribute to the stories, other than to open up the possibility of untold stories. For example the two page interim section between the story about Mother Winifred in 1022 C.E. and the next story, set in 1520 C.E tells us that the stone went from a Viking raider to an English soldier to the Caliph of Baghdad to another soldier to Francis of Assisi to a baker's wife to a pickpocket to a Medici prince to a traveling scholar. We never meet any of these characters.I hope that Ms. Wood returns to writing full-blown novels with less of the expository language that made The Blessing Stone bog down."},{"Title":"The Blessing Stone","review":"Barbara Wood has written a truly magical book. It not only entertains but educates with tidbits of information about religion,history,cultural differences,geography, etc. I was mesmerized from the first page and hated to see the last page appear.

Outside of the typos and errors that is, it was a big help. I also used practice exams from a friend. But, I didn't need them. This book has pretty good questions that very closely resemble what you will see on the real exam. However, many practice exam questions have the wrong answer, have duplicate answers, or simply have questions that are not complete. In the latter, you just guess something and look at the explanation.If I did not have my 5+ years of previous experience in VB 6, I imagine that I would have struggled a lot with this. Maybe I would have quit. I rated this book 5 stars only because I actually passed my exam. Otherwise, I gets a zero or whatever the equivalent is.Basic Summary:As someone previously mentioned, if you know some programming already, this book is Ok.

I do like the style of the book, it is very well laid out and the Practice tests that come with the book are very good, almost as good as Transcender.

Sees each as having countered an \\"ambiguous\\" inheritance \\"by creating [her] own rich matriarchal traditions\\" through art. Contends that, collectively, their fiction serves as a denial of \\"the patriarchal version of Southern life\\" presented by such authors as William Faulkner, John Crowe Ransom, Allen Tate, and William Styron.Concentrates on their concerns as women, specifically \\"their treatment of the problems of identity, on attitudes toward the mother, on the ways in which men are perceived, and on the distinctly female uses of place and symbol in their stories.\\" Argues that whereas Welty celebrates womankind, O'Connor and McCullers struggle against it.Sees Flannery O'Connor's \\"sour and resentful\\" children \\"as emblems of their mothers' debilitating power\\" who \\"set themselves at odds\\" with them \\"in resistance to femininity.\\" Observes that, of all the daughters O'Connor created through her art, only the retarded Lucynell Crater is \\"at ease with her feminine self.\\"Includes careful explications of \\"A Temple of the Holy Ghost\\" (with comparisons to McCuller's The Member of the Wedding and \\"Good Country People\\"; a discussion of the \\"sexual dimension\\" of O'Connor's stories and her use of religious solutions \\"to the problem of feminine identity\\"; differences between O'Connor's male (\\"aggressive and vindictive\\") and female (\\"rendered passive by punishment\\") characters; and, the influence of the hostile legal and business environment faced by post-Civil War Southern widows on O'Connor's portrayal of them.Characterizes O'Connor's mother-daughter relationships in discussions of O'Connor's \\"The Life You Save May Be Your Own,\\" \\"Why Do the Heathen Rage,\\" \\"A Circle in the Fire,\\" \\"Revelation,\\" and \\"A Stroke of Good Fortune.\\"Notes Flannery O'Connor's familiarity with Thomas Bulfinch's Mythology, comparative mythology, and Greek tragedy (through Robert Fitzgerald's work), and suggests that this knowledge influenced her fictional landscapes and her depiction of groves, meadows, pastures, and the protective woods surrounding farms ruled by women.Ties men's incursions onto these farms to sexual imagery and seduction patterns, arguing that the \\"pattern and tone of action in O'Connor's farm stories\\" is close to \\"the archetypal rape images of Greek mythology.\\" Discusses \\"Greenleaf\\" and \\"A Circle in the Fire\\" to illustrate why the persistent appearance of fertility myths \\"creates tensions in the stories which O'Connor's craft cannot resolve.\\"Concludes that while O'Connor's fiction \\"is an achievement of the first order in literary terms, she also wrote stories \\"where problems of female sexual identity twist plots away from their intended shapes and where feminine assertion is continually punished by masculine assaults which distort ancient mythic patterns associating women with the landscape.\\"R.

Verily I say unto you. There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.The city of Jerusalem sits on limestone. Underground passages provide water into the city. However, under seige, the underground passages filled with sewage as septic tanks could not hold so much sewage. Plaques broke out because of the raw sewage and during the three year seige, thousands of Jews died. It was estimated that 600,000 bodies were thrown over the wall. When the Romans took the city, they immediately killed all the leaders, sold the Jews into slavery, began to burn the Temple - after looting treasure. Once the fire started Titus allowed his troops to plunder the temple. Titus order all the walls be torn down and the troops pushed rubble of the temple and its courts over the sides of the hill.

It is very clear He is a Mormon.I do not believe in the Mormon religion which is not Christian. It is not that I dislike Mormons but that I do not believe there's is the true religion.Ruth Houston, Tx"},{"Title":"My Tiny Life: Crime and Passion in a Virtual World","review":"Fascinating and boldly honest. The narrative raises provocative questions that resonate on many levels, and harmonize with the author's own struggle to come to terms with his subject matter. Dibbell displays a grasp of his subject matter that is both deft and utterly compelling."},{"Title":"My Tiny Life: Crime and Passion in a Virtual World","review":"I bought a copy of Julian Dibbell's \\"My Tiny Life\\" about four years ago after happening upon his essay, \\"A Rape in Cyberspace.\\" Since then I have carried it with me back and forth between my dorm and home libraries, recommending it to friends who've shown interest in more pop-culture (ie video games) studies.Dibbell's approach towards writing about his experiences in Lambda MOO is interesting in and of itself- he separates each section into a different discussion on various questions raised as he played the game. There is a section on history, politics, sex, etc. -all within the framework of LamdaMOO. His writing style is both practical and thoughtful at the same time, lending to some memorable anecdotes while not being bogged down as being simply a memoir of his activities. While \\"A Rape in Cyberspace\\" is noticeably unchanged since its publication online, other chapters include thoughts on the nature of online communities, games, and virtual reality itself.That being said, this book has passed the 10 year mark. With the MMORPG market enlarging and expanding from its beginnings in Ultima Online and Everquest to approx. 11.5 million WoW players, I'm forced to almost question where someone can find any contemporary relevance in what Dibbell writes. While Text-Based RPGs might have matched Ultima Online in players in 1999, I'd be hard-pressed to argue that MUD or MOO players are today anything more than a small percentage rather than an example of the online gaming community as a whole. This makes the arguments and discussions in this book hard to apply to any contemporary study of online cultures.In some final comments, I will say that Dibbell is an absolute must-have for someone studying online communities, if only as a snapshot into what these communities looked like in the late 1990s. Dibbell's book also shows us that video games, at the very least, can be worth looking into from an academic standpoint, and offers an example of approaches that one might take if they were to attempt a foray into Ludology."},{"Title":"My Tiny Life: Crime and Passion in a Virtual World","review":"I enjoyed reading this classic meditation on online life when it was published. But, like some other readers, thought its focus on a \\"virtual rape\\" gave that act more power than it deserved. Reading tinylife again today, I take that back. Dibbell's exploration of social issues surrounding interactive virtual worlds are still on the cutting edge of sociology. Only now they have emerged as frontrunning concerns of society as a whole. With the explosion of Web 2.0 and social websites gaining millions of members every day, once arcane concerns of virtual harrassment and violence are now a huge issue. Dibbell asks and answers the relevant questions far better than anyone else out there. Time to crack open a tiny life again for insights into our brave new world."},{"Title":"My Tiny Life: Crime and Passion in a Virtual World","review":"A rather interesting autobiography of a MOO player's life and experiences within LambdaMoo. Tends to drag in a few places, but interesting nonetheless when you consider the dilemmas still facing MMO players today: is it just a game? Is your avatar just a piece of geometry/text on a screen? Or is it more? When your avatar is assaulted, do you feel as though you yourself have been assaulted?"},{"Title":"My Tiny Life: Crime and Passion in a Virtual World","review":"As with his original article on LambdaMOO, included here as the first chapter, Dibbell displays a remarkable lack of concern about his own biases and prejudices. Journalistic integrity is out the window. Instead, &quot;My Tiny Life&quot; is really just the self-indulgent ramblings of a newbie MUDder, who was never really part of the community because we all knew he was a journalist and was going to write about whatever he saw. We MUDders are a self-protective group. Dibbell's portrayal is as through a glass darkly; he saw only the fringes of what happened on LambdaMOO these many years ago, and he saw only what we allowed him to see. Thus his tale is a skewed view of events as they occurred, with stolen analysis, and he drops the narrative before some of the most interesting action took place. (This is because he himself left the MOO at that time. Why should he try to find out what happened, if he cared so little that he just left, for no other reason than that he was bored?) If you're really interested in online life, stop reading dead trees and log on."},{"Title":"My Tiny Life: Crime and Passion in a Virtual World","review":"This books is a compelling retelling of life in a virtual universe. It is a fascinating read, transposing real life with a constructed reality that exists only in cyberspace. For those unfamiliar with it, it presents a glimpse into th e other world of Multi User Domains. However, it is mainly a subjective work. With its tell-all nature, it may not be as appealing to those whose stories appear within, as its events are depicted according to the author's discretion."},{"Title":"My Tiny Life: Crime and Passion in a Virtual World","review":"Please don't believe a word Mr. Dibbell has to say. Those of us who are members of the LambdaMOO community can tell you how most of the events here have been changed to serve the author's point, and how untrue the entire documented experience is. This book is NOT a fair account of life on LambdaMOO, nor online at all! I regret that the general public will have an opinion of us based on what they have read from this book."},{"Title":"My Tiny Life: Crime and Passion in a Virtual World","review":"I hated the end. It just shoved in our face how he could spend 3 months on the MOO and then pretend he could know what a MOOer was like. And how dare he say most MOOers moved on? He was never a MOOer, so easy for him to say. Most MOOers I know from five years ago still live there. _He_ moved on because he was never there to begin with, only logging on and doing as much as his girlfriend allowed. I guess that's why he had to say over and over that the book was hers. I did really enjoy the way he described the real world as if it were a MOO, though. That was pretty creative."},{"Title":"My Tiny Life: Crime and Passion in a Virtual World","review":"It's bad enough that a virtual rape that passed by our screens years ago can still cause trees to be killed for profit, but now Dibbell adds to the fun by telling all readers how to committ &quot;crimes&quot; on-line. As one who has to clean up after his mess, I'm not amused. You do have a tiny life: now get a real life."},{"Title":"My Tiny Life: Crime and Passion in a Virtual World","review":"When I first heard about this book, I was very curious to read it. Although I never played MOO before, I did use LP MUDs quite often. So I was really eager to see what is there to write about a virtual community. The idea for this book, is great. But it is so boring. First, the book could be shortened to at least a 1/5 of its size. So many extra words!!! Second, it seems to me that the author was over romanticizing certain things. It seems to me he would be more excited from virtual rape than he would be excited by real rape. (Ofcourse, I'm excaggarating, but this is the general feeling I get from reading this book). Overall, it is an interesting book, but way too boring for my taste."},{"Title":"My Tiny Life: Crime and Passion in a Virtual World","review":"Never in my life have I read such trash. If you enjoy unbalanced journalism that helps fuel the trendwagon, this certainly book is for you. But in my opinion, it stinks. IT STINKS! It gives the wrong impression about people who are online as being overweight, uncaring, insensitve, pierced freaks who have nothing to do all day but engage in tinysex."},{"Title":"My Tiny Life: Crime and Passion in a Virtual World","review":"The author presents a tour of cyberspace. During this journey, we learn how the author feels, and what their priorities are. Cyber communites are the logical extension of chat sites, and web/ mail exchanges. In the real world, where restrictions can be placed on our daily lives, virtual reality provides an escape. Exploring this venue, we can learn more about ourselves as we interact with others, and the new environment. I'm glad the author documented their experiences!"},{"Title":"My Tiny Life: Crime and Passion in a Virtual World","review":"&quot;My Tiny Life&quot; about sums it up. Julian Dibble is, literally, what the British term &quot;a wanker.&quot; He brings navel gazing to an exhaulted pinnacle. He starts his book well, discussing the strange interactions between real life (RL) and virtual life as experienced on MUDs and MOOs (VL). He almost captures your imagination, then loses it all in a prolix tale of his adventures in masturbation, both real and virtual. In part, the book reads like his paeon of love to the (current) woman he has trouble making a committment to. In part, it's a waltz through the lives of people who are not yet ready to engage in real life and instead are tooling around virtual reality trying to get a grip on, primarily, their sexuality. While this book will surely appeal to those who recognize themselves in it, it's actually rather repellant to those who have been there, done that, then grew up."},{"Title":"My Tiny Life: Crime and Passion in a Virtual World","review":"Pretentious, meandering, and bereft of anything that could be mistaken for value. I question its use even as a cautionary tale of a man who has lost all ability to distinguish between the real world and a world of pretend."},{"Title":"My Tiny Life: Crime and Passion in a Virtual World","review":"I was the character that Dibbell called &quot;Laurel&quot; in his book. I was &quot;there&quot; though the entire story he describes, reading what he read in real time, although I never &quot;spoke&quot; with him (on-line or off). His book is remarkably accurate, although he does not have all the facts straight of the people behind the LambdaMOO characters. He deserves a lot of credit -- he got it closer than anyone else possibly could have."},{"Title":"My Tiny Life: Crime and Passion in a Virtual World","review":"My Tiny Life largely succeeds in its presentation of the evolution of a &quot;Tiny&quot; society, one that -- if you believe Dibbell's writing -- struggles through serious birthing pains as its population swells and it must contend with the issues of relationships, sex, gender (and gender's possible non-relevance online), ethics, law and self-governance. Not to mention how much LambdaMOO can absorb of your &quot;real world&quot; life.Dibbell's voyeurism and exhibitionism becomes somewhat annoying and distracting from time to time, although I do see the value of showing how his MOO life affects his relationship with his significant other. This is part of any journalistic writing in which the author is also participant, I suppose.If, like Evandra in a previous review, you were there when these events unfolded, it may not be of interest or of great enough depth to you -- but the insider's attitude that the book is without merit simply doesn't ring true and smacks of elitism.Overall -- extremely thought-provoking and very enjoyable."},{"Title":"My Tiny Life: Crime and Passion in a Virtual World","review":"Unlike most books on cyberculture, which either dryly recount someone's meteoric rise at an Internet start-up, or seek to explain the unprecedented growth of new media and to predict its endgame, this book is actually a page-turner. I couldn't put it down. In fact, I read part of it while sitting on a giant rock in a palm oasis in the middle of the Borrego Springs desert. What makes My Tiny Life a page-turner is how effectively Mr. Dibbell turns the typed-in shorthand of the LambdaMOO residents into the epic drama of a metropolis in a state of ascent or decline, depending on your point of view. Mr. Dibbell also presents himself in a brutally honest light, detailing his inner demons and conflicts and peccadilloes, as his obsession and entanglements grow. He writes with little regard as to where this book will place him in the pantheon of the new media elite. He eschews the usual smart-*** cynicism for real analysis that while sometimes layered in college dorm late night semantics, is not altogether dismissible as this new form of communication tries to understand itself.See the full revew at BETA Online..."},{"Title":"My Tiny Life: Crime and Passion in a Virtual World","review":"I found this book compulsively readable. I was a regular on LambdaMOO at around the same time that Dibbell was, and I found his descriptions of the experience of MOO-ing (what it's like to be there and participate in various ways) quite accurate. As for his version of MOO history, I wouldn't take it too seriously, but then, he makes it pretty clear that the motivations behind and significance of the events that he recounts are disputed. What impresses me about this book is the way it captures the feeling of being in the MOO, and the analysis of the issues that got raised in various conflicts."},{"Title":"My Tiny Life: Crime and Passion in a Virtual World","review":"This book is an instant classic of an emerging genre -- the computer memoir. Mr. Dibbell's personal accounts of his experiences with LambdaMOO are fascinating, not only for those unversed in the ways of the online world, but also for &quot;virtual oldtimers.&quot; Whether or not the reader agrees with his opinions, his frank and sometimes painful descriptions of his life, both on- and off-line, are compelling and sincere. To view his story as a definitive history of the development of LambdaMOO would be to miss the point. Through his soul-searching, the author presents us with a very human account of what most would consider an entirely technical subject. Dibbell is a rarity -- a computer-literate humanist. Required reading for everybody."},{"Title":"My Tiny Life: Crime and Passion in a Virtual World","review":"I have had a character on LambdaMOO for several years. I know the characters he writes about. His depiction of life there is accurate, and it's well done. Those LambdaMOOers who have trashed his book simply have an axe to grind."},{"Title":"My Tiny Life: Crime and Passion in a Virtual World","review":"The book is indeed a page turner. Online life and community presents opportunities and problems that are similar, yet different than RL. Julian's account was very subjective, but he opened himself up sharing the experience and the results on his RL relationships. If you accept that MOO users controlled what he experienced while online, then Julian could only report the experience. If his experience was so controlled, then it does support the Power Elite theory. I was fascinated."},{"Title":"My Tiny Life: Crime and Passion in a Virtual World","review":"Mr. Dibell arrouses our curiosities in the realm of virtual ethics with his gripping, nitty-gritty narrative of cyber life and passion. Dibell's cyber experiences at &quot;Moo&quot; call for a re-evaluation of human morals in the coming age. This work will certainly stand as a timeless classic, captivating the thoughts of gereations to come, especially as our world becomes evermore wired."},{"Title":"My Tiny Life: Crime and Passion in a Virtual World","review":"Aside from his own personal, short-term journeys in and out of LambdaMOO and fairly mundane conflict and resolution with his significant other, which provide part of the hook to the reader, Dibbell writes in an engaging way about the sociology of the MOO community. Of particular interest are the immediate and long term reactions of the community to acts, virtual though they may be, that affect the fabric of the MOO society. The book's inability to fully demonstrate the complexity of the MOO society, demonstrated by MOOers' castigation of the work, is irrelevant to the points made by the author about the relationships of the wizard power class to the other, parallel MOO societies, and to the constituent class. The strong reactions of members of the MOO society to events and characters that are perceived as harmful elements, and the attempts to call for, impose and/or resist virtual law and order in an unruly and perhaps ungovernable society provide the real conflict. Dibbell's observations of the tensions of anarchy and order in the MOO unfold in counterpoint to the author's RL events and relationships, which are described in MOOspeak, but which must inevitably follow societal rules and expectations of long standing.I found it to be a page-turner well after the narration of the motivating event was finished."},{"Title":"My Tiny Life: Crime and Passion in a Virtual World","review":"Disclaimer: I was never a player in LambdaMOO, but I was a player and a wizard in some other games at approximately the time in virtual history described by this book. Although I didn't know any of the pseudonymous MOOers in _My Tiny Life_, I nevertheless felt right at home in Julian's LambdaMOO, because the people and the situations were so familiar.Ah, yes, I remember it well. This is certainly not a perfect book, and probably not as good a discussion of the issues of cyberlaw as Bruce Serling's wonderful _The Hacker Crackdown_, but it was a lively read and I thought it captured the lived experience of being a member of a virtual community. But I am recommending this book to all those folks from my own MUSH days with whom I am still in touch. Dibbell really captured the flavor, at least for me. Oh, and hey, Julian - real women NEVER @desc their shoes. You can always tell."},{"Title":"Whispered Promises","review":"WoW i love this story great romance. she was way young but who cares KEEPER KEEPER."},{"Title":"Whispered Promises","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Doctor, lawyer and no, not an Indian chief -- but a geologist. He is the second of the Madaris brothers. According to the youngest brother, Clayton, Dex is a member of the &quot;pain and suffering club.&quot; Four years before the book opens, Dexter pursued Caitlyn in a whirlwind courtship that resulted in a marriage so quick that their families weren't able to attend. She was 21; Dexter was 32. When Caitlyn's manipulative father has a heart attack, she's torn between a father who has raised her since her mother's death and her new husband. She chooses her father and refuses to accompany Dex to Austrialia, where he's been sent on a job. When Dex finally decides to go get his young bride, he gets divorce papers and Caitlyn's wedding ring in the mail. The marriage is over. OR IS IT? Four years later, Caitlyn's father makes a death bed confession. He's never had the divorce papers filed. Caitlyn and Dex are still marriage. Dex is in for another shock when he meets Jordan, the current center of Caitlyn's life. The book abandons what could be an easy formula and carefully develops the characters. This is important to Brenda Jackson's work because the characters make cameo appearances in her other novels. Humor is another important part of Jackson's style. The seduction scene between two minor characters, Trevor Grant and Corinthians Avery, is a classic. The tension between the two extend beyond this novel into Jackson's follow-ups. There are plans for them to have their own story.

Well all I can say is DEX is FIRE. I am by no means a stranger to a little steam in a book or loving the main character of a book but Brenda Jackson put it all on Dex. I see lots of Clayton this and Clayton that (don't get me wrong, loving Clayton) but Dex is something. I loved this story. It was heartwarming, sweet and lots of heat. Do yourself a favor if these books and this author is new to you, give the Madaris men a try. I don't think you would be the least bit disappointed.

I read it a while ago but I decided to catch up on it since I've been getting more recent Madaris family books, I wanted to start from the beginning so I would know what was going on.

The moment Dex saw the lovely Caitlin; he knew that she was too young for him. However Dex still hired Caitlin for the job. Dex was visiting at Jake's ranch but he was leaving in three weeks to go too Australia for two years. The attraction that was between Dex and Caitlin began to burn hot; Dex knew that he couldn't leave Caitlin behind so he asked her to marry him. Dex took Caitlin home to tell her father that they were married; Halston Parker became so angry that he had a heart attack. After a few days Caitlin told Dex to go on to Australia without her and she would come as soon as her father was better. Dex was surprised when he received papers for their divorce. Dex was so hurt and he swore that he would never love again.Four years later Caitlin was back at the hospital because her father was dying of cancer. Halston wanted Caitlin to call Dex and have him come to the hospital. Caitlin calls Dex and he comes. Halston tells them that they are still married because he hadn't filed the divorce papers. Halston also tell Dex that someone had been harassing him, because he wouldn't sell a piece of land that he owned. Halston wanted Dex to protect Caitlin in case they start coming after her. Caitlin is afraid that Dex will discover a secret that she has hidden from him, and that he will never forgive her.Brenda Jackson beings the next installment of Madaris family and it was a heart warming tale of love, betrayal and love found again. Caitlin was young when they married and she was being pulled in two directions by Dex and her father. Dex being eleven-years older then Caitlin knew that he was too old for her, but he had loved her so much. He would stay with her now but she would never have his heart again... or would she?

One would think that a book this expensive and a publisher this well-known would be able to fork out enough cash to hire a competent translator.

First of all, Ta Hui is a key figure in the Rinzai lineage of Zen* and has been very influential in the shaping of this form of Buddhism as it comes down to us today. On this merit alone, any translation of his works and words is necessary and welcome, as we try to assess that influence as well as get in touch with the wise words of a very religious and spiritual man in Sung Dynasty China, words that do indeed speak with a jarringly colloquial eloquence across the oceans and centuries. So the historical importance and universal appeal are both there. Furthermore, as far as eloquence goes, this text has more of it than most; sometimes reading Zen texts is like gnawing on an iron bar, but since almost all of this book is made up of letters and addresses to laymen, Ta Hui gets his hands dirty and his feet wet \\"dragging through mud and water\\" with grandmotherly solicitude, breaking down Zen rhetoric into manageable portions. Oh, the good ol' paradoxes, seeming non-sequiters, and nondualistic loopdeeloops are still there, but toned down and elaborated in ways Ta Hui wouldn't have bothered with had he been addressing his monastic peers, and he's careful in several points to ward off \\"anything goes\\" misunderstandings of Zen practice (evidently a problem then as now). That being the case, this makes for an excellent and accessible introduction into Zen discourse, thought, and practice, and I would highly recommend its use as a primary text in the university classroom. And since it is addressed to laymen, people trying to meditate and be Buddhists while out in the secular world engaged in the daily grind, it's very relevant to most American practitioners of Zen today who are usually in much the same situation. So this book very much has appeal and usefulness both at the scholar's desk and on the meditation cushion.Cleary's translation style is quite appropriate, too, remaining true and accurate to Ta Hui's language while not being afraid to get slangy when he does. The flow of words is unstrained and natural while not fast and loose. The footnotes and parenthetical remarks are handled with good balance, making references obscure to the 20th century American reader clear while not talking over the author himself. The only thing really lacking as far as I was concerned was a brief biographical sketch of the laymen to whom these letters are addressed, perhaps as a little appendix in the back. Who is Ta Hui talking to? Why does he keep writing to Li Hsien-ch'en and Tseng T'ien-yu multiple times while only writing letters to others once or maybe twice? Or is this only an effect of Cleary's selection process? All of this would have been good to know, but the lack thereof doesn't detract that much from the book, which still stands quite well on its many merits. I highly recommend this book to any and all.*(I approach from the Japanese side, but \\"Lin Chi lineage\\" and \\"Ch'an\\" if you prefer. But then why don't I refer to the monk as Daie? Cleary does the same thing, too, with \\"Zen Master Ta Hui\\". The tangled linguistics of Zen/Ch'an/Son in America would be worth a study in itself.)"},{"Title":"Swampland Flowers: The Letters and Lectures of Zen Master Ta Hui","review":"This was one of several books used for a college course took on Buddhism.

This would be good for groups discussion or independent study."},{"Title":"Swampland Flowers: The Letters and Lectures of Zen Master Ta Hui","review":"\\"Swampland Flowers\\" is a selection of letters written more than 850 years ago by Ta Hui. He was a leading Chinese Zen or Chan master, 12th in the Rinzai or Lin Chi lineage.His letters are no-nonsense, personal, helpful. They almost constitute a correspondence school in Zen practice for non-monks, practicing in the midst of family- and work-life. It is as if his letters were written to you and me and just arrived in the mailbox. Always fresh: a letter that roused little interest last year may be right on point for my practice this year.Translator J. C. Cleary has arranged the letters in a subtle but meaningful way and has translated them in a consistent style. He leaves me feeling that I know the grand old man who wrote them.\\"Swampland Flowers\\" is one of my recurrent favorites among all Zen books.

Reina discuss the importance of having a strong sense of trust in the workplace. They advocate avoiding both the major and minor betrayals that undermine trust. Creating an environment that promotes trust contributes to effectiveness in the workplace, especially during times of rapid change. The book discusses the nature and effect of trust. It is enhanced with a variety of exercises that promote workplace dialogues and help people think through the issue of trust. Many of these exercises are especially suited for teams, work groups and divisions. The exercises facilitate discussing and resolving problems in a more trusting atmosphere.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Trust and Betrayal in the Workplace: Building Effective Relationships in Your Organization","review":"If you don't understand how to build trust or what undermines or outright destroys it, this book is a good starting place and I recommend buying it.The book focuses on the workplace, not on your relationships outside of work, which helped me make clear business application of the concepts. Thankfully, the book does not go on ad nauseum into theories but truly gets down to the basics of why we do or don't trust others (or whether they do or don't trust us).I've used concepts from the book in my workplace to help other understand why trust does or does not exist between them and others. The book provides a useful model of three types of trust that can be used to analyze situations where trust is lacking, and that in turn can be used to provide a focal point for having conversations to build or strengthen trust.By applying concepts from the book in coaching relationships at work, I've helped others have breakthrough conversations with bosses and co-workers they did not trust. I've also been able to use concepts to help others understand how performing more consistently for me or others influences perceptions and can color others' views of their reliability and professionalism, which in turn can affect what opportunities a person is or is not given.By the way, though the book focuses on the workplace, it seems to me that it is not a large leap to apply the concepts to one's personal life--why you do or don't trust your spouse, your kids, or someone else in your life. By understanding where trust is lacking and why, you can begin to prepare to discuss with others what your expectations of one another are, and discuss how to improve trust."},{"Title":"Trust and Betrayal in the Workplace: Building Effective Relationships in Your Organization","review":"The desire for greater trust and respect reverberates in organizations across the country.

I would like to take their course and meet them in person!"},{"Title":"Trust and Betrayal in the Workplace: Building Effective Relationships in Your Organization","review":"Trust and Betrayal in the Workplace by Dennis &amp; Michelle Reina This book tackles one of the most pervasive and intractable dynamics which degrade the quality of work relationships and job satisfaction. The contribution that this book makes is to provide models for analyzing how trust is undermined which then suggests ways that it might be restored. It's not helpful to just say &quot;I don't trust him.&quot; Using the Reina's model of contractual trust, communication trust and competence trust, you would describe that breakdown more precisely. &quot;I don't trust his behavior - it's too inconsistent&quot; or &quot;I don't trust that I'll get the information I need from him&quot; or &quot;I don't trust that he'll be able to get this job done.&quot; With the problem better articulated, it becomes possible to address it and a choice can then be made about whether to do so. The Reina's have made the subjects of Trust and Betrayal the core of their life's work to date and it shows in such simple and profound insights as &quot;Betrayal is an experience determined by the betrayed.&quot; This is what organization executives so often miss and which saddles them with disgruntled work forces. The Reina's go on to draw distinctions between intentional and unintentional, and major and minor betrayal. This gives executives a way to understand the dynamic without ladening them or their employees with guilt or defensiveness. The book is full of exercises one can use to gain competence in building trust or repairing trust that has been damaged. It takes a real adult to take responsibility for building and repairing trust rather than just writing off others as being untrustworthy. The Reina's challenge us to be adults."},{"Title":"Trust and Betrayal in the Workplace: Building Effective Relationships in Your Organization","review":"In their Preface, the Reinas explain: \\"This book is about trust: the power when it exists, the problems when it doesn't, and the pain when it is betrayed. Our purpose in writing this book is to help people at all levels of the organization to create, support, and rebuild trust in themselves and within their organizations.\\" Here is how their book is organized:Part I Understanding Trust and BetrayalPart II Transactional Trust (Three Types)Part III Transformative TrustThe material consists of sharply-focused analysis, mini-case studies anchored in real-world experiences, a series of checklists, and then at the conclusion of each chapter a summary of key points followed by \\"Ideas in Action.\\" Together, this combination of analysis and information helps to explain HOW to establish and then sustain trust throughout any organization. The authors also offer some practical advice on how to recover from betrayal, once experienced: Observe and acknowledge what has happened, allow your feelings to surface, get support, reframe the experience, forgive yourself and others, and finally let go and move on. Most of us have experienced betrayal in personal relationships and many of us have also experienced organizational betrayal. It can indeed be painful.The authors assert that first you must trust yourself; if you don't, you probably cannot or will not trust another person. Next, give trust to others inorder to obtain it. Trust another's character. Years ago, Stan Smith lost a major tennis title to Arthur Ashe after a call against Smith which enraged the crowd. Later, Smith agreed that losing the point was the turning point in the match. He then added, \\"But if Arthur said my shot was out, that's good enough for me.\\"Trust another's competence. \\"I know you can do it. I have total confidence in your abilities.\\" Most of the time (not always), the person told this will then do everything humanly possible to prove worthy of such trust.Trust those with whom you work closely. Small concentrations of trust within a branch office, department or business unit can frequently develop a momentum which has much wider and deeper impact. That, in essence, is what \\"transformative trust\\" is all about. The Reinas explain this quite well in Part III.The Reinas conclude their book with a series of questions which will help the reader to determine the nature and extent of trust within her orn his own organization, and, to determine what needs to be done to increase it effectively. There is no break-through thinking in this book...nor do the Reinas claim to offer any. Rather, as indicated, their book examines real-world situations which demonstrate either the potential benefits of trust or the destructive consequences of betrayal. For most of those interested in the subject, that should be sufficient."},{"Title":"Trust and Betrayal in the Workplace: Building Effective Relationships in Your Organization","review":"My boss gave me a copy of this book. Initially, I thought &quot;something to read on the train&quot;. What I quickly realized was that this was probably the most straightforward book I've read. It is logical, honest and simple in plan.

The book describes the importance of trust and why it is the core issue facing business people today. In our fast paced work lives, we need to be able to trust those we work with. Without that trust, organizations cannot run at an optimal level. I especially like the 7 steps for healing, which suggests that there is a way to establish trust in our workplaces. I plan to use this book the next time I teach Organizational Behavior, because it examines the issue in a manner which I know my students will love.

By following the simple instructions, one can fine tune all of the information read and use it to enrich your life and the lives of others. To heal and become productive again in both your personal and professional life is to truly be free. I have reflected back many times when following the 7 steps on healing and betrayal and it has become like a bible to me. Even though problems may occur, I am now able to handle them effectively and I have learned to let go.

They also offer practical and accessible vignettes and case studies illustrating the 'trust behaviors' that are so crucial to effective organizations and relationships.Probably the most powerful part of the book is the section on Betrayal. Betrayal is a huge factor in our lives and we rarely talk about it.

And, we need something about trust that makes sense. Trust is a concept that everyone talks about, especially when there isn't enough of it, but few can really understand. The Reinas have created a way of looking at trust that we can understand. They look at three forms of trust (Communication, Contractual, and Competency) which are easy to grasp. Haven't we all had someone break confidence about something we shared with them. Upholding agreements is also a point of concern for us all. I have certainly worried about whether someone was capable of doing what they said they would do. The Reinas also reminds us that this is not just about whether or not we trust others, sometimes we don't trust ourselves in these three areas. Their view of trust quickly leads to concrete things that can be done to build or rebuild trust. They don't just bemoan the impact of betrayal in the workplace, using their model of trust, they provide straightforward ways of recovering. I am using what I learned from the book and when I explain it to others, they like it too. Trust and Betrayal is easy to read and full of very helpful information. I highly recommend this book and urge you to buy and use it too."},{"Title":"Trust and Betrayal in the Workplace: Building Effective Relationships in Your Organization","review":"Trust is the \\"operating system\\" of every relationship and every organization. Think about it. No matter how good your software may be, when your computer's operating system is fragile that software simply cannot perform well. Trust in an organization is about much more than leaving your desk drawer unlocked while you go to lunch. Trust is also about confidence, reliability, competence and other important factors.This book is about the growing sense of betrayal in the workplace. That sense of betrayal is caused by a range of upheavals including change and transformations like downsizing and mergers. Employees feel betrayed by their leaders and leaders often feel betrayed by their employees.An unfortunate irony is that organizational change can create conditions that undermine trust at the very time trust is most critical.The authors discuss four key components of trust:1. Capacity for trust (how ready we are to trust).2. Contractural trust (our trust in each other's character and ability to honor promises).3. Communication trust (our trust in being open and transparent).4. Competence trust (our trust in the capabilities of ourselves and others).This is a highly readable and thought-provoking book that's an excellent companion toThe SPEED of Trust: The One Thing That Changes Everythingby Stephen M.R. Covey."},{"Title":"Trust and Betrayal in the Workplace: Building Effective Relationships in Your Organization","review":"This book contains some very well written information on trust & betrayal, where it comes from, what it causes, and how to address it. I found it very informative and helpful. However I was a bit distracted and disappointed in how focused the book is on marketing of the authors services (training, consulting, etc). The repeated and not so subtitle references to the products and services offered by the authors left me suspicious of the author's intent and agenda, causing me to question the validity of the material. I found it ironic that I felt betrayed by a book on Trust & Betrayal.So while I would give the material 4 stars, the poorly hidden advertising left a bad taste in my mouth."},{"Title":"Introduction to Phenomenology","review":"For anyone versed in realistic philosophy (Aristotelian/Thomistic)this book by Robert Sokolowski should both broaden and deepen their understanding of the basics of first philosophy as well as its very meaning. Sokolowski's presentation of phenomenology is challenging but clear. I certainly recommend the book.Introduction to Phenomenology"},{"Title":"Introduction to Phenomenology","review":"Phenomenolgy as a movement focuses on getting back to the things themselves. This does not mean objects themselves by themselves but the basic structures of consciousness that allow beings to appear. Robert Sokolowski's book is unparalleled as an introduction to phenomenology, because he shows what phenomenology is by doing it and thereby getting back to the things themselves. Rather than being a work of historical scholarship, the book introduces readers to the practice of phenomenology as a living manner of philosophical reflection.Dermot Moran's Introduction to Phenomenology, a historical overview of the movement, is an excellent complement to Sokolowski's book. It would be, however, a very poor substitute for it.Sokolowski does not speak as Husserl, as Heidegger, or as Merleau-Ponty. He speaks as himself, a practiced phenomenologist, who sees phenomenology as a means of articulating the world and its structures. And he invites others to join him in this pursuit as fellow agents of truth."},{"Title":"Introduction to Phenomenology","review":"Robert Sokolowlski's introduction to phenomenology is as clear an exposition of this often impenetrable subject as I have read. I like his layout into topics such as \\"What is intentionality, and why it is important\\", \\"Words, pictures and symbols\\" etc. Any questions I have concerning the subject of phenomenology are not criticisms of Sokolowski's book so much as of the umwelt in which it lives and which it exemplifies.I have long felt discomfort with phenomenological jargon in that rather than it pointing to falsifiable hypotheses, as I would presume we seek in a shared search for truth, it tends to make its serpentine concepts impossible to grip. This may be due to a reaching towards a new way of looking at the world or it may be a retreat to justification.It seems to me that the dichotomy of Cartesianism versus phenomenology is a bit over used and I am not even sure that phenomenologists really know where they are heading with this. I agree that Locke and Bacon and Descartes did lead us down some dead ends but phenomenologists seem to overlook that they are also wandering down similar tracks, as though it is possible to bracket one's biases and restore the lost and pure world. Phenomenological literature, nearly without exception, has a revivalist tone, to quote Sokolowski:\\" Phenomenology allows us to recognize and to restore the world that seemed to have been lost when we were locked in our own internal world by philosophical confusions\\".or\\"It validates the philosophical life as a culminating human achievement. Phenomenology does not only remedy our intellectual distress; it also opens the door to philosophical exploration to those that wish to practice it\\".I am sorry if I offend followers in questioning the revivalist tone, but I think that the very aspect of phenomenology that is praised as its greatest virtue is its greatest weakness: the trouble with phenomenology is encapsulated in the title of one of Maurice Merlau-Ponty's books: \\"The Primacy of Perception\\".How can perception be primary? The faculty of vision is so efficient that it has led phenomenologists and Lockean's astray, both, for it seems that sensations flow through our eyes like water into buckets, when more correctly the brain and retinal cells are acting as flickering searchlights for preconceptions and modified conceptions. This perspective has been clarified by the evolutionary epistemologist Karl Popper in company with Donald Campbell and Konrad Lorenz. Knowledge must be primary, not tacit knowledge nor justified knowledge nor certain knowledge. The embryo is not a blank slate: it guesses its way through the world and its guesses are tested, modified and retested, continually, through experience.Surely in the dawn of the 21st century when computers are ubiquitous it should come as no surprise that knowledge can be non-tacit? The mistake of many philosophies is to treat knowledge only as personal e.g. \\"I know\\", \\"I believe\\", \\"I see\\".To seek a foundation or essence based on the kind of indubitable knowledge that is sought by phenomenologists seems like the journey of Don Quixote, furthermore the jargon used in the phenomenological literature reeks too much of obscurantism which one suspects hides a lack of conceptual clarity.Again to reinforce the revivalist tenor of phenomenological literature let me quote Sokolowski: \\" Phenomenology has waged a heroic struggle against psychologism from the beginning. It tries to show that the activity of achieving meaning, truth and logical reasoning is not just a feature of our psychological or biological makeup, but that it enters a new domain, a domain of rationality, a domain that goes beyond the psychological\\". He goes on to say it is not easy to make this distinction - I am sure it isn't, when meaning and truth are conflated and an heroic quest for pure perception is undertaken.There are too many straw men fought against by the phenomenologist Don Quixotes, I wonder if these dons would have a mission without Descartes, and other philosophers who have \\"had a too limited understanding of what makes us rational\\". It seems to me that, in common with other revivalist movements, phenomenology makes many promises but provides little promise.Truth is not relative, it is just hard to find. We should try to make our knowledge claims objective rather than trying to justify them. Once the claims are made objective, i.e. shared, they can then be stress-tested, if broken discarded and the heroic journey of conjecture and refutation can continue without fear or favour. Truth is the regulative principle, not certainty, not justification and probably when we find truth it will not be recognizable anyway - for who can verify truth claims?All Life is Problem Solving"},{"Title":"Introduction to Phenomenology","review":"\`Introduction to Phenomenology' by Robert Sokolowski is an outstanding introduction to phenomenology, providing an accessible and helpful entry point to this important aspect of continental philosophy.Unlike some introductory texts which focus on introducing the field's major thinkers and their work, Sokolowski's approach is thematic looking at phenomenology's questions and terminology rather than its historic personages. Readers interested in a more detailed and historically focused introduction to phenomenology may enjoy a series of MP3 audio lectures by John Drabinski's \\"Between Husserl and Heidegger' (available on-line).Overall, this is an outstanding introduction to phenomenology; it is clear, concise and helpful. I highly recommend it for all readers new to this subject as well as those that have questions in this area."},{"Title":"Introduction to Phenomenology","review":"This book will be just great for introducing my master degree students on very important concepts on Phenomenology, especially intentionality. It will also cope with the hard task of explaining what phenomenology really is. I have used the D'Artigues book for many years, since it is a good one , however Sokolowsky gives e new breath to any one looking for a better understanding of that important philosophic approach to our complex and challenging human world, mainly nowadays due to so many conflicting relationships everywhere."},{"Title":"Introduction to Phenomenology","review":"It is not important how many of books regarding phenomenology you have read, this Introduction is much, much more than only introduction. Can help you focused your mind again to the matter."},{"Title":"Introduction to Phenomenology","review":"Sokolowski's Introduction to Phenomenology admirable performs the work of an introduction. On the one hand, it strives to dispel misconceptions; this is necessary, since where misconceptions exist it is unlikely that an acquaintance will follow an introduction; or, that where it does, it will get off on the right foot. The misconceptions have chiefy to do with Phenomenology's lexicon-the terms it has developed for itself so as to make possible its particular way of looking at the world and the self. These include: intentionality, parts and wholes, identities in manifolds, presence and absence; transcendental reduction, transcendental ego, internal time consciousness, life world, and eidetic intuition.In addition to being rather forbidding, this list (which corresponds to the way Sokolowski introduces the topics on it in his Introduction) of itself suggests why misconceptions exist, both about the words themselves and about Phenomenology as a philosophy. All the words on it have a stain of romanticism in them, no doubt because in reacting against rationalism and empiricism, Phenomenology incorporated the romanticism that is lodged at their core into itself. But as that romanticism-the romanticism of the solitary figure who knows and judges in terms of feeling-is unrecognized by them, so it incidental to Phenomenology.Moving from the one hand to the other, and from the negative to the positive, Sokolowski makes it clear that, as a modern philosophy-but a modern philosophy with a difference-Phenomenology seeks to recover the world and the self that modern philosophy, in its rationalist and empericist versions, lost. It seeks to recover the world or the cosmos as a thing that is able to disclose the truth about itself and the self as the agent of truth.This recovery has the effect of giving dignity back to human beings. (There is poignant and compelling-indeed, even a passionate-description of this dignity, and of what is lost when it is lost on pp. 120-21, though, unfortunately, it is too long to quote here.) The recovery opens, or reopens, the door to the pleasures of philosophy: the pleasures of grasping essential truth, and of sharing thought and speech about it. Conversely, it relieves one of the two main burdens imposed by much modern philosophy: first, the burden of trying to say everything, and second, the burden of trying to unsay everything.Finally, Sokolowski observes that, in his judgment, Phenomenology is the first philosophy to introduce and work with the formal structures of presence and absence; and he attributes their introduction to the fact that Phenomenology sought to overcome the epistemological dead-end reached in modern thought (i. e. that &quot;in here&quot; and &quot;out there&quot; are forever separate and silent toward one another). Perhaps the reason Phenomenology did this is that modern philosophy, with its view that the foundation and limit of thought is perception, forced so many things into absence that the notion of absence needed to be introduced to get them back."},{"Title":"Introduction to Phenomenology","review":"An excellent introduction to this major philosophical movement of the 20th century which counterbalances the more familiar Anglo-American analytic tradition. The author uses beautifully written examples from everyday life to explain phenomenological concepts and techniques. Phenomenological terms are brought into the discussion apace with the explanations so as not to overpower the reader."},{"Title":"Introduction to Phenomenology","review":"I agree with other reviewers here that this is a clear, concise introduction to what is often an abstruse area of study.However, one area of concern presents itself. How can we ever really agree on our own phenomenology? The libertarians, compatabalists and determinists, in the study of freedom, for instance, all report different phenomenologies in regard to their own thought.This concern came to the fore especially on page 127. Here is the paragraph in question:\\"And if the picture of someone who died before his time may, by the very absence of a future, give us an impression of what the responsible ego is, the picture of someone not yet born ,someone who is almost all future, with even a name still to come, may serve the same purpose. We have seen pictures of the early stages of life, during fetal development, when the eyes look like spots and the mouth is speechless and immersed in amniotic fluid. The mouth that opens and closes silently at that time is the same one that will be used to say \\"I\\" later on, and the early sense of self that is being established in the synesthsia of touch and hearing and bodily motion is the same that will have memories and project actions in the years after baby is born. The transcentdental ego, the dative of manifestation , is already there, establishing the basis for its future categorical activity and moral interventions. The early self is already something of a player in the game of truth.\\"The author laments in the historical appendix a lack of political philosophy linked to Phenomenology. But it looks like he himself is making quite an argument against abortion right there. But I think phenomenology can be value free, such as the writings of Peter L. Berger in the Sociology of Knowledge (influnced by Alfred Schutz who in turn was taken by the writings of Husserl). Is the transcendental ego also in a Sperm? When does it arise exactly?Phenomenology also claims to get out of the solipsism of Descartes thinking. God knows I need help with this, as I, personally, feel lost in a see of relativism. But the book didn't really convince me of that the phenomenological perspective fixes this issue.But any criticisms aside, it's an extremely readable book. The only knowledge the book assumes is that you've had a good Intro to Philosophy course. If you haven't, and you're willing to make some use of wikipedia and a dictionary, you can get a lot out of this book as well."},{"Title":"Introduction to Phenomenology","review":"This book clarified basic phenomenological concepts in a style and language that was accessible for a modern, American reader. Thanks to Dr. Sokolowski."},{"Title":"Introduction to Phenomenology","review":"As a philosophy graduate student who knew little about phenomenology, I found this introduction fantastic. Phenomenology has the potential to overcome many of the dilemmas of modern philosophy, as Robert Sokolowski clearly and vividly presents. Though not yet convinced, I'm eager to read more, a desire any good introduction should instill in its readers."},{"Title":"Introduction to Phenomenology","review":"Perhaps the most important philosophical movement in the 20th century, phenomenology is also one of the more abstruse and varied disciplines in philosophy. Indeed, it would be quite difficult to give a definitive description of what phenomenology is, as defined by the multifarious practitioners, and an onerous task of sifting through the thousands of pages of primary texts. Moreoever, as I can attest, encountering a phenomenological text for the first time is a daunting experience, like trying to navigate through a large city without a map or guide. While there are several good introductory texts on phenomenology in general (Moran's for example), and many texts discussing the many phenomenologists, Sokolowski has graciously and generously given us a very general and useful introduction to the basic structures of phenomenology as a method. To this extent, Sokolowski's book is strongly Husserlian and, in some aspects, echoes in simplistic terms his very good 1974 book, Husserlian Meditations. This, however, is not to be taken as a deficit. To the contrary, Husserl is the recognized father of phenomenology, and also a writer of terse and often impenetrable verse. Thus, it behooves anyone wishing to begin to study phenomenology to get the gist first before delving into the more difficult texts.What Sokolowski has done for us is to simply explain phenomenology in much the same way one would explain their hobby or a good book they have read. That is to say that it is casual and clear, and very helpful and informative, without an excess of jargon or unnecessary info. However, Sokolowski does go through pains to clarify and define the terminology implcit in phenomenology, e.g., terms such as noetic, noema, parts, wholes, eidetic intuition, etc.I cannot agree with one of the reviewers below, who claims that an introduction to phenomenology ought to be historical. For as much as phenomenology evolved since Husserl, it is indeed important to see it in such an historical context, however, when considering phenomenology simply as a method one does not need to know how it was transformed by Heidegger or Sartre. Further, I cannot help but feel comparison to Dermot Moran's sweeping and powerful Introduction to Phenomenology to be misguided; in either case the intentions are different. Besides, Sokolowski does mention the variations of phenomenology over the past century. All the same, the province of Sokolowski's book is an attempt to help us understand HOW TO DO PHENOMENOLOGY, as opposed to other aspects of phenomenolgy such as its history and context."},{"Title":"Introduction to Phenomenology","review":"This book describes the human experience of phenomenology in a natural language without assuming a previous knowledge of the relevant philosophers or concepts. It easily guides the reader into the subject and invites her/him to participate in this human experience by exposing it as relevant to the natural daily life. By this participation some important concepts are developed and made clear much more than may be attained by rote memorizing without a suitable context. However, the historical development of the phenomenological movement and its main figures are only mentionted in a brief sketchy way at the end of the book. Therefore this book is more like a good &quot;appetizer&quot; to studying the subject rather than standing, by itself, as a main &quot;meal&quot;."},{"Title":"Introduction to Phenomenology","review":"Introduction to Phenomenology does a fine job of getting you started in phenomenology. It meticulously specifies the key themes (parts and wholes, identity in manifolds, absence and presence) and then carefully leads you through them. The fundamental, difficult-to-grasp ideas of intentionality, epoche and time consciousness are treated thoroughly and at an introductory level. The book follows a practice common in good math texts of returning again and again to the main themes, each time armed with more powerful tools.As a rule, I never read just one introduction to any topic. No matter how good your first choice is, you need a separate perspective. In this case I recommend Natanson's Edmund Husserl: Philosopher of Infinite Tasks. The two books are complementary. Natanson's book is rich and inspirational, but Sokolowski's book is a better introduction. Introduction to Phenomenology is also motivational; it extols the benefits of phenomenology while noting it does not conflict with the objective body of science.I keep rereading Introduction to Phenomenology and finding fresh insights. But the goal for me was to move on and read Husserl, in the excellent translations found, for example, in Donn Welton's The Essential Husserl. It is in Husserl's work that you find the mother lode of phenomenology. After mastering his vocabulary (via Sokolowski), you discover that Husserl writes carefully, methodically and clearly. At some point, you will even find Husserl easier to follow than most interpretive texts. So read Introduction to Phenomenology as the best first step in understanding phenomenology.Side note: I personally \`discovered' phenomenology in Gian-Carlo Rota's Indiscrete Thoughts and in Sokolowski's Foreword to that book. Thank you for that, Professor Sokolowski."},{"Title":"Introduction to Phenomenology","review":"As Cal Schrag notes in a fantastic litte essay called \\"The Recovery of the Phenomenological Subject\\": \\"In 1945 Maurice Merleau-Ponty began the preface to his classic work Phenomenologie de la perception, with the observation that the reader might find it odd that the question What is phenomenology? still needs to be answered one-half a century after the first writings of Edmund Husserl. The fact however remains, wrote Mereleau-Ponty, that this question still awaits an answer. Some fifty years after the publication of Merleau-Ponty's seminal work on perception we are still asking the question What is phenomenology?\\"I do not hesitate (well, maybe a little) to reply that reading this excellent book by Sokolowski will certainly put the beginner on the path to answering this difficult question. Perhaps it answers best What is Husserlian phenomenology? but what better place to begin the journey than at the beginning. This is certainly not a scholarly text. You will not find footnotes at the bottom of every page. You won't even get citations to Husserl's texts. And you certainly won't find anything like a ten-page analysis of the words \\"phenomenon\\" and \\"logos\\" as encountered at the outset of Heidegger's Being and Time. But it's not supposed to be a critical scholarly text, it is just what it says: an introduction to phenomenology.I think this text will be especially beneficial to readers who are familiar with philosophy but who stand outside the continental tradition - e.g. analytic philosophers. Also, those who already understand Husserl (or think they do) will find this book a fantastic read as well. Don't think that just because it is an introduction that it is beneath you. I think you will be suprised (and perhaps encouraged) by the ability of Sokolowski to state so clearly an answer to the question What is phenomenology?"},{"Title":"Introduction to Phenomenology","review":"This is an excellent introduction to phenomenology. While the history of phenomenology is fascinating and rewards serious study, this book, unlike others, cuts through the differences between phenomenological thinkers to the 'meat and bones' of the approach and presents the basic methods of phenomenological analysis in a clear and penetrating fashion. I found it thoroughly enjoyable and enlightening. Anyone interested in philosophy would do well to sit down with this book for a few hours. It could very well change the way you look at the world and the way you approach philosophical problems (for the better!). Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Introduction to Phenomenology","review":"The phenomenological tradition, an oft used misnomer for \\"Continental Philosophy,\\" diverges from Analytic philosophy in dramatic ways. One commentator stated, possibly disparagingly, that the Analytic side is all about problems while the Continental side is all about proper names. Regardless of that statement's veracity (both traditions seem equally addicted to eminent names), newcomers to phenomenology, or even to the Continental tradition altogether, will find the fibers of this book almost unsullied by proper names. In near defiance to the stereotype above, it seems populated with problems. For many of these it even suggests solutions. Though phenomenology comprises only part of the entire Continental lineage, it nonetheless played a massive role in that tradition's development. Heidegger and Sartre, names known everywhere, founded their thought in phenomenology and simultaneously expanded its influence and scope. Anyone desiring to understand either major figure's thought should ground themselves in the concepts, terminology, and approach of this introduction.Human experience provides the basis for phenomenology. No matter how \\"elevated\\" the cognition, in phenomenology our shared human faculties provide the foundation. In stark contrast to Cartesian, Humean, and Hobbesian conceptions, phenomenology puts full trust in our sensory experiences. This idea gets emphasized and reemphasized throughout the book. Not only that, most concepts receive illumination through repetition and other literary devices. This elucidates the subject matter to an exponential degree as well as moistening up what could have been a very dry read. It proves that the experience of reading about experience can entertain.Intentionality, the first chapter's subject, provides a good starting block for phenomenology. This concept connects our consciousness to the world. It essentially means that consciousness is consciousness \\"of\\" something. We're connected to the thing experienced, and our experiences make up a part of that thing's being. Our beings criss-cross and validate each other. The implications of this get discussed in great detail. Following this, the discussion explodes into phenomenology's three crucial structures: Parts and Wholes, Identity in Manifolds, and Presence in Absence. These three found the remaining discussions, from the Natural versus the Phenomenological Attitude, Categorial Intentionality, ego consciousness, and temporality, to the lifeworld, evidence, Eidetic Intuition, and intersubjectivity. Later chapters build on early ones. The whole edifice comes together in the final chapters. In true fashion, the parts found and construct the whole. Though not everything attains lucidity. The almost mystical notion of \\"Internal Time Consciousness\\" apparently requires more discussion than this book allows. Regardless, everything comes back to intentionality and the three basic structures.Although the discussion evades proper names for the most part, an appendix provides a short history of the field from Husserl to the present. The book in general follows Husserlian terminology. Overall, the unorthodox approach taken here fits well with the subject matter. Phenomenology is something that people can actually perform. Some consider it a science. In places, the discussion even attempts to expand natural sciences to a new level based on human experience. It even suggests in one place that modern indeterminancy in science originates from science's disinterest in the variation of human experience. Obviously not everyone will find the arguments, or even phenomenology itself, convincing. But as a reaction to \\"mind in a box\\" epistemology it at least provides a refreshing new perspective. It also puts the human being in the world fully connected. We are reality, reality is us. Anyone who wants insight into one of Continental philosophy's most influential movements should read this book cover to cover and repeat."},{"Title":"Introduction to Phenomenology","review":"I came to this book hoping to find an overview of phenomenology that wouldn't tax my middle-aged brain with dense prose or obscure jargon. It met my expectations fully. The writing is clear and graceful; phenomenology is related to broader cultural concerns (such as the rise of mathematized science); and the narrative tackles simple issues (such as perception and memory) before moving on to tough ones (such as temporality and language). Throughout, the \\"natural attitude\\" (our experience of the world) is contrasted with the \\"phenomenological attitude\\" (our reflection on the natural attitude). The book has whet my appetite for sampling the phenomenology canon.I gave the book only four stars because Sokolowski doesn't really engage with rival philosophical projects, especially analytic philosophy. To be fair, he does draw distinctions between phenomenology and analytical approaches to human experience; in particular, he rejects any suggestion that internal mental entities mediate our experience of the world. Unfortunately, he rarely grapples with analytic arguments in detail.Maybe it's unfair to expect this in an introductory work. However, given phenomenology's minority status in academia, most readers will have an analytic background. Sokowlowski needed to show them, with explicit arguments, why phenomenology gives a superior account of our experience. He rarely rose to this challenge. But with that caveat, I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in modern philosophy."},{"Title":"Introduction to Phenomenology","review":"This is the perfect book for anybody,who has no deep philosophical background,to understand the fundamentals of the Phenomenological movement.Together with D.Moran's Introduction,open the fascinating intellectual pathway to Phenomenology."},{"Title":"Introduction to Phenomenology","review":"Sokolowski's work is the perfect point of entry into a complex school of thought.

Mr. Niederhoffer is a consumate statistician; hence his trading philosphy is heavily biased towards various types of short term statistical relationships. However, I am guessing that he mainly relied on his discretion despite his mathematical proclivities. Victor paints a very doom and gloom picture for would be traders. It seems that he is projecting his failure onto us, the readers. I was also a bit irritated at his constant references to George Soros, whom we all know is the world's second best speculator. I do not know what compelled Mr.Niederhoffer to completely disregard a sound risk or money managment strategy on that fatefull day. Though I can say this, most people who take cheap shots at him really should not, they most likely do not even have an iota of Victor's intelligence. Many great speculators have blown out and come back with a vengence. Look at Richard Dennis. If Victor Niederhoffer were to make a comeback, I am certain he would have no problems raising the neccesary capital and in no time, reassert his dominance."},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"The Education of a Speculator is a long, sometimes meandering account of the life of speculator Victor Niederhoffer. There is no particular order to this book, at least that I could discern; Niederhoffer jumps from topic to topic, going backwards and forwards in time. The style is almost stream of consciousness, with the main subject of finance digressing into topics as diverse as biology, music and squash (the author is a serious player of squash and other racquet sports). In addition to Niederhoffer's unconventional style of writing, the book assumes a fairly high level of knowledge regarding financial markets. Those (such as this reviewer) who are not well versed in the kind of articles, charts and data found in the Wall Street Journal or Barron's will often find themselves in way over their heads. For all this, I still recommend The Education of a Speculator, even to people not especially interested in the world of investing. Victor Niederhoffer is what may be called a holistic or macro thinker; he could also be called a Renaissance man. He has knowledge of many subjects and sees the connecting links between all events, objects and disciplines. He may not be right about everything, but his perspective is always interesting, intelligent and original. He combines the streetwise instincts of Brooklyn, where he grew up, with the scholarly mindset of Harvard, where he both graduated from and taught. As for investing itself, Niederhoffer, like many speculators (at one point he describes the overlapping definitions of an investor, a speculator and a gambler), has had many ups and downs in his life. When this book was written, he was at the top of his game; shortly afterwards he was wiped out. That, of course, was several years ago and he is still active as a writer (he has recently written a new book) and investor. I have always been fascinated with the world of investing, especially the kind of volatile speculating engaged in by people like Niederhoffer. Even if you don't understand all the details and nuances, the book conveys the dangers and excitement of this unpredictable universe. The author has spent many years compiling and analyzing data concerning markets, and he discusses how difficult it is to make predictions based on past performance. It is easy to look at a chart and, after the fact, describe how stocks or commodities moved in a logical, predictable manner. Often when you try to apply any seemingly logical system using real money, the results are disastrous. Niederhoffer seems to conclude that markets are paradoxical -they are both logical and illogical; sometimes they follow patterns but sometimes they are chaotic. And, most importantly, we can never be sure when order or chaos will prevail. If there is one overall lesson we can take from The Education of a Speculator, it is probably something like this -reality is almost infinitely complex with every part connected to every other part, the whole thing organized by some vast pattern that can only occasionally be comprehended."},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"In finance, &quot;The Black Box&quot; describes a hidden and usually quantitative process an investor might employ to select securities or markets. The author clearly employs such a box in his work though it seems completely subjective. The problem is, he does not see fit to explain the inputs; the book reads like a mystery novel without a resolution. In his defense, he does say, at the outset, that he is not going to teach you his methods. Yet you expect more. The book is a long (very long) recounting of his own personal history (including odd digressions on Coney Island, and his father, whom he worships through a nine-year old's eyes) as well as his interests--how these things created the savant. As Flaubert might say, it's the stuff of his &quot;Sentimental Education.&quot; But investing is not strictly literary. Imagine a Brain Surgeon explaining his techniques by alluding to his liberal arts term papers and you'll grasp the essential frustation with the book. For example, the author equates trading with the performance and appreciation of symphonic music. Indeed, he says he hires musicians to move millions in options money. Why? He doesn't elaborate; only that they are better. Horse Racing is another analogy he mentions. But what are the statistical underpinnings? How does a Racing Form connect to the Wall Street Journal? One more: He claims that only old literature can train your senses for the markets. This strikes me as absolute hogwash, a philistine bowing to Aristotle to gain class. In all, it's as though he is trying to intellectualize his profession, as if just making money is vulgar; he's staking a claim for traders in the pantheon of artists. Of course, many of his points are good ones, but there are not enough of them (a few equations would have helped). Indeed, the book comes off as an exercise in self-congratulation. And God knows what debt he owes George Soros, venerated here with religous adoration. Strange, indeed. (OK, I admit I bought a Soros book after reading this one. He at least ties his ideas to the markets.) Next time, Victor, tell us your secrets. The good ones."},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"This is a brain dump written without much apparent discipline. Niederhoffer's egotism and hubris can grate at times and the book is somewhat self serving e.g. the circumstances that led to his quitting squash for five years were not quite as they seemed.However there is a lot of good material and if you like ideas you will enjoy the way he ties many different fields back to trading. Some of the ideas are baloney but many are not. I found it useful because it does give a lot of insight into how a top trader thinks.From reading the book it was quite obvious he would blow up at some stage, which he has in fact done.The chapter on the ecology of markets is worth the price alone. Also the one on the interconnectness of markets, and on deception and gamesmanship.However this should definitely not be your only book on trading. There is hardly any useful material on risk management.Worth a read IMO but a lot of people will not like it i.e. those looking for a cookbook approach to easy wealth."},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"An interesting book about an interesting guy for those readers who like biographies and philosophical meanderings. Unfortunately, few practical investing insights are shared other than the one above (which I agree with!) To his ethical credit, Neiderhoffer puts the reader on notice in the first few pages that no great investing secrets will be disclosed as this would cost him (and the reader) the advantage. However, judging from the way Neiderhoffer lost his clients' money (heavily margined bet long on the S&amp;P500 futures just before the Asian meltdown) with no offsetting put hedge (oi vay!), I am pleased he did not share his &quot;secrets&quot;."},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"I purchased Mr. Niederhoffer's book after his much publicized debacle in the stock market in October, in an attempt to understand what could have motivated him to take the risks that brought his trading career to an end. What I got out of the book, besides a plethora of shameless self-aggrandizement was reinforcement to the old adage that sometimes, it is better to take than to give advice. Mr. Niederhoffer's herky-jerky style and numerous tangential forays into the &quot;academic &amp; philosophical &quot; foundation of speculation do nothing to keep the readers attention or interest and at best comes across as intellectual chauvanism. This approach to the subject, liberally sprinkled with accounts of what a big lasagna he is (was?), makes for a tedious and sometimes annoying read. A point worth highlighting was, his accurate description of the &quot;HOO-DOO&quot; or &quot;tipster&quot; (in laymans parlance) and his recollection of meeting Ivan Boetsky, in the prime of his career, and regarding him in this light. From Niederhoffer's accounts of how many times he was closing to losing the &quot;farm&quot; and his repeat mistakes in the markets, calling Boetsky a HOO-DOO smacked a bit hypocritical. To say that Victor Niederhoffer was an accident waiting to happen is a fair assesment of the book. (Ironically, his best friend George Soros seemed to think so, as Niederhoffer so proudly boasts in the opening chapter.) Playing the absent-minded professor in the reality of the modern financial world can exact a tremendous price. Sadly, Niederhoffer was too busy telling everyone else this, and forgot to take into account his same weaknesses."},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"If you expect something like Pit Bull, Reminiscences of a stock operator, market wizards (I&II), Trader vic, Investment Quotient etc etc, you will be worse off than even disappointed. This book takes you to anywhere but successful investment and trading. Talking about trading and investment there are plenty of good ones out there for you to pick instead of wasting your time and money on this. I dont understand how some reviewers say it's a must for the traders or investors. Quite the opposite, as a professional trader, this one is excellent to sell short."},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"The author obviously knows his subject but is overawedby his own expertise. A trend spotter par excellence, this book both makes a mockery of trends (he always bets against) and also subjects trend analysis to the kind of stupefying statisitical fury which is at core devoid of meaning. In a fit of Wall Street honesty he reminds us that no book of this price would detail any effective scheme of success even if it was available, which perhaps it isn't. (Note: in Niederhoffers World, that conclusion would probably spawn a derivative) Suffice it to say that if you can't spot the fool in this book, then you are the fool. Norm Marcu"},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"As many already know, Niederhoffer has had quite a volatile, and highly publicized career as a speculator. But it is pure naivety and ignorance for people to brush his work off merely because of the two blow ups he had in his fund. In fact, if anything, these two events have, in my opinion, made Niederhoffer's perspective exponentially more valuable than most modern financial literature on the subject.With that said, I must disagree with his view on statistical inference and its role in market speculation. Although statistical inference is valid as a data point, when one uses it as their primary and sole validation of any trade premise, the risk they expose themselves to is far too high. The foundation of his theories are based on using prior statistical probabilities to validate a trade. In other words, if the odds of a trade blowing up in your face are 1 in 1000, then it's a good trade. But if you don't consider what is going on in the macro environment, the overall sentiment of market participants, and other \\"subjective\\" data sets, then you risk exposing yourself to a situation where you make a massive long bet on the S&P; futures at a time when the market is in a freefall because of some geo-political and/or financial event such as a Russian debt default, or Asian financial meltdown. This is the scenario that blew Niederhoffer up, but the interesting thing to note is that the \\"trade\\" itself had already caused significant loss in a prior event. So what does that tell you about statistical inference?The value in this book is what you gain from his anectdotes and insights. Although he has a tendancy to go off on a tangent and lose you, if you can keep your focus, this book will provide you with invaluable insight into the mind of one of this generations most experienced market operators.And his comparison of a classical symphony with the Japanese Yen is priceless, and can be worth the price of this book in itself.I have personally read this book over 5 times by now, and I'm sure I'll read it again."},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"The author offers nothing that is not already known. In the preface he even states &quot;if I had decided to give away secrets and systems that I thought would have recurring value, [people who know me] would doubtless have prevailed on me not to spill the beans.&quot;So why would you want to read a book with no &quot;recurring value?&quot;Make sure you saved your receipt."},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"Just a bunch of BS about how good he is at playing squash.

This is one of the few opportunities we can get so up close and personal with a renowned speculator.

In fact, this book, along with market wizards, is one of my favs on finance and investment.This book is about the life of a speculator! And we all know that trading is not just about methodology and psychology.To be good at it, it has to be as large as life itself. Vic brings us through the world from his perspective as a speculator. I haven't seen another book that approaches financial speculation from such a multidisciplinary perspective.This book is definitely one of those that deserves to be read over and over again...as I'm sure new insights will be gained with each reading.

All accounts of the book being an exercise in ego massage are confirmed by Neiderhoffers attempt to justify his rubbish as a conspiracy of envy. What a laugh. I reviewed the book previously (see Victor Victorius)and gave it one star.~~~~~The book is not kind to the many poseurs, propagandists and Ponziists who populate the speculative world. It shows how the wisdom that ordinary people gain from their everyday activities involving games, music, gambling, nature, connections and counting can lead to much better prospects for success than the guidance authored by the 100 most renowned gurus and magicians. Unfortunately such breaking of taboos, including the depiction of the public in its usual niche in the market as a contributor of money to absorb the substantial overhead that keeps the market running is bound to raise the hackles and incur the wrath of many within the market ecosystem, e.g. the dealers, the brokers and the large speculators.

Other subscribers await my reviews of well know and highly respected experts because I am not afraid to identify their weak spots. So too with this author. He couldn't make it with money management and went bust and his books are a bust as well. He uses his supposed educational pedigree to impress propsective readers with his illogical conclusions. I once saw and tried to listen to a presentation he gave in Florida before the release of his book. His phony and empty-headed accomplice, wife? was there as well and someone accompanied him with a piano. Thank gosh the piano was sufficiently loud to drown his pompous, worthless gibberish. It would have been better had this inane book been accompanied by a loud CD that drowned out his drone. I would NOT read this book even if he paid me. It is truly an expression of this pompous egotisitcal loser and his empty excuses for failing with others' money.

I should know what to look for as I am just like Niederhoofer--we're both too cocky but at least my attitude is justified.

The book barely qualifies as a book on speculation. Instead, it is a long winded, rambling account of the author's (non-investing) life; after page upon page devoted to a topic other than speculating/investing (e.g. sports) he attempts to draw some parallel between the subject in question (e.g. sports) and speculating/investing. All too often, the analogies/parallels are weak to non-existent. For a book supposedly dedicated to speculating, remarkably little of it actually deals with this topic. There can be no doubt the author has tremendous knowledge; he simply choses not to share it with his readers in this offering. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"Victor Niederhoffer is one of the true originals in the investment world. Born to a poor Jewish family in Brooklyn, he became world champion of the ultra-WASP game of squash and then, as an academic, he challenged the prevailing \\"random walk\\" theory in papers that are still widely cited as classics. He is in the thick of the debates among today's statistical stars. Not content to stay in the ivory tower, he raised his first trading stake from the mergers-and-acquisitions business he founded, which was the first to concentrate on selling small businesses --and went on to achieve the best record of any hedge fund, in all periods.Here's a guy who has a lot to tell about trading, business and life, and the style to tell it well. Education of a Speculator gives the reader a unique combination of quantitative sophistication, street wisdom and a scholarly grasp of market history. The bibliography alone is worth the price of the book. EdSpec is so rich that you come back to it again and again. There is simply no book like this one.

If you want to read about a real man, Vic's father Artie -- scholar, athlete, cop, loving father -- read Education of a Speculator. If you want to know how a great mind approaches the day-to-day fray of trading, read Education of a Speculator.

He also shows you what it takes to be an investor in a 24 hour market,currency exchange. I read this book to round out my 11 years of experience with futures and currency exchange. It definitely did that. He reminds you of what it takes to be successful and discipline is the core of that. ...It is unfortunate that his money management firm blew out.

Others don't look at risks and jump... just like life and the markets. So your goals is to think like the few who think different and win, by using your head. It amazes me to see how many people regard certain things as life and market truisms when they are just based on slogins and irrational thinking.

It isn't perfect-- for one thing, he focuses way too much on sports and thinks they're far too important. Also, he's a speculator, which I don't think is so great. All investors prey off the market for their living, but I think speculators particularly are rewarded out of tune with what they provide the world, which is nothing. They certainly do absorb risk, however, which is the ultimate necessity of a true free market soceity.

I am sure his dad was a great guy but I don't want to read about how his mother and father met and got married. Then every once in a while he will throw in something about the markets and some study that he has done. The studies and the text after them are really good if he would have stuck to that topic it would be a decent book.Also it is very hard to read. In one paragrah he would be talking about his uncle Howie's strategy in handball and then burst right into speculating the next paragraph without really even trying to connect the two.

Too many 50 cent words. The Webster definition of eloquince is to say a whole lot with few words. He is nothing of the sort.

A good reference book for those contemplating suicide after a bad trade or regular market losers. The reason I did give it a star instead of 0 is that there is wisdom buried deep within the stories.

How simple, and yet so rare! It's hard to imagine anyone arguing with this premise. This is not a perfect book, Mr. Niederhoffer goes somewhat far afield to make some of his points. But it is generally quite well-written and profound. I see that many have seized with delight the fact that the author suffered a severe financial setback not long after the book's publication. However, from what I can gather, his real mistake was not following his own advice! (He apparently bought into emerging markets too early based mainly on widespread pessimism, without being able to sufficiently quantify same.) I expect that Niederhoffer will be back on top again someday, even wiser than before. But in the meantime, please don't buy this book. The more of you that trade without using logic, the better my odds."},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"Anybody who wants a solid foundation in trading should read Education of a Speculator. I don't know of any other trading book that includes a street-wise knowledge of bookmaking and an appreciation of classical music. Victor Niederhoffer is one of the most brilliant characters on the Street, and his tales of growing up in Brooklyn make this the best read of any trading book in print."},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"I read Victor\`s book more than 8 times before I decided to write an online review.A harvard statistician with a PHD in finance, Niederhoffer knows exactly what he is talking about.Although I don\`t agree with Niederhoffer about how great Soros is, I almost agree about every thing else including the mumbo jumbo called the Elliott Wave,&amp; Gann analysis that nobody else dared to criticize.

In these fields you occasionally run into that guy. The guy who is either so smart nobody can understand him, or he's a manic-depressive frothing in a mania stage. Either way, \\"that guy's\\" nervous system is obviously wired to a higher pitch than mine ever will be; at least without chemical additives or surgury. Reading the book is like talking to that scary smart manic guy. It's always humbling running into \\"that guy.\\" Niederhoffer is that guy. He ranges wildly from stories of his colorful youth in a working class neighborhood in NYC (which actually did remind me of Feynman's stories) to horse racing, to squash, to trading FOREX. He goes so fast, you can barely keep up with him, even in a leisurely read. Why is he talking about handball? I thought he was just talking about liquidity? Checkers? And how does Jesse Livermore fit in? Read it and see.Niederhoffer is the type of man I admire the most; he has physical courage, he's brilliant, he loves his family and friends, he beats the system with wit and street smarts and he comes from humble means. He managed to get a system for gaming the GPA named after him. He was a world champion at Squash. He was an early pioneer of direct marketing private equity funds. He was an early skeptic of the efficient market hypothesis (what would traders get paid for if the markets were efficient?). He was a professor at U.C. Berkeley. He built (and lost, in a story I hope the next edition of his book documents, and, stunningly, built again) a great fortune. His story is completely mind boggling; the world is a better place for his having lived his story in it, and you'll be a better person for absorbing his insights about the world.Beyond my gushing over his yarn spinning, if you're a careful reader, and you know something about markets, you can pick up some pretty serious insight from his descriptions of his day to day work. The only other book I got a feel for the markets like this was Larry Harris' book on Trading and Exchanges, and that was nowhere near as much fun to read."},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"I first read this book in 1998 and have returned to absorb its contents twice per year since then.It is a work of science and a tribute to an obviously admired and loved man, Mr. Niederhoffer's father.First the science - Dr. Niederhoffer provides ample avenues of exploration for the inquiring mind (some that lead to nowhere and some that have provided this reviewer with significant, statistically relvant opportunities).The book enumerates on a variety of studies....I encourage all readers to update Dr. Niederhoffers work with data up to the present day and apply it (perhaps with one's own bells and whistles attached), always taking note of - and quantifying the contents of Chapters 8 & 9.As to the parts of the book that deal with Artie Niederhoffer (Mr. Niederhoffer's father), well, they will mean different things to different people but hopefully we can all pass on to our own children just a small fraction of Artie's wisdom.A genuinely cathartic book for this humble speculator."},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"There is a lot of wisdom in this book, the wisdom of a trader. This book rides the fence of autobiography and reference manual. It is not an &quot;easy&quot; read. The first chapter was great - an easy flowing and very interesting autobiographical story.

I am myself a professional trader and an avid reader of a spectrum of financial literature ranging from classics like &quot;Reminiscence of a Stock Operator&quot; to modern works like &quot;Alchemy of Finance.&quot; The book itself, in the fashion that it was written, lacks the very skills that are invaluable to all traders: Focus, continuity, objective and clarity. As a teaching aid, &quot;The Education of a Speculator&quot; certainly does not teach by example. &quot;There is the everyday fool who does everything wrong all the time and then there's the Wall Street fool who makes a buck an feels compelled to write about it&quot; (an adaptation from Reminiscence).

I really expected more. Some insight on how to come up with good ideas, something, anything. No delivery."},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"The book is really provocative, so it's hard to write an objective review. Here is some idea. I boy from a pretty poor family grows up in Brighton Beach. Life is pretty tough, but he is making it up there. Finaly he becomes a top player in squash and his risky speculations makes them a pretty famous in financial circles. The emotions are sort of overwhelming this guy. He needs to talk about that. He doesn't really care if anyone is interested, he just wants to talk. The book is a brain dump. It's a sort of a pre Internet blog. The author jumps from topic to topic, making provocative statements, speaks from a position of a superior player and speculator.Yes, I have to admit, there are a lot of interesting thoughts spread across the book. But don't be mislead. This book is not about the markets. It's not about a specualtor, it is about the speculator - the author. It is more a celebrity autobiography then a financial guide.The celebrity status is also arguable. The author is proud of being close to Soros, but they are people of a very different caliber. The author was trying to understand the market and Soros was actually making the market in his best days. The author's results were ranging from very impressive gains to total bust, so I wouldn't follow him blindly. The book was written at his peak, so it's clearly shows some overconfidence is the author's exceptional abilitites.Overall, you'll probably either love this book or hate it. Just check out a few pages to find it out."},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"Another reviewer called this book a brain-dump and I can't possibly top that for visual effect or appropriateness when describing this useless book. I learned nothing that I didn't already know about trading and was subjected to painful stories about his boring family. The tone of the book is insufferably haughty, snobbish and condescending. He talks about how great he is in one sentence, followed by a declaration of his humility in the next. If you want to know where Niederhoffer's parents played handball during the winter, this book is for you. If you are looking for a real book about trading, buy Market Wizards."},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"In 1960, Victor Niederhoffer picked up a squash racket for the first time as a Harvard undergraduate. He boldly declared he would be the be the best squash player ever. He started to practice one shot, hours a day for a month, or until he mastered the shot. A few years later he won the U.S. intercollegiate championship, and eventually beat the best player in the world, Sharif Khan. Victor won the U.S title five times in his career.A pathological desire to be the best is only one of Victor's traits.The Education of a Speculator is a mostly autobiographical account of Victor's life, and how his interest in sports, board games, literature, music, poker, gave him the skill set to be a winner.The great philosopher of risk and randomness Nassim Taleb once said that the best way to judge a person's intellectual depth is to go to his place and look at his personal library. Well, Victor's 20,000 square foot Connecticut mansion contains over 15,000 books. Taleb also said, \\"You have to do things to get the point.\\"Victor's financial education started as an eight year old boy at Brooklyns's Brighton Beach. He learned to bet on stoopball , paddleball, and checkers. He hung out with adults like Louie the Liar, Sam Silver, the Milkman, Bitter Irving, Bookie, Nervous Phil, the Martian, the Indian, Rugged,the Ganef, and of course the Butcher.On page 11 of the book Victor states: \\"Manhattan and Wall Street seemed miles away when I was growing up. Brighton was the Harvard of my education as a speculator. The games, bargains, music, sex, and fauna taught me to appreciate the earthy and nitty-gritty. That's the proper foundation for buying low and selling high, the trade of a speculator.\\"In addition, Victor received guidance form his father (and hero) Artie. Artie was a cop with a LLB from Brooklyn Law School. Television was not allowed in their 700 square foot apartment, which was lined wall to wall, top to bottom with books, supplemented with twice weekly visits to the library.As a Harvard undergraduate, Victor would spend much of his time at the racetrack, or playing poker, honing his risk taking skills.This book has some of the most fascinating insights and quotes.pg 113 \\"Risk taking...is positively correlated with how well we feel about ourselves.\\"pg 206 \\"One thing is for sure. Among the emotionally charged, you will not find one single long-term winner.\\"pg 207 \\"...chain smoking, temper tantrums, screaming...these expressions of emotion have within them the seeds of destruction. I enforce a ban against all jocularity and temper tantrums.\\"pg 188 \\"Offering advice without expertise is aggressive ignorance.\\"pg 85 \\"With the increasing specialization in modern times, born losers are commonplace.\\"pg 95 \\"During the 10 years I traded for George Soros, I never heard him speak about a winning trade. To hear him talk, you'd think he had nothing but losers. Conversely, listening to the biggest losers, you'd think they had nothing but winners.\\"pg 114 \\"Do not follow the mentally lazy habit of allowing a newspaper or a broker or a wise friend to do our security market thinking.\\"pg 129 \\"The best opportunities come out of the clear blue.\\"pg 353 \\"The exchange is a market ecosystem.\\"pg 64 \\"Oracles, forecasts, and prophecies are a business. They should be evaluated with the same skepticism and savvy that would be applied to a used-car dealership.\\"One of the themes of this book is that one must be a non-conformist to succeed. A TRUE non-conformist, not the superficial kind.In the preface Niederhoffer states: \\"The only newspaper I read is the National Enquirer. I don't own a television, don't follow the news, don't talk to anyone during the trading day, and don't like to read books less than 100 years old.\\"pg 110 \\"My resistance to conformity has been the bedrock of my speculative persona.\\"pg 110 \\"...institutional learning, like the Harvard Colleges and Lincoln High Schools of Life - the kind that prepares most of us to become good soldiers, true believers, and conformists.\\"pg 136 \\"an incapability of relying on oneself and faith in others are precisely the conditions that compel brutes to live in herds.\\" A quote from Niederhoffer's intellectual hero, Francis GaltonNow, many people will not read this book because of Victor's famous 'blow-up' in 1997 when his fund collapsed.'Reminiscences of a Stock Operator' is considered one of the finest financial books ever written, even though Jesse Livermore went bust 3 times and committed suicide.The Education of a Speculator is just so unique, the only investment book with chapters on sex and music.Also, chapters on winning and self-reliance, deception and charts, delphic oracles and science, and connections to monitor, etc. As you read the book it is the DEPTH of Victor's knowledge that will most impress you. George Soros was so impressed with Niederhoffer that he sent his son to work for him so he could learn from Victor.It is this depth of knowledge that enables Victor to see connections and make analogies that others miss.All subtle thinkers are multi-disciplinary.In summation, in a world where watching the Discovery Channel is considered an intellectual achievement, a book like this will show people what an erudite, educated mind really is. I will end this review with a couple of quotes that summarize one on the main themes of this book.A child educated only at school is an uneducated child.George SantayanaSome drink deeply from the river of knowledge. Others only gargle.Woody Allen"},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"If you like biographies and trading, this is probably a book that you should read. It is quite entertaining. Some material is biographical and some more trading oriented. However if trading is more your focus I would strongly recommend first reading the same author's \\"Practical Speculation\\". If you like that book you can move onto this book.If you are more into learning about life through reading biographies, I would say that this book is pretty okay. The author have certainly had his ups and downs and that probably makes it easier to draw lessons out of this book.I have written several short reviews on trading books. The best way is to compare the score on the books I've read. Many reviews on amazon.com are just glorious 5 star reviews. I use all five categories; sorry but everything isn't \\"great\\". Books rated 5 are very good. Books rated 4 are good solid books well worth reading. Books rated 3 can be bought by some people who read a lot or have very specific needs. Books rated 1 or 2 I would not recommend buying or reading. Naturally all in my humble opinion."},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"Much like Jesse Livermore, Victor Niederhoffer speculates in the market using a form of intuition, vigorous study, and a lot of leverage. Risk management doesn't seem to be in his vocabulary, though he does seem to reccomend it. This book reads like a wonderful memoir should read, insightful into the life of a man, with the focus on how that life led the man into his profession. I frankly found the writing to be full of energy, action filled, poweful, had he not gone to become a speculator, he probably would've been a novelist of some sorts. There's some argument on the reviews of the quality of the man and his advice, since he did bust out, lose the money in his fund, and have to leverage everything to recover, but he is back in the swing a of it now. However, I think that's all beside the point.Victor Niederhoffer is a man who likes the challenge and is a contrarian by nature, it makes him act against he market, and steam forward with no stopping. Is it a great way of trading, if you don't mind an early trip of the grave from a heart attack, maybe. But that's not the point of this book. The point of this book isn't to teach you how to trade, he says that right from the book, but to give insight into what he took from his life, what he does when he goes into a trade, and what he does when he's winning and losing. This wasn't a book that gae you a trategy, it was a book about one man's education that could be any man's education, and how he uses it to amass wealth in the markets.Like Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, the story focuses on his journey, on his mistakes, on his victories, on the moments of elation and the moments of absolute dread. It's a fun, interesting read, not too long, so if you like the financial world, you may certainly enjoy this one, since it's cast of characters is both interesting and fun to enjoy. And, if you pay attention, and take it in, you might be able to learn from his mistakes, and get a few lessons as well from it."},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"I recently recommended this book to a friend who in turn quickly drew my attention to the wide range of opinions expressed in the reviews. Scanning through them I was astonished: if the vehemence of one's detractors is any kind of standard then the author is closing fast on Salman Rushdie. It appears his irreverence of mainstream trading systems has stirred up a vehement backlash among their most fervent adherents - one irate reviewer was so aggrieved he felt moved to lash out at the author's wife. That poor fellow is clearly beyond consolation, but it is remarkable that his more level-headed brethren have almost universally missed Niederhoffer's central point: even the cleverest of systems is doomed to fail once everybody knows about it. Likewise it is just silly to berate the author for the quality or vagueness of his trading advice, since the publication of such advice would in any case render it worthless. While he clearly enjoys flaunting his wackier ideas, there is often more value in the tales of how Dr. Niederhoffer draws upon his own experiences and wider philosophy to generate trade ideas than in the specific ideas themselves. The valuable lesson is that the only way to beat the market is to keep on innovating and, if you find something that works, keep quiet about it."},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"If you've been trading and understand the market then you will appreciate this great book."},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"You will not find advice on how to get rich in this book.

Nonetheless, reading his anecdotes has given me certain insights."},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"Mr. Neiderhoffer didn't feed me, he taught me how to make bread."},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"Long on insight, but you will NOT have it spoon fed to you. Don't look for trite examples of how to invest. The book helps get the reader into the mind of a successful speculator. If you believe that success is its own justification, then Niederhoffer needs no justification - his trading is proof of his theories of market inefficiencies and speculators' contrarian attitudes. I would challenge my academic colleagues to prove, with their own trading, why he is wrong.I am sure that the book, if widely read, will rattle some cages and ruffle some feathers. Unfortunately, to get to the meat the reader must both slog through some redundancy in the presentation of the mind of the speculator and the history of V.Niederhoffer. After that, you still must be able to read through the lines and think for yourself - this is not a &quot;do it yourself&quot; manual.Excellent Chapter 15 on the &quot;Ecology of Markets.&quot; I use the feeding chain chart (Figure 15-1) in lecturing to university classes on Investments.

Niederhoffer explains through lessons learned in life and on the sports fields, the qualities required to be a good trader. Niederhoffer was rated the best futures trader for ten years before his fund blew up in 1997. He was also a national Squash champion. The reviewers who have critisized this book, are people who want to be given a system that will constantly beat the market. Such things are not sold for...This book shows you the mindset of one of the greatest traders ever, and is unusually generous with the insights provided. Neiderhoffers trading style is very statistically oriented, and he writes about the markets like a gambler writes about a sports event, talking more about probabilitys of success than strict fundimentals. His new book Adventures in Speculation is coming out in March, and I would advise pre ordering it."},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"If he's such a hot-shot, why does he have the time to write a book?

While the book isn't an instant step-by-step guide to getting rich in the markets, it does serve the author's stated intent of chronicling the experiences leading up to his successful career, exploring the relationships between music, games, science, sex, and other phenomena upon speculation, and presenting a way of thinking that may carry over into the reader's trading practices if they pay enough attention. I only hope everyone that reads the book does NOT pay enough attention"},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"There are some weak chapters (checkers and music for me) but overall Niederhoffer gives an honest voice to what being a \\"trader\\" is really like, and especially from the buy-side perspective. The most refreshing aspect is that he disabuses folks of how glamorous the life is. I resisted reading this book for years, and now regret it. While wordy and at times brutally personal, it is quite real in a way that no other book on hedge fund and trading life has ever really captured. Strongly reccomended."},{"Title":"The Education of a Speculator","review":"It was hard following allot of Vickie's work because it is in the currency & bonds markets. That aside, Vickie writes in a rambling stream of consciousness style that reels you in. He is a good writer though the book is not that well edited.All that aside, Vickie gives tons of facts and stats showing you different aspects of trading & the importance of a trading system based in science not ART (i.e. feel).Vic makes one think allot about one's methods, whether it be trend or discretionary following, technical or fundamental analysis. Vickie is like Larry William's a 'contextual analyst' & that's the good part. The bad part & why Vickie really died in the Asian crisis was his non-belief in risk management. In fact unfortunately Vic is a contrarian from the get-go for no other reason than he is too smart, too quick, too good and believes he is immortal.Vic now writes for Moneycentral and (another website) & he often sling barbs; you can learn allot from the interchange.But in the end, I know Vic doesn't want to hear this, but it is really is an update of Livermore's Reminiscences of a Stock Operator (and Vic' grandfather knew the boy wonder :-). In both cases, MONEY management would have averted the fall. But Vic doesn't 'believe' in it. A shame.The Education is an important book from which to learn the humility of man and the importance of God. Vic instead takes faith in the synchronicity of Nature as though it can save him. One can only hope that Vic ultimately learns that his contrary atheism did him in so that he can take his place among the greats...in the mean time read it & learn.

There is a lot of fluff and self-gratification in the book but if you can grasp the importance of that single thesis and make use of it in your practical speculation that'll pay you back far beyond the price you paid for this book.

The book is a rich tapestry, full of great one-liners about stock trends, such as &quot;you can't catch a falling knife.&quot; Readers who can't find a &quot;get rich quick&quot; method here have precisely missed Victor's point!

The first is the family upbringing and the kind of theology one grew up with. Here Updike alludes that theology matters. We see this from Rabbit's interaction with Jack Ecles, an Episcopalian minister who despite a sincere desire to restore his broken relationship with his wife and in-laws, fails miserably in his efforts due to a defective view of man, sin, God and atonement. The people Rabbit grew up with are also a big influence that makes him the person that he is; his buddies in the army and his high-school basketball coach Marty Tothero. All these factors seem to work together to mold Rabbit into an irresponsible person who can't stand the painful realities and responsibilities in personal relationships, specifically in marriage that tragically leads to the death of his baby. I don't view the characters in this story derisively; Rabbit, his wife Janice, his parents and in-laws, Marty, Ruth, and Jack, but with sympathy since everyone is liable to similar predicaments. From a Christian perspective, they underscore the need of the gospel of Jesus Christ that deals head-on with the fundamental problem with humanity, namely, sin."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Read it ten years ago and still it stirs inside.If you enjoyed this book, \\"The Devil's Advocate\\" by Morris West is another notable work with themes of equal depth."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Rabbit, Run is one of Updike's famous books, in which he describes a 26-year-old's midlife crisis. A former high-school basketball star, Harry (&quot;Rabbit&quot;) Angstrom realizes that his life is in a rut when he plays against some youths. It also dawns on him that his marriage is also lifeless and empty -- his pregnant wife is an alcoholic and his job is insipid.Seeing nothing for him, Rabbit's solution to the problem is to run away. Living in Pennsylvania, he drives down to West Virginia and then back to help clear his mind. He meets his former coach who introduces him to Ruth, a prostitute. Rabbit and her have a passionate relationship. This unconventional situation only rooks him into a new routine -- one that he feels he must escape from. Despite help from the local minister, Rabbit feels that people are trying to con him into a pattern into life -- one that he isn't happy with.I couldn't make up my mind whether to root for Rabbit or look at him as a sorry individual. He is struggling for an identity, but every time he escapes, he leaves disaster and grief behind him. In addition, Updike asks the question, what moral responsibilities do people have versus their personal freedom and indentity? Updike's writing is strong and often times poetic. However, I found some of the symbolism and ephanies a little hard to grasp (even after several rereads). Some of the tense scenes were also written abstractly. This book is also not for children; there are many sexual situations."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Years after first reading Rabbit, Run, I still look for it on bookstore shelves so I can reread the first several paragraphs. They describe a young man shooting a basket in an alley, but the words are poetry. They're music. The whole book is like that: heavenly words about the mundane life of an earthy everyman. The book's not for everyone - my wife can't get past the first page in any Updike book - but I loved the entire series."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"This book was about a man named Harry who never tried to solve his problems. He always ran away from them and didn't try to handle them. This book gives you and idea on how hard it is to make the right decisions through your life and how hard it is being an adult. I really enjoyed reading this book, and I would give it a 10 because it seemed so realistic. It gave me a better understanding of how difficult life really is. At first, I didn't want to read this book because it seemed so boring, long, and pointless, but once you start reading it, you would want to keep on reading to find out the outcomes of each chapter. I would recommend this book to both young and old readers because it is easy to understand, unless they wouldn't want to be reading a book using lots of profanity."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"I've been trying to decide what to include in this review in terms of why this book is one of my least favorites.

Maybe because it claims to be, according to the author, a response to On The Road which, whatever its flaws has, a vital positive energy sparkling in it. The difference is that Kerouac actually WENT on the road and writes largely from personal experience with one of the most distinctive voices in American literature, whereas this book piles up quant intellectual metaphors about insignificant details in the lives of characters in situations utterly devoid of any redeeming value. This is just a cheap armchair attempt to spray-paint a thick coat of weakness and pity over human nature. I don't think reducing people and situations to their lowest potential is a noble attempt at literary realism... it's just pathetic. The message of the book as a whole is that no substantial goodness is possible in life, or to use the vernacular- life sucks. I disagree. The only thing that sucks is Updike's portrayal of life! If, however, you're all gung-ho about original sin, get several copies and build an altar to self-pity."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Read this book just to see how a terrible, pretentious little author could one day grow up to be the great John Updike. Astonishingly bad ... and that's working with a pretty cool story. Yes, Rabbit Angstrom is a hateful, inconsiderate little twerp ... but it's a story worth hearing. How the story's told, though, the language, the writing is so awful it cannot be parodied effectively. For example, this book contains what must be the worst English sentence ever written. Updike, describing the conclusion of a sex act, says, \\"His sea of seed buckles and sobs into a still chamber.\\" Oh dear. And yes, the author became a titan.

How many times have you actually done it, though? Rabbit feels what we feel, but the main difference between him and most of the rest of society is that he doesn't seem to care about those he leaves behind. He feels he can run, and that everyone will still love him and accept him when and if he ever returns. I don't like Rabbit, but I do like the book. I'm glad John Updike had the guts to write about a side of human nature that is despised. He no doubt catches criticism because it looks like he is glorifying this deplorable person. I don't feel that Rabbit was ever intended to be liked by us, or even felt sorry for. I feel more sorry for his family and friends whose lives he has wrecked, than for him.As a side note, I was very surprised to read that Rabbit's daughter was born in St. Joseph's Hospital in Brewer, PA (in real life: Reading, PA).

People think that Stephen King is a hack, but i feel the guy can tell a great story, develop interesting characters, and can get deep without being confusing. i don't like fluff, but i don't wan't to have to get cliff notes to understand what the author is trying to say. i think simplicity and directness is often the better road to take."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"My husband told me he wanted a copy of \\"Rabbit, Run\\" for his birthday, and even though I knew he didn't need a first edition or signed copy, I knew he wouldn't want just a boring paperback edition.

He has no diction, his prose is frightful, and he certainly isn't going to convert anyone with Rabbit Run, a pitiful waste of paper, as pretentious as it is creepy. What we have here is another sob story of a man who needs to grow up instead of playing basketball all the time. He's not going to make the N.B.A. So why doesn't he put down the ball? Updike's entire novel centers around this question, trying to make the case that just because Rabbit is no good at basketball doesn't mean he shouldn't play. Please. I suggest Moby Dick, this is pretentious trash."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"In essence Updike is an arrogant clown. The 'About the Author' on the back flap of the book states his name, where and when he was born, that he attended Harvard and Oxford, wrote for the New Yorker, and that he writes books. In the picture he effeminately holds a cigarette needlessly close to his face so it will be captured, along with his coy clown grin, in the photo. Then, in unparelleled audacity, there is a blurb from a review that is entirely in French (so 1 in 10,000 English readers will understand it) and another from the French review. To quote Harry from 'Dumb and Dumber:' \\"I don't know, Lloyd, the French are @ssholes.\\"Updike is one of the wise fools, too intelligent to be a worthy human being. I imagine he starts his day by elevating his nose with a stick before placing said stick in his @ss and ends his day by thinking up cutting remarks he can use to belittle those people who have souls before talking in his sleep just so he can hear the sound of his own voice all the time.That being said I really wanted to hate this book, and the first third is really quite terrible, but the second half is well done, redeeming the work as a whole. Outside of a few literary gimmicks, needless descriptions and pseudo-symbolism this may actually be a great novel, and I will pick up the second of the series."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"I can't speak to the quality of the item as I have not seen it.the delivery estimate was 3/23 - 4/7.

His depiction of late 1950's suburban life is brutal, and I can only imagine, all too real. The mastery in which he switches from Rabbit's to Rabbit's wife Janice's point-of-view, is breathtaking.I have to admit, about 160 pages in I was annoyed, ready to label Updike a pig, and about to shut the book. Some unameable instinct kicked in, and I kept going, and thank goodness. The narration redeemed itself with a shift into deeper complexity, and moral amibiguities. I recanted my distaste 10 pages later and completed the book in awe of Updike's skill.The novel more than holds its own 40 odd years after its initial publication. Do yourself a favor. Read it."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"The novel is great: well thought-out plot, psychological profundity in portrayal of its characters and their relations, language splendor and richness of images and similes are hallmarks of the oeuvre of John Updike, one of the best writers of the century. The use of present tense in the novel makes its readers not onlookers but participants of the tragical events.The author does not despise his main character Harry 'Rabbit' Angstrom but tries to depict impartially and understand him. Rabbit, a man who once was a first-rate basketball player, in the beginning of his mature life becomes an apprehensive son, indifferent father, inattentive husband, lustful but callous lover. He thinks only about himself, he is ready to run from any obstacle or trouble (his wife, his lover or any person who does not want to do what Harry desires), 'he doesn't care who he hurts or how much'. Gratifying his selfishness and feebleness in solving ethical problems, he leaves behind only disenchantment, pain and even death. His former lover fairly tells him: 'You're Mr.Death himself. You're not just nothing, you're worse than nothing. You're not a rat, you don't stink, you're not enough to stink.'One of the main characters of the novel is a priest, there are a lot of church-goers (including Rabbit himself) on its pages, they speak about God but do not have faith. Their sanctimony corrupts people. Even such unbelievers as Ruth, a call girl and Rabbit's lover, and Lucy, priest's willful wife, look more sincere than their pious milieu (Lucy about Rabbit: 'If he's a Christian thank God I'm not one').So, who is Rabbit? A monster? No, the author tells us, he is just an ordinary modern man devoided of moral responsibility."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"I read the Rabbit series in the mid-1990s.

At the end of the summer, I found out that the other camp counselors thought I was spending all my spare time reading the Bible.

One star? Come on! Rabbit Angstrom is the definition of the much misused phrase Existential Hero. If the Nobel committee wasn't so busy being everything but American this novel alone would have/should have gotten Updike the prize. There isn't an American novelist except F Scott Fitzgerald who writes with the \\"colors\\" that Updike uses. Every sentence (read the description of the pork chops left to gel in their own fat after Rabbit's \\"Run\\") proves that the line between poetry and prose in the hands of a genius is blurred.If you've not read Updike and I've read everything he has ever written then get started!

How he reacts to it - by constantly running away - is demoralizing and depressing. His actions are motivated by his still-lingering youthful selfishness, and never does love enter into his relationships, which are created more out of convenience and need of a partner - any partner - than anything else. The characters in the book are normal, typical people, and their flaws drive the story. This ultimately results in a rather depressing story with little redemption, and it's just about impossible to like anything about Rabbit. About the only character I felt empathy for was Ruth. But that doesn't mean that it's not worth reading.I found Updike's writing and descriptions to be very good. Not too long winded, as some people think, and the symbolism was a another layer to the story. I grew up in this era (I would have been about the time of Rabbit's daughter), and I related to the descriptions of the people since they would have been my parents' generation."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Rabbit was not a person I could care about.

I've read Rabbit, Run a few times and enjoyed it as much or more on each occassion."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Rabbit, Run is the first of a series of books written by John Updike, featuring as its protagonist, Harry \\"Rabbit\\" Angstrom. In this introduction to Angstrom, we meet a young man in his mid-twenties, a resident of late 1950s Mt. Judge, Pennsylvania. Rabbit, a former high school basketball phenom, has followed up with a stint in the Army before settling down to marry a high school sweetheart.Taking a look at his pregnant, alcoholic, prematurely aging train wreck of a wife, his young son and his dead end job as seller of household kitchen appliances, Rabbit decides to bolt. Initially deciding to drive south to the Gulf, he only gets as far as West Virginia before turning around and returning to Mt. Judge, though not to his wife. The rest of the novel is an attempt by Rabbit to avoid responsibility for the current state of his life. Twenty-five is too early for a mid-life crisis.I can't help but be reminded of the Flashman series of novels, written by George MacDonald Fraser, in which we follow the exploits of one of the greatest ne'er-do-well wastrels in literary history, Harry Flashman. Unlike Rabbit Angstrom, however, Flashman is well aware of his shortcomings and actually celebrates his cowardice, selfishness and dishonesty. As a result, you can't help but like the fellow. No chance of that here, as Angstrom is simply a miserable human being who thinks he deserves better, when he deserves no more than his current set of circumstances, in fact even less. Nevertheless, it IS possible to enjoy a novel while despising the main character.While much of the writing is entertaining, it must be noted that at times, Updike seems to fly off on wild screeds of florid, almost unintelligible prose that leave the reader simply rolling his eyes; that does not even mention some of the bizarre punctuation. In sum, an interesting story featuring some magnificent writing and some over the top prose. Time well spent."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Updike rules! I like him, Cheever, Vonnegut, Thurber, and Paula Fox, among others. This one is a classic for sure."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Harry 'Rabbit' Angstrom was once king of the high school world, a star basketball player, tall and handsome, and able to get the girls. Now, several years on, he is married, frustrated and unsure as to how it all ended up this way. One day, arriving home to his alcoholic, dreary wife and his meager home, he snaps. He will leave his wife, his responsibilities, his child. He will run.Rabbit turns to his former coach for advice, the old lecher introduces him to a part-time prostitute. He moves in with her the same night and they develop a dominant-submissive relationship, his affection existing only because it allows him to demand, hers because she knows no better. Like most of the other events in the story, this one is sad, gritty, and very real. Ruth, the plump good time girl, is a sympathetic character, and there are enough flashes of hard iron in her make-up that any sensation of her being a caricature or place-holder character fades.What Updike has done here is to create the dreary reality of a life that turned out not quite how you expected. Rabbit is a man at turns puzzled, the confident, then angry, then confused, but his emotions are never directed at himself. It is almost as though he is unable to analyse what lies within for fear that he will find something he doesn't like or - worse - nothing at all. When he acts, it is quick and unpredictable, but oddly, never out of character. Because he rarely internalises in the narrative, for the first half of the novel he is as much an enigma to us as he is to the other characters, but as the story develops, we begin to learn what makes him him, and while his actions never really lose that exciting touch of randomness, they always feel right in hindsight, justified.While evading his marital responsibilities, Rabbit and his wife's priest, Jack Eccles, form an unequal friendship. The priest is there to save Rabbit, to return him to the fold, to where he should be, but it is clear that the young man is as unsure about his world as anybody else. He doubts himself, he doubts his God. It is interesting that Rabbit actually draws strength from this indecision, allowing him to help as he is helped. It is made very clear that if Eccles had of been secure in his faith and in himself, he never would have been able to relate to Rabbit.When the novel was first printed, there was a lot of discussion about the overt, explicit sexuality of it. Forty years and more later, it is both difficult and easy to see why. Rabbit is a conscious sexual predator, an animalistic man who thinks about sex often, and loves women for being women. But today, that sort of outlook from a twenty-one year old man is not surprising, and is all but expected. Perhaps what still has the capacity to shock is his domination of women, his calm, measured attempts to make them submit - and they do. I can't help but wonder if that is another taboo that in a few decades will fade, just like the rest.Eventually Rabbit returns to his wife, but not in a triumphant, 'all is resolved' plot twist at the end of the novel. No, Updike does not take the easy way out, instead reuniting the pair a little over halfway through. And for what? A birth. His wife Janice is pregnant, to a little girl they name Rebecca. The events immediately preceding Rabbit's return to his wife are both sad and delicate, happy and horrifying.There is one scene that deserves special mention. I won't reveal what it is so that the plot can remain a surprise, but I must mention its power, both on the novel, the characters, and the reader. It is an urgent scene, horrible in its inevitability. From the opening paragraph, it is clear what is going to happen, and the fact that we, the reader, knows about it, makes it all the more terrible. I cannot praise Updike's skill as an author in this particular section, and it is worth the price of admission alone.To continue on that, Updike is an amazing wordsmith. He captures the unfriendly reality of everyone's life with ease. Only rarely dipping into lengthy sentences and almost never using literary tricks, Updike keeps his sentences short and sharp, his metaphors clear and crisp. Yet he never strays from what is real. Nobody is 'luminously beautiful', instead we have, 'Her hair in sunlight sprays red, brown, gold, white, and black across her pillow. Smiling with relief, he gts up on an elbow and kisses her solid slack cheek, admires its tough textures of pores.' In those two sentences, we are introduced to both the beauty and the reality of this sleeping woman, and it is wonderful. Throughout, Updike concentrates on reality, never fancifying or making a scene glib because he can. For every positive a character reveals, he shows us a - not a negative, never - but a neutral, a real, a grey. If a character was perfect, why would we care?The ending was, unfortunately, a little confused, and I am uncertain as to how he could have extended the story of Rabbit to three more books. However, based on every page, every sentence, every word that Updike used to create his marvellous narrative, I am convinced that he can pull it off. He was only twenty-nine when he wrote this book, but there is a wisdom and sensitivity throughout that many never touch - truly a stunning author."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Updike has a truly singular gift as a writer - he can chronicle the small pleasures and frustrations that we get from life's minutiae in gorgeous prose that's a delight to read, and makes one want to try to recapitulate the inner lives of his characters within oneself by walking around with a permanent sense of wonder.One would like to think, though, that a person could somehow manage to pull this off without becoming a totally self-absorbed, frivolous clown like Rabbit Angstrom. And all the golden epiphanies in the world can't disguise this fact about Updike's protagonist. I mean, this is a guy who runs out on his drunken wife, leaving her to look after a newborn infant unassisted, because she won't have nasty sex with him. As well as being a heel, he's also a crushing bore - his early mid-life crisis is just too predictable and timeworn a phenomenon to be made new for us by being described \\"from the inside.\\" As a result this book falls into the rather suspect category of novels that Raymond Williams identified as \\"the fiction of special pleading.\\" And the jury is not convinced.The solution to this sort of problem that comes up with a style of writing like Updike's has been discovered by his most devoted apostle (and to my mind, a far superior writer) Nicholson Baker, whose books utterly forego the conventional aims of narrative and sensibly stick to the minutiae. If you have an appetite for this sort of stuff, try out his novels _Vox_ and _The Fermata_."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"This is a beautifully written book about the fading joys of youth, the inexorable gloom of the ugly, cascading realities of adulthood, and the choices one can make with that deeply personal inner dialog.Why has it taken me so long to get to John Updike and this magnificent work of art? Again, I'm struck by the thought that if I'd been smart enough to read this as a younger man, it would have made me a different person. I wish I'd read this 30 years ago, although I note that Updike's observations and themes that resonate so congruently with me now really would have had no traction with the nave 19-year-old me.This book reminded of McCarthy's masterpieceSuttree. Both explore men who flee the stricture of adult responsibility. But freedom isn't free, as both books show, and that innate need for a man to connect with others--women, especially--keeps complicating things.I was also reminded of my favoriteCatch-22, both works ending with the protagonist--you love him or you hate him--taking off at a dead run. Yossarian and Harry Angstrom are on the lam, but from what and to what are the enthralling issues that make both books so compelling. I'm looking forward to the remaining threeRabbit books, but will space them out, to anticipate them more.Synopsis: After glorious high school basketball stardom, Harry \\"Rabbit\\" Angstrom, 26, is sick of his flat, predictable, mundane, inglorious job and family and life, and has to have something else. He abandons his pregnant wife and young son to explore his desires and possibilities in an early 1950s spring in a gray industrial Pennsylvania valley.Harry's running a lot, to and from things he hasn't taken the time to identify, or doesn't want to identify. He's too busy living in the now, just having fun being without any real responsibility.The truth of a real, pedestrian, routine life as an independent adult has finally landed on Harry, and it does not measure up to what he expected--and he seems to think he was promised--after his fantastic high school launch. His coach is unstable, quite possibly a repressed pedophile. His parents are beaten and angry, his in-laws ugly and distrustful snobs. All of this takes place in a stereotypical Pennsylvania industrial town, built on the side of the mountain, with another town on the other side, full of \\"them\\" and the typical, predictable, inescapable small-town jealousies, rivalries, resentment, class issues, etc. It's depressing and crushing, so what's the point, right?Updike's characters are magnificently defined, perfectly described, and utterly human. It is hard to decide if you like or dislike any of them, because at any moment they are lovely and loving, tender and kind, mature and self-sacrificing, but in the space of a page, and even from one sentence to another they turn ugly, resentful, scheming, immature, hateful and cruel. I know these kinds of people--they are everyone around me. And it's me, too. Updike makes his characters so fascinating because he unflinchingly makes them so human, showing us their inner observations and monologues, the things we never say but want to.Updike is exploring sexuality, mostly male sexuality, although he has a go at women's, too. It's not cheap or prurient, but (again) honest and straightforward, his narrative clear but not pornographic, getting at a fundamental aspects of who we are as living creatures, and how the rutting brute inside each of us really does struggle with the rational, moral and polite. The book's overall POV is masculine, as this is Harry's story.Updike has so much going on here: the burden of dead-end existence; the weight of adult responsibility; the pain and hypocrisy of dutiful wedlock; human sexuality; fulfillment and purpose; the nature of attraction; love, and its source and evolution; mortality and its incessant approach; yearning for growth; lost youth; the futility of life; the duality of beauty and ugliness; and a lot more.This being my first book of his, I loved Updike's detailed, lingering prose, so poetic and beautifully crafted, but also cinematic in its structure. It is not flowery, but has a wonderful texture and cadence, and surprisingly, is great to read aloud. The subject matter and the language of the book are adult (specifically sexual), but this is not too much for an older, mature high school student.Bottom line: this is a wonderful book, if anything for its magnificent writing. For a seemingly trite story of a low-end salesman in an unremarkable town, the story is compelling, but in the end there is no answer, no true resolution, which after all, is the only possible ending to Rabbit's run."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"I probably read \\"Rabbit, Run\\" when I was in my twenties, about fifteen years after the novel was first published, in 1960. Since then, I've read many Updike novels, included all four in the \\"Rabbit\\" Series. Recently---rest in peace, John Updike---I read it again, my way of putting flowers on his grave, I guess. I wondered if it would hold up. It did. I'd forgotten that so many passages are written in stream of consciousness, and I'd guess that readers who prefer more straightforward narration will not care much for \\"Rabbit, Run.\\" I'd forgotten entirely the wry and affectionate portrait of Reverend Eccles, whose ministrations to Rabbit are for naught, and it was a pleasure to catch this on the second reading. I remembered Ruth and Janice very well, and probably had more sympathy for them than I did a few decades ago. The city of Mt. Judge, described with the clarity of a photograph and with the eye of a painter, reminded me all over again of how lovely Updike renders the most humble details of everyday life. And Rabbit? Well, he's as appealing as ever in his misery, although returning to him after knowing how his life turns out (the successful car dealership, etc. in the sequels) made him seem less lost. Don't read this novel just because it's famous. Read it for one of the truest portraits of mid-twentieth century American life you'll ever find."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"The first time I read \\"Rabbit, Run,\\" I didn't much care for it: although I admired the prose and found the story interesting enough, I didn't know anyone like Harry Angstrom (I was exactly his age at the time), and it seemed a little unreal that a 26-year-old would have what seemed to me to be a midlife crisis.Well, two decades have not only expanded my horizons but also have wiped away a lot of my earlier idealism. Reading this novel now, I realize how exactly right Updike got everything. Harry (Rabbit) Angstrom isn't any more sympathetic than he was twenty years ago, but he's certainly believable.Feeling trapped in his marriage and his job, Rabbit longs for the wild excitement of his glory days as a basketball star in high school. Already the boys on the street playing hoops regard him as an old man, and he goes home grouchy, to a wife equally grouchy from pregnancy, and discovers his son and the car are both at his in-laws' home. On the way out the door to retrieve son, car, and a pack of cigarettes for his wife, \\"Rabbit freezes, standing looking his faint yellow shadow on the white door that leads to the hall, and senses he is in a trap. It seems certain. He goes out.\\"And he runs.His subsequent adventures lead him in quick order to an aimless overnight drive, to the haunt of his old basketball coach, to an encounter with a world-wise woman who moonlights as a prostitute, and to a friendship with an oddly endearing, if clueless, minister. While Rabbit hesitates in choosing whether to return to his old life or remain carefree, his indecision leads to an unspeakable tragedy, and even though I'd read it once before, the seamless construction and the crescendo of this pivotal scene still managed to take my breath away.In a later essay, Updike acknowledged that he wrote this novel in response to Jack Keroauc's \\"On the Road\\" (without having ever read it); he wanted to show what really happened when people just dropped everything and \\"cut loose.\\" In short, \\"the people left behind get hurt.\\" And this novel is about that hurt and how it threatens the fabric of the family and the community. While the openness of the ending acknowledges \\"our heart's stubborn amoral quest for something once called grace,\\" his story's seemingly \\"prim\\" morality forces the reader to recognize the importance of responsibility."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"The story is a bit drawn out, but it slowly pulled me in and propelled me forward. The tale of a conceited young man, plagued by a sense of futility and decay, alternating back and forth between two imperfect women reflects well a range of honest human emotions. The focus is definitely on the men though. The women in the story remain shallow and primarily serve sexual and reproductive roles. Not the best novel I've read, but I enjoyed it much more than Brazil (my first introduction to Updike's fiction) and plan to continue with the second book in the series."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"What's so thrilling about a washed-up basketball star trying to recapture something of his former glory, in any way he can? Everything, in Updike's hands. Rabbit Angstrom coasts through his post-school life before waking up suddenly one morning and asking what it's all about. He suddenly yearns for salvation, which he confuses with greatness - and grasps for both in one of the most bumbling, destructive yet heartfelt spiritual journeys ever portrayed in American fiction.One of the signatures of this book is something I found compelling in certain filmmaking, such as Lumet's NIGHT FALLS ON MANHATTAN: An ability to take your emotions from 0 to sixty in no time flat. Lumet suceeds by contrasting sudden bursts of violence with minutes of dead calm. Updike takes radical left turns with a long elliptical orbit - it takes you a minute to realize you've suddenly shifted direction. Rabbit's sudden interstate voyage aimed at the Florida keys, or his callous rebuke of his wife at the funeral, take you aback in their brashness, but then, suddenly, they come alive with their own inner logic. When Harry tunes into the news and wonders along with the broadcaster, &quot;Where is the Dalai Lama?&quot;, you learn just how far gone he is from understanding both the world around and the world inside him.Rabbit is a typical American male in many respects: trapped by images of former glory, resentful of his &quot;normal&quot; life, unable to relate to women outside of a sexual context. But what Updike captures best in Rabbit is the universal human trait of equivocation. Bad fiction rests on a single, life-turning momentous event, after which any struggle the hero endures is external. Running back and forth between his wife and Ruth, between family and &quot;freedom&quot;, and finally running away from the whole sordid mess born of his own indecision, Rabbit reminds us just how hard it can be to change one's oldest habits."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"I came back to Rabbit, Run after failing to finish it three and half years ago. I have to say that at that time I found it too difficult a read - I hadn't gotten 'into' Updike's style and, let's face it, a novel whose first forty pages describe a man taking an aimless car journey out of state for no reason other than existential angst is only so gripping. What brought me back to Updike three years later was discovering his fantastic poetry. After reading this I saw afresh the stylistic virtues of Updike's prose and see them now at full force in this novel. I think you do only read Updike for his style: that balancing act between the observation of the concrete particular and the abstraction from the concrete of Platonic, if provisional, metaphor. This style works away furiously in this book and perhaps there is something unrelaxed about it. It goes full-tilt all the time. It has the grave intensity of Updike's early work and I prefer the more comic atmosphere of his later stuff. But there's no doubt about it - Rabbit, Run is a fantastically well-written book, if you are patient enough to take it on its own terms."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"For me, Updike's point is captured best in the last pages of the novel. Harry Angstrom, one-time basketball star, fumbles through life following instincts he shouldn't, running from every fear. Life is no longer so simple as putting the ball in the basket; yet all the while he makes pained attempts to be a strong person, to do the right thing. The novel is about the unsettling feelings brought on by changes in perspective- changes that inevitably occur as one graduates, gets a job, marries, has children. Harry's world strikes him as strange, remote, absurd, and often sad. We watch as he struggles to find a way of dealing with these feelings, and are saddened when several times he gives in to the instinct to, quite literally, run. If his struggle is an attempt to find sense, or to embrace and articulate what little hope he still has, then it is at the novel's end that he achieves a triumph more bitter than sweet; tragically, his words are misunderstood. I thought this was very sad. Maybe he'll finally give up the game."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"This is a book you want on your nightstand at three a.m. on a hot summer night, when the big questions come out from behind the shadows. All your insecurites, fears, and longings are personified. This book is every bit as weighty as life, and the staggering vision here makes you gasp for air between paragraphs. Based solely on narrative structure, this isn't the best Rabbit novel, but it has the most to say"},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Yes, Rabbit Run is almost unendingly depressing and gives very little hope for humanity. The main characters range from the disturbed to the despicable; however, all of them are extremely believable. Updike paints a picture of the protagonist, Rabbit Angstrom - a self-centered infidel, a lousy father, who by all means ought to be completely unsympathetic - and yet I can genuinely empathize with him. Ultimately, I think that Rabbit is redeemable. Also, Updike's prose is - as always - spare and beautiful, and though he tends to only write about one topic - WASPs having affairs - he does it well enough to make it almost universal."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"RABBIT, RUN was the first Updike book I read \\"minny minny\\" years ago. I found it in the college bookstore at CMU when I was looking for something else, probably something \\"classic\\" at the time, like The Rise of Silas Lapham or The Octopus or The Sound and the Fury. While I think I did read all of those books eventually, they never stayed with me like Rabbit did. I was just 23 and engaged to be married when I read - no, devoured - Rabbit, Run. What was there in me back then, I wonder, that drew me to dark tales about other people's messy lives and misery? I dunno, but for some reason I loved the story of hapless Harry Angstrom, who, like a small fearful animal, \\"lived inside his skin.\\" Was that a quote from the book? Maybe, it seems familiar anyway. I have read probably a dozen or more other Updike books since 1967 - certainly not all of his stuff, but enough. All four Rabbit books, of course, but I also loved Of the Farm and The Poorhouse Fair and The Witches of Eastwick. And I did a senior paper on COUPLES, a book which was thought to be quite scandalous at the time, what with all its combinations of multiple couplings, bed-hopping (and laundry pile) adultery, and a seeming obsession with oral sex. The paper I wrote was pretty awful, as I remember, but at least it gave me a valid excuse to read what was then Updike's newest offering without feeling too guilty. RABBIT, RUN became required reading in most of the English classes I taught in the early 70s. I found that many of my students didn't share my enthusiasm for Updike or his Harry creation though. I remember one male student once remarking, \\"Mr Bazzett, ya know how there are some books that once you pick 'em up, ya just don't wanna put 'em down? Well, this Updike book, it's like once I put it down, I didn't wanna pick it up again.\\"Well, I guess I understood his point of view, but I was a little hurt just the same that he didn't like one of my favorite books. And back then I was probably a little too much into exploring the \\"symbolism\\" of Updike's character names too. Eccles (Ecclesiates), Harry (a hare?), Angstrom (a tiny insignificant unit of measurement, or perhaps a \\"stream of angst\\"), Ruth (\\"whither thou goest - NOT!), Coach Tothero (t'other one), Mt Judge (self-explanatory), and on and on until my students probably just wanted to puke. I got out of teaching after five years, which was probably a good thing. I think I was one of those guys who ended up teaching English just because I loved literature and reading - which does NOT automatically make a good teacher. I don't cerebralize (is that a word?) the books I read much anymore. I just enjoy them. I re-read RABBIT,RUN again recently, after more than twenty years. It holds up well. It's still dark, tortured and an interesting look at the \\"human condition.\\" But you know what? I don't like that kind of book so much anymore. I'd rather read a good love story, or maybe a memoir. At 65, maybe too much estrogen and not enough testosterone? Harry Angstrom is still a guy all serious students of American Lit should know though. And if you're a relatively new Lit student, here's something you might have missed. RABBIT,RUN was made into a pretty decent (if largely ignored) film around 40 years ago, with James Caan as Harry. If you haven't seen it, it's worth the rental price. Sadly, Updike finally put Rabbit to rest some years back (RABBIT AT REST) in the fourth book of the tetralogy. Personally, I think he shoulda kept him around a while. I'd like to know how he woulda been as a randy ol' septuagenarian. But that's probably just me. R.I.P., Harry. And many thanks to his master craftsman creator, John Updike. Write on, Mr. U! - Tim Bazzett, author of the REED CITY BOY trilogy and LOVE, WAR & POLIO"},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Literature can't get better than this. John Updike is one of my favorite authors and Rabbit, Run is one of my favorite novels of all time. The first page is the most mesmerizing I've ever encountered, it snakes a hand gently around your throat and squeezes. When you come to, you have not only finished this book and its marvelous sequels, each deliciously darker than the last, you have devoured Couples, The Coup, The Centaur, Marry Me, The Witches of Eastwick, S., A Month of Sundays, In The Beauty of the Lillies, and everything else this man has written. You don't just read an Updike novel, you join a cult.Harry Angstrom is delicious -- so deeply flawed, a black diamond. He is sexist but not unusually so -- he perfectly reflects our culture. And yet I don't consider Updike a man's writer, for women, too, could relate to his beautifully crafted work. I can't recommend this book enough. Read it!"},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"When I was in tenth grade, my English class was assigned John Updike's \\"Rabbit,Run,\\" which I found to be an unpleasant reading experience, indeed. I seem to recall thinking how strange it was that, although Updike was widely considered a classic American author, we were reading a book about a completely immoral (or, at the very least, ammoral) main character who leaves his pregnant wife, and lives with a prostitute, with whom he engages in some fairly explicitly described activities. However, even then, I figured someday I'd read it again when older and wiser.Not quite 30 years later, while browsing at a bookstore, I came across the 1500 page \\"Rabbit Angstrom, The Four Novels,\\" which I figured would serve the dual purpose of not needing to buy another book for over a month, while reading quality literature. After completing the first book, \\"Rabbit Run,\\" it's not that I regret starting this lengthy work, but rather that I give more credence to my earlier self.Now I know that Updike is considered one of the great American writers of the second half of the twentieth century. Perhaps that's true, but I don't really see it in this book. Of course, I do notice the unique use of stream of consciousness, shifting of character perspective, heavy use of metaphor and simile, and interesting descriptive observations; but I've seen it elsewhere, presented in a more compelling style. Updike reminds me a bit of Kerouak, Fitzgerald, and Tennessee Williams, all considered to be classic American writers, and all whom I think are somewhat overrated.Let's look at a typical example of Updike's prose in \\"Rabbit, Run\\" (page 167):\\"The St. Joseph's parking lot is a striped asphalt square whose sides are lined with such city trees; and above their tops, in this hard open space, he sees the moon, and for a second stops and communes with its mournful face, stops stark on his small scrabbled shadow on the asphalt to look up toward the heavenly stone that mirrors with metallic brightness the stone that has risen in his hot skin.\\"Okay, obviously Updike has superior descriptive writing skills, but just maybe he can do a little better with syntax, and break his thoughts down so the reader doesn't have to read the sentence three times in order to figure out what the author is trying to get across.Then there's the story itself. I'm not usually the type of reader who needs to like the main character to enjoy the book (I'm a Harry Crews fan, for crying out loud!) but I have to understand his/her motivations and sympathize just slightly. Rabbit Angstrom exudes a self-centered \\"I don't care about the consequences\\" attitude that makes him abhorrent, even though certain people seem to like hanging out with him. Sure, we can understand why a man marrying in his early twenties to a vacuous woman (pregnant with their second child) -- already showing signs of alcoholism and losing her looks -- can feel trapped and decide to escape. I can even appreciate why he might seek solace with a prostitute. But what about pretending to fall in love with the prostitute, whose life he also almost ends up destroying? Or returning to his wife (who has given birth), only to go back to the prostitute at the first sign of trouble? Not to mention the horrible thing Rabbit says to his wife after the seminal event in the book. I'm sorry, the only rational way to deal with someone like Rabbit would be to show him complete disdain, or total rejection (think about if someone you knew behaved like this).Enough of my stream of consciousness! I've just started book two: \\"Rabbit Redux,\\" and hoping for improvement."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"I was recommended this book by a good friend of mine. I found the book to be very well-written. I also found the main character, Harry &quot;Rabbit&quot; Angstrom, to be one of the most unappealing, pathetic and annoying characters in fiction. Rabbit is a formerly celebrated high school athlete who, at 26, has settled into a mundane life as a salesman, husband, and soon-to-be father (his wife is pregnant). Apparently having a quarter-life crisis, he leaves his wife, takes up with a prostitute, starts hanging out with a local minister and takes a job as a gardener. Harry appears to be the kind of person who, due to his good looks and charm, is somehow always able to avoid having to take responsibility for his actions. He is constantly being given second (and third, and fourth) chances by everyone in his life, despite his appalling behavior. He is selfish, aimless and spoiled. I'm sure the author intended that the character provoke this reaction, and intended it as a criticism of suburban American society at the time it was written. But because I found Rabbit to be such an unappetizing character, I have no desire to read any of the sequels to this book."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"I'll admit it - I toyed with the idea of putting this book back on the shelf at times. Like Wolfe or Faulkner, the prose is rich and decadent; each sentence conveys a great deal of meaning and can't be assimilated quickly. I stuck with it, and by the 50th page or so, the style became more natural and the characters opened up to me.You'd have to possess a dark and vicious world-view to think of this as the story of an Everyman, an average-Joe, a typical American male of his generation. Rabbit exists in a moralistic void, a near-complete vacant solipsism making him react in ways more animal than human. Rabbit fails to choose a particular path simply because he never seems to realize that he has choices to make. He's fully accustomed to getting by on an innate likeability and his athletic grace; a fact which perhaps has stunted his development and lead him to his state of sociopathic carelessness for the feelings of others.Reading this book is an exciting experience and I recommend it highly. Mt. Judge and Brewer are populated with interesting people - whether ultimately, you hate Rabbit Angstrom or love him, you'll find someone there who agrees with you."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"I, too, was going to title my review &quot;Updike is the Bomb!&quot;; as someone who fancies herself a writer, I just stand in awe of this man's work and and realize that I will never in my wildest imagination create something this gorgeous. Beautiful lyricism and stream-of-conscious narration, to say nothing of tour-de-force characterization, its apex an entirely unsympathetic hero whom you somehow root for and hope will redeem himself. No such luck with Rabbit, and though his lack of responsibility, self-reflection, decency and foresight make him, at best, a loser, the reader is riveted by his saga and begins to associate this character's faults with those of our own consumer-driven, me-first culture, which at the time of this book's writing, was still in its infancy. Imagine Rabbit as a '90s man! It boggles the mind how he reflects all that is bad about us, and how vividly the writing was on the wall, 40 years ago! Right on for the poet/novelist/prophet/teller of fortunes that is Updike, he's done us a service by sharing his gifts."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"I've wanted to read Updike for a while and 'Rabbit, Run' is my first foray. It's clear from the beginning that this isn't a novel of the casual-reading variety that will allow your eyes to dance across rapidly turning pages. It doesn't pull you in like that. Updike has a gift for descriptive prose (in fact that's what you're going to get throughout the novel) and as such you have to invest time and effort to absorb and immerse yourself into the whole of it. By committing and submitting yourself to this narrative you allow Updike to use his primary vehicle for relating his characters.The prose can be challenging, especially at first, like listening to a foreigner trying to speak English, you have to shift gears and give yourself time to attune to the flow and pattern of this delivery. As such, I viewed the approximately first 30 pages as a disembodied, boastful and self-serving exercise in prose designed to show off the prowess of a clever writer as opposed to the delight encountered upon finding a novel that has an ability to grab you right away and immediately begin advancing the story. The descriptive text can be numbing and I catch myself reading individual words and individual sentences, focusing on the wordplay instead of absorbing the character and story. I force patience in myself and as the characters and style become more familiar the verbosity of prose begins to feel less burdensome.If you're the type of person whose heart sinks at the sight of a paragraph that extends a page or more, and there are definitely a few of those in here, then this book is probably not for you. But it's not just that the paragraphs can be (and feel) long, rather it's the feeling that each paragraph and each descriptive little nugget within seems to relate a quality or feeling of grotesqueness and distortion, and the longer the paragraph the longer you're submerged, held under, gasping for breath. Some might say 'that's the point, to be unsettled' and I can understand this argument but the story is filled primarily with this manner of textual undertow, and, combined with the accompanying tragic characters (even the children are made to feel tragic), the reader is pulled relentlessly into an unsatisfying, spiraling morass. At the end, characters' positions may change but the changes are slight and circumstantial at best (not dictated by realization or self-determination) leaving the reader to ponder only the lack of growth, reward, justice, and ultimately payoff."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Harry Angstrom is the quintessential eternal youth, whose marriage turns out to be an albatross. The marriage not only deadens his spirit but also accelerates his descent into decadence. Harry's vital life spirit totally rejects the encumbrance of a forced marriage; however, in early 1960s working class America, quick divorces are not the common panacea that they are today. And with a young child and second on the way, Harry's only escape through a labyrinth of guilt and social mores will be a secretive and ultimately an internal one.Everything about Harry Angstrom speaks of spring--it is no accident that Updike sets the action of the novel during spring--and he finds himself married to the dead of winter. It is this commonly experienced conflict, crystallized through the eyes of an astute Everyman, that calibrates the smoldering action in Updike's masterful study of a fallen society. There are no Hollywood endings here; Updike's mission is not to offer hope or solace but rather understanding. The internal monologues served up so plentifully in this novel are a precursor to the \\"Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus\\" studies that would come 40 years later.The present-tense narration is lyrical and poignant, playing out like a 250-page prose poem, replete with unforgettable descriptions of the commonest things. While reading this novel, I was constantly in awe of how great a student of humanity and its foibles Updike kept proving himself to be, acquiring such an extraordinary amount of intimate knowledge of the mental workings of men, women, toddlers, clergymen, the elderly, the decadent, the square, the working class stiff--and all astoundingly by the age of 27. But even compared to later laureates, they just don't write them like this anymore. My favorite line in the entire book comes from the last page; it sums up the dilemma not only of Harry Angstrom but also of modern society as a whole in one simple, memorable sentence: \\"Funny, how what makes you move is so simple and the field you must move in is so crowded.\\""},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Written on the cusp of the birth of Keroac's and Ginsberg's creation of Beat literature, this book incorporates many of their themes and delivers outright depression.Harry Angstrom, a/k/a Rabbit is a middle 20's man whose mind is still surrounded by high school drama on the bastketball court where he excelled. Outstanding at sports, he weds - a la shotgun - a pretty and wealthy girl. In 1960, the year of the novel, his world would be declared idyllic - for Rabbit it is not.Like Kerouac's Dean Moriarity, this guy is confused. Like Kerouac's Sal Paradise, he impregnates and delivers women to situations to which he holds no allegiance or responsibility. Rabbit, like Moriarty or Cassidy, is the kid in a man's body who refuses to acknowledge or realize that life includes acts of responsibility. Are they all cool? They are free. But, their freedom often comes at a great cost to those around them.Rabbit's greatest demise is his wife. He flees her and shacks up with a professional woman, Ruth Leonard. The discourse between he and professional girl Ruth is amazingly well formulated and perhaps is the highlight of the book. Ruth is hard and tough. But, eventually, Rabbit ruins her life in a manner which only he can - she calls him \\"Death.\\" And, a short synopsis would be to say that Rabbit, albeit attractive and personable, is precisely what any parent of a daughter would fear see coming to their home during the holiday season. He can charm many, but ultimately he will tarnish whatever good existed or exists in the women around him.Perhaps the only character lower than Rabbit is his idol - his basketball coach, Tothero. He introduced Rabbit to Ruth and kindled the disaster of the relationship. But, unlike Rabbit, he acknowledges his frailty and never pretends to be what he is not. He knows he is a louse, and repeats this fact often and takes abuse from others about the same without reply or response in defense.In the end, Rabbit manages to distance himself from everyone: his wife, his in-laws, his parents and his sister. He reminds me a lot of Salinger's \\"Cather In The Rye\\" Holden Caulfield. But, unlike Holden, Rabbit has looks, charisma, moxie and appeal. He is not a child infuriated by teenage angst. But, he is as hopeless as Caulfield, and maybe more tragic as he can never \\"grow up.\\"This is neither light reading nor a happy story. Like many novels of its time, it is ponderous about how the American Dream may not be a dream, but rather could be a nightmare from which we must run. And, so it is for Rabbit - the title is most appropriate."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Growing up is hard for everyone..there are people who still haven't given up on childhood omnipotence, even as they become middle aged. This has an advantage- it keeps your mind off death. Believing you still can do whatever you want, act as you feel...this keeps you young, at least in your head! This is what happens to Harry &quot;Rabbit&quot; Angstrom, who cannot accept he's not the star of the basketball team anymore, cannot accept he's older, has responsibilities, has a less than glamorous job &amp; a less than exciting marriage. Instead of coping with his life, making the best out of it, Rabbit choses to just follow his instinct &amp; run. While running away, from place to place &amp; from relationship to relationship, Rabbit never finds what he's looking for, always returns to this empty feeling inside himself, this fear of death, of things ending, of things changing, of time passing. Rabbit doesn't face this fear though...he just continues running away. Rabbit Run is a sad, sad story, with a tragic ending, a story that could appeal to anyone since it talks about our deepest fears &amp; anxieties. John Updike writes beautifully, I'm really looking forward to reading more of his books."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"A star basketball player in high school, Harry \\"Rabbit\\" Angstrom comes to the realization that his life 8 years out of high school is a meaningless existence, even with a wife and son. His success on the court has not translated into success in life, perhaps making it harder to accept his current situation. Once adored as a top athlete and hero at his high school, Harry has evolved into a mediocre salesman living in a decrepit apartment with an apathetic wife. With this drab existence, Harry spurns his commitments (and responsibility to his family) and decides to run. Run where? Run for how long? These do not enter the bewildered mind of Harry Angstrom.John Updike delivers a masterful job of telling the story of this ex-jock and his current struggles with everyday life. He presents the raw emotion and feelings of a drifting young man. Harry is no hero. He is narcissistic, selfish, and immature, to say the least, yet Updike manages to elicit sympathy for Harry and his situation. Equally as intriguing as Harry Angstrom, is the character of Jack Eccles, a local Episcopal minister. Updike delves into the complexities of this man of God, as he struggles not only with \\"reforming\\" Harry, but also of his own doubts and inferiorities, as well as his embittered relationship with his agnostic wife.Religion and sex emerge as the dominant themes. Religion, neither lauded nor condemned, proves a pivotal role in shaping the lives of Updike's characters. The ideals of God's role and God's will perplex Harry and Jack. Even the existence or non-existence of God becomes a central role in the novel. Sex, undoubtedly, is the catalyst behind Harry's abandonment of his family. Updike does not describe sex as a sacred or meaningful, but instead describes it in rather graphic detail as a physical act without meaning or purpose. Indeed, for a book written in 1960, the sexual details are explicit, much more than the much-aligned \\"Catcher in the Rye.\\", written a few years earlier. However, Updike's portrayal of sex lends more realism and more potency to his novel.It's easy to see why this is Updike's most successful novel. I will be reading \\"Rabbit Redux\\" soon."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"\\"You don't think there's any answer to that but there is. I once did something right. I played first-rate basketball. I really did. And after you're first-rate at something, no matter what, it kind of takes the kick out of being second-rate.\\" This is how Harry Rabbit Angstrom explains why he walks out on his marriage with no warning one day. He was a star in high school, and now he's just a mediocre salesman of MagiPeel kitchen devices. Unable to handle this pressure, he runs. He drives through the night into Virginia, then turns around and returns almost home to a neighboring town where he looks up his old high school basketball coach and eventually moves in with a prostitute. RABBIT, RUN is a gritty, ugly story about an unlikable protagonist who always considers doing the right thing but in the end always acts out of selfishness or fear. Like other characters in the story, we're lured in again and again by Rabbit's charm and promise only to be burned by the reality of his decisions. Updike weaves a dramatic, emotionally involving, and ultimately heartbreaking tale with inventive, often poetic prose.One Amazon reviewer called RABBIT, RUN the American version of Camus' THE STRANGER. While the characters certainly share a certain immorality, or amorality to be more precise, Rabbit is a much more involving book for the reader. And while Camus' protagonist is eventually held responsible for his decisions, Rabbit, as the title says, always manages to run from his. I'll be interested to read the next books in the series and see how Rabbit's decisions affect the rest of his life."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Though the later Rabbit novels would win the awards (Pulitzers and National Book Awards for the last two), the original Rabbit, Run is a towering and memorable book. The character Rabbit Angstrom was fantastic, and although many people complain about his decision-making and morals, I find Updike's search for complex humanity and drive in such a character to be a great achievement. Who wants the vanilla do-gooders from factory belt novelists when you can have the perfect imperfection of Harry \\"Rabbit\\" Angstrom? Other great acheivments in this book lie in the moments; conversations, sudden reactions, streams of consciousness, epiphanies. The way he structures a conversation alone is mesmerizing: we read what Rabbit thinks, how he wants to steer the dialogue to his advantage, and then witness the battle of words in between. The only difference between this Updike and the later Updike is the descriptions; his prose hits on all cylinders, but sometimes it is too verbose, as if he is swelling himself outward to impress to the extreme. One of the unspoken rules in writing is to not lay all your cards on the table talent-wise, to reign yourself in a bit and make the story matter more. A little bit of that urge to show it all seeps through the cracks here. Regardless, the book is fantastic, one of amazing characters and talented prose."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"On this my third or fourth reading of RABBIT RUN, I was reminded once again that in Rabbit Angstrom, John Updike has created a truly American character. Whether or not you like him-- and there isn't a lot to admire in this selfish young man-- he is as real as the people with whom you attended high school and as much a part of our culture as Willy Loman. Anyone discussing American literature in the last half of the 20th century has to deal with Harry (Rabbit) Angstrom, who obviously has a transparent name.When the novel opens in 1959, Rabbit is 26 and married to Janice Springer. They have a son Nelson who was born seven months after their marriage in 1956. Janice is now seven months pregnant and has a drinking problem. Rabbit demonstrates a kitchen gadget called the MagiPeel Peeler in five and dime stores. He got his nickname because of \\"the breadth of white face, the pallor of his blue irises, and a nervous flutter under his brief nose. . .\\" His big moment came in 1951 when he was the hottest thing basketball had ever seen in the town of Brewster, Pennsylvania. His life has beeen downhill since then. He tells Reverend Eccles, the Springer family's Episcopal minister, who befriends him after he leaves Janice: \\"I once did something right. I played first-rate basketball. I really did. And after you're first-rate at something, no matter what, it kind of takes the kick out of being second-rate.\\"There is a lot going on here that has to do with religion. Rabbitt spends a lot of time with the Springer family's minister Reverend Eccles of the Episcopal Church, getting advice and counsel, not always solicited. Rabbitt \\"believes\\" in a higher power although not much in his actions would support such a belief. Reverend Eccles does much good in his role as a minister although his heart isn't much in a lot of what he does. He is much better as a good shepherd on the golf course with Rabbit than from the Sunday morning pulpit. His wife is a nonbeliever. Rabbit's parents are severe Lutherans. There are references to religion on practically every page of this novel. Rabbit's mistress Ruth lives across the street from a church where Rabbit can watch the congregation coming to and from the church on Sunday mornings. So is this 1960 novel dated? Not when a large majority of Americans believe in literal angels and President George Bush is considered the leader of fundamentalist Christians in this country. Also, Rabbit and Janice in 1959, given their background, would have sought the advice of a minister, rather than a psychologist for help with their marital problems.No writer in America creates more complex, three dimensional characters than John Updike. We know hundreds of details about everyone in this novel. Ruth doesn't break the back of books when she reads them. Janice cannot cook weiners without their splitting open. Her mother-in-law has never cared for her. \\"I never liked that girl's eyes. They never met your face full-on.\\" Rabbit always folds his trousers carefully before having sex. Minor characters are as richly developed as he is.We also never forget that Updike is a poet. (William Maxwell said he wouldn't read a novelist who didn't write poetic prose.) So we have \\"the wreckage of the Sunday paper\\". A waiter goes away \\"like a bridesmaid with his bouquet of unwanted silver.\\" There is the description of a \\"true\\" pink rhododendron in Mrs. Smith's garden where Rabbit works briefly. The Smiths had driven their Packard to New York City to get the plant off the boat and had put it in the back seat of their car \\"like a favorite aunt or some such thing.\\"Updike has written about a little piece of America. We know what products are in the grocery stores, what movies are playing, (Janice, for example, goes to see SOME LIKE IT HOT, what television programs people watch, and what cigarettes (Newports) they smoke.RABBIT RUN is as timely as it was in 1960. And, of course, it was to be followed by three more novels, RABBIT REDUX, RABBIT IS RICH and RABBIT AT REST and a novella RABBIT REMEMBERED."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"John Updike is wonderful author, and one of the most esteemed literaty figures in the United States. He earned that respect by writing controversial novels about sex, adultery, suburban malaise, and unhappy marriages.His eloquence is marked by short, almost angry sentences contrasted with passages of simple beauty. His prose style is unique and yet difficult to describe. Rabbit, Run is the first of four novels about Harry &quot;Rabbit&quot; Angstrom, a 26 year-old former high school basketball hero who comes to the realization that the rest of his small town life will never measure up to the glory days of his teenage years.Rabbit, and the tragedy which befalls his family, make for a very complicated novel. When Rabbit walks out on his family, leaving his wife and child without a source of income, I almost cheered for Rabbit. After all, he was only escaping the trap which so many small-town men fall into after high school. Then I realized that I was cheering for a man who was doing something truly awful. And then I cheered harder. Only Updike could create such a complicated character and sustain him for four novel. This is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"This is a quirky little novel about a young husband and father who simply decides he doesn't want to deal with the complications of his life anymore. What does he do? Gets in the car and drives. Just drives. No plan, no particular destination...just \\"away\\". Turns out the plan (or lack of it) is ill-conceived. After driving all night, Harry \\"Rabbit\\" Angstrom turns his car around and drives back into his little Pennsylvania town. He spends the rest of the novel avoiding his (alcoholic) pregnant wife, taking up with women of questionable moral character and having chat sessions with the local priest who's trying to talk him into the right thing: returning to his family.Rabbit is a local high school basketball hero, but he's become dissatisfied with his loss of luster in the early adult years when he's nothing more than ordinary...ordinary and saddled with too much adult responsibility. He's a bit of a cypher. His dialogue is short and clipped and he seems a bit of a dunce. The world baffles him. He's not particularly likeable.Of the two novels I've read in the series (this and Rabbit Redux), this is the less interesting of the two. Rabbit is simply not fleshed out enough in this initial offering. There's not enough of him \\"there\\" to get interested in. It's not until \\"Rabbit Redux\\" that Harry's life becomes far more fascinating."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"The first of four books revolving around the life of fictional character Rabbit Angstrom. Each volume was written at 10-year intervals, and this series represents John Updike at his very best. Set in east-central Pennsylvania, this opening novel explores the life of Rabbit as a young married man, afraid that his once-successful life as a high school basketball player is on a fast spiral downward into mediocrity. If life now would only go as smoothly for him as it did on the basketball court! Panicking, he decides to run away, but gets only as far as West Virginia before getting lost and returning to PA. But he doesn't return to his wife Janice, but rather moves in with Ruth, a prostitute. When Janice goes into labor, guilt drives Rabbit home, but after further complications regarding the death of the newborn child (everyone blames him though Janice was at immediate fault) and Ruth (she announces she's pregnant by him), Rabbit hits the road again. Updike captures perfectly Rabbit's feelings of entrapment and his desperation in trying to achieve self-perfection in a very imperfect world. Interesting from first word to last, this novel is a brilliant start to the magnificent Rabbit series."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Harry 'Rabbit' Angstrom was once king of the high school world, a star basketball player, tall and handsome, and able to get the girls. Now, several years on, he is married, frustrated and unsure as to how it all ended up this way. One day, arriving home to his alcoholic, dreary wife and his meager home, he snaps. He will leave his wife, his responsibilities, his child. He will run.Rabbit turns to his former coach for advice, the old lecher introduces him to a part-time prostitute. He moves in with her the same night and they develop a dominant-submissive relationship, his affection existing only because it allows him to demand, hers because she knows no better. Like most of the other events in the story, this one is sad, gritty, and very real. Ruth, the plump good time girl, is a sympathetic character, and there are enough flashes of hard iron in her make-up that any sensation of her being a caricature or place-holder character fades.What Updike has done here is to create the dreary reality of a life that turned out not quite how you expected. Rabbit is a man at turns puzzled, the confident, then angry, then confused, but his emotions are never directed at himself. It is almost as though he is unable to analyse what lies within for fear that he will find something he doesn't like or - worse - nothing at all. When he acts, it is quick and unpredictable, but oddly, never out of character. Because he rarely internalises in the narrative, for the first half of the novel he is as much an enigma to us as he is to the other characters, but as the story develops, we begin to learn what makes him him, and while his actions never really lose that exciting touch of randomness, they always feel right in hindsight, justified.While evading his marital responsibilities, Rabbit and his wife's priest, Jack Eccles, form an unequal friendship. The priest is there to save Rabbit, to return him to the fold, to where he should be, but it is clear that the young man is as unsure about his world as anybody else. He doubts himself, he doubts his God. It is interesting that Rabbit actually draws strength from this indecision, allowing him to help as he is helped. It is made very clear that if Eccles had of been secure in his faith and in himself, he never would have been able to relate to Rabbit.When the novel was first printed, there was a lot of discussion about the overt, explicit sexuality of it. Forty years and more later, it is both difficult and easy to see why. Rabbit is a conscious sexual predator, an animalistic man who thinks about sex often, and loves women for being women. But today, that sort of outlook from a twenty-one year old man is not surprising, and is all but expected. Perhaps what still has the capacity to shock is his domination of women, his calm, measured attempts to make them submit - and they do. I can't help but wonder if that is another taboo that in a few decades will fade, just like the rest.Eventually Rabbit returns to his wife, but not in a triumphant, 'all is resolved' plot twist at the end of the novel. No, Updike does not take the easy way out, instead reuniting the pair a little over halfway through. And for what? A birth. His wife Janice is pregnant, to a little girl they name Rebecca. The events immediately preceding Rabbit's return to his wife are both sad and delicate, happy and horrifying.There is one scene that deserves special mention. I won't reveal what it is so that the plot can remain a surprise, but I must mention its power, both on the novel, the characters, and the reader. It is an urgent scene, horrible in its inevitability. From the opening paragraph, it is clear what is going to happen, and the fact that we, the reader, knows about it, makes it all the more terrible. I cannot praise Updike's skill as an author in this particular section, and it is worth the price of admission alone.To continue on that, Updike is an amazing wordsmith. He captures the unfriendly reality of everyone's life with ease. Only rarely dipping into lengthy sentences and almost never using literary tricks, Updike keeps his sentences short and sharp, his metaphors clear and crisp. Yet he never strays from what is real. Nobody is 'luminously beautiful', instead we have, 'Her hair in sunlight sprays red, brown, gold, white, and black across her pillow. Smiling with relief, he gts up on an elbow and kisses her solid slack cheek, admires its tough textures of pores.' In those two sentences, we are introduced to both the beauty and the reality of this sleeping woman, and it is wonderful. Throughout, Updike concentrates on reality, never fancifying or making a scene glib because he can. For every positive a character reveals, he shows us a - not a negative, never - but a neutral, a real, a grey. If a character was perfect, why would we care?The ending was, unfortunately, a little confused, and I am uncertain as to how he could have extended the story of Rabbit to three more books. However, based on every page, every sentence, every word that Updike used to create his marvellous narrative, I am convinced that he can pull it off. He was only twenty-nine when he wrote this book, but there is a wisdom and sensitivity throughout that many never touch - truly a stunning author."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"How horrible can one man be and still retain our sympathy? For all the iniquities of Harry \\"Rabbit\\" Angstrom, he never quite loses his charm. He gives people faith, his minister says. He has the gift of life, his employer says. On the other hand, everything he touches he corrupts. As another character puts it, he has \\"the kiss of death.\\"She was overreacting a bit. Rabbit's closest fictional counterpart, in my opinion, is Steve Carrel's Michael Scott--a man basically good, but capable of plenty bad, simply because he's a clumsy, self-centered individual who has never imagined what it might be like to be someone else. Things feel good in his own skin, and he sees no reason to think outside of himself. If you asked him why he just did or said something terrible, he would probably reply that it \\"just felt right.\\" Rabbit follows his instincts, and leaves a path of destruction behind him.So why would anyone want to read this novel--who is going to get pleasure out of watching Rabbit destroy lives? Updike was a gifted stylist, and Rabbit, Run is a virtuosic display of ability. If you enjoy reading prose that seems to leap off of the page, that contains as much life as the characters themselves do, then read this book. If you enjoy brilliant dialogue, and conversations that illuminate characters more fully than exposition ever could, then read this book. If you enjoy stream-of-consciousness writing that isn't too bewildering and actually adds depth to the characters, then please--read this book. Updike captures those uncertain moments after high school and before adulthood when it becomes clear that indeed, we will one day die, and that now may be our last chance to make a break for it.Many readers find Rabbit reprehensible, and opt to give this book one or two stars. However, Rabbit is most real when he is most obliviously cruel, and part of our discomfort may stem from seeing a little too much of ourselves in his character."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"John Updike, specifically Rabbit, Run, is why I began writing. The first page is the most mesmerizing I've ever encountered, it snakes a hand gently around your throat and squeezes. When you come to, you have not only finished this book and its marvelous sequels, each more darkly rich than the last, you have devoured Couples, The Coup, The Centaur, Marry Me, The Witches of Eastwick, S., A Month of Sundays, In The Beauty of the Lillies, and everything else this man has laid his hand to. You don't read Updike, you join a cult.I can remember the first time I read Rabbit, and how it seemed an important journey was beginning. God couldn't write a better first page. Perhaps Updike is God.Harry Angstrom is delicious; so deeply flawed, a black diamond. He was sexist but not unusually so - he perfectly reflects our culture. And yet I don't consider Updike a man's writer, any more than I think of Eudora Welty as a woman's writer. They're far too muscular to be limited by gender. Oh, read it. Don't do anything else until you have."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"How can a man in his late twenties understand tragedy perfectly, and anchor his first novel convincingly and perfectly to disaster? If John Updike's prospective publisher was doubtful of the manuscript in 1959, such doubt must have folded in an instant when he read that protagonist \\"Rabbit\\" Angstrom went away from home one day, and then his young, worried, angry, drunken wife accidentally drowned their new baby in their bathtub.\\"Great crimson prayers\\" are offered by Janice, to \\"Him who set the stars in place,\\" as little Becky cannot be saved, and drowns. The prose, unique and powerful as it is, for me is almost unreadable today.Think of the magnificent modern stories that are anchored by incident, in this way, and become indelible: Michael Cimino's ineffable Russian Roulette sequence in \\"The Deer Hunter\\"; the chainsaw massacre in \\"Scarface\\"; the vicious attack and survival in James Dickey's \\"Deliverance.\\""},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Although I am generally not a fan of Updike's work, this is a great beginning to his fascinating series about American life. The story traces the lack of fulfillment many citizens feel and does so in a way that is comically imperfect and not too preachy."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Harry is trapped in an unhappy marriage. His wife is pregnant and an alcoholic, and they have a two-year-old child. Everything gets to be too much for Harry, who was a superstar athlete in high school and somehow feels like he deserves more out of life than this.One evening without warning, he leaves his wife and child, drives for awhile, and eventually comes right back to his own city to live with another woman.Other people touch Harry's life through this transition, especially his former high-school basketball coach who is a bit addled, and the minister of his church, with whom he begins a weekly golf game as the man attempts to save him and make him realize he ought to go back to his wife.Harry remains untouched, though, and continues doing whatever feels right to him at the time, justifying the hurt he causes to all those around him.The writing in this book is excellent. The way Updike carves out a sentence is breathtaking and his metaphors and use of language are mesmerizing.However, I hated every single character and couldn't muster any sympathy for any of them. It was hard for me to continue reading about characters I disliked so intensely, and I can't imagine ever picking up the sequel to this book."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Huh? Why is this story of a pathetic man such a classic? It's depressing, predictable and trite. For instance, when Rabit first runs away in his car, I thought O.K. we've got a great American road trip here and we're going to the gulf coast, but instead he returns to Pennsylvania and lives with a whore in an attempt to make a not-too-radical change that he inevitably undoes.

Nothing in his life has been equally rewarding. In fact, he can hardly cope with life as a nobody. He stills has enough charm to warm over the local pastor or a widowed lady, and the coach is still there for advice, but his life is going no where.The novel opens with Rbbitt a salesman of a household device. His wife is a pregnant alcoholic and he already has a two-year old son. No crowds cheer anymore. His wife has left the car at her parents and the son at his parents, and while you're out Rabbitt pick up a pack of cigarettes. Angstrom has had enough and the run begins.It has been said that there are no sympathetic characters and that is somewhat true, but the story is real. Some of my contemporaries still live their high school years over and over. They still want to tell you how someone they played ball with is doing. They still play ball. There lives change very little over the years otherwise they will lose that varsity feeling. This story represents that very well."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"I read &quot;Rabbit is Rich&quot; last year, and I liked that one husband-swap scene so much, I decided to try the rest of the Rabbit books. Now that I've just finished &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot;, I may well skip the rest. This book was excruciating. First of all, Hassy Angstrom is an utterly worthless character. I don't care whether he's 'profoundly understandable' or not, or that he represents most middle-American men--he's a lowlife. I cannot undestand what some of the characters saw in him, especially Ruth and Eccles the minister, because all he did was poison everyone around him. This book was like watching Married With Children, but without the laughs. Second, I've about had it with Updike's prose style. I just wish he would write clean lines and quit cluttering it up with metaphors that don't work. I found myself re-reading sentences over and over again and just not getting them. Some of the stream-of-consciousness passages were extremely aggravating to read. I'm sorry if grammar and punctuation are in the way of great art, but you have to use a friggin' comma to separate some of your clauses now and then unless you want to wear down the eyes of your reader. And lastly, Updike the 'over-a-Cheever' should maybe start reconsidering an old idol of his. Here's a quote, Mr. Updike: &quot;If I am writing narrative prose, and I sometimes am, I must content myself with these limitations. Every line cannot be a cry from the heart, cut in stone. But I do rebel against common speech, against the quality of filler I find in my work...&quot;. In other words, cut out all the unnecessary filler in your books.

It's so easy to hate Rabbit but this novel tells the story of what can happen when someone abandons all responsibility and lives solely for himself for a period of time.

Most of his stuff is pretty much the same, and I didn't find much to like in it other than his use of language, which was often quite beautiful (though occasionally not even grammatical).But there is something different about Rabbit, Run. For one thing, there is more to the story than just someone cheating on their spouse (though that is, of course, still at the heart of it). And the characterization is better---deeper, broader, more insightful. But mostly, it's the way it all fits together...this is a really well crafted novel. I still disagreed with its theme (fundamentally that life is a mess---a filthy, dirty mess, and there's nothing we can do about it---as is made explicit in the scene when Rabbit's wife has their baby), and I couldn't much like or even sympathize with any of the principle characters---but I could *understand* them. And that made this book powerful, like it or not. It actually gave me a pain in my stomach reading it---seriously, it felt like it was giving me an ulcer! The only other book to give me that kind of physical sensation while reading it was Anna Karenina. So, while Updike's artistic vision is still not exactly my cup of tea, here it is really *artistic*, and that made reading it worthwhile.

This was a time of formality, politeness and heavy moralizing. This novel is jarring and shows the desperation of a man trapped in his life.Harry \\"Rabbit\\" Angstrom is a sad character who, to date, has had his greatest moments in high school when he was a basketball star. Since then he has married a woman he doesn't really love and is trapped in a life he doesn't want. He has not lived up to the expectations he had of himself. Most men simply settle for this but Rabbit doesn't. One night, he simply walks away from his pregnant wife, 2 year old son and extended family. He begins a short life with a woman who is basically a prostitute. He probably loves her though he loves himself more. He is torn between his love for Ruth, the woman with a suspect reputation and the duty of staying with his family.Rabbit continually makes bad choices and is completely self absorbed. He is not a likeable character.Ultimately, I was torn between cheering and jeering Rabbit. In a way, I applauded his courage in resisting a typical life that will not make him happy. On the other hand, it is hard to cheer for someone who has no regard whatsoever on the effect of his words and actions on others.The novel is full of tragedy and I found it very jarring and at times, very disturbing. In all, it was hard to enjoy but I was completely absorbed and found it to be a very worthy and thought provoking experience. I particularly enjoyed the relationship between Rabbit and Reverend Eccles, the Episcopalian Reverend who is obsessed with Rabbit and with saving him.Updike's style tends to superfluously verbose in its descriptions which makes this drag a little at times.In all, I highly recommend the jarring experience of Rabbit Run."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"This is an example of astounding use of the English language.

I cannot think of a single character in this novel except perhaps Rabbit's minister \\"friend\\" who inspired anything in me but revulsion. Rabbit, Run was an unpleasant book filled with unembraceable people in disturbing situations. I am well known for liking the dark energy that can be present inside a bleak, tragic tale, but the disturbing Rabbit, Run was boring, tiring, depleting, and uninteresting. It was less a story than a series of situations that never go anywhere, and Ganesh help us, it didn't even come with an ending. Maybe I wouldn't have such a negative report if I hadn't made the mistake all these years of listening to the many praise-gushing discussions of this book which universally made it sound like a classic.

Rabbit Angstrom is a former high school basketball star whose glory days are in the past. Rabbit is a poor man's Gatsby, a man of small means and abstract dreams too large for his mind to handle. He becomes prey to the dangerous and rebellious tradition of self-exaltation - Raskolnikov without a scheme and an aim.Rabbit suffers from an early onset of mid-life crisis - one so confounding he does not know what he does or why he does it. He runs away from his family, but he can't even leave the small-town milieu. His escape is localized and small-scale, perhaps admissive of personal limitations and insignificance. Updike doesn't quite denigrate small-town America - he clearly has appreciative affection for his small town life (though he often gets a little too cathartic with his self-assurances of religious truths).Updike's language is a slow progression of action and aimless colloquial triteness with interspersed moments of pulsing, raw but poignant stream-of-consciousness - that's when Rabbit is really on the run. In the eventlessness of small town life Updkike makes even scandals look like events of mundane existence. There is a pervasive lack of excitement; even Rabbit's moments of self-awareness, or rather its beginnings, are lethargic and ultimately ineffectual. Rabbit's rebellion is against his own long-exhausted role and purpose. He is a &quot;flower stalk.&quot;"},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"To head off the inevitable criticism, let me start off by saying that I generally like reading great literature, and can enjoy books even if (or especially if!) they are depressing or have unhappy endings. But even for such books I need a reason to care about something: either the characters or the themes or the writing. This book gave me nothing to care about. The central character [Rabbit] has no redeeming qualities: his predicaments are interesting (and had the potential to be relevant as an illustration of people who drift through life), but Rabbit is not just a 'drifter'; he's a jerk who commits not one selfless act the entire book. Does the book offer anything else? The themes explored here may have been considered revolutionary at the time the book was published in the early '60s (I don't know), but by today's standards are weaker than what you would find in a good independent film.

But he's feeling overwhelmed. His wife spends her days drinking and there is little affection between the two of them. He realizes that in fact, he doesn't love her anymore. He can't stop remembering when he was in high school and was the star of the basketball team. Life was easier then, he was a big shot and everyone loved him.So Rabbit runs. He takes off to go down south but only gets to West Virginia before turning back for home. He doesn't go back to his wife, though, he goes to his old basketball coach for advice. The coach is a pathetic character who ends up taking Harry on a double date with two some-time prostitutes. Harry ends up moving in with this new girl, Ruth. When his second child is about to be born, Rabbit goes back to his wife only to run again after a tragic accident.It's easy to understand Rabbit's feelings in this book. Updike does a good job of getting you inside his head and feeling the pressure of being trapped in a marriage that makes you unhappy with an unfulfilling job to top it off. Rabbit is, however, an unsympathetic character. He rarely thinks about anyone but himself and what he wants. In the time he is apart from his wife before he returns to her, he never tells her where he is or if he's ok. He never goes to see his son, even once. The new woman he is living with changes many things about her life for him, but Rabbit remains Rabbit. He gets by in life due to his charm, but that charm rarely comes though the pages of the book.I couldn't figure out why Ruth lets him move in because she never says a kind word to him. They never have the kind of conversation that two people in love would have and yet they live and breath as a couple. It just never makes any sense. This is the first Updike book I have read and he certainly has a way with words. Some of his sentences will make you stop and pause, they are so beautiful. There are times, though, that he becomes too enamored of his own ability and strings together alot of lovely words that signify nothing. It then takes him awhile to get back to the story.Rabbit, Run is very well written and interesting to a point.

I'm not a big fan of John Updike. I've read the first two Rabbit books, and I'm not impressed. The writing is excellent. The prose is fine and moves the story along. I don't mind an unsympathetic protagonist, i really don't. There is just something in the character of Harry Angstrom that made me dislike the book...Perhaps there is greatness in this book. I wouldn't doubt it. I didn't find it, though. It has been said that people have two choices. 1. To act. 2. To not act. Even through inaction, people are making a choice, setting themselves down a specific path from which they refuse to leave. This is what Rabbit Angstrom does. His crime is not that he is a bad person, his crime is that his inaction and personal irresponsibility causes more harm than if he intentionally set out to hurt.This novel is an excellent character study. It examines motives and truths about Harry Angstrom as Rabbit acts, thinks, doesn't think, and doesn't act. Rabbit, Run works as a character study novel. It is an extremely well crafted one at that.One more thing: All the technical craft in the world can't make a person like a book. Rabbit, Run is a book i felt i should read. So i did. It is also a book i have no intention of reading again."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"The &quot;Rabbit&quot; legend has been so inflated in American literature, perhaps it was impossible for Updike's novel to live up to my expectations. In any case, I finally got around to reading &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot; and was quite disappointed. As novels go, it's perfectly fine: a simple story of a young man itching to shed his ordinary, middle-class, suburban life for some nebulous nirvana of love and excitement. The problem: I found Rabbit remarkably irritating and shallow, and the supporting cast (Ruth excepted) one-dimensional and unremarkable. The prose, with occasional exceptions, is drab and lifeless--perhaps it was a stylistic choice made by Updike to complement his dreary story, but I doubt it. Suburban malaise, the restlessness of American Everyman, marital hypocrisy--all of it has been done, redone, and re-redone in American literature before (talk about redux), and often with far better results (check out Richard Yates' &quot;Revolutionary Road&quot; for a glimpse of an unusually brilliant example of this type of novel). Maybe &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot; was sharper when first published in 1960; but as a reader in 2002, I am unimpressed. There's nothing in particular wrong with this book; but in my opinion, there's nothing much extraordinary about it either."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Updike's prose is lyrical. His observational skills and ability to distill a moment, a complex idea or emotion are poetic. His story crafting is legend and well deserved. However, I hated this story. Reading it was like listening to a favorite song only to realize the lyrics are describing something repugnant. Maybe I'm burned out on the anti-hero or just tired of being sympathetic towards dirtbags who are too unclever to meet even a modicum of their responsibilities as they reinvent their lives or search for meaning. Whatever the cause, I'll run from spending yet another second with \\"Rabbit.\\""},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"John Updike was one of those legendary authors that people raved about but for one reason or another I never felt compelled to read one of his books. But when an old copy (and I mean old: this one was a paperback from 1968) of \\"Rabbit, Run\\" showed up in my bookshop recently, I decided to take a crack at it. After finishing the novel I must concur with the critics: Updike is an enormously talented writer. What I found most interesting, apart from Updike's rich prose, is that a novel as \\"scandalous\\" as this was written and published back in 1960. Nothing terribly wicked by today's standards --- some adultery, sexual scenes, religious doubts, a bit of profanity --- but I'm guessing that books like this created quite a stink amongst the conservative masses back in those days. The Rabbit character is a very complex and fascinating one, and one of this book's strengths is the way that Updike writes about his conflicts and passions in such a fluid manner. I'm ready to try the rest of the books in the series now."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"John Updike, at least in the opinion of his fans, made constructive use of a Guggenheim fellowship by writing 'Rabbit, Run,' which grew into a four-novel series chronicling the life of an average American man. The series, much like Rabbit Angstrom, ran away with itself and became a landmark of the twentieth-century American novel. By the time of his death in 2009, Updike's Rabbit tetralogy was best-selling and the recipient of two Pulitzers.First published in 1960, 'Rabbit, Run' was the second novel of Updike's career and broke ground in ways similar to his 'Couples' of 1968. Never one for self-censorship, he laced 'Rabbit, Run' with an audacity and sexual frankness that writers such as Philip Roth, Norman Mailer, and William S. Burroughs also championed through the 1960s and 70s. Updike was certainly not alone in overcoming literary taboos, but he stands apart from his contemporaries in using a Protestant, middle-class perspective that combines issues of family, sexuality, and politics with bourgeois life and religion.'Rabbit, Run,' written by Updike in his mid-twenties, was a reaction to the social climate of America as it moved out of the 1950s, a decade marked by vast prosperity and, to many, extreme conformism. Updike made reference to Americans feeling 'stuck' in the 50s, when the United States advanced through early phases of the Cold War to become a military and economic superpower. His characters from this period, usually middle-class suburbanites, lack direction and personal fulfillment in a post-Second World War malaise that overshadowed the Eisenhower administration.Set in the fictitious Pennsylvania town of Mt. Judge, Updike often uses the word 'net' to describe a late 1950s atmosphere that Harold 'Rabbit' Angstrom feels trapped in. Harry, once a star on his high school's basketball team, is now 26 years old. He is dabbling in the working world as a kitchen gadget salesman while caring for his pregnant, alcoholic wife Janice Springer and 2 -year-old son Nelson.Harry, from the opening pages, is facing a mental and spiritual crisis. While swamped in an unhappy marriage, he deals with flak from his parents and in-laws to keep the Angstrom and Springer names unblemished, pressure from his Christian faith, and demands by society to have a chicken in the pot and two cars in the garage. Unable to cope much longer, he hops into his Ford and drives to the Mid-Atlantic states with no intention of returning.Dogged by family obligations, Harry drives back to Mt. Judge and joins Marty Tothero, his old basketball coach who is living in the attic of a social hall. Harry always looked to Tothero for advice but finds his pep talks outdated and stale. Yet it is through Tothero that he meets Ruth Leonard, a heavy-set woman who seems to make ends meet through prostitution. A morbid affair, based on domination rather than love, begins and Rabbit finds himself more at odds with his conscience than ever. This guilt is heightened by Jack Eccles, an Episcopalian minister who has been asked by the Angstroms and Springers to 'convert' Rabbit back into family loyalty.It does not take long to sense an absence of emotional depth in Harry, which causes his undoing in 'Rabbit, Run' and over the three later novels. Still living on the glory of his basketball days, Rabbit seems to lack consideration for most anyone outside of himself. He has no patience in helping his drink-quaffing wife and is repulsed by her second pregnancy. Except for his son Nelson, he cannot seem to form any direct connection with another person's feelings; men are negative forces that pose threats and women are vessels for his rampant sexual desires.His behavior is impulsive, almost animal, and the work of Eccles to steer him onto the righteous path seems hopeless. Yet Rabbit is himself aware of what is lacking. Unhappy with his life and clinging to what little of his Christian faith is available, Rabbit senses a reality beyond Mt. Judge but cannot find his way. Against a static backdrop where there is little hope of improvement, it is no wonder that Harry feels like skipping town. Updike asks whether our ties to other humans are truly strong enough for Rabbit to go back.While an engaging, often funny, and ultimately painful book, 'Rabbit, Run' is a product of the early Updike, the writer who has not fully set down his method. Like Updike through all periods, the novel is rich in detail and brings us to the heart of its protagonist, but it does not have the total balance and polish that his later fiction carries. Updike had published just one earlier novel, 'The Poorhouse Fair,' in 1959 and was still a distance off from the pristine narrative and impeccable form of 'Rabbit is Rich,' a superior, Pulitzer Prize-winning novel released in 1981.As usual, Updike does not divide the novel into chapters but into loosely-based sections that run for dozens of pages. 'Rabbit, Run' is told in third-person semi-omniscient, telling most of the story from Harry's point of view but stepping away to relate other characters' predicaments, such as those of Janice and Eccles. This keeps the reader fully aware of the developments. The book functions well as a unit, but Updike might have created a more suspenseful novel by revealing some of the events after they happened.Updike, who thought of 'Rabbit, Run' as a film on printed pages, admitted that the novel was written 'carelessly' in order to gain a narrative freedom. At times, his writing seems too free; besides detail-packed sentences that leave out punctuation to maintain flow, Updike tinkers with stream of consciousness to describe characters' innermost thoughts. This actually breaks the narrative rhythm more than it sheds light.These problems are overridden whenever Updike gives meaning to drab, ordinary lives. Updike's characters and settings are unpleasantly real and cause us to think we've been in the exact situations before. While his narration is a bit too verbose, Updike's dialogue is some of the most beautifully conceived in American literature. A typically Updike combination of pleasure and pain, 'Rabbit, Run' and its three successors make up a commentary that will remain popular for at least the near future.Those interested in the social history of America should read at least one of the Rabbit novels, beginning with 'Rabbit, Run' in 1960 and ending with 'Rabbit at Rest' in 1990. A novelette based on the Rabbit series, 'Rabbit Remembered,' was also published in Updike's 2001 collection 'Licks of Love.' 'Rabbit is Rich' and 'Rabbit at Rest' won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1982 and 1991, respectively.'Rabbit, Run' is in wide circulation at bookstores, libraries, and on the Internet, including as a 284-page Fawcett Crest paperback. The 1993 Fawcett printing has small but clear type and a cheerful blue cover. Earlier hardcover releases by Alfred A. Knopf with Updike's familiar jacket design are also available. Harold Angstrom has been the wellspring of Updike's fame during his lifetime and will almost certainly make up the bulk of posthumous fame that Updike enjoys."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"*spoiler alert*The reader who usually dislikes books with clogged arteries from too much description (so, 4 instead of 5 stars), might enjoy reading Rabbit's story, and understand his erratic mindset a bit when Janice turns out to be a vapid drunk and mama's girl...... when all of a sudden the reader might be knee-capped about 50 pages from the end, upon Rabbit leaving Janice for the second time.Updike gets into Janice's head then, and the way he describes the terror and desolation of the mommy abandoned with babies -- very, very real. The anger, the pain and worry for the children, the hemorrhaging of confidence and capabilities, the unanswered questions, the shut door and the silence, all terribly true.But of course most abandoned mommies do not become drunks and everyone survives more or less intact. And years later, when all is more or less forgiven and forgotten, the reader might happen to be in a public place and reading this part of the book and a wound reopens as if new, you might start crying, and it is not a pretty crying, it is the crying of the lost, of the abandoned, of the forgotten, of the rejected. The rage, the hopeless way the reader with bad old memories might appear will cause those nearby to move away, to ask cautiously \\"are you okay?\\" and the reader has to marshal the forces of survival back up and say, \\"yeah, fine\\".Don't say you haven't been warned."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"This novel brought tears to my eyes....of boredom and disgust !I can't believe that they have been touting this book as one of the greatest of American literature. It is about a twenty-something guy who is married with a son. He used to be a star basketball player and now, caught in a love-hate marriage and a dead-end job, the banality and drabness of his life is getting to him.Interesting so far, isn't it ? But Updike makes a mess of a promising plot. Here is what happens....our hero decides to run away from his family, his job, his friends, everything......he gets into the car and intends to drive someplace far away. Ah, one thinks....a great American road trip is in order.....but no such luck. He returns to his town the same night, settles down with a prostitute, and when his wife is about to deliver a baby, goes back to her, again gets tired of her, goes back to the prostitute but is not sure if he should abandon his wife, and runs again.Sounds stupid ? It is.And the writing is tortuously slow and maddeningly muddy. It seems that Updike wrote this novel to please his literature teachers who would prefer form over substance. He writes these long paragraphs without punctuation apparently trying to describe and mirror the random thoughts of his characters....trying to evoke a stream-of-consciousness feel about these passages but fails miserably. Such passages only make the book even more tedious and ambiguous.Here is an example of what has been called Updike's 'Crystal-clear prose:'\\"And further inside, so ghostly it comes to him last, hangs a jagged cloud, the star of an explosion, whose center is uncertain in refraction but whose arms fly from the core of pallor as straight as long eraser-marks diagonally into all planes of the cube.\\"And if you guys want an example of Updike's cute punctuation, here are the last few words of the novel:\\"....he runs. Ah: runs. Runs.\\"Updike, like all bad literary-wannabe authors, keep describing the weather, the food, the scenery with great, tear-inducing meticulousness but doesn't develop his stereotypical characters even one bit during the course of the book.This garbage is not worth anybody's time and is a good example of why such so-called literature doesn't interest the masses. This is pretentious writing without even the slightest hint of talent or creativity. Two thumbs-down !"},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"This is the only book in the Rabbit Angstrom series that I have read so far. Although I would not call it a fast read it is a wonderful novel. Set in small-town America at the end of the nineteen-fifties, it captures an era in which boys went straight from high school into the military, and straight from the military into a marriage. They don't stop to consider the consequences of their actions until it is too late and they are trapped.Rabbit Angstrom realizes that he is trapped. A former basketball star, he is prematurely middle-aged at twenty-eight. On impulse, he runs. The trouble is, he doesn't know how to run away or where to go.The prose evokes a time and a place that no longer exist, and that is simultaneously a good and bad thing. No matter how unconscionable Rabbit's actions seem, his are the struggles of a fly caught in a web. He lashes out frantically because he's just realized he's been caught and can't figure out what he did wrong. It proves Socrates' dictum that the unexamined life is not worth living."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"There is no doubt that the author's writing is poignant and insightful. The behaviors of protagonist clearly convey the dilemmas, challenges and impulses of youth. The story itself was not very interesting to me, however, the protagonist's internal thought process was. My only problem, however, is that the thoughts read more of the author, meaning a sophisticated, analytical intellectual, and not of the character. It felf as if watching a movie with a director's commentary."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"I can't believe so many people have panned this book because they don't like the main character. Maybe they see too much of themselves in the book because some of the relationships in their lives are similar to the one Harry Angstrom has with his wife. Marriage is a living thing and it is often not pretty. This book captures life or at least a dark portion of it. If you want a feel good story don't pick it up. If you want a interesting piece of literature that will resonate with you then don't be shy."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Simply, this novel is superb and it has made me an Updike devotee. Maybe Updike is God, as it has been whispered from time to time. The wonderful pacing of the events of the story is matched by the almost haunting poetry of the prose. When it comes purely to the art of writing Updike has few peers (Nabokov, maybe Rushdie), and the magnetic imagery seems perfectly placed amongst the more necessary details of the story.Honestly after reading this i lament all of the time I have spent reading other authors when i could have been better spending my time reading Updike! His style is so bold and pronounced, the colors so lush, the details bursting with a life of their own, the characters hugely complex and on and on. This man is a wizard at artistic observation, and a master at getting into the innards of his fully-fleshed characters.I feel like an illiterate clod attempting to write about Updike; he must give any writer a huge inferiority complex. Anyhow run (quickly) to the bookstore and Read This Book."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"I read this novel for my AP English III class. Although I understand that everyone enjoys different types of reading, I find it hard to believe that anyone could truly enjoy wholeheartedly this long trek through one man's life. I chose this novel because of an excerpt from it I read that I liked. I enjoyed Updike's one-point-of-view, stream-of-consciousness style, although I found the repetitively depressing, anticlimactic events to be boring and disturbing. A man of easy caricature, Rabbit Angstrom, flows through the changes in his life brought about by marriage, the birth of a child, and the consequences the choices he makes hold. The repeated sexual references and graphic description might appeal moreso to the older reader than they might to me, yet I cannot understand how any reader would enjoy the pauses in the smooth, blanketing style of the writer's flow from one event to the other and the way it effects his character. The employment of deep emotion and feeling is prevalent in the novel, which I liked. The novel also presented many sarcastic universal truths throught the course of it in which Updike qualifies his understanding of humanity and bitterness towards it. One of the truths he states near the opening of the book, between major scenes, upon pondering right and wrong: &quot;We're all in it together. Fraud makes the world go round. The base of our economy.&quot; Updike also seems to understand that bad luck, once begun, fails to end for a long time, but that it is brought upon by oneself. Rabbit's sexual conquests and consistent lack of responsibility for himself definitely come back to haunt him with the loss of his wife and child. Rabbit also flashes back to the past, remembering the only fond thing about his early life, basketball. This comparison of things in his current life to that before makes life appear to Rabbit as a game, and as though each step he takes in it is like a foul in the basketball games he used to star in.Perhaps the thing that Updike most fully understands, though, is the human tendancy to fear the unknown. Throughout the entire novel, there is hardly a single page that doesn't describe Rabbit's fear of any one thing, situation or person. Rabbit continues to present himself in risky situations and try his sense of right and wrong by scaring himself into doing things. When Rabbit is presented with these uncomfortable situations, his natural reaction, like that of a rabbit, is to run. Updike's flowing style and colorful descriptions make everything appear normal until he adds the element of fear into his novel, which allow for it to be interrupted, and real life to play back into the picture of Rabbit and his game of life. One of Rabbit's few statements of true contemplation is that of a flashback to his basketball coach who said &quot;Run, run, run. Run every minute their feet are on the floor. You can't run enough...Give the boys the will to achieve. I've always liked that better than the will to win, because there can be achievement in defeat.&quot; This sums up how not only was Rabbit scarred by basketball into later life, but how his memory of &quot;achievement in defeat&quot; validates the presence of death, fear, and pain in Rabbit Angstrom's life."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"I considered titling this post \\"Sex and Updike,\\" but that seemed more than redundant...Reading Updike has and will ever be a challenge for me--a constant struggle against the easy high road of feminist indignation--not because Updike's undoubtedly genius prosaic skills somehow redeem him for his misogyny, but because misogyny isn't and shouldn't be the primary focus of his novels, especially Rabbit, Run. Sex is and should be....(Read the rest on my blog! [...] )"},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"I picked up a Fawcett edition of this book for a dime. I had never read an Updike book or any Updike story.

So these things were on my mind as I read the tale about \\"Rabbit.\\" What we have here is a 26 yr who peaked in life as a high school basketball star. A married man who has an affair with a woman who he met thru his old coach. A married man (Rabbit) with a 2 yr old son and a pregnant wife. A married man who plays golf with the preacher and has eyes for the preachers's wife. There is not much to like about Rabbit's family or his in-laws. The one man who seemed to believe in something was the Lutheran minister, Fritz. (I did like him.) Anyway, Rabbit is a modern man who when faced with any difficulties simply runs. Runs away from it all. What a man. I understand that there are three more Rabbit books and that two won Pulitzer prizes. Amazing. There is some very good prose in the book but the subject matter blows. There are people in America who try to do the right thing, people who are not consumed with ugliness.

This book has a main character that is hard not to like, even though he behaves in a pretty reprehensible way and it portrays the cloying nature of some marriages and the day to day grind of working life very well. You really understand why Rabbit ran and his behaviour throughout the book, although it has to be said he is a very indecisive chap! I came to Updike via his short stories and whilst I enjoyed this novel I have to say I enjoy his short stories more. This seemed to lack the melancholy and moving narrative of his short stories, although the writing here is just as stunning and his turn of phrases and descriptions are amazing, they just moved me less than his other shorter pieces. This may well be personal preference. After reading this I want to get the other \`rabbit' novels to see where Rabbit's life goes and no doubt once you read this you will want to do the same. There is also an afterword by the author exploring the writing of this and the other Rabbit novels and if you are unfamiliar with them some of the points raised may go over your head, but it makes for informative reading never the less. This is a great introduction to Updike's novels, but if this fails to move you don't give up, but try one of his outstanding sort story collections instead.

Harry is someone totally irresponsible of his actions and acts hopelessly immature. If my summary of the book sounds pointless and confusing to you, then you have gotten the idea. Don't read this book if you're not a pious fan of John Updike."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"In John Updike's Rabbit, Run he reveals the stunning reality that is life. What happens to us during our high school years does not determine the rest of our lives. Harry Angstrom, the main character of the novel, was one of the best basketball players his school had ever seen. He was the popular kid in school everyone loved, and everything seemed so clear. Now he has run away from his wife and the fog has begun to set in. He begins to live his life with no responsibility for any of his actions.Updike does a wonderful job of painting the picture of Harry's life. He captures what a real dysfunctional family looks like. With the use of an extensive vocabulary Updike captivates every last detail in a scene. He describes every character's emotions and reactions to one another and he causes us to begin to have our own emotions and reactions towards the characters. Harry's life is not a happy or a sad one because there are so many different viewpoints to look from. He may seem happy now, but what happens when he gets bored with where he is? This book is a good to read, although it would be best if read by an experienced reader."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"The primary problem with this novel is that Rabbit is neither sympathetic (he's actually sort of a wanker) nor interestingly unsympathetic. He comes across as a spoiled little mama's boy who seems on the verge of curling up in a corner and sticking his thumb in his mouth. This would be tolerable, possibly, if he had even the slightest sense of humor about himself; as it is, the combination of severity and (unintentional) absurdity is more than a little trying.Updike lathers on the details, though he's far from his best in this early effort, and as a result the novel hasn't aged well at all. There's an embarrassing, dated feel to the narrative--a kind of 1958 hokiness to much of the descriptions, particularly Rabbit's interactions with any of the women in the book. Things that were presumably taboo in 1959 come across as laughable today, and this further undermines Updike's purpose.Taken as the early work of a relatively young man, the novel does have a bit of promise, though I can't imagine handing it to someone today and saying, \\"You've really go to read this. This is important.\\" Were it not the foundation for the rest of the Rabbit series I would think it would have died a quiet death long ago."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"I read this book 5 years ago, learned to hate John Updike, and haven't picked up a book of his since.

Today, I started what seems like it will be a bad book that described \\"plump, round buttocks,\\" and naturally thought again of Updike and how much I had hated his description of women. I'm not quite motivated enough to diss him to go and check out another copy from the library to search for the phrases that I hated the most (white mounds of flesh..), but I was delighted to see that I was not alone in my disdain for this novel and this author (at least at this phase of his writing..), and I am pleased to add another single-star (regrettably not zero-star) review to his depressingly high pile of praise."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"If Updike deliberately intended for this book to portray a person who's life you definitely should NOT imitate, then maybe this book should get 5 stars. But I wish that he had stated that a little more plainly. Harry &quot;Rabbit&quot; Angstrom is, as a character in the book says to him, totally self-centered and spoiled. It made me want to scold this fictional character's parents for doing such a poor job of raising him. The story is almost unrelentingly depressing. He thinks only of himself, and doesn't care who he hurts in his pursuit of his latest whim. It would be nice if he learned something positive by the end of the book, or at least acknowledged some of his shortcomings, but alas, that is not the case. The only redeeming quality in this book is a positive portrayal of a minister -- a man who is good, doing his best, yet human.

Not completely sorry, as I liked the interactions between people and think Updike has a great eye for what makes people tick. But, about 100 pages into the book I was tired of reading all the net and snare metaphors ridden to exhaustion and decided to skip most of the overwrought description and focus on the interactions between people. The one thing that kept me going was a mild interest in seeing how Rabbit would devolve or evolve, but honestly, unlike most of the other characters, he's the same jackass at the end of the book that he is at the beginning. In the real world people who refuse to learn from experience are oddly fascinating, at first, but in books they stale quickly.

Yet, for those of us who lived through the Sixties and continue to watch the ebbing away of those primary values that once underlaid our country, reading RABBIT, RUN today is small potatoes. Similarly, the sexual \`explicitness' that had everyone talking back at the time of publication, would hardly raise an eyebrow today. Various sexual acts that have become part of US national lore, for better or for worse, were still not given a name in this novel. Rabbit Angstrom, a former highschool basketball star, is stuck in a boring, tawdry marriage and a dead-end job. His lower middle-class parents expect him to follow in their footsteps; his in-laws look down on him as a no-hoper. A few years later, the answer would have been obvious---tune in, turn on, and drop out ! But in those more serious times, a mere five years before the tidal wave of change began, Rabbit's flight can draw no social or political sympathy. There is no Haight-Ashbury in view. He drives into the night, only to return sheepishly. He soon takes up with Ruth, a \\"loose woman\\", who, again five years later, could have been seen as a \\"hip chick doing her own thing\\". Everyone condemns him, the woman condemns herself. She gets pregnant, but does not tell Rabbit, even when he runs from her to rejoin his wife in the hospital as she gives birth to his second child. Family grudgingly accept him back, but things have not really improved. A do-good minister with a bored, flirtatious wife tries to help Rabbit resolve his inner conflicts, but is too weak to accomplish much. A final tragedy occurs. Rabbit runs off to Ruth yet again. The ending is a little predictable.In my opinion, Updike hovers always on the edge of greatness. He is forever caught between the desire to write supremely well and to be popular. I love how he catches the feel of a small American town or city in the late \`50s, the mores and expectations of the people, their goods and habits. But as a young man, perhaps, Updike loved his own skill rather too much, he loved to sit back and watch himself create these verbose passages, these descriptions of old ladies on porch gliders, of upper class gardens, or of Pennsylvania country gas stations. He revelled in those descriptions that somehow ring a mite \\"over-literary\\". His reach for the perfect word sometimes extends too far. I feel, as an older man, that Updike before 30 could see beauty only in very young women, perhaps thanks to Hollywood and the printed media. Each description of an older woman is tinged with disgust, discoloration, and deterioration. That said, Rabbit Angstrom is an unforgettable character. Updike's choice of name is very clever. If you sympathize with him at first, his utterly brainless selfishness and weak indecision, his lack of any backbone whatsoever, tend to make you despair. He is a real antidote to the American dream, to the \\"log cabin to White House story\\" that we love to love. At times, this novel annoyed me with its wordiness, but it grips you like a crazy ride on a downward spiral. There is a bit of Rabbit in everyone, but most people face the music, most people form some idea of where to go next."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Besides the usual laudatory remarks about this Updike work, (which are all important and valid) i.e., preternatural description, dialogue, sense of place, character, etc., I think it is important to consider the book within the early 1960's milieu of existentialist literature. What makes Rabbit, Run a revelatory book is because we see an Everyman who is not merely alienated from 'God' but from everyone else. Rabbit sees himself as an isolated isotope in the world even though he is externally a typical representative of mid-America. When he looks at his home town from the hill, he senses the isolation of all the lives across the valley--and I believe Updike is hinting at the fact that we all feel like outsiders to a world full of 'insiders', but in feeling that isolation are stuck in its irony. 'Rabbit, Run' unmasks the 'hail fellow, well met' facade of American post-WWII culture as we see a man running from himself and perhaps running until the end, three books later. We see the sadness behind the false smile in Rabbit and by extension perhaps we can learn a bit about our culture whether it is the fulsome friendliness of morning talk shows or the upbeat nature of rah-rah politics. 'Rabbit, Run' is the ultimate expression of the plight of the minority--because we are all in the minority. The only difference is that some identify with the oppressor; others with the oppressed. The title of the book should clearly indicate which way Harry Angstrom version goes."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Updike writes with such detail it's like he's painting a picture in my mind. Normally mundane life bursts off the page and I can see what he is writing about. I am now on to Rabbit Redux which jumps ahead a few years and is even better, I can remember what I was doingin 1971 when that was published, a much more political time and Updike is in the middle of it all."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Updike certainly turns out the anti-hero in Harry (Rabbit) Angstrom, a misogynistic 26-year old ex-basketball player who hasn't grown up. Love, for Harry, ebbs away with every ejaculation and is restored only when his resevoirs fill up. Yet women fall for him, forgive him, hate him and hate themselves for their vulnerability, while Harry's foil, the Rev Jack Eccles, who is truly on a mission to save souls, is despised by his wife Lucy. And yet it was the Eccles's of this world, the organizational men (and women), who built post-war America. I wonder how this book was received when it first came out?Updike was also lucky to be writing this novel before the literary writing classes and editors became more established in the land. The book is loaded with the how-not-to's that contemporary literary courses teach us: word repetitions, tense changes, sudden point-of-view shifts, first person/third person confusion, unecessary adverbs,run-on sentences, lack of punctuation, multiple pronouns in a sentence refering to different characters and confusing the reader...the list goes on. Some scenes run forever and Updike is [...] (pardon the pun) on detail, even when he goes to great pains to disguise the \\"unatural\\" sex acts that Rabbit demands of his women. And yet he was able to hold my attention with his snappy dialogue, with dramatic scenes such as Janice's alcoholic misadventure with her baby, and with dysfunctional characters such as Harry and Jack.I got the impression that,like his protagonist, Updike was running free of his contemproaries, the critics and the editors, writing this book and determined to preserve his distinct voice (whether we like it or not). Perhaps the title of this book should have been \\"Updike, Run\\".Shane Joseph www.shanejoseph.com"},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"So far it's been kind of a difficult read. The plot is kind of interesting, but the character, Harry Angstrom (Rabbit) is a really unappealing, amoral character, especially in his attitude towards women. He seems to hate women, be they his mother, his wife, or the woman he freeloads off of when he leaves his wife. He even has creepy, mysogynist things to say about a minister's 3 year old daughter. I don't know about this book. But I'm still going to try to finish it, because there is something about the writing that keeps me interested."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"While few would think of a drab 1960 lower middle class industrial suburb in Pennsylvania as an ideal setting for a novel, it is perfect for the tale that Updike tells here. Though we might not choose to exist in this brown-gray environment, neither would our twenty-something protagonist, and that's precisely the point. That we can be disgusted and frustrated along with him is what gives substantial balance to his sometimes unlikable decisions, and helps us react to them fairly. Updike's ability to paint with broad strokes of reality is simply astounding. No other author I've read can so painfully probe into the most intimate of human motivations and behavior. Every sentence is sculpted so beautifully, that even this early work, occassionally revealing a pinch of effort as his more recent works never do, could still serve as a manual for writing fiction. But perhaps best of all is the well-crafted plot, something I'm now discovering as an Updike trademark. Small actions push the next along so as to keep the reader going, yet still at ease, assured that the book is an innocuous bed of subtlety, and then WHAM! you are hit with a wallop that comes from nowhere, but feels absolutely right. This is the way that life happens, captured perfectly in Rabbit, Run. Warning: If cliffhanger endings bug you, watch out. As for me, I'm running to get the next Rabbit!"},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"John Updike's first in a series of \\"rabbit\\" novels is about a washed up high school basketball star that struggles to find success during his post-basketball crowning. Harry \\"Rabbit\\" Angstrom finds himself running from mostly everything - including his wife, child, job, and himself. He shacks up with a local whore, Ruth, and relates to Ruth really well in the sexual manner, but seems awkward during everyday situations. He inevitable becomes attached to both his wife and Ruth and has a hard time deciding which fate suits him better - or another alternative is neither lifestyle.This is the first Updike novel I have read, and I was so impressed by the impact of each sentence and the deep rooted meaning and symbolism in every passage. I think in a way, Updike has unfairly been labeled a misogynist, even though he has little respect for Rabbit's wife, Janice.I found the book to be extremely sad, but quite touching. I imagine many men have gone through this agonizing ordeal of not knowing where there life is heading and if it is even heading in the right direction. Some just run from their problems - like Rabbit."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"I read this book because it is on many Top 100 lists.

So far this is the only one I've read, so far, and I really loved it. Rabbit is such a sad person, a pathetic, indecisive has-been who I would want nothing to do with in real life, but this isn't real life, is it. I really enjoy Updike's style. Sometimes he can be a bit over descriptive, but I just read those parts while thinking about something like kites or past sexual experiences. I've already started Rabbit, Redux, and I am glad that I didn't hafta wait 10 years to read it like the suckers who were alive when these books were first published."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"In the book, Rabbit Run, Harry Angstrom runs away from his home. He runs away from an alcoholic wife, a simple job in the sales world, a young boy, and his soon to be daughter. Rabbit (Harry) is searching for his childhood life; he wants to go back to the days when he was the high school jock, and the star of the basketball team. Thinking that finding his old basketball coach will help him, he goes in search of Mr. Tothero. Tothero introduces him to a couple of friends, Margaret and Ruth, and by the end of the night Rabbit and Ruth become roommates. Rabbit seems to be happy until his wife, Janice, goes into labor and forces rabbit to leave Ruth and rush to the hospital. Throughout the rest of the book, Rabbit fights with the desire to return to Ruth, and the obligation he feels he has to Janice and their two children. The novel ends in such a dramatic way that you can't wait to begin reading the second book in the series.John Updike did a terrific job in creating the realistic fictional novel. The novel was easy to read, and just interesting enough to keep you into it. Updike uses simple vocabulary and his sentence structure is easy to follow. At some points the plot and descriptions John Updike chose were weak and a little dry, but overall the book was enjoyable.

But I was not inspired to find out more about Rabbit in the other books--he is way too ordinary &amp; unappealing &amp; shallow. And John Updike may get an &quot;A&quot; from his writing teacher, where form is more important than substance, but I challenge anyone to make sense of this quote--granted, it's out of context, but you'd have to have a strange imagination to dream up a context for it.

Being sort of bored this summer I thought I could start the series. To say the least, I expected more; however, I also realize I must keep in mind that this is one of Mr. Updike's earlier works. This of course explains the immature slant. All and all I found Rabbit a very unlikable character. Running around on his wife and essentially killing his baby girl did not make me feel for his plight. If he feels so strained by domestic responsibilities then why put yourself in such a position from the start. If Mr. Updike's intention was to make one feel sorry for Rabbit, he failed completely. All through the novel I wanted to see him get some sort of comeuppance. I guess I'll have to read the next one to see if this happens.

There are a few surprises in the book that are a good plot twist...I won't spoil it for you, but they make it interesting to read.The only drawback I see in this book it that at times there is too much description and not a lot of dialouge. To me, when you see pages filled with paragraph after paragraph, it looks less appealing to read, even if it is interesting. Many of the times, however, I found the descriptive paragraphs boring.

Published originally over four decades ago, it captures its time and its place with utter accuracy yet the novel still applies to our society that has been transformed in many significant ways since Rabbit Angstrom first appeared on the literary scene. While he is destined for greater material success in Updike's later Rabbit novels, Rabbit is a salesman living a marginal life with an alcoholic wife in RABBIT, RUN. Brilliant prose stylist that he is, Updike spins a winning story about these characters, and it is a story that will seemingly survive upon the American literary landscape for as long as there are readers of fine books."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"The first Harry 'Rabbit' Angstrom book and Rabbits glory days are past. From basketball hero he now has a dead end job and a stagnant marriage; one child and one on the way. Washed up at 26 he seeks a new life; a new begining,but all his plans are hampered by his indecision and lusts.This is a great read and 50 years on is still fresh and ground breaking in its sexual detail and exploration of the failed American dream. Updike's prose style is descriptive and poetic and somehow achieves the near impossible in making in making Harry sympathetic despite his amoral attitude to life and the damage he does to those around him.I avoided Updike for years despite recommendations and only recently took him up with 'My Fathers Tears'. That was excellent and 'Rabbit Run' serves to show how much more of his work I have to enjoy. This certainly measures up to comparable novels such as 'Revolution Road'."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"My local library put out a reading challenge to read any book written in the year you were born. How strange to think that while my parents were expecting me, John Updike was writing this! I had not read Updike before and I was absolutely struck by the intensity and beauty of his prose.This book is the story of an average guy who was a basketball star in high school and now sells vegetable peelers. He has a child and a pregnant wife. Feeling trapped, he tries to run away but can't quite take the big step. Instead, he ends up living with what must have been at that time called a 'loose woman'. Things tumble downhill for Rabbit, his wife, and his lover. Eventually, Rabbit returns to his wife but his troubles are far from over. In a mind-blowing climactic scene, the worst possible thing happens.I will definitely be reading the rest of the books in the series. Poor Rabbit. It really isn't his fault, and yet, it all sort of is."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Harry \`Rabbit' Angstrom is an anti-hero for 1960s America and for modern times: self-centred, irresponsible, sybaritic, pusillanimous. Rabbit is an ex-college basketball player. He is spoilt, though he does have an intermittently functioning conscience. And he decides his layabout wife and his job as a potato-peeler salesman are not what he expected from life: such is the premise of Rabbit, Run, a self-contained novel that became the first piece of a four-part series.Rabbit, Run brushes aside money to suggest sport and religion are what American mores are about. For despite its premise, the book soon parts with beat-generation road-novel stereotypes. What interests Updike isn't so much that giddy ride into the unknown, but what happens back home, the tug-of-war of flight and gravity more than flight itself. Rabbit, Run thus resembles a darker version of the movie The Graduate more than On The Road. Rabbit becomes involved with a loose woman as he is chased about by a local pastor. This makes for a slow, sometimes un-engaging middle third of the story, especially since Updike's characters are meant as realistic more than appealing. Nevertheless, the novel picks up pace towards the end. And if it has mildly aged since it was written - one scene, involving fellatio, was evidently expected to shock and was indeed censored in the first edition - Rabbit, Run remains highly readable and interesting."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Weren't the 1950s supposed to be the era of the organization man: a man who leads a life of prescribed normalcy without questioning? But Harry \\"Rabbit\\" Angstrom, a high school basketball star of only minor repute just eight years ago, now at age twenty-six, circa 1959, a demonstrator of vegetable peelers and married to Janice with whom he has lost a sense of connection, is unable to find equanimity in his life. One night, instead of picking up his young son, he runs; his all-night automobile journey is almost directionless but he returns by morning to his small town in Pennsylvania, where he struggles over the next few months to understand his situation and get his life together.Rabbit at first seeks refuge with his old coach, through whom he finds Ruth, a rather down and out young woman - the anti-Janice - who wants nothing to do with him, but who finally provides Harry some stability. He also encounters a youngish Rev Jack Eccles, who sees core goodness in Harry, prods him during weekly golfing sessions, and builds bridges between Harry and Janice and her family. A reconciliation with Janice is short-lived with tragic consequences, leaving Harry still, literally, running at the end.The book has the author's typical highly nuanced descriptions, which can at times be very awkward and difficult, making the book a bit of a slow read. Despite lengthy descriptions of the fictional towns of Brewer and Mt. Judge, they remain rather muddled. Harry is not a reflective person, but the author subtly captures his appeal, especially to women. Characterizations are a strength of the book. Eventually, the actions and thinking of Ruth, Janice, her parents, etc come to be appreciated and understood. With Harry left in such a state of uncertainty at the end of the book, it is by no means predictable where Harry will be physically or mentally in the sequel to this book.It may be debatable as to whether Harry is worth writing about. Perhaps he can be viewed as an everyman of the 1950s, especially one who fell through the cracks. It would have been interesting to see the author address the options that Harry had out of high school. What was he actually prepared to do? Why did he slip to being a vegetable-peeler demonstrator? But then maybe authors in the 1950s didn't question much more than their characters. The book barely slips in as a four-star."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"I've been meaning to read the \\"Rabbit\\" books for years and have finally made a start. I wasn't disappointed, although I was a little surprised. I had an idea of the matters covered in these books but was expecting a wider canvas than the small domestic drama that is the story of Harry \\"Rabbit\\" Angstrom. Perhaps I had this preconception because one tends to expect a grandiose sweep from such lauded literature. But Updike deals with the American dream in a microcosmic way. He analyses the mundane to produce a reflection of the wider world. Rabbit is a fine example of flawed humanity, struggling with his shortcomings while trying to work out exactly what he expects from life. He's sometimes sympathetic, sometimes quite unlikeable; a realistically complex character depicted with candour. The prose is often wonderfully evocative, although I occasionally found the grammatical structure a little unusual. Updike takes the life of an unremarkable man and provides a remarkable incite into how difficult that life can be."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"To keep this as short as possible; I picked up the book because it won a Pulitzer prize, and the good reviews it had. I was in a period of reading a lot of non-fiction, and wanted to take a break with some fiction.The rating of 3 stars is because it was not good or bad, my reaction was apathy. I was a bit disappointed with the structure and format. That lack of actual chapters was a bit boring.The book seemed to drag on, had there been less unnecessary detail, it would have gotten a better review. Instead I feel I read much more about a particular thing than I needed to. I loved the way John Updike expressed the detail, but I think he went overboard in some cases. Especially since there is no real action in the book and are only a few main events that happen.I'm not sure I would particularly recommend the book to somebody. I will mention it and tell them my lack of reaction to it. The characters can be interesting, and in some aspects I wish I could hear more about them. I do not think I will pick up the other Rabbit books anytime soon though.Some of it can be a bit detailed about sex, if that is of concern to anybody. I had to chuckle at some of the euphemisms used.If you want a book where the main character is indecisive, escapes, but does not really move away or change, then this book would be of interest. Every character has their annoying qualities, even Rabbit. Surprisingly my favorite character was the minister. There is some decent deep thought play that is spoken but never really discussed from him. Especially for the time period."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"I was more than a little amused after reading some of the other reviews. Amazing how many people don't get it. This has nothing to do with \\"On the Road\\" or \\"the Stranger.\\" And I am certain that Updike did not mean to portray Harry Angstrom as Everyman. Quite the contrary.This was a very risky book to write. I am certain that Updike must have had great trepidation showing us a \\"hero\\" who is at once immature, insensitive and narcissistic. I mean there is virtually nothing likable about this guy. Why should we care about him? He was a big fish in a tiny basketball pond in high school and drifted into marriage with a woman to whom he refers often as a \\"mutt.\\" He likes the idea of being married, but not the specificity of it. I wonder if this book gave Philip Roth the courage to write Portnoy's Complaint.One reader made reference to Updike's use of stream of consciousness, thus showing his ignorance. Clearly this reviewer never read James Joyce or Virginia Wolff and has no idea of what real stream of consciousness is.It is Updike's portrayal of time and place that evokes such a strong feeling in us; that and the wonderful supporting cast he gives us. But it is the men who are badly damaged here as well as most of the women. The two fathers, Springer and Angstrom seem like tired, depressed old men who are just plodding along. Their wives are more sharply etched by Updike, but they only seem alive when angry. Harry's sister seems much like an empty shell. His old coach, Tothero, is a sick, depressed old man, living in the past and takes up with a woman who has contempt for him. Eccles, the reverend, is busy trying to repair the chaos in the Angstrom house while blissfully unaware of the crumbling of his own. Only his wife, Lucy has the appropriate response to Harry: she hangs up on him.This book is a sign of its time. In 1960 when it was first published, the country was coming out of a recession and the malaise of the Eisenhower years. It had just elected a vigorous and young new president, but small town America had not quite climbed on board yet. This is not merely a novel about Harry Angstrom. It is a novel of time and place and in that regard it is very much like Jack Kerouac's first novel, \\"The Town and the City,\\" although Updike's characters are more finely drawn.The writing throughout is simply exquisite. Few American writers have been able to evoke such feeling in so few words as this sentence: \\"The hours that follow are so long they seem to contain the same incidents over and over.\\"In the Republic, Plato likens the artist to a Wizard and he says the Wizard holds a mirror to nature. That is what John Updike has done. Rabbit, Run is a mirror held up by a Wizard to a small American town in a certain time and place, warts and all."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Considering Updike was 28 years old when he wrote this book, it has to be considered one of the most promising books any up and coming author has ever laid at the feet of the literate public. As much as I enjoy Tom Robbins, who graced us with Another Roadside Attraction at roughly the same age, this stands above that as a precursor to what would come later. Rabbit, Run is a great start to what turned out to be an outstanding writing career.The book deals with middle America, the loneliness and sexual frustration which exists there. This seems a common theme for Updike, as his book Villages, written 45 years before this, addresses many of the same topics, albeit with a somewhat different twist in a similar but not identical setting. One thing we can assume is that Updike subscribes to the adage to write what you know. But then he also penned the Witches Of Eastwick as well as his latest, Terrorist. So take that for what it's worth.In any event, Rabbit, Run deals with a Twenty something Everyman unhappy in life and unhappy in marriage, living unhappily in a blue collar Pennsylvania town. Once the star of his high school basketball team, Rabbit has not gone on to bigger and brighter things. More accurately, Rabbit is mired in a rut, burdened with the every day slump many in the same situation find themselves in. To escape this rut, he does as the title suggests. He runs.The running is dealt with brilliantly in the pages. Human tragedy, frailty, emotion - all are covered here. The reader is squeezed through the wringer as we rise and fall with Rabbit's actions, his decisions, and his ultimate cowardess. From his wife, to another, back to his wife, then away, there is nothing for Rabbit to do, nothing he knows how to do, but run to escape his misery. Behind him, nothing remains but a path of destruction.This book is a brilliant example of required American literature. Given the plight of society, this book - which is now 46 years old - is no less accurate than the day it was written. As we move to the later half of the book, the pages turn faster, even though they're often devoid of dialog and thick with narrative. Updike brings magic to these pages and to the actions of the Everyman Rabbit, who does not fancy himself an Everyman at all, but as unique from everyone he meets.This is a complete book, in my opinion worthy of every accolade ever heaped upon it. While it is an old book by today's standard, it is every bit worth the read. I greatly look forward to picking up the next in the Rabbit books, Rabbit Redux."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"This book was not an easy one to get into. It definitely starts slow, with descriptions and monologues overrunning the plot for a time. But it doesn't take too long for the reader to fall in love with Rabbit.Rabbit is a young, married father who is unhappy with his lower middle class life and unexpectedly deserts his wife and son while on an errand. He moves in with the town floozie and plays house while trying to figure out exactly what to do. He is befriended by a priest who tries to set him on the right path during weekly golf rounds. Despite his selfishness and arrogance, Rabbit manages to be immensely likable; somehow i was rooting for this adulterer and liar to succeed in the end. This is mainly due to Updike's skills as a writer. He doesn't paint a pretty picture of his characters or make them bastions of morality. Instead, they are entirely human, which makes them incredibly easy to relate to. I underlined several passages in the book as being remarkably insightful. Updike is able to describe the human condition in three sentences when it would take three paragraphs for even the most skilled writers. At least in this respect, Updike is very similar to my favorite American author, Richard Russo.Updike peppers his book with humor and tragedy, making &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot; a bit of a roller coaster and always surprising. His cast of characters (especially the minister's wife) are colorful and dynamic. Appropriately, there's no great moral at the end (again: Russo), leaving the way open for the other Rabbit books, which after this great opening salvo, I can't wait to read.4 stars."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"The first Updike book I've read, and it made me want to read more. Never having heard of Updike's myth, I had very few preconceptions. I found Updike's style entrancing, powerful, beautiful.If you need to like the characters in a story in order to enjoy a book, don't read this book. If you need to read about characters who reflect your moral beliefs, don't read this book. Updike's style takes the ordinary everyday (many reviewers here have noted the mundaneness of the plot), takes the subtle evanescing experiences of life, and crystallises them, slows them down, so we can see, ponder, wonder, re-examine. Updike neither condones nor condemns any character in this story: each of them is described in a way that reveals or suggests the mystery and wonder (not necessarily wonderful!) of the universe that is a human being. Most of the characters have little self-awareness, with protagonist Rabbit having the least. Yet Rabbit has a very alert instinct that can sense attitudes and intentions behind the words and movements of others. Abandoning his prostitute companion, Rabbit returns to his wife, and contritely stays with his wife's parents while his wife is having their 2nd baby in hospital. The in-laws are glad Rabbit has returned yet still censure him in their hearts for having left in the first place. Updike describes the atmosphere in the house as a shifting in the furniture and the air to make a space where Harry can fit in, if he makes himself very small. This is how Rabbit lives: he sense things instinctively but rarely questions whether what he is doing is right or wrong. He can't, his instincts are too strong. He feels good when things &quot;click&quot;: when he nets a perfect basket, when he hits a perfect drive in golf. When things don't go his way, he feels uncomfortable, trapped; his disappointment is instantaneous.Despite Rabbit's unpleasant character, the dilemmas he faces are common to many (as are those of his wife and Ruth, the prostitute he shacks up with for a while): what should he do about his wife's drinking? And about his own distaste for her drunkenness? About his wife's untidiness and the distaste this arouses in Harry? Should Ruth tell Harry she's pregnant with his child? Will this make him want to stay, or run? Is the woman who invites him in flirting with him? Or is he misreading the signs? No answers are provided, rather we just see Rabbit living out his life instinctively, and while we see the mess this leads him into, I felt sad when Rabbit returned to his wife. It was like watching a wild thing returning to its cage."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Harry \\"Rabbit\\" Angstrom was a high school superstar only a handful of years ago. Now he is a young married father, trapped in the suburban 60's, unhappy with a cluttered house, a drunken wife, and a son who will never be the athlete he was. Will this former basketball star find a way to make his life better, or will he run like a rabbit? The title says it all and Harry Angstrom does indeed run whenever things don't go his way.Leaving the house to pick up his son, he impulsively drives from his Pennsylvania home to West Viriginia. He wants to run to the sunny shores of Florida to live the life he feels he deserves. Surely a man like Rabbit deserves more in life, or so he imagines. Unable to complete this journey, he runs to his former coach, a tired and washed-up man who introduces him to a part-time prostitute. Rabbit moves in with Ruth that very night and they begin a relationship they flaunt and thus humiliate his very pregnant wife and both sets of parents.Is there an ounce of unselfishness in Rabbit? The reader may think so when he returns to his wife the night she goes into labor. Their reunion is bittersweet and because in large part of Rabbit's inability to see beyond his own needs, their reunion burst apart in a senseless tragedy that is horrific but so beautifully written the reader is glued to the page hoping against hope this terrible thing is not happening.Will Rabbit be able to grow up and realize he is no longer the high school hero? Will he be able to comfort his wife, to provide a home for her and his children? Will he forsake Ruth, the hooker who accepts him as he is but is now pregnant with his child? In which direction will Rabbit run this time?In addition to the novel's main character, Updike gives us as fine an array of secondary characters as can be found anywhere. He elevates Janice and Ruth so that they are not stereotypical \\"bad wife\\" and \\"good-time girl\\" but sympathetic characters the reader can relate to. Most notable among the secondary characters is the minister, Jack Eccles, who takes upon himself the task of saving Rabbit. He becomes Rabbit's friend and marvels at the paradox of this character. For example, after spending the first night with Ruth, Rabbit has the need to go home and get clean clothes as he cannot function unless his wardrobe is clean and pressed. The minister inquires, \\"Why cling to that decency if trampling on the others is so easy?\\" Thus lies the paradox of this restless anti-hero, one the reader cannot admire but cannot help but root for and not turn away from. It is this same minister who so succintly sums up the essence of Rabbit when he lambasts him later by saying, \\"The truth is you're monstrously selfish. You're a coward. You don't care about right or wrong; you worship nothing except your own worst instincts.\\" And therein lies the crux of Rabbit's character.The novel's second half is quite intense and on finishing it there is no way I could leave Rabbit and the supporting characters behind. I had to know what happened, so immediately began the sequel RABBIT REDUX, the second in the four-part Rabbit series. I admit that had I read this when it was first published I would have been let-down by the ending since I like tidy conclusions. Waiting 11 years to find out what happened to Rabbit would have been an eternity. I could barely wait 11 seconds, so I'm glad I discovered these books and Updike only recently."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"This is a Great Book - it must be - the NYT and other literary experts say so. Rabbit's life is awful - his wife's a drunk, his job sucks, nothing is really what he thought life would be. He tries to run away and fails at that too. According to Time magazine, Rabbit Angstrom is \\"an unflinchingly authentic specimen of American manhood\\". Yikes! Let's hope not - but maybe there is more truth in it than one likes to admit.It's hard not to recommend reading this book even though reading it is really not an enjoyable experience. Rabbit evoked powerful emotions in this reader - especially anger and depression; maybe a little anxiety. You are almost guaranteed to feel worse after you read this book - especially if you can identify with any part Angstrom's angst. On the other hand, the mature reader (er, middle-aged) who has experienced the fullness of life's sorrows may sort of shrug at Rabbit as if to say 'what did you expect from life? Pull yourself together, son.'Read at your own risk."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"I always find it interesting that in a lot of extended series of novels, the first book tends to be compact and to the point, while later novels tend to be more sprawling and expanded. Glancing over my line of Updike's Rabbit novels, of which this is the first, that seems to be the case, but time will tell whether those later books successfully trade the taut intensity of this novel for a more spacious feel. The Rabbit novels take up four books, all tracing the life of Harry \\"Rabbit\\" Angstrom, a man growing up in the latter part of the twentieth century, with each book taking place in a different decade, highlighting not only the changes in Harry but the changes in the country itself as it winds through the crazy years of the 1900's. This book takes place in the early fifties or late sixties and introduces us to the man himself, Rabbit, who does his best to fulfill the verb embedded in the title and run as far as he can. Harry feels trapped in his marriage, with a three year old already present and his wife heavily pregnant and drinking all the time, he takes a look at his dreary life and wigs out, trying to drive as far away as he can before coming back and attempting to find himself, with increasingly flailing results. His quests lead him to encounter a priest, a prostitute, an old coach and his parents and in-laws, all of whom have advice and none of which seem to have the right advice. So Harry tries to forge his own way but that might not be right either. The book doesn't have so much of a plot as it consists of shifting stream of consciousness impressions, all told with Updike's carefully controlled prose, lunging from beautiful descriptions of the outside world and the people in it to searingly brutal internal monologues that are only matched by the terrible things people say to each other. There's hardly a likeable character in the entire novel and that's where the real truimph comes in because even when you have all these imperfect people you keep reading anyway, watching them trying to find meaning in their grey lives, with nobody really sure what to do. And in the center of it all runs Rabbit, serving to cause everything even as he's only reacting against what's happening to him. People throw the word \\"anti-hero\\" around when describing him and it's not too far off, he's selfish and hypocritical and impulsive and utterly self centered but yet there's a fascinating sincerity about him, a tragic sense that he's certain he's doing the right thing even as he brings it crumbling down even further. None of the characters are angelic, all hide their own motives and quirks and it only makes them more sympathetic because they're dealt flawed cards to begin with and sometimes in trying to make the best of it they only muck things up further. The latter half of the book is remarkably intense considering it's about suburban life and the pivotal moment goes by like a slow motion car wreck, a horror far worse than anything Stephen King ever crafted unfolding before you. You know what's going to happen about halfway through and you keep reading in the hopes that your intuition isn't true. Updike's words masterfully give voice to the numbness inside all of them and even if he's wordier than he should be at moments it doesn't matter because the sheer tide of his telling carries us through. The book depicts people who are alternatively saints and monsters and really none and so fall somewhere in between, just like any of us. Rabbit runs, but it gets him nowhere and with a character this rich, readers have to know that we'll eventually see what happens beyond the ending. And yes there are three more books. But even if you can only read one, this is enough. That there's three more waiting is just an afterthought, a way to see what happens in the movie after the credits stop rolling and everyone else has gone home. Regardless of anything else, here's where it starts."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Reading Updike's sentences is a breathtaking experience. He has a rare ability to transpose ordinary experiences into rarefied grounds without falsely heightening experiences themselves. Each sentence, each event in the novel is carefully considered and calibrated, so that no sentence or description seems wasteful. The technical facility of Updike is truly something to marvel at, even surpassing the lyricism of Cheever. The way he writes about sex, adultery and guilt in this book is unparalleled in 20th century American fiction, and I haven't seen any other writer come close.Taken as an individual novel, however, it fails to rise to the status of a 'great american novel.' Although the writing is unsurpassingly beautiful, the plot is a bit thin, and ideas it expresses, commonplace. Minus the prose, the story tracks the wanderlust and guilt of Harry Angstrom, a man who still wants to hold on to his glorious boyhood, and seeks to escape his oncoming adulthood and life of ordinariness. It's a well-traveled premise for a novel, but executed and polished to a hilt.As we see Rabbit Angstrom struggle to keep apace with his given life, we are meant to see the social milieu that he lives in. Readers do get an acute sense of time and place, but what of it? Not that all fiction should strive for the Meaning of Life (how dreadful would that be?!), but the feeling you get after reading 'Rabbit, Run' is that of caffeine rush which you know will fade. And it does.I don't mean to slight Updike's legacy - he is one of the best writers we have in the States. And read as a tetralogy, the Rabbit books do encapsulate four decades of Americana with a sprawling and lyrical sweep. It truly is an accomplishment. As an individual novel, 'Rabbit, Run' is emotionally involving and a hell of a good read. But it moves us tantalizingly close to showing us what literary greatness is, then ultimately leaves us short."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"What makes &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot; such a staggering masterpiece is -- paradoxically -- its very ordinariness.The novel is about a former high school basketball star, now married, with a family, who is finding his adult life claustrophobic. He misses his youth -- the adrenaline rush of sports, the sense that life is full of possibilities. He doesn't know what to do about it. He tries to make some kind of change, with what's left of his youthful energy. He's self-centered, but he's also a dreamer.The book is sad, in that it offers no &quot;solution&quot; to the frustration of leaving youth behind. But it's also reassuring and poignant, because the theme is so universal.Updike manages to keep this apparently ordinary story interesting without being philosophical or tedious. His vivid, compassionate descriptions of characters and their neighborhoods are phenomenal. He has a way of illuminating the inner workings of American optimism (sports heroes, suburban consumer culture) without looking down on it. In fact, he seems to cherish it, focusing his lens on the unspoken dreams that make our society and our personalities what we are.This book -- along with its sequels -- is one of the great pieces of American literary art.PS If that's not enough to grab you, read it for Updike's incomparable descriptions of lovemaking. Arrestingly specific and vivid. Only a handful of authors can actually describe sex -- I mean, really describe it -- and show the way people's personalities are played out in bed just like they are anywhere else. The main character is a charismatic, self-absorbed yearner, in search of his lost youth at all times -- even during sex. In Updike's world, sex isn't pornographic -- it's part of life."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"I am somewhat embarrassed to admit that, prior to checking out \\"Rabbit, Run\\" from the library a few days ago, I had never read ANYTHING in my 38 years by John Updike. What a mistake! First, as many other reviewers (here and elsewhere) have pointed out, Updike is an amazing, powerful, beautiful prose stylist. In my opinion, and admittedly having only read one Updike book (\\"Rabbit, Run\\") now, I would say that he ranks up there as one of the greatest American fiction writers of the 20th century. In some ways (stylistically and thematically), Updike reminds me of another great (albeit problematic) American 20th century writer, Norman Mailer (his masterpiece, \\"The Naked and the Dead,\\" specifically comes to mind). Second, I'm just in awe of how clearly, accurately, and powerfully Updike - at only 28 years of age (!) - was able to say so much in \\"Rabbit, Run,\\" capturing the zeitgeist of a time and place (drab, grey, conformist, late 1950s suburban American hell, as epitomized by Brewer, Pennsylvania), and presenting his characters with such nuance, balance, wisdom, honesty, and - most importantly - truth. Incredible. Finally, I don't feel that it's an exaggeration to say that \\"Rabbit, Run\\" (and its sequels, which I haven't read, but have read about) is one of the most important achievements in American literature EVER.So, what is \\"Rabbit, Run\\" about? In terms of themes, we've got a huge amount of material here (this is one big, meaty \\"rabbit\\" of a book!). Life, death and sex -- in fact, lots of sex (\\"Rabbit\\" is certainly an appropriate nickname in this context!!). Courage to face life (and marriage, children) vs. giving in to \\"rabbit-like\\" fear. Commitment/responsibility vs. freedom/running away. Religion vs. true faith (and what, if anything, such true faith might consist of). Sin vs. redemption. The fate of an individual attempting to find meaning and identity while fitting in (or not) to a stultifying, stifling, conformistic society (and ones' particular place/role in it). The romantic fantasy of busting loose, hitting the road, and finding a better place. (Personal note: as a huge Bruce Springsteen fan, I was strongly reminded in \\"Rabbit, Run\\" of \\"Born to Run,\\" \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town,\\" etc. with their many similar themes). Physical perfection/athletic achievement as potential sources of meaning, especially when you're past your \\"prime\\" (\\"Rabbit\\" was a high school basketball star, but now mainly relives his fading \\"glory days,\\" as Springsteen would say). Growing up vs. remaining an eternal youth. Order vs. chaos. And, ultimately, the difficult balancing act between ones' quest for PERSONAL happiness and fulfillment vs. the needs of family, friends, employers, society. And much more.Is this book, as some reviewers here have stated, \\"depressing?\\" Well, actually, I'd have to say yes. For one thing, Updike presents no definitive answers to all the important, dark, disturbing questions he raises here (nor could he, nor, as an artist, SHOULD he, in my opinion!). Meanwhile, almost everything his main character (Rabbit) touches somehow turns out wrongly, or tragically (the misery and alcoholism of his wife, leading to the book's climactic tragedy, being the greatest example). Plus, the setting of \\"Rabbit, Run\\" is inherently gloomy (dreary, \\"dung\\" colored apartment buildings which smell of \\"cabbage cooking\\" or \\"something soft decaying,\\" a deserted ice plant with \\"rotting wooden skids on the fallen loading porch,\\" etc.). People are mainly unhappy, or trapped, or scared, or confused, or looking for a little excitement to brighten up their dreary existences, or all of the above. So why read such a depressing book? Here are just a few reasons: to learn, to experience the world through the eyes of a great artist (Updike), to challenge yourself, to enjoy the sheer beauty of top-notch writing. Finally, a philosophical question: is the point of reading (or any other activity) simply &quot;pleasure?\\" Should we run, like a rabbit perhaps, from anything that might scare us, or threaten us, or even depress us? Or should we stand our ground, look those things straight in the eye, and - unlike Rabbit Angstrom - NOT run. Personally, I vote for the latter option!"},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"I suspect that many people don't know how to approach or evaluate a work of this type. Updike is a realist, which is to say that the fiction he writes is a reflection of the way things are, not a parable of the way the writer thinks things should be or a construction of an imaginary world. The reader will look in vain for an honorable protagonist, a fascinating mystery, many laughs, world-shaking events or major crimes. Updike's books are pretty much limited to tales of ordinary people doing ordinary things. This has brought complaints from both readers and the critics, throughout his long career, that his subject matter is trivial. But limiting the subject matter like this means that the books have to succeed based on their literary merits, and that is a very difficult thing to pull off.Updike has wonderful skills in characterization, a poet's love of words and a musician's feel for their sound. The artistry of his prose is superb, better than that of nearly all of his contemporaries. Some of his finest phrases, although they may start out sounding rather mundane, contain delightful unexpected semantic twists that bring them to life. Two examples from Rabbit, Run are: From the first page: \\"The scrape and snap of Keds on loose alley pebbles seems to catapult their voices high into the moist March air blue above the wires.\\" From the first chapter, a sentence concerning Rabbit's intentions in his mad, aimless drive south: \\"He doesn't want to go down along the water anyway; his image is of himself going right down the middle, right into the broad soft belly of the land, surprising the dawn cottonfields with his northern plates.\\"Rabbit, Run is the first novel of the Rabbit series (there are five of them at this point by the way, not four as you might guess by the fact that only the first four have been published in the same volume) and in some ways I like it the best. Updike's trademark long run-on sentences, which can seem confusing or even annoying, are here cut to a minimum. Also I like the way he uses the mountain so effectively and consistently as a symbol of the line between innocence and vice.As is the case in most of Updike's novels, this one has religion as one of its central themes. There is an ongoing debate in it about the existence of God. One interesting twist, though, is that the profligate, Rabbit, is the believer and the minister, Eccles, is the skeptic.James Joyce, the pioneering twentieth-century English-language realist, whom Updike has acknowledged as one of his influences, once remarked that if the city of Dublin was destroyed it could be rebuilt from the information contained in the pages of his novel Ulysses. I'm not sure whether or not one could quite do that with the Reading, Pennsylvania area with the Rabbit novels. But I do know that, back in 1977, I was driving for only the second time in my life through southeastern Pennsylvania. I had read Rabbit, Run and Rabbit Redux, the only books of the series that had been written at that point. I didn't know where they had supposedly taken place. For all I knew there may really have been a Brewer, PA. But as I rounded a corner on the highway, I gasped: There, spread before me, was the flowerpot-red city nestled along the river and the mountain rising directly behind it with a hotel at the top. The city was called \\"Reading.\\" When I saw on the map that the town directly on the other side of the mountain was named \\"Mount Penn,\\" I was sure that it must have been the prototype for Updike's \\"Mount Judge.\\" It wasn't until nearly a decade later though, after I had relocated to a city not far away, that I verified that I had been right.All of the Rabbit books, which were written at ten-year intervals, are also fascinating encapsulations of the eras in which they were written and their effects on the characters. So it is with Rabbit, Run. If your impression of small-town American life in the 1950's is epitomized by Leave it to Beaver on the one hand and Grease on the other, this book will give you a more realistic idea of it."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Not only until I was near the end of \\"Rabbit, Run\\" did I notice that this novel has many similarities with Ingmar Bergman's movie \\"Scenes From a Marriage\\". Both talk about the cold feet that husband and wives have after a period of being married. This is not the only thing they share in common, they are both brilliant. Using a polished and beautiful prose, Updike wrote a novel that grabs you by your rabbit ears and never let you go. You don't have to be a young male American to feel related to Rabbit's life. I believe that most people go through his very same issues sooner or later in one's life.Sure Rabbit is selfish --who isn't? -- but his motivations are his fears, rather than his egotistical feelings. His fear of failing as a father, a son, a husband, actually, as a human being is what makes him move from one point to another; to change things is his life. His unhappy marriage, his dead-end job are just symptoms of a bigger disease, and in this angst that lies the central spine of this splendid novel.At the beginning of the narrative when Rabbit is thinking of going somewhere --he's not sure where -- far from his family, he ask for directions in a gas station. The attendant, an old man, simply says: \\"Figure out where you are going before you go there.\\" And, while Rabbit keeps that in mind, he fails to follow this advice. The fact that he goes through the motions in his life --he never seems to do anything with passion -- only proves that, like most youngsters, he is still trying to figure out what he wants to do with his life. This is one of the biggest qualities of this novel, to portray someone's life so full of truth.Updike writes with his heart and his brain, making a colorful prose and characters so believable that you don't want them to go when the book is over. Every character is believable, the wife, the parents, the in-laws. I think his idea has worked so well, that he expanded that in his more books, creating The Rabbit Tetralogy. \\"Rabbit, Run\\" is highly recommended to those who like literary and good books. And now, I'm looking forward to reading the sequels."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"Has life ever seemed to much for you? Do you sometimes just want get away from it all? Well, here is a man that does it all for you, Mr. Harry \\"Rabbit\\" Angstrom. He is the man for running away from just about anything that is a conflict for him. Updike investigates this unfortunate soul of the suburban middle-class with the use of many similes, metaphors, motifs, and imagery. In &quot;Rabbit, Run,&quot; John Updike's simple language brings reality to the central character of Harry and his boredom and disgust with his present life. In his early years at Mt. Judge High School, Harry was the star basketball player and this game was his life. In the beginning scene of the novel, Rabbit tries to recapture his ex-hero illusion of himself as a basketball star by playing basketball with a group of teenagers on the court. In this scene, we get a taste of Updike's use of rabbit imagery to enhance the rabbit qualities of Harry. When he arrives home, he regains the sour reality of his unfulfilled marriage, and his animal instinct tells him to flee. Like an animal, he can be gentle, but when he goes off on his own, he is the cause of all problems. In fleeing from his home, he experiences marital infidelity (a cental theme of many of Updike's books), the death of his baby, and ends up not a born-again-hero, but a man fleeing in panic from the realities of life. The quest motif is an important part of the novel in that Harry escapes from the imperfections in his life in search for a higher purpose. Because he is extremely sexually driven, he finds himself in the arms of Ruth, a prostitute that fulfills his need for an experienced cook and lover. Some of the scenes with Ruth are graphic and X- rated so I don't recommend this book to young children. Throughout the novel he possesses rabbit twitching and nervousness that causes others around him discomfort and pain. At the end of his quest, Harry does not find his higher purpose in life but ends up running aimlessly into the night.Even though Harry was quite depressing , I found this book very enjoyable because of Updike's detailed use of imagery and motifs. This is just the first of the Rabbit trilogy books by Updike, and this novel drives me to read the other Rabbit books just to see what happens to Harry next. This is a must read on my reading list, and I recommend this book to all high school students and adults."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"As &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot; opens, it is the late 50s and Harry &quot;Rabbit&quot; Angstrom is eight years out of high school, where he was a basketball hero. He is in a marriage that is heading toward the rocks with much speed.After reading this novel you may not like Rabbit, but he will have led you on an emotional and spiritual journey that will leave you asking many questions -- questions about the book as well as questions about yourself.Rabbit has a limited intellectual and emotional range, so why would Updike expend his considerable talent in detailing the life of so common a person? For one thing, Rabbit's experience as an ordinary man is more typical than that of someone on the tails of the bell curve and this allows Updike better to capture the spirit of the times. There is perhaps no better author than Updike in capturing the zeitgeist, and &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot; showcases this ability, as the subsequent books in the Rabbit tetralogy illustrate to a! n even greater extent.We are at ground zero watching Rabbit struggle with aging, religion, sexuality (particularly sexuality), nature, and the trade-offs between freedom and attachment, and rebellion and conformity. In witnessing Rabbit wrestle with these big issues in his blundering, but persistent, way, we come to understand the commonality of the human experience.Updike's inventive and flowing prose is well displayed here. Parts of the narrative are pure poetry. The dialog is brisk and gritty and the sex scenes are graphic, especially for a mainstream novel published in 1960. The writing style itself helps create mood -- lyrical when describing a flower garden and so edgy during the climatic scene that it makes you sweat.This is a marvelous book.

Rabbit is feeling trapped in almost any situation he is in, he is confused, he does not know what he wants, and displaying his immaturity he reacts on his impulses constantly, regardless of the consequences. Rabbit is not a bad person, or we dont know, much in the same way that rabbit doesnt know. he feels guilt, for short periods of time, but is unable to sacrifice his own version of happiness to take responsibility for his wife and kid. Neither the reader, nor Rabbit himself, understands the motivation behind his actions.

Who hasn't thought about packing up, quitting their job, leaving their family, and hitting the road for some adventure? That's exactly what Rabbit does and his journey is a fascinating one.

He had better just mosey along into the sunset of adulthood. Not Rabbit. Not on your tintype. Get ready for the roller coaster ride of your literary life as Rabbit defies the gods, the muses, good sense and well-meaning mentors. He must make a run for it or the mundane will devour him."},{"Title":"Rabbit, run","review":"This isn't the best book in the world, but it definitely has possibilities. I guess I didn't fall in love with it because Rabbit doesn't change for the better, and as Ruth so accurately realized, his life is fraught with tragedy, misery, and particularly idiotic spontaneity. The characters are sort of weak (except Rabbit, who is moderately well-developed but even so is rather two-dimensional), and even the date it was written is no excuse for the way women are portrayed. Nice try, Mr. Updike, but try again, eh?"},{"Title":"Men We Cherish","review":"Who ever had this idea to praise our black men, should get a billion dollars and then some.

They are all true, too life men I could relate to as apart of my life. It was overwhelming to read this and get into the various kinds of men presented here in their all to human-ness which is desperately needed as we look around us. The media offers no positive, supportive role models but this book shows what we all know: that there are some good and decent black men out there that should be given their &quot;props&quot; --- this book does just that. Every African-American home, especially where there are young black boys around should have a copy of this book."},{"Title":"Men We Cherish","review":"I was very pleased at the wide range of stories from brothers to lovers to the handy man that never let you down.

It kept me interested but I felt that at some parts I just wanted to skip ahead. She talk about visions and dreams and voices she hears and it gets annoying and seems very exaggerated. I eventually started skipping the parts where she randomly brings these things up, and I feel the boom would be so much better without them. Those visions and dreams and memories and sights of unreal nonexistent witches and people seem bland and not at all intriguing.

I have seldom been disappointed with her works since. This book and The River Queen are her best. She weaves most of them into her personal experiences and her life. Through her books we know her love for her daughter, confusion and disdain for her ex lover. Who, reading her works, it is not hard to learn his identity, a learned scholar and a cad. Her love of family and pain as the years inevitably remove them from her life is palpable. A feminist with a soul, with struggles that all women feel, rich or poor. Everyone I have shared this book with loved it."},{"Title":"Nothing to Declare: Memoirs of a Woman Traveling Alone (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I was not so impressed with this novel and felt that the author was too caught up in her own drama to take the reader on an interesting voyage with her.

All of the general details are true, of course, but the author is quite a unique women, and though I think her memoirs are a must-read, she seems to be a person who remains a mystery to herself, and I wonder how and why she ever made some of the journeys she did under the conditions she had to endure. I suppose she is the ultimate journalist: able to get to the heart of others while never shining the light directly into her own being.

I was excited to find Nothing to Declare, but found it quite disappointing. She complains a lot about Mexico, how she hates to be alone, her new boyfriend (who takes care of her and makes her feel like the man in the relationship), and so on. If there was any self discovery in this story I missed it. Skippable. Read Eat Pray Love instead."},{"Title":"Nothing to Declare: Memoirs of a Woman Traveling Alone (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"A better title of this book might be \\"Nothing Interesting to Write About\\". This book was a total disappointment. All the people the author meets and writes about are oafish, selfish and/or unlikeable, including the man she takes as a lover, as well as being thoroughly boring. The one exception is her neighbor Lupe, however her sad and hopeless situation is common refrain in any poor area of any country. Too many children, not enough money. I will say that her descriptions of travel, food and medical care in Mexico have convinced me it is not someplace I ever care to travel to."},{"Title":"Nothing to Declare: Memoirs of a Woman Traveling Alone (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The story is definetly written from a womans point of view and I was able to relate quite well. I highly recomend this story as the tale of a moment in time as seen through a womans eyes in Central America."},{"Title":"Nothing to Declare: Memoirs of a Woman Traveling Alone (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Morris' tales of traveling solo in Central America were the perfect accompaniment to my own solo trip in Indonesia. Although Morris taps directly into the surreal, magical heart of Latin American culture, her concerns echo the thoughts and dreams of women travelers everywhere. Each chapter can often be read in one sitting; any one of these vignettes stands beautifully on its own as a complete short story.A gem of a book, this would be the perfect gift for a woman embarking on any sort of journey."},{"Title":"Nothing to Declare: Memoirs of a Woman Traveling Alone (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Not only does Mary Morris transport you to Central America, but also in the depth of a woman's soul. Fascinating writer. I recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Nothing to Declare: Memoirs of a Woman Traveling Alone (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Although Morris would (and does) believe that she is a natural and effortless traveller, this text attests otherwise. Morris spends the majority of the work lamenting the inefficencies of Mexico and reminding us how bold she is for taking the journey. The other portion consists of her waxing lyrical about her indifference to love or how generous she is as the privileged and revered American. She continously struck me as bitter and egocentrical.Similarly, I think she adheres to the stereotypes she seemingly casts away. I particularly loved when she decided that she felt more like a 'man than a woman' in her relationship with the pampering/cleaning Mexican man. I also shuddered when she declared that her aforementioned Mexican love was like an 'Indian' when drunk.As others have suggest, the cast that populates the background are more interesting than Morris herself. Beautiful writing and landscape, but intensely annoying subject."},{"Title":"Nothing to Declare: Memoirs of a Woman Traveling Alone (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is a beautiful memoir of Mary Morris' travels into Central America and personal growth around the 1970's. A woman in her early 30's, she has a successful writing career and traveled extensively. Her journey into Central America is a trip embarked with a heavy heart and personal doubts. Her past needs reckoning and her search for personal equanimity is at last confronted when she moves to San Miguel, Mexico. Unknowingly, she rents an apartment in the poorest part of town instead of the more affluent area where many of the &quot;wealthier foreigners&quot; live. This error in judgement serves to be her silver lining. Skillfully brought to life are the neighbors that become her loving friends and substitute family. As she opens herself to their lives and stories, she feels compelled to face her inner demons.For many, the prosect of reading another traveling diary may be stultifying. This is not one of those, but an original attempt to make the relationship of a woman's personal journey inside herself and her global journeys she bravely explores on her own.In her past, Mary has been physically and emotional abused by some of the men in her life. I thing it is extremely important to note that in those years, many of the social/counseling/activist support groups were non-existant, or at the least, in their infancy. For Mary, her travels, and those that she met in the wake of her trips, served as her counselors and support groups.There were a wide assortment of characters that she met in her travels, and her gift is to be able to write about what each of them meant to her. Many of them are truly unforgettable and the times she writes about capture the humor, strength and sorrow of their lives. San Miguel serves as her &quot;base camp&quot; and she plans many visits to the heart of Central America. Knowlingly, she ventures into some of the most unstable countries in the area (San Salvador, Honduras, Bolivia) and trusts her inner instincts to be her compass. Constantly challenging herself in these tension filled areas, subjecting herself to extreme discomfort, poor traveling conditions and appalling lodging, she nevertheless is able to note the beauty of the world, but not so idealistic that she can't complain and feel total despair. Life is NOT perfect on the road, and I respect that she does not front herself off to be in a constant state of traveler's ecstasy."},{"Title":"Nothing to Declare: Memoirs of a Woman Traveling Alone (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is a book which richly deserves some judicious editing. Morris can write well, in every sense, yet gets bogged down with her own emotional dramas. Having travelled, much of it by backpacking and hitchhiking, I could easily appreciate her stories and descriptions. Yet I was frequently annoyed by her 'woe is me' whining. It makes only a good book out of what could have been a travel classic. The other reviews here cover the content quite nicely, and accurately. The book is worth reading if travel interests you, but for a far better author in the same vein, check out Tim Cahill. His writing is equally impressive, his travels more interesting, and his self-deprecating humor is a pleasant contrast to Morris, who is unfortunately quite full of herself. I know which author I'D choose to travel with, hands down."},{"Title":"Nothing to Declare: Memoirs of a Woman Traveling Alone (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Morris reminds me of people I've met travelling; rootless, wanting too much, searching everywhere for adventure. This book is about her trip to Mexico, alone, where she writes, thinks, loves, and makes various friends, whom she knows she will leave. In this book there's the transient community of the ageless twenty-something, who turns thirty and is still searching for everything she doesn't have, the lessons that come from simple living, and no resolution"},{"Title":"Nothing to Declare: Memoirs of a Woman Traveling Alone (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Mary Morris' intensely personal memoir of her time spent living in Mexico resonates with honesty and beauty on every page. Morris captures the essence of the trials and joys of a woman travelling alone while at the same time revealing an insider's look at the true modern culture of Mexico. Her vivid descriptions of the small village where she spends almost a year are so vivid that even a person who has never been to Mexico will feel that they know it like a friend's backyard. The characters are not characters but people--people who think and live and grow throughout the book just as they would in real life. Morris has a unique ability to not only be able to search her own soul in prose but that of other's as well, with seemingly unfailing accuracy. The intertwining of her inner journey with the story of her physical journey is faultlessly crafted and expressed. I reread this book every few months and am moved to tears and laughter everytime. It, and Mary Morris' other travel works, are essential reading for any traveller and absolutely necessary for any woman who ever has or ever plans to travel alone."},{"Title":"Nothing to Declare: Memoirs of a Woman Traveling Alone (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book is so fantastic that I have re-read it and also bought a copy for a friend. She was delighted and said she stayed up all night to read it.Mary Morris has written a fascinating insight into living in San Miguel, Mexico (although she also visited other Central American countries). Her characters in San Miguel really come to life. And in the bargain, she also gives a very honest picture of her personal changes. I think her situation is one that many women can relate to. I cannot say enough good things about this book and can see why she has received so many literary awards.In reading some of the other reviews, I think some people have not \\"gotten\\" the point of the book. Certain in terms of those expecting research to the point of giving specific names of animal species, etc., please know that those are topics for another kind of book. The reader of this book gets the big picture, and it is played out in a very personal account."},{"Title":"Nothing to Declare: Memoirs of a Woman Traveling Alone (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book has a haunting quality that comes, in part, from the author's ability to capture the ephemeral quality of Mexican culture and, in part, from the author's own inner-searchings. I have read this book twice, with several years inbetween reads, and each time it made quite an impact on me. I think this book captures some soulful things that we lack as Americans and which the author finds in some of her Mexican friends. It also captures the sense of total foreigness an American can have in a Latin culture."},{"Title":"Nothing to Declare: Memoirs of a Woman Traveling Alone (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I finished reading this book only because I'm on vacation and short of other books. Also, I couldn't believe that there wouldn't be more to it at some point. Ms. Morris does write fairly well. There are some errors in the text and she clearly is not a craftwoman - she doesn't do the research at various points to name animals (for instance the 'large rodent' in the Guatemalan jungle). The critiques of other reviewers are very correct - she is self-absorbed, but not in an interesting way. The entire book is of her taking from others what she can, with very little giving back, except to her generous neighbor, Lupe, and even in that relationship it doesn't feel as if she's really able to be humanly touched. Her travel descriptions are pathetically shallow and useless for those of us who are curious and want to know the flavor of places. The texture and description which bring the essence of a place to a reader are mostly absent. The whole book reads as a cryptic list of 'places I've been with the crummy places I stayed while there and how I didn't like it' saga. I would have given the book one star, except Ms. Morris does have some writing ability. I'm very surprised this book is still in print. Ms. Morris has now had a number of other books printed and I for one can't imagine ever picking one of them up after having read this one. If those books are better than this one, Ms. Morris, do yourself a favor and take this one out of circulation."},{"Title":"Nothing to Declare: Memoirs of a Woman Traveling Alone (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"A travel book can have a dislikable narrator and still be an enjoyable reading experience (i.e. Dervla Murphy's &quot;The Ukimwi Road&quot; - see my review - or any of Paul Theroux's productions). But since &quot;Nothing to Declare&quot; is more of an &quot;inner journey&quot; than a road trip, the author is pretty much the whole show. And by the last page, I was very glad to part company with her.She spends a lot of time stoically lamenting the cruelty of men - both solo and accompanied by her neighbor, a veritable poster child for oppressed Latina womanhood. But judging by the shabby way Morris treats the Mexican man who dotes on her (i.e. sniffing at his enthusiasm for domestic chores while chasing other men at the drop of a hat), her relationship problems would seem to be mostly her fault.This sort of hypocrisy appears throughout the book. Although her only reason for coming to Mexico is to escape the shambles of her life north of the border, she sneers at the other expatriates living in San Miguel - &quot;writers and painters, or so they call themselves&quot;, &quot;losers&quot;, &quot;mediocre Americans&quot;. She blithely claims to be in contact with ghosts and prefers not to waste her palm-reading ability (!) on the unworthy, yet wishes a New Age healer she consults would &quot;skip the mumbo jumbo&quot;.I won't deny the author's writing skills succeeded in holding one's interest. And judging by the comments here (and the fact that it's still in print after a decade - no mean feat), more than a few people have responded to this book. But I won't be travelling with Mary Morris again."},{"Title":"Nothing to Declare: Memoirs of a Woman Traveling Alone (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I was not so impressed with this novel and felt that the author was too caught up in her own drama to take the reader on an interesting voyage with her.

Oscar Micheaux was a man of limited educational accomplishment[8th]grade. He was opinionated and wrote what he felt about afro-americans,many of his opinions were not well recieved by afro-americans because he refused to acknowledge the racial barriers erected against blacks of the late 19th and early 20th century in the united states. He accepted jim-crow as a law of the land."},{"Title":"Honduran Summer, Honduran Spring","review":"The blurb for this book says the author wrote it after traveling in Central America -- that's hard to believe. The main part of the plot for the second half of the book revolves around the supposedly common kidnapping for ransom of a Honduran citizen by \\"Sandanistas [sic].\\" The backcover also refers to the hero being in the \\"killing fields of the Sandinistas\\" -- huh, wha?! In the 1980s (the book is set in 1989) Nicaraguan contras were based in Honduras for their attacks into Nicaragua; no Sandinistas or armed Nicaraguan force of any political stripe before or since has been entering Honduras or any other country and kidnapping people.The book is riddled with absurd inventions like this. Take one example: anyone who's been there will laugh at the long description of Tegucigalpa International airport as 2 concrete strips among barren hills, where passengers are separated by chicken wire(!!). In fact, the hills are covered with pine trees that you smell as soon as you arrive, and the terminal is like a regional U.S. airport, except for the spectacular 100 ft. mural of Copan (that's been there over 20 years). If you've ever been to Central America, much less if you're a Honduran, you'll eventually get angry at the stupid portrayal of Hondurans and Honduras inflicted by the author. Statements like the fantasy that someone was sacrificed every day at Copan during the Mayan kingdom is one in a series of the most ridiculous fantasies and stereotypes that permeate the book's portrayal of Honduras. Steer clear of this loser.Look out Florence, Italy -- the book's publicity says that you're next!"},{"Title":"Honduran Summer, Honduran Spring","review":"I just finished reading Honduran Summer, Honduran Spring and recommend it to anyone in the 18-40 age group.

The CP was more than just a railroad; it had hotels, ships, etc., and these are mentioned during discussion of this company, although the focus is primarily on the railroad. The photography is wonderful and makes the book. Too bad there wasn't more room for more specialized information on the locomotives and cars, but many are shown in the excellent photos. A good overview and first reference on the CP."},{"Title":"Canadian Pacific Railway (MBI Railroad Color History)","review":"Like most books in this series from this publisher this book is an excellent overview of a major railroad. Like most books in this series I found it a bit lacking in maps for my - there are about three or four of parts of the system that are not very detailed. Otherwise, the graphics of photo reproduction are excellent. A strength of this and other books in this series is that they are not the usual dry academic corporate histories that some university presses put out but describe the dynamics and operations of a railroad in its historical and contemporary context. As this is a book about the Candian Pacific Railwayjust enough is provided about Canadian Pacific's hotel, airline and ocean liner operations to put this gem of Canada's history into proper perspective. Easily worth 5 stars."},{"Title":"Gestures of Conciliation: Factors Contributing to Successful Olive Branches","review":"This outstanding book offers a thorough analysis of the conciliatory initiatives that are taken by adversaries as peace processes unfold. It examines the nature of such initiatives, the contexts in which they are produced and recognized, and the conditions for their success. The book is must reading for all students of international politics and conflict resolution."},{"Title":"Gestures of Conciliation: Factors Contributing to Successful Olive Branches","review":"Chris Mitchell's book is a treasure trove of brilliant insights into the role that symbols and gestures play in resolving deeply rooted conflict. I have studied each page and put it down because so many ideas come to my head about how his insights could be applied to both personal and international conflicts. The Middle East continues to be a place of endless conflict while few diplomats understand the power and importants of consistent patterns of unilateral and bilateral gestures that parties should be encouraged to engage in. Mitchell's work is really the path to a completely different future for diplomacy, and it is high time that government officials take notice. Still deeper, we all need more advice on how to move beyond the power of words to the power of deeds as we struggle with how to change the direction of our conflicts, how to right basic wrongs, and how to stimulate in ourselves and in others a path to reconciliation. this is precisely what Israelis and Palestinians need the most, and it is what we need so badly between the United States and Islamic civilization. There are surely many destructive forces in the world that need to be resisted, but Mitchell shows us a path out of the madness of cycles of violence. His view is sober, not utopian, it is scientific to the core, and it is hopeful based on sound empirical judgements and recommendations. I wish everyone could read and study this seminal book."},{"Title":"Gestures of Conciliation: Factors Contributing to Successful Olive Branches","review":"Christopher Mitchell's GESTURES OF CONCILIATION is a brilliant, pioneering study of the psychology of peace processes. Clearly and popularly written, it identifies critical obstacles to the successful conclusion of peace negotiations and offers important practical suggestions about how these roadblocks can be removed.Mitchell is one of the first analysts to deal in depth with questions like, &quot;How does a party to a conflict know that they other party's offer to negotiate isn't merely a sign of weakness or a cynical trap?&quot; Thinking his way into the minds of the parties to violent, protracted conflicts, the author throws new light on a host of critical issues, including the problems of radical mutual distrust, self-entrapment, ambiguous peace gestures, and &quot;ripeness&quot; for resolution. No official should consider negotiating a serious conflict without first consulting this book. It is a must both for specialists in conflict studies and for general readers interested in discovering why peace processes succeed or fail."},{"Title":"Drive I-95: Exit by Exit Info, Maps, History and Trivia, Second Edition","review":"This book is great for traveling form MA to FL.

I would recommend it to anyone who is going to drive 95 for more than a day trip, I want to do it again!"},{"Title":"Drive I-95: Exit by Exit Info, Maps, History and Trivia, Second Edition","review":"I don't know how they did it and I don't really care. This couple managed to map out in easy to read sections the whole of interstate 95 up to the Florida/Georgia Border. This book was instrumental in my having a safe, anxiety-free drive from Northern New Jersey to Central Florida this Easter.I'm not a great map reader, but this was the easiest thing ever. The sections are mapped out 30 miles at a time facing the direction you are driving. Everything from speed traps to restaurants to gas stations at every exit are pointed out, along with little antiquities along the way.I left my house at 1:00 am, and was fighting an illness. It was instrumental that I knew where to find gas, bathrooms, restaurants, etc. This book eliminated that guest work. Looking at the book, I could plan bathroom breaks, diaper changes, gas stops, etc. We were able to avoid the \\"screaming baby in the car\\" syndrome that one hears so much about, since I was able to leave in the wee hours of the morning and still navigate where to stop.The only negative is what's mentioned before, the book ends at the Georgia border. I really feel that the book should be advertised as only going to Georgia. But reading reviews here, I knew that already. Because we only have to go three hours into Florida and know where we're going, it wasn't that bad.Altogether, this is so worth it."},{"Title":"Drive I-95: Exit by Exit Info, Maps, History and Trivia, Second Edition","review":"Book is excellent for driving I-95.

The maps were clear and easy to read - the information and landmarks on the maps were right on. Looking at the book on the way down 95 took some of the boredom out of the drive. We stopped at some of the restaurants & noted which we would go back to. I loved the listings of the businesses and hotels at the exits - it helped with planning on where to spend the night.

The book claims to follow I 95 from north to south but it does not. Through New Jersey it changes to I 295 and skips Pennsylvania completely, crossing directly into Delaware. There is no mention of Philadelphia or several significant attractions such as Independence Hall or the Liberty Bell. I don't know why the authors chose to by-pass an entire state and I can't understand why the editors let them get away with it.

The book shows you the drive south, interrupts with a section of interesting facts and side trips, and shows you the ride north. I hate trying to turn a map around.

This \\"Drive I-95\\" was very disappointing to me. The information in it is seven years old, (2005) (3rd. addition) It excludes Maine of Florida and it omits most of Massachusetts, Exits 13 to 60 So its not a true I-95 guide.

You can tell at a glance how fast you should be going on any stretch.One of the best features of Drive I-95 is the information about offbeat attractions not far off the road. If visiting the supposed birthplace of the hamburger is not exactly a destination, it can sure reduce the tedium of a long drive.

I guess I expected more of a guide book than it is. You do get listings of what is at each exit to the Florida border on 95- but I was hoping for some reviews(especially on the many many hotels along 95) The most info given on a hotel is if it serves scrambled eggs for breakfast-not if it was clean-or what services it has. Mobil travel guide would have been a better choice for me. Also it reads a little off. The maps in the front representing your trip down to Florida run from the bottom of the page- up(vs going from top down as you are driving) I found this slightly annoying. On the plus side, they do list a few off the road attractions and give a little history along the way.

Most importantly, we were able to see which restaurants had play areas for the kids so we were able to make our stops mini-excercise breaks for the kids. We found the book helpful when we were planning our stops so we could see exactly what restaurants and points of interest were coming soon. This book definitely made our trip much less stressful because we always knew exactly how far things were. One unexpected benefit of the book was; we got stuck in some traffic and were able to use the book, which shows roads running parallel to the highway when available, to get off the highway and take the local routes, which definitely got us past the traffic quicker."},{"Title":"Drive I-95: Exit by Exit Info, Maps, History and Trivia, Second Edition","review":"\\"We have spent the past eighteen months entrenched in this road: researching about it charting it, driving on it and then getting off 420 exits in 11 States - twice - once South and then again going North.

This is confusing for preschoolers. Older children won't mind when the very first page opens with \\"I'm Emily Elizabeth, the cat\\" but younger readers are confused. The same page shows a picture of a dog, and the little girl is wearing a cat costume. Honestly, the dog looks more like a cat than Emily Elizabeth does!The pictures are NOT really humorous. They seem hastily assembled, and truly there are dozens of picture books for young children about Halloween which are very worthwhile.

He's a historian par excellence. In HIDDEN HISTORY he publishes a series of essays that explore the more unfamiliar aspects of familiar events.HIDDEN HISTORY helps us to see our forefathers in unexpected roles and learn to see our society from new perspectives.&quot;...the prize for which Europeans would have to shed blood would seem the free native birthright of Americans,&quot; he writes. &quot;The history of the United States has thus had a unity and coherence unknown in Europe. Many factors -- our geographical isolation, our special opportunities for expansion and exploitation within our own borders and our remoteness from Europe have, of course, contributed...but, whatever the causes, the winds of dogma and the gusts of revolution which during the last two centuries have blown violently over Western Europe...have not ruffled our intellectual climate.&quot;Boorstin says that the American Revolution was hardly a revolution at all, at least not in the sense of the modern European understanding of evolution. He quotes Alexis de Tocqueville, &quot;the social condition and the Constitution of the Americans are democratic, but they have not had a democratic revolution.&quot; Boorstin says this fact &quot;is surely one of the most important of our history.&quot;Boorstin's theories, his arguments, the pictures he presents of events and people who shaped our nation's history -- all jolt the reader's awareness and awaken to higher interest and sensibilities. They fan the flicker of patriotism that hides in complacency.HIDDEN HISTORY is scholarly but it is far from dull. It challenges our perceptions of our own history and our role in the world; it whets the appetite for understanding. It should NEVER go out of print."},{"Title":"Hidden History Exploring Our Secret Past","review":"Boorstin's collection of essays in Hidden History are designed to highlight one important fact- often history does not tell us the whole story (or as Paul Harvey might say, \\"the REST of the story.\\")He points out that in much of American History, the most influential book by far was the New England Primer, which taught children things like Scripture, poetry, and the like. It was the basis of education for nearly the entire nation. However, there were so many of them that nobody thought to preserve them, and as a result almost no copies exist today. However, collected sermons of various pastors from that time CAN be found, because of course there was almost zero demand for them. So, Boorstin asks, which one was the more influential? And which, then, is more important to a historian's understanding of history? Unfortunatly, though, much of the time this history is harder to get at then simply picking up a sermon collection and (mis)characterizing the people of that time.The book is excellent on its own, but I especially recommend that you read it right before reading Boorstin's other work... the Creators, the Discoverers, the Seekers, and The American Experience (Colonial, National, Democratic). Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Hidden History Exploring Our Secret Past","review":"This book is a wonderful collection of essays that give a fresh perspective on some well known historical events. Although you might think you know the history, Boorstin is like Paul Harvey, he tells you &quot;the rest of the story&quot;. I would have liked to know his sources and other works about his topics so I could learn more."},{"Title":"Hidden History Exploring Our Secret Past","review":"Boorstin is a master storyteller of the rich history of the founding of American and its continuing story. Here are interesting chapters each dealing with the often overlooked aspects of daily history and events. This is one of my favorite history books. A wonderful book to curl up with."},{"Title":"Hidden History Exploring Our Secret Past","review":"To read this book is like selecting the best articles from a favorite magazine and having them all in one place. Boorstin has offered a behind the scenes look at familar topics in American history, such as Paul Revere. He adds excellent biographical summaries and places the subjects in an American history chronology. This is clearly the result of long years of writing American history, including a textbook and multivolume overview.The Amazon reviews that preceded mine are excellent and I strongly agree with each reviewer."},{"Title":"Mean High Tide","review":"Invasive exotic species, get the picture? Eventually so does Thorn. A breeding program to develop a species of \\"red\\" tilapia under the theory that Americans will eat anything that's \\"red,\\" not so far fetched now that we know about red dye in farmed salmon, threatens to unleash a flood of unwelcome visitors into the glades watershed. The story is a bit heavy handed, but after all so is Thorn.I discovered a used copy of this novel in a bookstore in the Keys a few years ago while hunting a poolside \\"read.\\" Almost got as red as the tilapia as I forgot the time in the sun and since have hunted down the entire series. A rough, tough south Florida adventure novel, and while not Hall's best it's worth the time if you like this sort of fiction. I do."},{"Title":"Mean High Tide","review":"Hall is the best of the Florida writers. His novels are complex and beautifully written and always full of scary situations and wild bad guys. Mean High Tide is one of his very best, which to my mind makes it one of the best thrillers I've ever read.Just the opening few chapters will blow anyone away who loves good writing and wild characters. There's a scene on the coral reefs in Key Largo that is as vivid and richly detailed as any underwater writing I've ever read. And in the same scene a moment occurs that is break-your-heart sad and scary at once.His environmental concerns are also richly detailed in this book. The very real threat of the tilapia fish being introduced into the warm tropical waters of Florida gives the book a moral weight that most thrillers lack.He's the best. Read all of them. But if you want to see Thorn at his most creative and angriest, read this novel."},{"Title":"Mean High Tide","review":"James W. Hall is an excellent author, his books are always full of adventure, non stop edge of your seat suspense and packed with factual scientific information pertinent to the day in time.Hall introduces the story by forcing the reader to feel what it's really like to be inside of Thorn's skin. With the death of his close companion we share his anger, outrage, frustration and grief. The plot of the story holds more meaning because the reader is personally and emotionally tied to the story.Although the story is obviously fictional one cannot help wondering how far fetched a biological disaster as such could really be. In nature one finds that these occurances are often natually corrected however this book presents the question, &quot;What if it occurs intentionally?&quot; and more importantly, &quot;Why?&quot;James W. Hall is indisputably worth your money, attention and time. Don't stop with Mean High Tide!!!"},{"Title":"Mean High Tide","review":"Hall is the best of the Florida writers, and this is one of his most beautifully crafted novels. From the opening scene snorkeling on the reefs off Key Largo, to the final scenes in the Everglades, Hall renders the natural beauty of Florida like no other writer ever has. The thrills are there too, and wild characters (like Hiaasen's, only 3 dimensional), and great dialog. This is one of the best novels by one of the best thriller writers in the country."},{"Title":"Mean High Tide","review":"What a disturbing picture of law enforcement in Florida James Hall paints. Twelve corpses of people who worked in a federal research facility stacked up &quot;like Lincoln Logs&quot;, discovered by a volunteer fire dept. crew, and nothing leaks out to the news media. No investigation is ever made. Why? Because the &quot;good stuff never makes it into the paper&quot;, according to one nudist colony member now living at the scene of the crime. &quot;The truly interesting news, somehow they manage to keep it quiet.&quot; We're expected to believe this? That purges going on in Florida are kept quiet? And who is the &quot;they&quot; that keeps it quiet? That question is never really answered, other than some oblique references to the CIA.Thorn, the laconic he-man hero of Mean High Tide readily swallows this line without a trace of doubt. So too, apparently, did the families and friends of the slaughtered researchers. Yet, in another part of Florida, a &quot;thorough investigation&quot; is made to find the person who carved an obscenity into the skin of a potato.Now, I'm not a person who insists on absolute realism in fiction, but, golly, this seems a bit much. Twelve people? A potato skin?Later, an ex-Mafia hood comes into Thorn's house in a quiet residential neighborhood and honeycombs it with shots from a gun that makes fist size holes in the hardwood floor. In my limited experience, a gun that powerful makes quite a loud noise. Yet no one calls the police. Thorn has to be talked into doing this himself by his friend, Sugar, an ex-cop. It's a gross inconvenience to Thorn, who, in his words, is &quot;not up to dealing with police bullshit at the moment&quot;. A man of action, he is not often up to dealing with such niceties, for he is usually busy avenging the brutal killings of virtually all his loved ones: his mother, his brother, his lover, his friends, the environment...All Thorn's rage, however, cannot drive out one nagging problem of plot. The man wielding the big gun in Thorn's house had no motive in the story for being there. In fact, he has no direct contact with Thorn for the rest of the book.Simply put, huge parts of Mean High Tide make no sense. The assassin with no motive nor connection, the uninvestigated pile of twelve bodies, the other uninvestigated pile of bodies discovered by Thorn later, the curious fact that animals, from squirrels to alligators, copulate whenever observed by Thorn...While the plot is a mess, the characterizations at least are acceptable, especially those of the villains. The most amusing is Sylvie, a demented girl of 25 who lures men to try to kill her father, an ex-CIA assassin. He, too, is a splendidly evil fellow, hatching a scheme to destroy the planet's biodiversity. His cruel cunning and ruthlessness provides a welcome respite from the tediously macho and stolid Thorn and his equally tedious, though less macho, sidekick Sugar.But then even Harden Winchester (the ex-CIA hit man) falls prey to expository monologue disease in a scene at a bar with Thorn that is so dazzlingly out of character for the brutal killer that I was sure the referee would step in and stop it. But no. It plodded doggedly on for several pages until we realized why the hit man was so naughty.There is a climax toward the end in which Thorn administers mouth to mouth resuscitation to Sugar (is there a gay subtext here?), while a few feet away occurs simultaneously what may be termed The Clash of the Geriatric Titans. (Where else but in Florida?) After these and other conflicts are resolved, there remains only the environment to save. To accomplish this, the fish are assaulted by hand grenades (yes, the fish) thrown by the redoubtable Thorn. If you want to know why, you'll have to read Mean High Tide."},{"Title":"Mean High Tide","review":"Jim Hall is an excellent story teller. His charctor development is the most creative of all authors. No one does it better!"},{"Title":"Mean High Tide","review":"'Mean High Tide' is the sort of book intended to entertain and nothing more. It's not meant to be fine literature, nor will it be one of those book you'll remember long after finishing it. But its story of murder and mayhem in the Florida Keys and aquaculture run amok is funny, sometimes violent yet never gross, and the characters are all quite believable. This is my second book by James Hall and I can now say I am a fan.Bottom line: the perfect book to bring for your Florida vacation. Recommended."},{"Title":"Mean High Tide","review":"I enjoyed this book, an eco-mystery with an engaging plot about red tilapia--a contradiction in terms because impossible. Hall's descriptive detail was a bit over the top: one got the sense that he tried to build suspense by shifting to descriptive detail instead of continuing the narrative--thus one longed for less of it at times. His plotting and characters, esp. Sylvie and her father Harden Winchester were great.I especially enjoyed the description of snorkling but was thrown by the fact that the one character I really liked was murdered within the first few chapters. Her death was the kind that made you hide your eyes and hold your friend's hand."},{"Title":"Mean High Tide","review":"...Hall, if you are at all familiar with him, is absolutely an incredible author. If you are coming to Hall via Hiaasen/Shames/Dorsey/Barry or even Leonard, a word of caution: Hall tends to use a slightly more doom and gloom approach to his writing. His is a work that is going to have a more ominious (even melancholy)tone to it---no offbeat hijinks to level off the atmosphere. With the other authors, save for instance Randy Wayne White, you get a little humor to lighten the load somewhat. Not here. Here, you better hang on because it's going to be a bitter armageddon.This is classic Hall. The story involves a huge amount of topics, all of which Hall (like a juggler) never lets fall. There are times when Hall returns to a point/storyline a bit late, but I truly only say that as a word of caution to those with severe attention-span disorders. But, as I cautioned above, the storylines here weigh pretty heavy.Topics include a mafioso guy with a penchant for child pornography. An under-developed, highly-sexed-in-situations girl who in involved with an incestuous relationship with her father (whom she is trying to kill). The incest-father is an ex-cia masterkiller who is slowly poisoning the stroke-victim-husband of his exwife (incest victim's mother). Not to give too much away, mafioso guy is related to incest victim and exwife and has his hand in the murder. Or does he? How???? Hmmm, for you to find out.Also include some great government conspiracies and nudist colonies. Now throw in some old fashioned underwater murder and you've got just a wee sketch of what's going on.Hall carries this off amazingly. Dark subject matter, sure. But a [darn] good story by an altogether incredible author. Other authors could learn a thing or two from Hall. Particularly, as much as I love him, Tim Dorsey. Dorsey has a slight problem with including far too many storylines that are of no consequence (and are totally meaningless in the big picture), and has a [heck] of time trying to keep them altogether. Still, don't take this to imply that you should avoid Dorsey. In fact, read all of his books. I certainly have.Anyway, enjoy this one if you are up for it. Just realize what you're in for. Hopefully I've given you a heads up as to what that is."},{"Title":"Mean High Tide","review":"This novel is an absolute delight--lush, tropical Florida background perfectly depicted; fast, fascinating action and excellent plot; and truly colorful characters. We have a super-symbiotic relationship between a violent sociopathic, father-daughter team; a sad detective married to a dog b*tch from h*ll whom he can't live with/can't live without; and a lovable super-hero who always lands on his feet. Judy Nelson, a law enforcement officer, is a very strong, brave and funny supporting player.Sylvie is the craziest woman you'll ever hope to see. I doubt there's any psychiatric diagnosis for her condition. Yes, she's a violent criminal sociopath and pretty much schizophrenic--but more than that, just crazy as a hoot owl. One of the most fascinating characters I've ever run across, and I'm sorry she died. But the other complete nut who really sticks in my craw is Sugarman. He falls in love with Doris, a beautiful, kind, gentle woman who loves him with all her heart, yet he won't leave his cruel, selfish, totally self-centered harpy of a wife who continues to make him her perfect little punching bag. (They have no children to consider.) So I give him no respect. Last we hear, Doris is still hanging in there with Sugar despite this, so I give her no respect either.This novel is simply not to be missed. It's far more than a fine suspense thriller in a beautiful scenic setting. It's a meticulously detailed study of how crazy and absurd some of our species can be.Not to be missed! Oldie but goodie that I just happened to find in the library and has hooked me on James W. Hall."},{"Title":"Mean High Tide","review":"While I've enjoyed later books by Hall, this book left me wondering if I cared if any of these characters lived or died. Thorn and Sugarman seemed unlikeable at worst, unsympathetic at best, and the other characters either bordered on annoying or superfluous. I finished it simply to see who would be left standing at the end.Read Hall, but not this book."},{"Title":"Mean High Tide","review":"Hall offers yet another look at the seamy underbelly of South Florida life, this one with a plot revolving around revenge, the threat of environmental havoc, and a rather forgettable cast of characters. The ostensible hero, Thorn (although he's not particularly interesting or likable to root for, nor nasty enough to be an anti-hero) comes across a scheme to genetically modify and breed Red Tilapia, with potentially devastating consequences for Florida's coastal ecology. Thorn is apparently a carryover from previous novels, in which other relatives and friends of his have been murdered, so perhaps the reader is meant to have gotten to know him better from these previous outings. In any event, when his girlfriend dies mysteriously while diving, he and his ex-cop buddy start poking their noses around. This soon entangles them with Sylvia, a stereotype man-eating sex kitten who has a bizarre relationship with her ex-CIA hitman father. Their combined actions and motivations require a rather substantial suspension of disbelief on the part of the reader. This is also required when someone tried to kill Thorn in his house, spending a considerable time firing a gun at his house without rousing anybody in the neighborhood. Of course, it's never really clear how or why this person comes looking for Thorn, much less to shoot at! Throw into the mix a wildlife inspector with a detachable nose, a pudgy retired Mafia boss, a mass killing at a federal research facility that apparently somehow got covered up, a bizarre and herky-jerky climax, and what you're left with is a big mess. Hall is at his best in his lyrical descriptions of the water and landscape, but when it comes to dialogue and story, he falters and often fails."},{"Title":"The Tunnels of Cu Chi : The Untold Stories of Vietnam","review":"'The Tunnels of Cu Chi' is a fascinating tale of the ingenuity and perseverance of the Communist Vietnamese enemy. Unable to win against American soldiers and air power on the open battlefield, the Communists burrowed underground, frequently using only using the most basic of equipment, picks and spades. They built incredible tunnel complexes immediately next to some of the U.S.'s largest military bases and, from them, conducted sabotage, hit and run raids, and even the full scale Communist assault of Tet, 1968.The tunnels were arguably most successful in areas with chalky soils for the simple reason that cave ins were less common. Many of the tunnels were equipped with electric lights, ammunition bunkers, hospitals and quarters for hundreds of troops. Entrances were skillfully camoflaged with booby traps at the entrance and sometimes at critical junctures in the tunnel system.The Americans countered these constructions, to a certain extent, by locating openings and employing tunnel rats and/or explosives. The most devastating attacks, however, were high altitude B52 attacks, with enormous bombs that exploded deep underground, collapsing entire tunnel systems.Of course, the Japanese during WWII used similar tunneling techniques to arguably even better effect. The moral to the story is, 'Never Underestimate the Enemy'. He's smarter than you think."},{"Title":"Mike Singletary One-on-One: The Determination That Inspired Him to Give God His Very Best","review":"It is nice to read good things about professional athletes.

But that doesn't mean I completely understand it. So why would I (you) want to read a book written about football by a football player? The question was answered within the first couple pages of \\"Mike Singletary One-On-One\\". It's not just about football...it's about life. Oh, sure there's enough football stories...the hits, the plays to keep the average football fan happy. (Why you can practically smell the turf when reading this book.) But you combine Mike Singletary - one of the greats of football - with Jay Carty's humor and insights and you have winning combination. Here's an example: In the chapter entitled \\"High and Lonely\\", Mike talks about having a work ethic that put him at a different level than many of his teammates were willing to go. And that can make you lonely. \\"It would have been nice if I had been one of the guys, but that was not my way. I didn't know how to play any other way. Maybe if I'd had more talent I could have relaxed a bit, but I didn't. I was the guy who came from the ghetto, who was too small and who was dedicated to my family...yes, sometimes it was lonely at the top.\\" It is this kind of honest reflection with Jay's commentary and spiritual perspective that makes a professional football player \\"human\\"... even downright relatable. This is a great book to give to a football fan...it's even a better book to give to someone who has to deal with the \\"hits\\" and the \\"daily playbook of Life.\\" (I know that I will also be watching Sunday football with just a little more insight into the game.)"},{"Title":"Mike Singletary One-on-One: The Determination That Inspired Him to Give God His Very Best","review":"Author Jay Carty and linebacker Mike Singletary relate valuable lessons of life.

Mike Singletary has been an inspiration to all as a man dedicated to working hard and never giving up, no matter the circumstances. Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Mike Singletary One-on-One: The Determination That Inspired Him to Give God His Very Best","review":"I'm no longer a gung-ho supporter of any professional football team. (Although I probably still lean a little toward the Miami Dolphins - my first gridiron love dating back to 1972 and their undefeated season.) But in 1984, I was a big fan of the Los Angeles Raiders (my hometown team) who were then the reigning Super Bowl champions, and I can still recall watching a game against the Chicago Bears on the lobotomizer (TV). To my utter amazement, four Raiders had to be assisted off the field that day. My jaw fell open! This was the sort of manhandling treatment that the OTHER teams customarily suffered when playing the men in (Silver And) Black. That was the day that I sat up and took notice of the new Monsters Of The Midway, and that wild-eyed linebacker wreaking havoc on everything over the middle - MIKE SINGLETARY.To this day, Singletary (inducted into the Football Hall Of Fame in 1998) remains the best linebacker I've ever seen, and no football fan from my generation will ever forget those eyes under his helmet, wide open, huge, like two motherships scanning the terrain for something to zap into smithereens. And what an awesome force this man was on the field, flattening runningbacks and pulverizing quarterbacks and dealing similarly with any other fool who got in his way! Singletary was the indisputable leader of what came to be known as \\"The Junkyard Dog Defense.\\" In this book, \`MIKE SINGLETARY: ONE ON ONE', Jay Carty calls him \\"the most intense man I have ever met.\\" Over two decades ago, a friend gave me the nickname, \\"Mister Intense\\", and although admittedly I have mellowed a little with age, I'm still occasionally called by that moniker. And it was Singletary's intensity and reputation as a good man that appealed to me even while I hated his '85 team - which I will confess is the greatest football team I've ever rooted against.....and better than any team I ever rooted for, too.(Mike writes: \\"The huge amount of pressure was most intense on game day. I got really revved up. I would hyperventilate and build up a rapid heart rate. While everyone else listened to rock, rap and hip-hop to amp up, I would listen to Beethoven to try to calm down.\\" Ha-Ha! Yeah, this dude was created for the game of football!)\`MIKE SINGLETARY: ONE ON ONE' is a book containing 60 Christian lessons (broken up into daily study) which ex-L.A. Laker and current minister, Jay Carty, based upon the reminiscences of Mike's playing days. On the left-hand page is a brief football-related story by Mike, and on the right-hand page is the Christian (usually Bible-based) insight that Jay associates with the story. Following his text, Carty includes a little prayer related to the theme and then gives some Bible passages for the reader to explore the idea more fully.I found Carty's original prayers (and commentary) to be rather silly at times (and really, with the exception of a few Holy Spirit-filled prayers that one should memorize, effective prayer really needs to be spontaneous and come from the individual's heart - not from someone else's heart), and in a few of the lessons, I felt that Carty was really reaching to find a spiritual message based on what Singletary had to say. Even so, I found myself highlighting as much of Carty's text as Singletary's, and there is no question that Jay is a very sincere man who desires to live a Christ-like life.There were less than flattering comments made about a couple of other players (e.g., Day 20, in which Singletary discusses William \\"The Refrigerator\\" Perry's lack of commitment and self-discipline) that probably weren't necessary, and probably don't belong in a book of this nature. But they were made more palatable by the honesty of both writers who did not shy away from pointing out times in their own lives when they too had gotten off the track.\`ONE ON ONE' contained many interesting stories: you'll learn who Singletary ranks as the best quarterbacks he ever played against and which two linemen hit him as hard as he hit others; you'll learn what qualities Mike and Jay believe constitutes a \\"real man\\"; and you'll learn about the \\"miraculous moment\\" when Singletary is sure that God intervened on his behalf, saving him from a possible career ending injury.The book is informative, easy reading, and according to my own understanding, mostly Biblically sound. Also, I feel that God actually delivered a personal message to me through the lesson for Day 21 - what more could one ask for? \`MIKE SINGLETARY: ONE ON ONE' would make an especially excellent gift for a young man who is involved in athletics and needs to see how a very motivated, competitive player can also be a good man and what being a good man really entails.Mike Singletary is one of my all-time favorite athletes. His Mother believed that we must \\"let God be God.\\" And for that reason, she ignored the advice of her doctors when they recommended that she have an abortion. Mike was born as a result of her letting God be God.

These are not foods recommended by the USDA food pyramid - but they are very healing. Dr. Howell warned that healing would take time, he observed that RA patients require about 24 months to heal.

However, some of the content is lost in scientific boredom."},{"Title":"Enzyme Nutrition","review":"I have to confess that I couldn't stomach reading more than a little over two chapters of this book. It was clear by then that this wasn't going to be worth the time to read. I've read several dozen health-related books and this is the only that has provoked that response in me. So what turned me off? I started to get an uneasy feeling when the author stated that he spent a significant part of his career working for the National Enzyme Company, which specializes in selling enzyme supplements. That's a conflict of interest that, at least for me, casts significant suspicion on the results of his research. And I had the feeling that he was cherry picking the research of others to support his conclusions, though obviously I didn't stick with the book long enough to confirm or deny this feeling.But the thing I couldn't stomach was the proposition that over production of digestive enzymes by your body (to compensate for lack of enzymes in your food) causes your body to deplete a finite store of enzymes (which are also needed for metabolism), and once you've depleted your enzyme \\"bank account\\" you're dead. So he basically proposes that the way to put off death is to eat lots of raw, natural foods (for their enzymes, which are destroyed when foods are cooked - this minimizes your body's need to overproduce digestive enzymes and thus preserves enzymes for metabolism) and to live your life in such a way as to minimize your rate of metabolism so as to preserve your metabolism enzymes. Basically you should be a couch potato, but eat a very healthy diet. Doing so will have you living to a ripe old age. But if this were the case, wouldn't athletes all die young from over-metabolizing? I think about my 91 year old Uncle Bill - exercises religiously, smoked and drank a good part of his life, and eats very poorly. Yet he's in better shape than most folks 20 years younger. Now some people would correctly point out that as you become very fit your BASAL metabolic rate declines. They may point to this as proof of the author's point. But people only become fit by being very active, so their overall metabolic rate is higher than that of an unfit, sedentary person.At least it wasn't a total waste. I did learn there are three types of enzymes - metabolic, digestive and those contained in foods. And I suspect there is benefit in preserving the natural enzymes in most foods, which is part of why folks on a diet that avoids processed foods enjoy better health than those eat too many processed foods.

If you have doubts about *why* a raw food diet is a good idea, and why in many cases it can save a person's life, then this is the book to start with. &quot;Enzyme Nutrition&quot; is pretty much a scientific book. It is not a manifesto, or a how-to book, but rather a presentation of one man's life-long research into the role that food enzymes play in human digestion. Don't let that scare you away, however, because the language is very easy to understand, and the book is easy to read. In fact, this book is a condensation of the author's unpublished 700 page book, a book that supposedly took him 20 years to write.It is really a shame that this book is not a bestseller, and that Dr. Howell's theories are not more widely known. The ideas in it are, pardon the possible hyperbole, revolutionary. Many of the ideas that you read in other raw food and enzyme books are based on Howell's research (although, to be accurate, not all raw food advocates are advocates of Howell's ideas).

He backs up his findings on the nutritive, health-giving, and cancer-fighting elements of living foods with years of research, statistics, and even labarotary animal cases. While the use of labaratory animals for research is ethically problematic- the statistics Dr. Howell has gained from them are a great boon to this book, his position, and the health enthusiast community.For all the cynics who think a raw food diet is a silly fad, they might have difficulty arguing the facts present in this book. For those who follow a diet such as the Hippocrates Diet, or who realize the value of adding fresh and uncooked or minimally-cooked foods to their meals, this book will be a valuable source of information as to precisely why, in a scientific sense, your endeavor to eat living foods is not only justifiable, but very wise.There's more to life than the foods you eat, but there's not much more to death than the foods you eat. Most people dig their own graves with their knives and forks. By understanding both the harmful and healthful qualities of various foods and how they are prepared, one can greatly increase once chances of survival through the 21st century. Of course, first one has to avoid getting hit by a car or flying airplanes."},{"Title":"Enzyme Nutrition","review":"This book lays out so well the role that &quot;enzymes&quot; play in our health, that by the time I finished reading it, I switched to a &quot;live-foods&quot; diet.

However, this book is NOT Dr. Howell's \\"scientific\\" book. In the mid-40s he published a book filled with many hundreds of citations supporting his conclusions. THIS book is a popularization of his conclusions. I have read both, and can definitely say that this book is entertaining, enlightening, and still revolutionary in its implications for proper human nutrition.The reviewer also objected to the idea that the pancreas has a finite capacity for enzyme production. Dr. Howell notes that the heart also has a finite capacity for beating cycles. This fact is generally accepted in the life sciences, so why the idea that the pancreas is similarly limited is so hard for that reviewer to accept is unclear.I have seen nothing to disprove or discount Dr. Howell's conclusions. Indeed, I have been using his principles of enzyme supplementation in my own diet for over 16 years, and I can personally attest that he is RIGHT because one's body does indeed process food differently when there are plenty of enzymes available."},{"Title":"Enzyme Nutrition","review":"In this \\"Enzyme Nutrition\\", Eddie Howell and May Murray managed to squeeze a lot of information into a compact space. A good effort indeed!The book is small; but, touched every vital point.

Its theme is simple and straightforward. Still, I will advise any non-science biased enthusiasts (like: bodybuilders and fitness [people]), who would like to venture into it, to keep a biochemistry dictionary at hand. \\"Enzyme Nutrition\\" will assist its readers in assessing and selecting healthy natural foods. It is an ideal and affordable advisor, which diabetics and other persons with limited food choice would enjoy reading."},{"Title":"Enzyme Nutrition","review":"This seminal work by Dr. Howell fills a much needed void in the nutrition paradigm. With abundant clinical research to back his findings, he explains the critical importance of consuming foods rich in natural enzymes and how these life-sustaining molecules are destroyed by our modern methods of cooking, sterilizing, and processing foods. Written on a level basic enough for people with little nutrition background, yet comprehensive enough to take a doctor like myself to a new level of understanding regarding the power of raw foods in both health and disease.

It should be read critically because Howell was not a responsible scholar. His logic and his use of references cannot be relied on. His thinking was also extremely out of date. This might be explained by the fact that he himself was 87 when this book was published. Despite the hype, he was not a noted researcher. He was not an enzymologist and did no published research. He is unknown in the biochemical world.Howell's main idea about enzymes can be seen in the excerpts provided here. He believed that the proteins in enzymes were mere carriers for a 'vital energy' or 'life principle' which he called the enzyme potential. He also believed that we were born with this enzyme potential in a limited lifetime supply. Why did he believe in this bizarre theory? The excerpt provided gives a clue: in a book written in 1985 he was arguing against the enzyme theories of 1880 and 1890. He had missed the huge development in the knowledge about enzymes which had happened after 1950. He was stuck in the past.Much of the material in this book is similar to his first book, \\"Food Enzymes for Health and Longevity\\" which was written in 1939 when he was 41. In his first book, he gave some references describing experiments where the enzyme activity appeared to be separated from the protein molecule. If he had stayed in touch with enzyme research he would have known that these crude experiments were disproved with more accurate equipment. In fact, the enzyme activity IS completely explained by the protein molecule. He would have learned about DNA and its role in enzyme production. He would have learned about ATP and its role in providing energy to enzyme activity. There is no 'enzyme potential' needed to explain the workings of enzymes - his theory was based on misinformation. If he had been a true scientist he would have discarded his enzyme potential theory and moved on many years before this book was written.In this book he used faulty logic, drawing unjustified conclusions from bits of information from other people's research. The way he presented information from other sources is also questionable in several cases. It is easy to read his book and get the impression that he had supported his ideas with good references. But if the actual reference is read, it can be seen that he sometimes omitted details which would have weakened his case. For instance he talked about an old experiment by 'Jackson' where rats were fed a diet of 80% sugar and the pancreas size increased. He commented that this was an enzymeless diet, and he exclaimed about the calamitous effects of an enzymeless diet. But he didn't mention the fact that the control rats' diet was also enzymeless cooked food (containing 40% sugar). The difference between the rats on the two diets had nothing to do with enzymes in the food. He also ignored the fact that the paper's authors thought the change in the pancreas weight of those mice might not have been related to diet but to another factor in the experiment."},{"Title":"Lorna Doone (Oxford Bookworms Library, Level 4)","review":"I have loved this story since I was a child and I have read several more detailed versions of the same story.

This monograph, \\"The Colonial Background of the American Revolution,\\" seeks to reverse the general habit of trying to justify rather than explain, and the tendency by early nineteenth century historians to concentrate exclusively on the years of the conflict, without exploring in any detail the nearly two centuries of colonial experience that preceded it.England may have stumbled blindly into empire and the American colonists may have moved in a slow, clumsy manner toward self government, but these inexorable movements in opposite directions were destined to strain colonial relations, Andrews argues. Just as England was coming to the realization that it needed greater control and authority over its vast colonial holdings, the American colonies were realizing that they were developing an independent self-identity. Thus, the hundred years before the Stamp Act mark a \\"silent revolution\\" that was gradual, yet profound; balancing the needs of establishing an imperial domain while placating a radical colonial population were irreconcilable.Despite the effects of this silent revolution, Andrews maintains that cooperation and conciliation could have prevented the American War for Independence. Thus, the American Revolution was more the product of obstinacy and radicalism by British and Colonial elite, respectively, than it was of any true principle of liberty. Ultimately, however, the two competing parties simply failed to understand one another, according to Andrews. Although they came from the same racial stock and institutional tradition, two hundred years of life apart had left an indelible impression. Americans were imbued with the \\"spirit of the frontier\\" and a fierce drive for independence and self government, all feelings that the common Englishman of the eighteenth century were incapable of understanding. But even if they could appreciate the motivations behind the revolts and were willing to explore conciliation, the British government simply could not accept the colonial argument of the solubility of Parliamentary laws without directly threatening the entire foundation on which the British empire rested.From the perspective of official London, there was only one proper response to the behavior and increasingly strident demands of the colonial radicals: physical coercion. Brute force, not conciliation, was the answer. Colonial grievances, Andrews says, were in no way interpreted as legitimate claims or as an expression of a newly developed concept of naturals rights or liberty. Rather, they were viewed as craven examples of colonial ingratitude and treasonous disrespect. The author claims that this disdain for popular dissent among the governing elite was not dissimilar from the \\"gag rule\\" over slavery instituted by American Congressional lawmakers in the early nineteenth century.Andrews maintains that the Revolution was a direct result of two native, ruling elites with a total inability to empathize with the other and an irrational unwillingness to even try. In addition, he cites a host of minor causes. Among them are: 1) Royal Governors, who either failed to appreciate the inadequacies of Royal colonial government or understand the fundamental changes that had taken place in colonial society (often both); 2) Privy Council, which even more than the Royal governors failed to grasp the need for change in colonial administration; and 3) Crown Legal Advisors, who almost to a man maintained a strict interpretation of existing legislation, which condemned colonial actions out of hand for legal reasons and gave the ruling authorities the motivation to maintain a very hard line in dealing with the radicals.Interestingly, it is only after 1774 that Andrews believes that King George III deserves any culpability in the events leading to the Revolution, and that overall the King has been made a scapegoat. He was surrounded, the author argues, by officials who refused to depart in any way from a strict interpretation of the law. Although, over time, George became a true believer in the value of coercion as the only way to settle the situation, Andrews continues. In a way, the American Revolution was like Vietnam for the George III administration. All close advisors urged a hardline policy and threatened that failure to respond with resolute action tempted a domino scenario throughout the empire, as one profitable colony after another fell to self-determination. Once engaged in a costly war, many former advocates became critics and the timeless argument of sunk costs reared its baleful head. George III ultimately had to find an exit for a war his advisors had created.\\"The Colonial Background of the American Revolution\\" might be a rather arcane, academic history of early American history, but it's one that reads well and retains its relevance nearly a century after its initial publication. The fact that it is still in print is testimony to its enduring value."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Great Poems English and American From the Foundations of the English Spirit to the Outstanding Poetry of Our Own Time with Lives of the Poets and Historical Settings","review":"The book of \\"great poems\\" came in a timely fashion, in the condition described.

They are all beautifully written, fiercely intelligent, and both hilarious and heartbreaking at once. Had it not been for an article in the Atlantic Monthly, I would have lived my whole life never having discovered this author, who has become one of my absolute favourites. When you discover a writer that you love, you cannot imagine never having read their words.I almost feel as if I know her.Elizabeth Taylor is often compared to other female British writers but somehow the comparisons are not accurate to me. She was different; more intelligent, stronger, and had a wit that showed a subtle brilliance.Her writing is not typically female, and has a sharp masculine undercurrent about it eventhough her stories are almost exclusively concerned with female domestic life. It's a fascinating contrast.She once said that she preferred books where \\"almost nothing happens.\\" Yet her stories are so rich - in dialogue, in analysis of human behaviour. It is \\"inaction\\" at its very finest.Furthermore, she was able to do what few female authors manage: to write male characters authentically - their mannerisms, their voice, their perceptions, in a way that is totally believable. What a rare and wonderful writer she was. If you haven't yet discovered Elizabeth Taylor, how I envy you. You have so much enjoyment to look forward to."},{"Title":"In a Summer Season","review":"Elizabeth Taylor was unquestionably one of the most intelligent and hard-to-describe British novelists of the mid 20th century. Each of hers novel is very unlike every other novel in terms of its plot, although you'd never mistake her witty way at getting at the springs and balances of genteel middle-class behavior for anyone else's. And yet her work shows strong affinities with her great friend Ivy Compton-Burnett's, as well as with Elizabeth Bowen's and even (at times) with Iris Murdoch's.IN A SUMMER SEASON, one of Taylor's finest novels, is a striking blend of both comedy and tragedy, centering largely upon the ways in which the young and unsettled cling to that which is older because it seems safe, even when it is not the best thing for them (or for their elders). The middle-aged wealthy widowed Kate has married Dermot, over a decade her junior, mostly for his sexual allure, but he stays clinging to her because she makes it possible for him not to work or grow up; significantly, his own mother wants him to work in a shop selling Victorian antiques. Meanwhile Kate is watched in her marriage by her live-in aunt Ethel, a former suffragist; her son by her first marriage, Tom, who works for his condescending and nagging grandfather in hopes of rising in the family business; and Tom's sister Lou, who nurses a crush upon a middle-aged pastor with High Church tendencies that distress the other townsfolk. Even though the novel's women sport the latest and highest bouffant hairdos of the novel's era (it was published in 1961), the family's telescope in their Thames Valley home gives away their fixation on the ways and comforts of the past, in that it more often than not focused on Windsor Castle several miles away. The novel has some of Taylor's best comic moments in it (there is a very wittily composed section midway through the novel concerning a contentious dinner party featuring a roast turkey that has gone off), and also shows her usual gift for delaying violence until it becomes almost inevitable at the novel's conclusion. This is a novel that should be much better known in the United States, and shows Taylor at her most skilled and intelligent."},{"Title":"In a Summer Season","review":"I first heard of Elizabeth Taylor in an Atlantic Monthly review. I am a Barbara Pym fan(atic) and it seemed Taylor would be to my liking. I received In a Summer Season on Thursday and devoured it by Saturday morning. The story was compelling, the characters beautifully drawn and largely sympathetic. Some of Taylor's emotional or psychological insights caused me to catch my breath. I am widely read and slightly cynical, but I found this novel to be that paragon of literature--entertaining, informative, and thought provoking. I highly recommend this author and am only sorry it took me so long to hear of her."},{"Title":"On This Rockne : A Notre Dame Mystery","review":"I liked this book much better than the other reviewers did ... except for the fact that McInerny doesn't seem to want Notre Dame to win a football game! (I've read all of them in this series I can find, and the author features a game in each one ... and they're always ties! Forget that, and win one for the Gipper!) I found the \\"literary detection,\\" however, more fascinating than the murder mystery -- so much so that I searched out Knute Rockne's only novel, THE FOUR WINNERS, which, much to my surprise, has recently been republished. It's better than this book makes it sound, and is a genuinely good \\"young adult\\" type story, given the overall sophistication of a mid-1920s audience. Nevertheless, I've spent some time in academic environments, and McInerny captures the sort of thing that goes on with a high degree of accuracy. I like the Knight brothers, although a little more effective action, both in their lives and on the football field would, I think, improve the books."},{"Title":"On This Rockne : A Notre Dame Mystery","review":"I must commend McInerny for putting himself at risk by attempting to intermingle a modern fictional work with the time-honored tradition that is Notre Dame. As an alum, myself, it was amusing to read about my old stomping grounds, but I found the references to the Notre Dame campus, buildings, tradition and environs to be distracting at times. McInerny seems to be forcing discussion of Notre Dame history through his characters, incorporating wording and phraseology that few would use in daily conversation. The plot seemed rushed, and I believe that those who have never seen the beauty of the campus would be hard pressed to understand where and why certain actions take place. Notre Dame tradition is deeply rooted and anyone writing about it can be assured to receive criticism or praise from fans and alumni alike. McInerny's brave attempt at bringing this tradition into a fictitional realm is only mediocre, and I hope that in future books of this series, his results are more entertaining and intriguin"},{"Title":"On This Rockne : A Notre Dame Mystery","review":"\\"On This Rockne\\" is the first of the Notre Dame mysteries by Ralph McInerny who is best known for the Father Dowling mysteries.

Marcus Bramble donated money to the school to build a memorial to legendary coach Knute Rockne. Madeline Rune, whose grandfather had helped Rockne write his novel \\"The Four Winners\\", is found murdered at her home. Philip and Roger team up to investigate. Who killed Madeline? Was it her estranged husband Stanley, Henry Hadley, a man obsessed with her, or someone else who had a grudge against her? It is Roger who actually solves the case. It was interesting to find out that Rockne did write this one novel. There is some football action for the college football fans.

Philip is a private detective, Roger is scholarly, obese brother who has just accepted a faculty position at Notre Dame. The first dead body to appear is a member of the college Trustee board, and had been Philip's dinner companion the night before. As the brothers tried to find out the truth behind the murder other questions began to pop up, some dating back to the glory days of Knute Rockne himself.The author of this series, Ralph McInerny is better known for his Father Dowling series which would lead a reader to expect a somewhat challenging, well written cozy. Sadly this story does not live up to those expectations. Part of the problem is that as the first novel in a new series it has the burden of introducing the main characters, establishing the setting and generally supplying the overall series mythology as well as relating and solving the crime specific to this book. All first novels of a series face these issues and most still manage to tell an interesting story in an entertaining manner. This one falls a bit short in meeting the challenge. The main characters are all introduced and a bit of their backstories are supplied but the mystery aspect of this book is a disappointment. It is quite obvious who committed the crimes, the red herring would not mislead any both the most naive of mystery readers.

But as a professional medieval historian, I found this book to be slow and difficult, so I feel I should warn other readers that this is not a sprightly guide to medieval institutional history, but a heavily argumentative one.Readers interested in Reynolds' point of view might want to look first at her earlier book, *Kingdoms and Communities in Western Europe 900-1300.* If you really like *Kingdoms and Communities* you might be ready for *Fiefs and Vassals.*"},{"Title":"Fiefs and Vassals: The Medieval Evidence Reinterpreted","review":"Susan Reynolds completes the quiet revolution begun by Marc Bloch with the appearance of Feudal Society in the 1930s-- though arguably it can be traced back to Ferdinand Flach at the turn of the century. Bloch painted a complex and nuanced portrait of medieval society in which feudal relations played but a part. The program of study outlined by Bloch has dominated medieval studies until today. More importantly, he decentered feudalism from analysis of medieval society.George Duby in his study of the Maconnais played the role of Kepler to Bloch's Copernicus. Duby focused his attention on a small geographical region within the heartland of so-called classical feudalism. Though the Maconnais did not conform to feudal models, Duby modestly suggested that more regional studies needed to be done. He hinted that a great deal of variation was to be expected. Since Duby, medievalists have taken up the micro approach while embracing an ever wider range of social activity.By the 1970s, feudalism had, by and large, disappeared from scholarly discorse, but, pardoxically, not from textbooks or the classroom. It was only a matter of time before someone pointed this out. In a fameous AHR article EAR Brown lamented this state of affairs. But medievalists are a conservative lot and continued working as before. This is where Reynolds comes in.Reynolds asks a simple question: whence feudalism? The answer is complex; but the starting point was the 12th century Lombard [Italy] compilation Libri feodorum. The Book of Fiefs was a highly tendentious work that represented one side in a difficult and emotional dispute. It was hardly of pan-European significance. Medieval people, moreover, did not use the term feudalism, a neologism of the Enlightenment era. The Libri first came into French use-- and from there European wide use-- in the 16th century when a now professional judiciary used it to further the systemizing and centralizing goals of the monarchy. And once adopting the Libri as academic law, European scholars began imposing its categories on the medieval past. Reynolds spends the bulk of book showing just how varied and unstable the medieval terms and practices ossified in the Libri were over space and time. It is a fascinating tale expertly handeled by Reynolds. Feudalism is finally dead thanks to this book. I cannot recommend it too strongly."},{"Title":"Fiefs and Vassals: The Medieval Evidence Reinterpreted","review":"I thought this book was a very interesting read - but readers have to understand ahead of time it is NOT a general interest book on feudalism or medievalism.

I have been puzzled by a statement I occasionally came across that said, basically, feudalism as classically understood is a modern construct that did not really exist.This book explains that statement. The modern construct of feudalism is that a lord gives a vassal land in return for (military) service. This book examines the evidence and shows that is rather thin. Instead the evidence suggests that there was a whole spectrum of relationships in the Middle Ages and only a few fit the definition of feudal lord and vassal. It looks as though modern scholars have taken Latin phrases which actually have a broad range of meanings over time and narrowly interpreted them to fit the preconceived notion of &#34;lord&#34; and &#34;vassal.&#34; That's the gist of the book.What was interesting to me is how the author discusses the evidence - it paints an interesting picture of relationships in that era.Just be forewarned - this is a thesis - pretty dry and academic.

The book is riviting."},{"Title":"JFK and LBJ: The influence of personality upon politics (A Pelican book)","review":"This book was assigned to me in a Presidential Politics course taught at Gettysburg College in the seventies. It talks about JFK's intent to remove a large portion of American troops from Viet Nam before his assasination. Wicker goes on to describe how LBJ wanted to push for the policies supported by the late President but could not continue with JFK's planned change of policy in Southeast Asia because it had not yet been announced. Acting in concert with JFK's plans by disengaging would, paradoxically, have been seen as a break with past policies and an imposition of LBJ's intent on his newly obtained office.Wicker's skills as an analyst of each president's personality brings a richness to his narrative in this and other areas not always seen in political history. His methodology relies more heavily on the Great Man theory (individual leaders impact on world events)than on a systemic explanation.Around this time, Wicker further demonstrated his insight into the effect of personality on politics in a largely forgotten novel titled \\"Facing the Lions.\\" I have not read either book in 30 years but remember both works more than many others I have read over that same period and would not hesitate to recommend them to the contemporary follower of presidential politics."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Statistics (Oxford Paperback Reference)","review":"Two English statisticians have compiled this list of terms, abbreviations, famous probabilists and statisticians that is accessible to experts, beginners and practitioners in all fields that use statistical methods and probability.

I wanted a good dictionary to help me out, so I purchased the Oxford Dictionary of Statistics. I have found this book to be almost completely worthless for my purposes. The book seems to take a shotgun approach in that it is full of statistical procedures and techniques that (at least in my field) nobody really uses while at the same time not using enough space to explain some important and very standard procedures (such as regression discontinuity). The short story is that it is not very useful at all for anyone working in evaluation of people and/or social programs or any kind of sociological/psychological based field.

One reason for it, is that a lot of words are missing. This is understandable given the fact that it has only 400+ pages and my Cassells has 1200+. But somehow I missed that when ordering it, since it got so many good reviews. One other problem is that the words it contains, are not really explained and usually contain only one synonym, where in my Cassells it has a whole paragraph explaining the different meanings (and usuage) of the word.To sum it up, you get what you pay for.

The bad news: This dictionary is printed in the tiniest type, on the cheapest, natural-coloured paper just one step above newsprint. I've had things wrapped in better paper than this! It's also saddle-bound. This might seem a very superficial criticism, but a dictionary, particularly pocket size, gets a tremendous workout. Mine just arrived, but I can see it starting to fall apart in a month or two. The less-than-white paper and tiny print make it hard to read. After all the effort that went into the content, it's a real shame that it was so shabbily printed.

The book also talks about the position of the RR in the different countries around the world , including the USA.

For their own reasons, they each decide there can be no romance between them, but in the meantime they are still attracted to each other and Daniel helps Phoebe develop self-confidence. The characters are likable enough, and Phoebe does become more empowered throughout the course of the story, but there wasn't anything particularly interesting about the story or the characters, so I won't be reading any more in this series about the Barone family. Also, this book got several things wrong about Boston -- the main library doesn't have a parking lot, for instance, and there are definitely no ranch houses in Boston proper! This would be more forgivable if the book weren't part of a series of over a dozen books about this family -- surely the author must know the city better than is evidenced here?Altogether, as interesting for the title as anything else, and perhaps a harmless read for a high schooler. Pretty bad cover too."},{"Title":"The Librarian's Passionate Knight Dynasties:The Barones","review":"Heroine: average/plumpThe night was hot, but she was not. Yet something about the short, mousy girl in line at the ice cream stand caught the attention of sexy millionaire playboy Daniel Barone anyway, and he wasn't sorry when he spotted her a second time on that sultry August evening in the crowd milling around Boston's Faneuil HallShy, quiet Phoebe Richards couldn't believe that she, a librarian who lived a simple life filled with romance novels and daydreams about daring, dashing heroes had actually met one of Boston's most eligible, adventurous bachelors, not to mention one of the only truly chivalrous men left in the world. Too bad he only wanted to be friends after rescuing Phoebe from a perilous situation.Or did he?What worked for me:I adore puns, so I loved the rather apt title.The characters were wonderful: shy little Phoebe was very sweet, sexy Daniel just charmed the heck out of me, and I would have gladly given Pheebs' surrogate mother Leslie a high-five for taking our heroine to task over her tendency to put herself down.There was a nice mix of drama and humor in the story. The instance when Daniel and Phoebe cross paths for the second time was absolutely priceless!Size-wise, Phoebe was short and roundish. No mile-long legs and impossibly perky bosoms on this gal!What didn't work for me:Jumping into the middle of a family series like \\"The Barones\\" is like plunging into a soap opera five years after it debuts. There was a huge amount of information on Daniel's background handed out in large lumps. Fortunately this only happened in a couple of passages. The rest of the time was focused on the budding relationship of Pheebs and Daniel, which was of more interest to me.Overall:A fun, sexy read! Fans of \\"caterpillar to butterfly\\" or Cinderella stories should enjoy this one.Be aware that there are some steamy scenes in this book.If you liked \\"The Librarian's Passionate Knight\\" you might also enjoy \\"Midsummer Lightning\\", \\"The Independent Bride\\", \\"The Bridesmaid's Reward\\", \\"His Seductive Revenge\\", \\"Carried Away\\", \\"His E-mail Order Wife\\", \\"The Course of True Love\\", \\"More to Love\\", \\"Runaway Bay\\", \\"Dear Cupid\\", \\"Looking for Laura\\", \\"Spellbound\\", or \\"Sweet Memories\\"."},{"Title":"The Librarian's Passionate Knight Dynasties:The Barones","review":"Daniel will always be Phoebe's knight in shining armor after he saved her from a sticky situation with her ex-boyfriend. While all he wants is a buddy, Phoebe is more than ready to lust after him, even if she knows nothing will come if it because of his well known adventurous and globe trotting ways. It's just too bad they happened to fall in love.I got my hands on this book a while ago and was reluctant to read it because of the low reviews here. For me 3 stars usually means a terrible romance with the way most people rate on Amazon. But I am so glad I finally gave in and read this one. This is one of the funniest and most charming books I have read in a long while. It's your typical harlequin, but this book has such a good heart and two wonderful leads that I am shocked that everyone didn't love it as much as I did.Phoebe is adorable, sweet and innocence, but not at all in a cringe-inducing way. You really root for her to fight for what she wants and even if she doesn't end up with Daniel you want her to be happy with someone. Daniel was equally adorable and charming and while I didn't like him as well as Phoebe he was still a great hero. I got annoyed with his in ability to grow up and take responsibility for anything. His rational for not wanting to be with Phoebe was that he didn't have commitments, being he had to go to a new adventure. But the whole point of his life style, which he referred to as selfish and fun, was doing what he wanted. His being unable to make a commitment to Phoebe just meant he was committed to freedom just as strongly as if he would be committed to a person, so he wasn't exactly as \\"free\\" as he liked to pretend. That being said, he was a really sweet and carrying man.The ending wasn't as fulfilling as it could have been, he basically just told her what he wanted and that was that. I wanted some groveling or something after he acted like such a dope. Plus, the basic differences of the fact he couldn't stay in one place and she wanted to settle down and have a family were never solved, just glossed over, and I hate to say it but I worry that if these guys did get married they wouldn't be able to make it work if they ever had a family, and I hate doubting if a happily ever after is going to last. But on the whole this was a very endearing, sweet, charming, good-spirited and fun read that had me laughing and smiling through most of it.4 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"The Librarian's Passionate Knight Dynasties:The Barones","review":"THE DAMSEL IN DISTRESS ...When she saw the man who rescued her from a stalker ex-boyfriend, librarian Phoebe Richards couldn't believe her eyes.

And she begins to grow up!This is a must-read for all women ~~ regardless of their marital status or children-status. I think moms with very young children can relate to Maggie's dilemmas with the babies ~~ but everyone can enjoy the stories. Durrant writes with a flair and humor ~~ you can't help but fall in love with the characters and keep on turning the pages. This is the perfect summer read!5-22-03"},{"Title":"Having It and Eating It","review":"This isn't a bad book, but it isn't a very good one either. Yes, I have kids so I can concede that her observations about chaotic childcare are accurate. Accurate, yes, but not original, thought provoking or more to the point, funny. Because this writer seems to have taken a stab at comic writing. My advice: Don't do it, you're simply not funny enough. Sabine Durrant is certainly no Marian Keyes.I kept reading this thinking it would pick up. It didn''t. The plot didn't really go anywhere and the ending was anticlimactic. I guess I mainly read it because I'm a UK girl living in the US and like reading about England when I feel homesick. But this book was like a long forgotten eclair you find at the bottom of your fridge, looks tasty but ends up tastingt kind of stale."},{"Title":"Having It and Eating It","review":"Reviewing readers who have no children can not POSSIBLY understand this book. No offense. Neither could I have two years ago before the birth of my first child. Now home with two, I COMPLETELY relate with Maggie Owen, our narrator and protagonist.Durrant clearly has experienced motherhood, perhaps even stay-at-home motherhood. It's a different world. It's stifling, but fulfilling in its own wonderful ways as she explains so beautifully.I called friends and family at times to read excerpts that struck me just so. Even staggered down the hall (no, not drinking...laughing so hard I could hardly walk) to read bits to my husband/the father of our children.If you haven't had kids yet, wait to read the book...no...don't...this'll give you a taste of what IS to come."},{"Title":"Having It and Eating It","review":"Heroine:Feeling frumpy, still carrying baby weightMeet thirty-something Maggie Owens, former journalist turned stay-at-home-mum of two baby boys. Maggie loves her life, but lately she feels disconnected from everything: the \\"real\\" world, the one where making money is all that counts; her \\"friends\\" with whom she has nothing in common save motherhood, and most of all her partner Jake, who has been very distant while working on several major advertising accounts at once.And nothing seems to drive this point home to Maggie as decisively as a chance meeting with an old girlhood friend, the devastatingly successful, blonde, slender Claire Masterson. It is Claire who has made her mark on the world of international journalism, while Maggie submitted her work to third and fourth rate publications. But Claire states that she's getting too old for a jetset life and has moved back home to get back to her roots and hopefully find the man of her dreams, the one who will give her the family she longs for.At first Maggie is thrilled to have her old friend around, but soon a series of upsetting coincidences leave Maggie wondering if Jake isn't having an affair with the toned and tan Claire, which in turn leads her to consider wandering down the garden path herself.What worked for me:The word craft in this story was excellent; certainly a notch above the other chick lit books of this nature. Some passages I read more than once, just to savor the clever construction of the sentences and the images they portrayed.As a stay-at-home mom myself, it was easy for me to slip into Maggie's world of diapers and spit-up. And I completely understood her struggle with feeling herself to be somehow less important than the supermoms who balanced kids with careers.Size-wise Maggie is never really pinned down to a particular number, we just know that she feels dumpy and requires clothing designed for ladies with a \\"curvier\\" figure.What didn't work for me:The characters weren't particularly deep, but were still fleshed out enough for me to dislike most of them, with the exception of Jake. I felt sympathetic for him but really didn't \\"know\\" him beyond the fact that he worked a lot, loved soccer, and adored his family.\\"Having It and Eating It\\" truly lives up to its title. The book seemed to be meant as a \\"grass is always greener\\" cautionary faerie tale, but the author doesn't really explore the moral of the story. The reader never sees Maggie paying the price for her poor judgment. Whether it's with a couples therapist or someone who specializes in post partum depression, Maggie is in need of some serious counseling.Overall:A quirky, enjoyable read, especially for fans of the current British Chick Lit craze or admirers of well-constructed prose. However, the plot is so infuriating that you might miss some of those beautifully written passages when skimming forward to find out what happens in the less-than-satisfactory conclusion of this tale.Warning: there is some coarse language in this book, as well as some steamy love scenes."},{"Title":"Having It and Eating It","review":"I bought this book from Barnes and Noble because I wanted to get my order over $25.00 to get free shipping (LOL) and it was a baragin book.

You won't be let down."},{"Title":"Having It and Eating It","review":"Although I figured out very early what would happen regarding one key plot point, I nevertheless recommend this book as a good weekend read. The characters are believable, as are the situations and conversations. There are suspenseful moments, and funny ones, and of course, touching ones as well. Very enjoyable, on the whole.It's of the genre pouring out of England in the past few years -- I think Helen Fielding started the trend with the Bridget Jones books, although the books about Adrian Mole are in the same vein, and predate Fielding by awhile -- humor diarists writing winningly about everyday situations. Jane Green does a nice job, too, and the best recent offering is _I Don't Know How She Does It_. If you read that one, this book will seem a little flat, but still well worth reading."},{"Title":"Having It and Eating It","review":"This book devotes most of its descriptive energy to portraying the unfulfilled life of this underappreciated &quot;playground mum.&quot; It's depressing enough to put anyone off having children, and given the many advantages of Maggie's posh lifestyle, it comes off as whinging. Somehow the playful element that might add a note of comedy is missing.You might think that things would be spiced up by the plot involving adultery. I will not give any more details here, but I don't think I'd be spoiling it if I did, because all of the developments of this subplot (including its eventual ironic, &quot;surprise&quot; twist) are completely obvious from the get-go. I cannot recall the last time I read a book this predictable.In short, the plot of this book is not nearly exciting enough to warrant spending time with its irritating narrator."},{"Title":"Having It and Eating It","review":"Having It and Eating It isn't a bad read. It is a fairly predictable book about a woman questioning her life as a suburban mom and her (not quite) husband's loyalty. When she meets her old school friend, Claire, she finds herself reexamining everything about her own life, and comparing it, unfavorably, to her perceptions of Claire's life. The book is fairly honest in its depiction of how Maggie feels rendered irrelevant by her full-time parenting job.But it was unclear to me if the book's big narrative surprise was really supposed to be a surprise to the reader. It's so obvious in its set-up (and I'm not a particularly clever reader).If you base your book-buying decisions on whether or not you're likely to want to reread, get this one at the library."},{"Title":"Having It and Eating It","review":"Durrant's story is well-crafted and well-written, but it's kind of a downer. First, it makes being a stay-at-home mom seem positively loathsome and tremendously unfulfilling (I'm not a mom yet, so I couldn't say whether or not this is true). Second, the fact that heroine Maggie is not married to her man Jake (but has two kids by him)seriously warrants some further exploration and explanation that we never receive. And even though Jake doesn't turn out to be the cad we thought he was, there are still some serious relationship issues that are never resolved.However, I did find this book engaging enough to finish in a few hours, so despite the problems I had with it I still consider it a pretty decent read."},{"Title":"Having It and Eating It","review":"bought this book from Barnes and Noble because I wanted to get my order over $25.00 to get free shipping (LOL) and it was a baragin book.

Even if you're not the age that Betsy was in one of the books, you can still love all of them! Maud has a way of capturing real feelings and experiences--even bad ones--and turning them into works of art. The &quot;Betsy-Tacy&quot; series really is a work of art, even if it was painted with a pen, and not a paintbrush."},{"Title":"Emily of Deep Valley","review":"Emily of Deep Valley was a sweet book. It was about Emily Webster and after she graduated from Deep Valley Highschool. Emily lived with her grandfather, a civil war veteran, in an old fashioned house across the slough. She goes to school with her own crowd and has some of the same teachers Betsy and Tacy had. Emily is one of those shy, sweet, and considerate charactures that every one loves. She gets you into the story with her longing to stay in highschool, and her longing to go to college. But she can do neither. She sees her friends come home for vacation from college. She finally decides to stop feeling sorry for herself and do something. She starts by putting her &quot;hair up&quot;. This knocks off the whole story. As soon as the hair is up Cab Edwards, we know from the Betsy-Tacy series, begins to call on her and they go to dances together... I have one question though. When are they going to republish this wonderful book?"},{"Title":"A Most Suitable Duchess (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"He loves his farm, and breeding beagles. She loves her literary society and educational charities such as building a new observatory. On the surface, these two have nothing in common. Yet, due to a string of meddlesome people (a dead Duke, overly-helpful brother, and anxious soon-to-be sister-in-law, as well as the usual gossips) circumstances conspire to marry these two off. The conflict starts at once -- she wants to live in the city, he wants to return to his farm. They compromise by taking a lengthy tour of his newly inherited ducal estates.That's when this quiet character study really comes into its own. Cut off from the props of their previous lives, the hero and heroine must discover what's truly important about their lifestyles, themselves, and their spouses. No one is more surprised than they as they discover when it comes to what's really important, they're more alike than different. But when the honeymoon is over, and they resume their former lives, can the tenuous bonds formed in isolation withstand the stress?As always, Ms. Bray's characters are a delightful mix of insightful human commentary and Regency absurdity. (I loved the scene where the butler, having been brushed off and told to put the latest wedding gift in the room with the others before he can say what the gift is, gets to announce that the gift has just eaten one of the other gifts.) Fans of her previous books will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"A Most Suitable Duchess (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"This book is what I've come to expect from Patricia Bray's Regency stories-- a lighthearted comedy of manners that's just the thing to curl up with on winter's evening. The author has a knack for creating interesting characters that come alive, and then placing them in absurd situations.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Most Suitable Duchess (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"I enjoy romance novels, especially Regencies. But this novel left me wanting and waiting for more story substance. Penelope and Marcus supposedly marry for convenience and eventually fall in love. But the details of their relationship were definitely missing. And in Penelope's supposed response to Marcus' advertisement, we are never told who truly wrote it or why. One more sub-plot that could have been nicely explored was Penelope's brother, James, and his changed attitude.As much as I love Regencies, I really cannot recommend this novel. Perhaps Ms. Bray's other novels are much improved."},{"Title":"A Most Suitable Duchess (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"I really enjoy regency romances. But I have to agree with another reviewer that this book had no substance to it, at all. It started with some original twists to the &quot;marriage for convience&quot; plot, but it never went anywhere. I never felt connected to any of the characters. While the couple is obviously supposed to be slowly falling in love, the author never showed me why they would. They were one demonsional characters. There was no progression that made sense to me. I would not recommend this book. And there were holes in the plot - at one point the husband plans to take the cruel brother to task as soon as they return to Edinbourough, but then he never does. And all of a sudden the brother &quot;hates&quot; his sister - and she never had any problems with him for all her life until the few months of this book - and this antagonism is never satisfactorily explained."},{"Title":"A Most Suitable Duchess (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"&quot;A Most Suitable Duchess&quot; is a pleasant enough read if you're not already familiar with this plot premise, otherwise this novel could be a little disappointing as the authour does not deviate very much from the basic storyline.Marcus Heywood, the new Duke of Torringford, needs to marry before his thirtieth birthday so that he can inherit the fortune left by the previous duke -- he will need this fortune in order to run his newly inherited estates. While drunk, he and his younger brother pen an advertisement for a wife; unfortunately there is a mix-up and the advertisement ends up being printed in all the Edinburgh newspapers. Elsewhere, Penelope Hastings is beginning to realise that she may not be able to continue living with her older brother, James, especially now that he is courting a rather nasty young lady, Amelia Carstairs. Penelope, a bluestocking and (she thinks) a confirmed spinster, has been running James's house for many years now, and lately things have become rather uncomfortable, esp since Amelia has been doing her very best to drive a wedge between James and Penelope. Spitefully, Amelia answers Marcus's advertisement in Penelope's name, and in the ensuing scandal that breaks, Penelope and Marcus come to the realisation that for the sake of both their reputations, they will have to marry. Will a marriage that began in such an ill propitious manner have any chance of flourishing? Can an Edinburgh bluestocking and a country gentleman find enough things in common so as to be able to make a match of things?I'm probably not being very fair to this novel, as it is an extremely well written one. I especially liked the bits that dealt with Penelope and Marcus getting to know each other, finding things that they liked about each other, and coming to grips with running a ducal estate. I thought that both characters were well developed, and I liked the seamless manner in which the novel 'flowed.' It's just that this is s rather popular plot device -- two strangers forced to marry because of circumstances -- and it would have been nice if there had been a few plot twists that would have made this novel a little less run-of-the-mill. All, in all, &quot;A Most Suitable Duchess&quot; is a pleasant enough read, and should satisfy, esp if you can overlook the fact that it does possess a rather over used plot premise."},{"Title":"A Most Suitable Duchess (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"I love the whole marriage of convenience turning into love so I enjoyed this story.I think it was a case of opposite personalities attracting and then eventually falling in love.I would have liked Marcus and Penelope to spend more time together,but their time apart helped them to realize their feelings for each other as their time together helped them to appreciate their differences.I also liked how Penelope handled the servants at the ducal estate when they tried to intimidate her.The author created a rival for Marcus' affections in Steven Wolcott a former beau of Penelope's.His reappearnce helped Penelope to realize her love for Marcus."},{"Title":"A Most Suitable Duchess (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"Although the story line was intriguing, I found the characters half-formed and they failed to capture my interest.

I own almost all of the Agatha Christie/&quot;BBC Radio Presents&quot; dramas, and this one ranks among the best of them, including SAD CYPRESS, DEATH ON THE NILE, and the Miss Marple double feature, 4:50 FROM PADDINGTON and A POCKET FULL OF RYE.This particular Hercule Poirot whodunit has previously been adapted several times -- first as a 1934 British film, under the original title, LORD EDGWARE DIES (1934), released just a year after the debut of the novel.Then came the 1985 American television movie, starring Peter Ustinov as Poirot; Jonathan Cecil as Captain Hastings; David Suchet, the PBS Poirot, as Inspector Japp; and Faye Dunaway.The recent PBS version, reverting to the LORD EDGWARE DIES title, presented Suchet as Poirot -- in a cast that included Dominic Guard and Christopher Guard. This rates as the best screen adaptation to date.But the BBC Radio version, dating from 1992, is sublime. John Moffatt, the perennial Poirot of BBC Radio, again assumes that role. His Captain Hastings is Simon Williams, perhaps best known in America as James in UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS.The one drawback to this audio is that there is no additional cast listing. With all other BBC Radio dramas in the BDD (Bantam Doubleday Dell) series, there's a printed cast list -- and the players are also credited by the announcer at the conclusion of the tape. Not here, alas! And I'd love to know who the other actors are in this superlative production.That omission aside, THIRTEEN AT DINNER is highly recommended for Christie aficionados and radio drama lovers in general.Full disclosure: for the past fourteen years I have worked for an imprint of Random House, which, a year ago, acquired the division that distributes these BBC Radio tapes in the U.S. -- but I was a fan of the Christie series (and other BBC Radio presentations) long before corporate megamerger fused us into one media-monolith family."},{"Title":"13 at Dinner: BBC (BBC Radio Presents)","review":"This typical Agatha Christy novel is one of a kind!

This book showed that the blogosphere, like society, is full of people from all walks of life, and it showed just how useful blogging can be in theworlds of politics, business and culture. Theres a little bit ofsomething for everyone in here.I admit that I skipped a few of the business interviews when I found nothing there for me but if you run a large or smallbusiness Im sure youll find those parts interesting.My personal favorites were the politics and culture essays, especially the interview with Michael Chabons wife Ayelet Waldman. The introductory essays were also good giving a balanced introduction to each of the chapters and all of the commentary pieces pulled from newspapers and magazines were entertaining.The book had a tendency to repeat itself slightly with differentinterviewees saying the same thing in different ways, but I suppose you cant help that when you are interviewing so many different people.On the whole I would say this looks like one of the best books out there on blogging at the moment."},{"Title":"Blog!: How the Newest Media Revolution is Changing Politics, Business, and Culture","review":"David Kline and Dan Burstein have been around for decades as respected author/journalists.

This book is a critical investigation into the many ways that blogging is rapidly changing our world -- from culture to business to science to politics -- and in the arena of such trend-synthesis, the author/editors reek of cred.

One awesome book that is a must read for bloggers is \\"Blog! How the newest revolution is changing politics, business and culture\\" by David Kline and Dan Burstein.It talks of the power and influence of blogs. It uses political examples. Through these examples we can learn what good blogging is (honest, open) and what it is not (poorly written, blatant marketing). It talks about freedom of the press and countries and companies that try to suppress blogs. It also warns and gives examples of blogs that share insider or confidential information and what happens. Most of this advice is just \\"don't be stupid\\".To quote from it:\\"..most people - or at least most of the media's coverage of business issues in blogging - are missing the fact that the real excitement here is not how much money business can make from blogging, but how dramatically blogging will reshape the world of business from top to bottom and create new sources of competitive advantage for firms that learn how to use this new medium intelligently.\\"\\"Bloggers not only tend to be more passionate about their interests and hobbies than other people, they also have marketplace influence far beyond their numbers\\".Much of the book consists of interviews with famous people who blog. It asks their view of the Blogshpere and what is happening.This is a highly inspirational read for anyone who blogs. We live in revolutionary times and as bloggers (and blog readers) we see history being made. We are truly cutting edge. The world is changing before our eyes.As A. J.

While I almost exclusively watch O'Reilly segments through Media Matters for America, I tuned into this particular segment about slanderous websites, because I was interested in hearing O'Reilly spinning reality once again.Kline was a guest, supposedly the balanced guest from the left, who was immediately blown away by the conversation and O'Reilly. How so? Kline couldn't even engage in the conversation, because he had never even heard of Media Matters, the site that O'Reilly focused his vengeance upon.Huh?So I go to Kline's blog and I get involved in a few of his posts. The first is basically an open apology to the left and to bloggers for how he allowed himself to be used and abused by O'Reilly. A ton of people posted comments, with many getting on him for his lack of preparation when appearing on an obvious ambush show.At first glance, I shrugged it off as a poor showing and gave the guy a break. Today, my perspective changed. Why? Go to his site, blogrevolt, and scroll down to the lower right side of the page.

The authors have also interviewed a number of the more famous bloggers or other people analyzing the trend. This variety makes it an extremely useful introduction to the phenomenon. It certainly isn't a gripping read, but the ideas are fascinating. This is not a how-to book, except in the sense of explaining some of the capabilities of the format, and exploring what makes a good or bad blog.Kline and Burstein have a fairly balanced view of blogs, expecting them to be quite significant, but acknowledging that they cannot be expected to creat a new utopia, and that the future is very much still forming. The book is somewhat slanted, but not uncritically, in favor of blogs, perhaps because the authors feel that love them or hate them, they're here to stay. They point out that the purposes of blogging are age-old, although the technology now allows communication on a grand scale.The book acknowledges that most blogs are personal, i.e., intended mainly for friends and family (although still open to public view), but they concentrate on the publically oriented blogs, especially the political and the business.Fortunately, having gotten me all gung ho on reading blogs, the book has appendixes giving guidance to various blogs of great general interest. They also have an blog updating the see future of blogs (see productwiki, below).I recommend this to everyone, especially those who are not currently familiar with blogs."},{"Title":"Blog!: How the Newest Media Revolution is Changing Politics, Business, and Culture","review":"According to one of the greatest scholars of the 20th Century, Dr. Walter J. Ong, SJ, who taught and inspired countless students and media experts for many years at St. Louis University; any new technology starts out in the path of older technologies and gradually finds its place, purpose, rules, and forms as people get used to it.A striking example is the fact that the first cars were basically horse carriages with a motor. Gradually, people learned about aerodynamics and developed more sensible shapes although there is a car out there which I will not name which does look like a perfectly rectangular carriage with a motor, fancy that!Now Prof. Ong did write somewhat about computers but he retired before the Internet became the Web with its accessible, visual format. Now how would he approach Blogging?First, obviously when a reporter or a student starts a blog, he/she has some responsibility to follow journalistic practices just as a student still has to give credit for sources even if it comes from the Internet. Obviously these standards are changing because what a 12-year-old writes in a blog on Madonna ( what a skank!) should not be judged by the same standard as what a reporter writes on her latest relationship (judging by the fallout of her latest adventure, it would appear that Madonna is following the judge-me-or leave me paradigm, blah blah.....)Now as Dr. Ong would point out, blogs and the Internet in general are making great changes in such basic areas as how we learn (many teachers and profs. are terrified of students who can make them look stupid by finding materials on the Internet which directly contradicts the teachers' favorite notions); how we process information; how we communicate and what and how our literature and art operate.BTW, I have spent over 10 years trying to promote discussion topics (or lists, or whatever the site calls them) as a means to improve thinking, feeling, communcation and writing skills in students at whatever level.Why? Because just as is the case with blogs, young people love to have a forum to express their personal ideas, likes, dislikes, preferences etc. They are trying out attitudes, styles, etc. and learn much when they are either praised or blasted for their efforts.However, discussion topics and blogs are still in the Wild-West stage where often anything goes.

The phenomenon of Blogging is metamorphosizing so quickly, that much in this book is getting out of date. If you recall why cable TV had a 'buzz' when it first came out, it was basically for three reasons: a) to offer greater access to production; b)commercial free programming; and c) better quality images. The first two have been co-opted by the cable industry and the third is largely irrelevant thanks to DVD programming (unless you are a sports freak whose idea of ecstasy is to watch emerald green grass in a ball field.

Rider Haggard's classic adventure of treasure seekers in South Africa! King Solomon's Mines is undeniably one of the most exciting and thrilling adventures I've ever had the pleasure of reading, and I reccommend it to all those who yearn for the days of exploration and discovery. Great fun!"},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"As an avid fan of Jules Verne's adventures (AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS, 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA, JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH, FIVE WEEKS IN A BALOON, etc), I was seeking another author who could take me places in my imagination that I had never experienced before. Here is another one of those authors. H. Rider Haggard's classic KING SOLOMON'S MINES is a fun adventure for just about any reader of any age. Though the adventure will be entertaining for an older child or early teen, it also addresses and portrays events of historical and social interest that will appeal to an adult. The British imperialist attitude is portrayed wonderfully in this tale. Also, the racism that goes hand-in-hand with British imperialism is found throughout the book as the native Africans are often treated like children who need to be cared for by the British. Loaded with realism, history, fun and adventure, KING SOLOMON'S MINES is a winner!"},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"I read this book shortly after returning from a six week stay in Africa, so I may have felt a little more enthusiasm for the story than I ordinarily would. Years later, though, I still think it a good tale of adventure, with travel to what was then still an exotic place, and filled with mystery and speculation about lost treasure, just the sorts of things we still enjoy reading today. It's not the best novel I've ever read, but it is better than average. I think it would make a good Christmas or birthday gift."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"Old-school British adventure novel. Well written and exciting, but be warned it uses colonial / imperialist language towards non-Europeans.If you decided to read the book based on seeing the movie with Richard Chamberlain and James Earl Jones, the book seems very different based on what I remember of the movie. Not necessarily better or worse, just a rather different tone and some changes to the plot."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"I read People of the Mist before this one, it is a good story but not as interesting as The People Of The Mist though."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"For the record, I did not READ this book. King Solomon's Mines falls into public domain, and I listened to an audio version of the book that is available for free online. I listened to it while at work where I normally have to listen to bad music, so that may have affected how much I liked it. I won't get into the plot because you can read a description of that somewhere else if you want.That said, the story itself was very fun (think Indiana Jones). There probably isn't enough sex or cursing for those who are used to today's entertainment. However, there are some awkward references to race now and again, that many would consider racist today. For the record, I do not think the book is racist. The main character, at the beginning of the story, says he does not like or use the \\"n\\" word. And frankly, if you turn around the statements in the book made about blacks (the book takes place in Africa) and made similar references to white people, many would consider it funny today. So, all in all, it really isn't a big deal, and the offensive racial commentary occurs probably less than a dozen times. Not to mention, there are several African characters portrayed in positive light and even an interracial love interest.You should definitely give this book a shot if you like adventures. The book is a part of history - the first fiction novel written in English to take place in Africa and the first of the \\"lost world\\" genre. That's what Wikipedia says anyway and it is part of what got me interested in the book. Have fun reading/listening!"},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"There is a lot to recommend in this archetypical adventure story. A lost treasure traced back to Biblical times; 19th century adventurers venturing into the heart of an unexplored Africa; an author knowledgeable and respectful of Africa and its native peoples; and a cast of interesting characters- some likeable, some not- balanced out by its rational and levelheaded narrator, Allan Quatermain. Author Haggard even goes out of his way in the first chapter to use the 'n' word in reference to the natives- a common occurrence in all literature of this era- only to apologize for using such a derogatory term and to promise never to use it again. (This coming from an author writing in the late 1800s!)For all the ingenius plot devices and well-intentioned writing of its author, however, \\"King Solomon's Mines\\" unfortunately gets bogged down in a cumbersome plot detour that detracts from the \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" sense of adventure with which it starts. The first third of the story involves Quatermain and his crew daring to cross a desiccated desert and braving the harsh weather of Africa's highest peaks in an effort to find a road that may not even exist. On the verge of death several times, they eventually find the road they seek and stumble upon an African village located in the remote mountain pass. It is here where the story gets bogged down, as Quatermain and Company get involved in tribal politics and eventually help lead a revolution against the cruel king. Despite taking up close to a third of the book, this entire section feels like it belongs to another story and interrupts the suspense and adrenaline created by the quest for King Solomon's Mines.Haggard does eventually return to the quest story and Quatermain and his fellow diamond seekers do get a chance to search for the lost treasure but not after the story has lost quite a bit of steam. The final chapters do have their share of excitement and adventure but not without some sense of disappointment at what more may have been.This story should have had more- more daring, more suffering, more of the mysterious tone that Haggard uses so effectively in the early chapters to draw the reader in. It is still a good book, but ultimately falls short because of the middle third."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"Much of the story seems trite to a 21st century reader because its major plot points have been copied so many times in modern movies and books. For example, I was groaning when the main characters realized they could impress their captors by predicting the sky would grow dark -- i.e., solar eclipse would occur, and they had an almanac to tell them when. How many times has this trick been used? Regardless, the book is a great read, and one has to give credit to Haggard for creating so many enduring concepts. It's fast-paced and very hard to put down.An interesting side note is how harsh Haggard (via the characters) was in his treatment of black Africans as well as animals, but I suppose that was commonplace for the era when the book was written. For example, the characters don't have any qualms about slaughtering any elephant for its ivory, and they treat the locals as clearly inferior, using terms for them that today would be extremely offensive in southern Africa."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"King Solomon's Mines was a great book! It was really exciting and i enjoyed it a lot. This story was about these three men who went out into the desert on a journey to find the mines of king solomon that were filled with treasure and the lost brother of one of the people in the group. The party was made up of a man named Sir Henry Curtis (the one looking for his brother), Good and sailor, Umbopa a Zulu servant, and Quatermain the main character and narrator of the story. These men set out on a long journey through the desert, over the mountains and to the long lost treasure caves. Along the way they lost several memebers of the party they began with and all almost died from lack of food and water but in the end they did find the treasure. though it took much more than they had every imagined. They also found the man's brother and the true king of the native tribe they ran accross on the journey. This was a very good book if you like the &quot;treasure hunt&quot; type of stories and i highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"Surely a classic, this was Haggard's first foray into the literary field -- to prove he could do it better than some of his contemporaries. Having spent time in South Africa as a minor civil servant, he drew on his experiences of that land to impart a feel for the country in this short, but by no means small, tale of treasure hunting &amp; adventure among unknown &amp; exotic peoples. This is the story of an over the hill &quot;white hunter&quot; impressed into the service of two English gentlemen seeking the brother of one who had disappeared years before on the edge of a great desert in vain (or perhaps not so vain) pursuit of the fabled mines of King Solomon. Along the way they are joined by an enigmatic native guide who is much more than what he seems as they stumble across previously unexplored (@ least by Europeans) tracts of Africa &amp; into a lost nation related, apparently, to the Zulus of southern Africa whom the English of that day so feared &amp; respected. Drawn at once into the internal politics of these people &amp; overawing them w/their European tricks, they are soon in deadly peril from the the cruel king of that country and the evil sorceress who conspires behind his throne. But there's no use telling too much of a tale like this in a review -- the interested reader is urged to read it for him or herself. It's quick &amp; exciting &amp; no more than what it seems: a fast paced adventure in strange parts, for those w/a taste to see how the great ones, like Haggard, did it. -- Stuart W.

I really love those swashbuckling adventure stories like The Prisoner of Zenda, Scaramouche, and The Scarlet Pimpernel, but it's really difficult to find books like those which have managed to age really well. Fortunately, I have now happened onto another which I can return to.King Solomon's Mines is the story of Sir Henry Curtis, Captain John Good and the narrator, Allan Quatermain. Curtis's younger brother has recently disappeared in Southern Africa in search of King Solomon's legendary mines. He is very worried, and he engages Good and Quatermain, a hunter, to help him find his brother. The three hire an African, Umbopa, to travel with them and they set out. What follows is there always exciting adventure in which they confront an tyrant king and an evil, sort-of-immortal woman (that will make sense after reading). The novel has just about everything - adventure, women, evil villains, humor, mixed identities, treasure, and an exotic local. It's entertaining stuff.There's not much to complain about in King Solomon's Mines. The pace is quick. There is a lot of action and humor. I was very pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn't dated. The language isn't archaic and the jokes are still funny. The novel, first published in 1885, won't even offend by being overtly politically incorrect like many novels of that time. Really, this is a totally worthy read for anyone who likes a good adventure."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"This review covers only the Gateway Movie Classics edition, softcover, 1999.What a thrill to revisit this gripping story that I enjoyed in childhood so much. Good writing, excellent story-telling, if you're not too squeamish to tolerate late 19th century colonialist literature.But skip this edition. Mainly because of the numerous typos scattered inanely through the book...periods dropped into the middle of sentences, rogue exclamation points, and words inaccurately transcribed as though an original text had been OCR scanned without any professional quality checking. Inexusable in a professional publication. And, frankly, I don't think the movie is all that great, so the cover photo of a film version Quatermain doesn't do much for me.Get another edition!"},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"I was required to read King Solomon's Mines at school (about three thousand years ago), and was delighted to see that there's a new edition in the Oxford World's Classics series. And indeed this is a true classic adventure, somewhere between Treasure Island and Around The World in Eighty Days. Though some of the language may now seem a little stereotyped and cliched, it was certainly not that way when it was written over 100 years ago, and the real cliches are resident with modern imitations, like Indiana Jones. However, since imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, I guess we shouldn't complain.Sir Henry Rider Haggard (1856-1925) is best known for his African adventure novels, notably King Solomon's Mines and She (1886). Their strengths are that they are not only undeniably amongst the most exciting and thrilling adventures ever written, but that they capture the very essence of the colonial empires - an attitude that is stubbornly maintained today by American imperialism - of treating the natives fondly, but with a certain superiority and disdain.The essence of the story is the adventure of an elephant hunter as his safari heads into the interior of South Africa in search of a fabled diamond mine, and to rescue the missing brother of an English gentleman who accompanies him. They are aided by an enigmatic native guide who is more than he seems. As they stumble into Zulu territory, they are drawn into the local politics and discover that their European methods are less effective here, and that they need to learn new tricks. Quickly, they find themselves in deadly peril from a merciless king and a malevolence sorceress who conspires against them.In the end, King Solomon's Mines is more than just the sum of all its parts because Haggard's intelligent and observant characterizations give him the opportunity to put together a revealing social commentary about race and class, while still telling a captivating story. Against the conventional wisdom of the time, Haggard treats his black characters sympathetically, and even dares to suggest that English society might be less than perfect (an audacious heresy in Victoria's reign). So, like Gulliver's Travels, King Solomon's Mines not only tells a great adventure story, it leaves the reader with something more robust to think about."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"Haggard is a master of visual scenery in the novel.The book starts off rather slow, but picks up nicely and is an excellent story with nice twists and fantastic characters. The battle scenes are written extraordinarily well, which is difficult to do on paper. There is much excitement throughout.The evil in the book is a little strong for my taste, so I wouldn't recommend this book for young readers only for that reason. But it makes for a great ending when the evil is conquered."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"Within the pages of this novel is a tale of legend, treasure, adventure, friendship and warfare. H. Ridder Haggard twines all these components together in an intriguing fashion. Making it so close to reality that it seems likely to have happend long ago. The character, Alan Quatermain retells the journey taken in deep Africa with his comrades, reflecting on the irony of their many precarious situations. What I liked most was his observations of life and the matter-of-fact truth in it. How the characters were drawn to contemplate the value of life and what makes it worth living. Their quest does turn gruesome at points. But the author provides some very clever solutions to their perils, which sometimes are quite humorous.The last five chapters are the highlight of the book. These climaxes are expertly written and will keep you reading till the very end. The first few pages might seem confusing, but it makes perfect sense when reading it thru the second time. King Solomon's Mines is a novel with riveting, good vs. evil character development and it is a worthwhile read. I recommend it to anyone who likes a first-rate adventure.Out of all the different publications to choose from, I say consider a copy from Regnery Publishing, Inc. ... 1999. For it has an easy to read layout and print. It also has numerous typos and makes me wonder if that isn't directly from the 1885 original. Other than that, the book has a nice introduction to the author and his works. Giving some Hollywood film history of King Solomon's Mines along with other interesting notes. This really opens up the story to the reader, and makes it a memorable one."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"This book is still amazingly fun from something written in the 1800's. The Kindle's dictionary was quite helpful. Some of the words are little used today and the ability to do a quick lookup kept me reading at a fast pace!"},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"The concept of a swashbucking adventure where the heroes escape death at the hands of threatening natives by appealing to an eclipse as evidence of their divine power over the sun and moon is hardly a new one. But to my knowledge, in \\"King Solomon's Mines\\" Henry Rider Haggard (1856-1925) offers no clone of this legend. He offers the original idea that spawned the copies. Haggard's story is such a good one, it's not hard to see why it's been often imitated and reworked with varying degrees of success. Here's a case where you should read the original and find out where all the cliches came from.The story-line is full of adventure, revolving around the journey of three Englishman accompanied with a native into the heart of Africa. They are in search of king Solomon's legendary treasure of diamonds, a lost brother, and adventure. The prospect of buried treasure is an age-old theme that arouses excitement today as it did in Haggard's day, and is combined with Haggard's contemporary fascination with the mysteries of Africa. Haggard employs Allan Quatermain as his narrator. Quatermain is far from the bravest of characters, and his sense of fear adds to the tension in times of conflict. His companions, however, are bolder: the native Umbopa and the Englishmen Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good.The first part of the story is somewhat slow, relating the preparations for their adventure, as they venture into the desert wilderness and face the elements. But persevere through the desert, because if you can make it through the perils of the dry desert with Quartermain and company, even greater adventures lie on the other side. The area where Solomon's legendary treasure is hidden is inhabited by a lost civilization of primitive and barbarian natives, ruled by an evil leader who proves to be a usurper. King Twala and his sorceress are not too quickly persuaded by the marvels of European technology. In the style of typical colonistic arrogance, Haggard ensures that his characters survive by pretending to be gods from the stars, their credentials including the use of guns, Good's false teeth, half shaved face, and white legs (the result of which being that Good has to continue walking around without trousers to preserve his image, offering delightful comic relief!). In the process important questions about colonization are raised, for many of Haggard's contemporaries viewed Africa as a paradise inhabited by barbarians, whose wealth could freely taken over by the \\"superior\\" European colonists.The identity of the rightful king turns out to be rather surprising, and the adventurers pledge to help him overthrow the usurper Twala. It is at this point that they call on a lunar eclipse to escape death by the skin of their teeth. Several battle scenes ensure, with truth and justice prevailing. Even though there seems to be some misplaced colonistic arrogance typical of the time, Haggard shows sympathy for the blacks by having his adventurers establish an indigenous government. More importantly, he shows the follow of paganism and defends important virtues such as justice and truth. The cause that the adventurers fight for is to overcome evil and maintain a proper king who defends justice, a king with Messianic overtones, and with virtues worth pursuing in our own lives. Their zeal for the right cause is unforgettable: \\"Never before had I seen such an absolute devotion to the idea of duty, and such a complete indifference to its bitter fruits.\\" (p198)Only then does the diamond hunt continue, but when the elusive treasure trove is finally discovered, the adventurers find themselves trapped, giving new meaning to the expression \\"Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.\\" (p258). The irony of being buried with immense wealth is carefully portrayed: \\"There around us lay treasures enough to pay off a moderate national debt, or to build a fleet of ironclads, and yet we would gladly have bartered them all for the faintest chance of escape ... Truly wealth, which men spend all their lives in acquiring, is a valueless thing at the last.\\" (p262). At the resolution, the adventurers have a renewed perspective on wealth \\"Oh! hang the diamonds! I hope that I may never see another.\\" (p267).It is ironic that at the outset the adventures left in search of wealth, but they return in the end with the wisdom that wealth is valueless. They have learned the lesson of Solomon, who was offered wealth by God, but instead correctly chose wisdom (1 Kings 3). By journeying to Solomon's Mines in search of treasure, both adventurers and readers return with the treasure of wisdom, and learn something about the fleeting value of earthly wealth. So although this is a great adventure novel, it isn't only about adventure. Even if you return from King Solomon's Mines without Solomon's diamonds, you may return with some of Solomon's wisdom. And read a great adventure story in the process."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"A classic adventure tale, this 19th century novel surely must have been a template for the Indiana Jones movies a century later. It is told in a straight-forward and easy-to-read narrative by the elephant hunter, Quatermain. Briefly, it tells the tale of three Brits (Quatermain, Henry Curtis, and John Good) and their quest for the legendary treasure of King Solomon and Curtis's lost brother in the South African savannah of the 1890s.H. Rider Haggard paints vivid scenes with his literary prose. The imagery and scenery afforded to the reader is as good as any in a movie, if the reader has even the least bit of imagination. From their harrowing trek across a scorching desert and snow-capped mountains, to their decisive battle in the Kukualand civil war, Haggard masterly paints a vivid picture. Although there are a few things that seem to stretch the pale of believability, the occurrence of a once-in-a-lifetime lunar eclipse comes to mind, the tale is well-told and credible, in context. The only thing this story lacks is character development, as there is none to speak of, save for John Good's brief and tragic romance with an African.For the PC crowd, this novel is pretty high on the Offend-O-Meter. The native Africans are constantly referred to as ignorant \\"savages\\" and they are held in low regard to the native European colonists. The hero of the story is an elephant ivory hunter who kills for money, as well as mere pleasure. Plus, the romance between John Good and a native African is considered impossible and a \\"complication\\". But, hey, this book was written in the 1880's and, with that perspective, these can all be dismissed as relics of an earlier time.All-in-all, I would highly recommend this book for a light and easy read. There are no complex subplot developments and no deep philosophical ideas to ponder, but it is an entertaining adventure story."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"H Rider Haggard's Allan Quatermain is a man who has been\\"trading, hunting, fighting, and mining\\" for most of his 55 years. Writing in the first person as Quatermain, Haggard goes on to tell that one of the major reasons that this book is being written is because he needed to spend some time recovering from a leg injury sustained while shooting his (no kidding) 66th lion. Nevertheless he calls himself a timid man.The adventure starts when Quatermain meets Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good. Sir Henry's brother disappeared in Kukuanaland searching for King Solomon's mines. Off go the adventurers along the African Umbopa. They engage in an elephant hunt, nearly die of thirst in the desert, nearly freeze to death on the mountains, and nearly get killed in a massive civil war in Kukuanaland where 20,000 Africans die. After all of this they finally make it to King Solomon's mines which is guarded by pillars... stalagmites created by limestone and water dripping upon the corpses of kings of Kukuanaland. And then the evil old witch (doctor) Gagool seals them in. Don't worry. The story doesn't end there.If you're looking for the character played by Sharon Stone, \\"there's not a petticoat in the whole history,\\" says Quatermain.

This one is a classic, no, the classic.To get the full worth from this book, you must transport yourself back to 1895 or whenever this story was written, when Africa was unexplored, when gentlemen were gentlemen and savages were savages. Yes, it's very un-PC, but that's the price you must pay. Remember, you are reading the first adventure stories, at the time of your G-G-G-G-great grandfather.Cons-The prose is very old fashioned, and is somewhat difficult to read, you must read it slowly as it's so different from modern books. And like one of the reviewers said, \\"it's full of cliches\\" because it has been copied so many times. It reminds me of part about the eclipse, apart from HRH, I've also seen it used in an Enid Blyton book, and a Tintin book, surely HRH was the first to use it, but not the last.I first read this book in the 60's before the plethora of modern adventure stories, so I don't know if any modern reader will get as much out of it as I did, but give it a chance."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"This vigorous novel was written by an imaginative writer, H.

Quatermain is a great role model."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"&quot;King Solomon's Mines&quot; was published in 1885, when the interior of Africa was still an unexplored, &quot;dark&quot; continent; thus, it was the first book to present the possibility of adventure in Africa to the European reading public. Riding on the tails of Robert Louis Stevenson's &quot;Treasure Island,&quot; &quot;King Solomon's Mines&quot; made H. Rider Haggard famous. Much of what Haggard writes is based on his personal experience and observations in South Africa, where, unusual among the British colonizers, he learned Zulu, which gave him an insight lacking in his colleagues and contemporaries.Although on the surface an adventure story for young boys, &quot;King Solomon's Mines&quot; raises interesting questions about the role of the colonists and their relationship with the African people on the eve of the great European scramble for Africa. Like the elephants that Quatermain and his group hunt and shoot down simply because they are there for the picking, so Africa and its riches presented itself to the Europeans as rich for exploitation. The question of &quot;What is a gentleman?&quot; runs throughout the narrative, leaving the European reader to discern whether Africans possessed a nobility and dignity comparable to the ancient Greeks and Biblical Hebrews. Haggard depicts the Zulu language as comparable to the richly metaphoric Old and Middle English languages.&quot;King Solomon's Mines&quot; gives us a glimpse into a way of life that was shortly to disappear with the arrival of the Europeans."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"I picked up Haggard's \\"King Solomon's Mines\\" to read on the train, knowing that it would be entertaining, and I wasn't disappointed. Moving quickly but without forsaking the kinds of detailed narration that bring a story to life, Haggard's novel is an engaging treasure hunt of the Indiana Jones variety.The book is styled as a long chronicle written by safari-leader Allan Quatermain to his son, describing a hunt for the lost diamond mines of King Solomon in the heart of Africa. Haggard peppers the tale with nods to real life that go out of their way to convince us that everything we are reading is true--editorial comments purportedly added later, for example--and the result is a compellingly detailed read. It is clear that Haggard knew Africa well, and his framing of this knowledge within a focused and nicely spun-out plot pulls you right through the book to its climactic finale, which I should probably allow you, after you've traipsed across deserts and tamed native unrest with the narrator and his companions, to discover for yourself.So, \\"King Solomon's Mines\\" is a well-constructed read, but another of its strong points, the humor that is so central to the story, forces a look at the bigger context. Haggard takes solid jokes (like Good's pasty white legs, for which he is assumed to be a god by the natives) and, like David Letterman, returns to them at intervals in a manner that always uses them in a new way but lets the reader think that he or she is on the inside, slyly being chucked on the shoulder by the narrator.It's this penchant for humor that gets a little uncomfortable once you think about it, because you can't help but compare Haggard's novel here to another journey to the center of Africa written two decades later, Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness,\\" which is conspicuously devoid of laughter unless it's the very evil kind. Haggard's novel is immensely entertaining--I don't want to deny that for a second--but it glosses over some very real problems that Conrad is more careful about: imperialism and its disastrous universe of consequences.I probably shouldn't stand in judgment of Haggard for his take on and his playing to the racial politics of his day, but I'm going to do it anyway because Haggard was, in his day, one of the most widely read writers writing. Adventures like \\"King Solomon's Mines\\" set the bar for the British male for decades and, if it taught him to be a gentleman and fair-player, it also grounded this ethos in the belief that he was superior both socially and racially. Thus is it the gentlemanly westerners who manage to import due process into African law in this novel, and thus does Captain Good's native love-interest ultimately recuse herself from his affections because, as a white man, he is like the sun. And what can possibly be good enough to mate with the sun?, she asks. Disturbing, in retrospect.This gripping adventure story gets four stars by virtue of its great plot and skillful spinning-out of that plot. It misses the fifth star because it buys wholeheartedly into the myths on which centuries of imperial violence were founded. And no matter how enjoyable this novel is, it's hard to chase those ghosts away."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"When the film RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was released in 1981, more than one commentator observed that its hero owed much to another fictional adventurer introduced almost a century before: Allan Quartermain, the creation of Victorian novelist H. Rider Haggard. (And that the actor who later played Indiana Jones's father would go on to interpret his other 'father' as well creates a sort of symmetry.) It is worth noting, however, that in KING SOLOMON'S MINES, the first of 16 novels and numerous short-stories to feature him, Quartermain appears as a small man in his mid-fifties, with false teeth and a bad leg, who seems to take pride in regularly declaring himself a coward. The Jones comparisons owe more to later, adjusted depictions of Haggard's protagonist in both print and performance.The modern reader may also find discomforting the cultural and racial condescension (at best) which the character expresses as a British imperialist in southern Africa. Careful attention to the unfolding story, however, suggests that the author, if hardly immune to the prejudices of his day, sensed something of their fallacy. His native African people gradually emerge as fully developed, and fully human, individuals -- capable not only of either great nobility, wisdom, and intelligence or wretched evil, but of a complete spectrum of intermediate humours. Quartermain himself undergoes a broadening of outlook through his experience, so that for a while at least he comes to address (and perhaps truly to regard) as equals people he had previously felt should 'know their place'. Later, reflecting on his adventures, he recoils at old pejoratives which still habitually turn up in his vocabulary, and he writes to his son, 'What is a gentleman? ... I've known natives who ARE, and ... mean whites with lots of money and fresh out from home, too, who ARE NOT.' Given the period in which Haggard was himself writing, this is a remarkable insight.Still, it is a mistake to read the novel as an early parable on social conscience. The author's purpose was simply to compose a rousing tale of 'derring-do' in the spirit of Stevenson's TREASURE ISLAND, and in this he achieved adequate success. That he also provides a contemporary glimpse into the absurdities and injustices of a bygone era is a bonus he probably never foresaw."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"As a kid I loved this book. The story was an amazing story with wonderful characters. In a way the story was suspenful because of the standoffs between different characters."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"A classic adventure tale, this 19th century novel surely must have been a template for the Indiana Jones movies a century later. It is told in a straight-forward and easy-to-read narrative by the elephant hunter, Quatermain. Briefly, it tells the tale of three Brits (Quatermain, Henry Curtis, and John Good) and their quest for the legendary treasure of King Solomon and Curtis's lost brother in the South African savannah of the 1890s.H. Rider Haggard paints vivid scenes with his literary prose. The imagery and scenery afforded to the reader is as good as any in a movie, if the reader has even the least bit of imagination. From their harrowing trek across a scorching desert and snow-capped mountains, to their decisive battle in the Kukualand civil war, Haggard masterly paints a vivid picture. Although there are a few things that seem to stretch the pale of believability, the occurrence of a once-in-a-lifetime lunar eclipse comes to mind, the tale is well-told and credible, in context. The only thing this story lacks is character development, as there is none to speak of, save for John Good's brief and tragic romance with an African.For the PC crowd, this novel is pretty high on the Offend-O-Meter. The native Africans are constantly referred to as ignorant \\"savages\\" and they are held in low regard to the native European colonists. The hero of the story is an elephant ivory hunter who kills for money, as well as mere pleasure. Plus, the romance between John Good and a native African is considered impossible and a \\"complication\\". But, hey, this book was written in the 1880's and, with that perspective, these can all be dismissed as relics of an earlier time.All-in-all, I would highly recommend this book for a light and easy read. There are no complex subplot developments and no deep philosophical ideas to ponder, but it is an entertaining adventure story."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"H Rider Haggard's Allan Quatermain is a man who has been\\"trading, hunting, fighting, and mining\\" for most of his 55 years. Writing in the first person as Quatermain, Haggard goes on to tell that one of the major reasons that this book is being written is because he needed to spend some time recovering from a leg injury sustained while shooting his (no kidding) 66th lion. Nevertheless he calls himself a timid man.The adventure starts when Quatermain meets Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good. Sir Henry's brother disappeared in Kukuanaland searching for King Solomon's mines. Off go the adventurers along the African Umbopa. They engage in an elephant hunt, nearly die of thirst in the desert, nearly freeze to death on the mountains, and nearly get killed in a massive civil war in Kukuanaland where 20,000 Africans die. After all of this they finally make it to King Solomon's mines which is guarded by pillars... stalagmites created by limestone and water dripping upon the corpses of kings of Kukuanaland. And then the evil old witch (doctor) Gagool seals them in. Don't worry. The story doesn't end there.If you're looking for the character played by Sharon Stone, \\"there's not a petticoat in the whole history,\\" says Quatermain. If you're looking for the Sean Connery character in \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,\\" he isn't in this book other than by name. If you're looking for a classic adventure, this is the place."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"King Solomons Mines is really interesting Novel.This book's about three Men who embark on a great expadition to find the lost treasure of King Solomon. these men must travel through burning hot deserts and steamy wet jugles, freezing moutains defeat an African tride and a witches curse. they must go through all this just to fine the lost treasure of King Solomon. This book was a real page turner it will really dazzle you. I highly recomend this book to anyone"},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"This book is the perfect adventure of Victorian derring-do and is faultless as an example of the genre. Many of the storyline tricks that have been used many times over by more recent authors come from this classic story. Most readers also learn a good deal about an intelligent Victorian gentlemen's view of Africa. Haggard himself was involved intimately with African imperialism (having personally hauled up the Union Flag annexing the Transvaal in the late 1870s) and he writes about what he knows. Although his characters are to some extent typical adventure story heroes (don't look for a tortured inner life, or complicated ethics) they ring true, and in fact they can be considered to be archetypes of \\"good\\" imperialists. The Africans are depicted in a convincing fashion - with good and bad attributes and the two monsters of Twala and Gagool are splendid creations. Clearly Kukuanaland is a kind of Zululand or Matabeleland gone even more extreme and Twala seems to be based on a sort of distorted Chaka (the famous Zulu king c.1830s), but this is precisely what makes this story so real and gripping. The only other story that I think approaches this is written by a finer writer (Kipling) and is based on the imperial adventure in India: The Man Who Would be King. Alas and alack though there has never been a film version of King Solomon's Mines that even approaches the power of the novel, unlike The Man Who Would be King that was so brilliantly presented for the screen by John Houston."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"I'm sure the other reviews cover much of the book's plot, so let me just get to the meat of the reason I loved this book. ADVENTURE and ACTION! DIAMOND MINES and BATTLES! This is the book that millions of others try to copy. A journey into a desert, into a remote part of Africa, searching for a lost brother and a legend. Mystery and magic adds spice to what is, already, a perfect story.Mr. Haggard knew what boys, both young and old, want in a story."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"H. Rider Haggard's \\"King Solomon's Mines\\" is at once a ripping adventure yarn and a celebration of Victorian values. The book - the first of the \\"Lost World\\" genre - features at trio of English adventurers: the elephant hunter Allan Quatermain, an aristocrat Sir Henry Curtis and his companion Captain Good. Curtis wants to find his brother who was last seen leaving to find the mine of the title.Curtis is a shining example of the aristocracy - brave and virtuous - a knight in every sense of the word. Good and Quatermain are also fine Englishment who know their place. Haggard was certainly in favour of the established order. To modern eyes the book is incredibly racist and misogynistic but compared to other literature of the time is positively progressive.You can certainly see where the inspiration for \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" came from."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"I first became aware of the story from the movie of the same name starring Stewart Granger and Deborah Kerr. I loved the movie when I was a kid, enjoyed it as an adult, but I had never read the book.The original story is largely represented in the screenplay, except there is no woman corresponding to Deborah Kerr's character. The book is a guy's-only adventure, with some notable supporting parts near the end for a witch and for Foulata, a lovely Kukuana girl. The story is told in the first person by Allan Quartermain, the elephant hunter. It depicts what I take to be a Western stereotype of what sub-Saharan Africa was like in the 19th Century, with its colonial presuppositions. (The original copyright date is 1898.) Nevertheless, some of the African characters (Umbopa and Ignosi) are well-developed and favorably depicted. Yet today we would cringe at the wasteful killing elephants described in the book.No-one would mistake this for great literature. It is similar in genre to Zane Grey's novels or more modern novels written by Alistair MacLean. You read the book to enjoy the trip and not for ideas that you will be pondering deeply long after you have finished. The action is briskly paced, yet we do see character development as well. I rated the book as high as a did because it is an excellent example of this particular genre."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"They just don't write adventure stories like they used to. Actually, I don't even know if it would qualify as a genre anymore, though certainly the tales still exist. The old stories had their flaws: they could be overly melodramatic and often have at least a touch of political incorrectness (if downright racism and/or sexism), but if you could look beyond these problems (which were more a product of the time than the exception), these books could be fun.H. Rider Haggard's novel King Solomon's Mines fits well into this category. The most famous of Haggard's tales (followed by She), King Solomon's Mines is the first tale of hunter Allan Quartermain who is recruited by Sir Henry Curtis to find King Solomon's Mines. Curtis is looking for his long lost brother who disappeared while seeking the legendary place. Quartermain hires on, and soon the pair, plus Curtis's friend Captain Good and a mysterious native named Umbopa are beginning their trek.The book has three basic parts. The first portion deals with the dangerous excursion to a mountain range called the Suliman Berg. Beyond this range is a valley with the large Kukuana tribe. Their interaction with this tribe is the second part of the story. The final part deals with the actual treasure hunt and discovery of the mine.Although Haggard's views on race were slightly more progressive than some of his contemporaries, this book does have its moments that may offend some people. But, as I said before, if you can look past that aspect, you will find that this is a pleasant read that, though well over a century old, reads as easily as a modern story."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"I was going to write something similar to what Ryan Lynd did -- this Kindle edition is marred by question marks in place of characters such as &ouml;, , and so on. But let's not get too upset; it's not as though these characters turn up more than a couple dozen times in the whole book. I didn't think it ruined the reading experience, just caused the occasional bump in the road. After reading this I spent $1.99 on the Halcyon Classics Allen Quatermain collection (Kindle edition) to get this and 14 other works -- complete with &ouml; and . Better, and very very cheap, but if you want just King Solomon's Mines and you want it free, this is very acceptable."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"King Solomon's Mines by H. Rider Haggard is a novel first published 1885. This novel is the first to feature adventurer Alan Quatermain.The adventurer and white Hunter Alan Quatermain is approached by Sir Henry Curtis and his friend Captain Good to lead an expedition into the heart of Africa to find Curtis' brother. The brother was in search of the fabled King Solomon's Mines.Quatermain, who is in a possession of a map to the mines which he never taken seriously, agrees to go but don't think they'll return alive. The adventurers brave heat, cold, dessert and jungle on their arduous journey.King Solomon's Mines by H. Rider Haggard is an easy to read, fast paced and light read. The important thing to remember when reading books such as this is not to take them too seriously.This is a simple tale, filled with swashbuckling adventures and explorations galore. Some of the book simply drags, other parts are offensive in today's terms (which I don't hold it against the book) and some parts are simply funny. I especially found the pompous attitude of some of the characters (mostly Quatermain) hilarious.\\"\\"How is it, O strangers,\\" asked the old man solemnly, \\"that this fat man (pointing to Good, who was clad in nothing but boots and a flannel shirt, and has only half finished his shaving), whose body is clothed, and whose legs are bare, who grows hair on one side of his sickly face and not on the other, and who wears one shining and transparent eye- how is it, I ask, that he has teeth which move of themselves, coming away from the jaws and returning of their own will?\\"Haggard's tale is certainly written to target the Britain of the times, colonial is big, Africans are belittled and the white hunter is all but god among men. Many other adventure stories, sans the racism, have used this formula where the hero can overcome any odds and still keep a good attitude and calm disposition.Haggard goes into great details about which supplies Quatermain and his crew took on their adventures, including the type of wagons and even immunizing cattle. I couldn't decided if these were simply tedious details to ensure some semblance of authentic or just sheer bragging of the author.This is not a book for politically correct minded people, the protagonist's description of Africans and animals usually has a negative connotation to them. Quatermain continually dismisses the native population as beneath him and/or other Europeans. As this is not unexpected, it is still somewhat amusing to read how people thought a few decades ago.The book's premise is that Quatermain is telling this story to his son - some sort of a fireside story. While it's a nice introduction, it does of course ruins the mystery of whether or not he will survive.The characterization in the novel is not much to write about (pun intended). Quatermain really never comes alive, the rest of the characters are two dimensional cardboard mannequins which play up to the stereotypes of the time. For such an adventurer, Alan Quatermain lacks the inspiration which so many real explorers have, and use to their advantage to raise funds and lead parties through hardships.Overall, this is a fun book which cannot be taken too seriously. While I didn't think the novel stood the test of time, I'm certainly glad I read it."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"I grew up on the movie so it was quite a shocker to read the book. As stated in the beginning there are no petticoated women in this book. It is a men's adventure written by a man for men. You can not miss the hand of H. Rider Haggard as he has a unique sense of humor that pops up at the strangest times. He may be a little verbose but every word has a use. And as with written stories this one is much more intricate than the movie adaptations. You will find many assumptions of the time such as any complex construction must have been built by white people and natives on their own may turn savage.The story is told first person by Allan Quartermain. Nevil is off to make his fortune by finding King Solomon's lost diamond mines. Allan sends him a 300 year old map to help. This is the last anyone heard from Nevil. Turns out that Nevil is really the estranged brother of Henry Curtis. Sir Henry Curtis now wants to make amends and he with his friend Captain John Good, bribe Allan Quartermain to take them across an endless desert and trough impassible mountains to an adventure that will hold you to the very end. Along with them is their self imposed helper Umbopa who carries a secret of his own.If you get a chance also hear the recording, an added plus is narration by John Richmond; He brings the characters to life and adds to the mystique that this story has been passed down.If you cannot find a copy of the John Richmond, recording you can use the Kindle 2 text-to speak. It is not as smooth but it is functional.King Solomon's Mines Starring: Deborah Kerr, Stewart Granger"},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"This is a Victorian era novel of adventure in unexplored Africa. The plot centers on the search for a lost diamond mine, but contains daring treks through the wilderness, a civil war among African natives, and colorful descriptions of the landscape and people of Africa. This book represents the definition of the romantic image of the Age of Exploration during the Victorian era: intrepid explorers heading off into the wilds in search of fame and fortune. Several movies have been based on this book (and subsequent Haggard stories about Alain Quatermain), and the character Indiana Jones was based largely on Haggard's Quatermain. None of these films have manged to the capture flavor of Haggard's book on the big screen. If you liked the movie King Solomon's Mines with Stewart Granger and Deborah Kerr (undoubtedly the best of all the films), you will probably like this book even more. The main drawback of this book (at least for 21st century readers) is Haggard's subtle and not-so-subtle racism. The native Africans are at best noble savages, and often Haggard considers them to be much less. I've read elsewhere that Haggard wrote this after having read Treasure Island. He supposedly felt that he could write a better adventure story. This is the first of his twenty or so novels written at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. If true, he succeeded.

Yes, it's very un-PC, but that's the price you must pay. Remember, you are reading the first adventure stories, at the time of your G-G-G-G-great grandfather.Cons-The prose is very old fashioned, and is somewhat difficult to read, you must read it slowly as it's so different from modern books.

Our hero, Quatermain, remembers sending the missing man a message that might lead to an ancient treasure. The reasoning is simple - find the treasure, and we'll find the prodigal.Of course, it's never that simple, is it?Our intrepid Englishmen dance the white man's burden to the tune of Bwana and Sahib all the way into ne plus ultra, fight in a tribal war, find (and lose) pure love, set a rightful king on a throne, and come away with a pocketful of diamonds.

Good read!"},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"Every so often I get the feeling that a good old timey adventure book would be a good thing to read. This is (hopefully) the last time I think this as the results are always dire. Conan Doyle's \\"The Lost World\\" was one hell of a struggle. Chesterton's \\"The Man Who Was Thursday\\" was dreadful. However, Rider Haggard's \\"King Solomon's Mines\\" takes the prize for most unreadable load of old toss ever.3 Englishmen ponce into Africa on a treasure hunt. They cross romantic terrain, shoot majestic animals, patronise and insult black people, before leaving with a few pocketfuls of giant diamonds back to Blighty. What ho!Sounds a bit of a lark, what? It's not. First off, Haggard has his hero Quatermain say in the first chapter that they went to Africa, did this, did that, and made it back home with the treasure. Oh great, now I'm really on the edge of my seat. Now when Quatermain and chums are in danger and the chapter ends on a \\"cliffhanger\\" (by Victorian standards) I'll know that they make it out because this was explained in the first chapter!Also, Haggard has the annoying habit of describing every single meaningless detail in a scene. So when they cross the desert, you have endless descriptions of wind, and how thirsty everyone is, and how if they don't make it they'll die and the characters start whinging and don't stop and will they make it..? Look an oasis, we're saved! No tension whatsoever anyway, we all know they make it BECAUSE THEY SAY SO AT THE START! All this needless exposition and attempts at drama are useless if we know the characters make it.The most offending attempt at literature in this amazingly labelled \\"classic\\" is the way Haggard deals with Africans. They're all \\"noble savages\\" who for some reason speak like medieval dukes. \\"Thou hast\\", \\"ye\\", \\"sayest not\\", \\"hark\\", etc all make regular appearances in their speech but does he honestly think Africans speak like that?! The Englishmen patronise the Africans like pets and Haggard has the Africans run about like gormless children, either behaving \\"nobly\\" ie. standing around bored saying nothing, or like coked up teens with a hormone imbalance, ie. screaming, tearing hair, killing people randomly. No attempt at characterisation is made and none of the characters seem at all real. In fact they all sound remarkably the same, like a middle class educated Englishman.This is the most tedious novel I've ever read, it actually made me angry while I was reading. Haggard can't seem to accept the reader has the capacity to fill in the gaps. For example, rather than say \\"they went to the ridge and sat down\\", he has to say \\"they gathered up their things (items are listed and digressed), and after several parting words (list numerous mundane words), hastened up the path (description of path and weather), while we wondered about (list everything thats happened thus far) and upon reaching the ridge (list various mundane observations the characters have made while walking) we sat down and gazed at the view (list needless description of mountain range).\\" It's EXHAUSTING. I hurled the book away from me every time I sat it down (about every 3 chapters) and am amazed at my tolerance for poor writing.How is this a classic? It's not at all on the level of \\"Great Expectations\\" or \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" or numerous other examples. There's no profundity, no great story, no great writing. Haggard is a very minor writer and his contribution to literature is very small, if at all recognisable. I am amazed this is listed as a classic when it is the 1880s version of a Lee Child novel. Give this a wide book berth, it's appalling."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"I got turned on to H Rider Haggard because, well because there are so many freebies for him on the Kindle. I'm glad I did - Haggard is an exceptional adventure writer with a poetic grasp of the English language. He never gets bogged down in the words like some from his era, but keeps the story flowing.I read Allan Quartermain first, which is actually Allan's last adventure, so some of the things that were supposed to be surprises in this book weren't.This is one of Allan's later adventures. It includes Sir Henry Curtis & Captain John Good, who were in the final adventure as well. They are in search of Curtis' younger brother who went off to Africa in search of the fabled King Solomon's mines. They start off on their adventure and must endure hardships that end badly for some in their party. (Think of these folks as \\"redshirts\\" from Star Trek.) They find a lost civilization and...But wait, that would be spoiling it. Well, if you really want to be spoiled, look this up on Wikipedia. Otherwise know that there are many adventures, lots of fighting, evil doing, and implausible escapes. There's even a smattering of romance thrown in. The action moves pretty quickly, and though I thought the ending was a little rushed compared to the rest of the book, it was satisfying.The characters are vividly drawn and true to themselves. Haggard obviously had great respect for African people, which is neat considering this was first published in 1885.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"I grew up on the movie so it was quit a shocker to read the book.

The plot involves our hero, an aging elephant hunter, leading a party into deep dark Africa in search of wealth and mystery. Boys are certainly the target age for this genre, but be cautious with young readers, as glorified violence and racial stereotypes could use a mature approach when reading..

True, he might not be Shakespeare or Homer, but in his own genre Rider Haggard's raconteur is just as good. Tales like these are hard to come by nowadays.

So it is with this classic adventure story: so much of the action and plot devices were similar to what I remembered from other adventure stories (and comic books and movies), yet Rider Haggard came decades earlier. Here is one of the prototypes (along with Robert Louis Stevenson's &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, written just a few years earlier) of the modern adventure-action story. There is lots to admire in this well crafted story: great action, excitement, characters, and exotic locations. If there's a kid you know that only wants to watch television or play video games, read this book with him or her. It shows what words on a page can do in the imagination of the reader.It is also interesting to see the book in its historical perspective. &quot;King Solomon's Mines&quot;, 1885, records European ignorance of and fascination with Africa, which was still partly (as Joseph Conrad later called it in &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;) a blank area on the map: The source of the Nile had been discovered only two decades earlier; Henry Stanley and Richard Burton were still living, the memories of David Livingstone and John Speke were still fresh; and the Berlin Africa Conference was taking place just as the novel was going into print.

I thought that made it too light for the heady draught of five star-ism. But on reflection I think I was too harsh. The book does have staying power in my memory. So here goes.Surely a classic, this was Haggard's first foray into the literary field -- to prove he could do it better than some of his contemporaries. Having spent time in South Africa as a minor civil servant, he drew on his experiences of that land to impart a feel for the country in this short, but by no means small, tale of treasure hunting and adventure among unknown and exotic peoples. This is the story of an over the hill \\"white hunter\\" taken into the service of two English gentlemen seeking the brother of one of them, who had disappeared years before on the edge of a great desert in vain (or perhaps not so vain) pursuit of the fabled mines of King Solomon. Along the way they are joined by an enigmatic native guide who is much more than what he seems as they stumble across previously unexplored (at least by Europeans) tracts of Africa and into a lost nation related, apparently, to the Zulus of southern Africa whom the English of that day so feared and respected. Drawn at once into the internal politics of these people and overawing them w/their European technology, they are soon in deadly peril from the cruel king of that country and the evil sorceress who conspires behind his throne.But there's no use telling too much of a tale like this in a review -- the interested reader is urged to read it for him or herself. It's adventure in strange parts, for those with a taste to see how the great ones, like Haggard, did it.SWMThe King of Vinland's Saga"},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"I had heard of King Solomon's Mines my entire life but never read it. Now I know what I'd been missing. H. Rider Haggard's breakout novel is a grand, enjoyable adventure, a sort of Indiana Jones prototype from the great age of Victorian imperialism.The narrator, Allan Quatermain, is a middle-aged big game hunter who has somehow managed to survive decades in the African wilderness. His name is known far and wide, and as a result he is approached by a pair of men with an unusual proposition. One of the men, Sir Henry Curtis, has lost an estranged brother whom he believes was searching for the legendary diamond mines of King Solomon. Quatermain just happens to possess a map and some personal knowledge of the legends, and with a deal in place to grant him half of the diamonds--should they find some as well as Curtis's brother--he agrees to join them on the journey.Naturally, a great deal more happens to the party than they originally expected. Elephant hunts, witchcraft, and tribal warfare complicate their quest, but in the end all works out well--if unexpectedly--for most involved. Quatermain recounts the tale in a rapid, exciting manner that gripped me from the first chapter. This is one of a very few books I've read in a single day.This Penguin Classics edition of King Solomon's Mines reproduces the first edition text of Haggard's novel. As an appendix, a heavily-revised chapter from later editions is offered as a point of comparison with the original. The editor's notes are good, though they failed to explain one or two minor things and missed some rather obvious historical allusions. A preface and introduction place Haggard's work in its historical context and offer some interesting critical insights, but are by no means required reading and, honestly, are a little dull next to Allan Quatermain's epic quest.Overall, King Solomon's Mines is a great adventure story for readers of all ages, with well-drawn characters and exciting episodes on every page. Don't make my mistake and wait so long to read it.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"King Solomon's Mines, writtten by H. Rider Haggard, is a story told from the point of view of a man named Allen Quartermain. Quartermain is an experianced hunter, fighter, trader, and miner. This book is written sometime in the late 19th century and takes place in the remote African interior. While Quartermain was on a junting expedition, he met two men, Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good. They asked him to accompany them on a trek to find Sir Henry's lost brother. Quartermain accepts this offer after much thought. Their journey well take them to remote and dangerous parts of Africa. Along the way, they face many great dangers. They nearly die of thirst in the desert and are close to being trampled by a wounded elephant. All these things they but finally, when they are so close to their destination, they get themselves into a situation that they believe is impossible to get out of. And all this happens when they were so close to obtaining the precious diomonds of solomon's mines. All their hope is is lost, and they can but pray.I enjoyed this book very much and I would recommend it to anyone of any age. This book is crammed full of action, suspense, and mystery. if you're looking for a book to keep awake then this is it. This book is close to impossible to put down and often kept me up late to finish a good part. there are surprises around every corner and you never know what's coming.

In this instance, free is not better."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"When the film RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was released in 1981, more than one commentator observed that its hero owed much to another fictional adventurer introduced almost a century before: Allan Quartermain, the creation of Victorian novelist H. Rider Haggard. (And that the actor who later played Indiana Jones's father would go on to interpret his other 'father' as well creates a sort of symmetry.) It is worth noting, however, that in KING SOLOMON'S MINES, the first of 16 novels and numerous short-stories to feature him, Quartermain appears as a small man in his mid-fifties, with false teeth and a bad leg, who seems to take pride in regularly declaring himself a coward. The Jones comparisons owe more to later, adjusted depictions of Haggard's protagonist in both print and performance.The modern reader may also find discomforting the cultural and racial condescension (at best) which the character expresses as a British imperialist in southern Africa. Careful attention to the unfolding story, however, suggests that the author, if hardly immune to the prejudices of his day, sensed something of their fallacy. His native African people gradually emerge as fully developed, and fully human, individuals -- capable not only of either great nobility, wisdom, and intelligence or wretched evil, but of a complete spectrum of intermediate humours. Quartermain himself undergoes a broadening of outlook through his experience, so that for a while at least he comes to address (and perhaps truly to regard) as equals people he had previously felt should 'know their place'. Later, reflecting on his adventures, he recoils at old pejoratives which still habitually turn up in his vocabulary, and he writes to his son, 'What is a gentleman? ... I've known natives who ARE, and ... mean whites with lots of money and fresh out from home, too, who ARE NOT.' Given the period in which Haggard was himself writing, this is a remarkable insight.Still, it is a mistake to read the novel as an early parable on social conscience. The author's purpose was simply to compose a rousing tale of 'derring-do' in the spirit of Stevenson's TREASURE ISLAND, and in this he achieved adequate success. That he also provides a contemporary glimpse into the absurdities and injustices of a bygone era is a bonus he probably never foresaw."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"This is a great story! It's like Indiana Jones in 1895. I suspect that George Lucas based Indy on Allan Quatermain to an extent. Quatermain is a hunter in Africa, and has obtained an old map - drawn in blood no less - that gives directions to the fabled diamond mines of the biblical King Solomon. Accompanied by two other English men in search of treasure and a long lost brother, and a Zulu warrior who is not what he seems, they begin their arduous trek. Blazing deserts with no water, freezing mountains, an insane leader of a lost tribe and an evil witch all present challenges to the companions.Both humour and adventure are commonplace in this tale, and anyone who dreams of treasure should pick up this gem.Relic113"},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"This classical story about the search for wealth (diamonds), for a lost brother and a lost kingdom is heavily tainted by the colonial mentality of the British Empire, 'the wisdom of the white people'.It has a racial undertone: 'Can the sun mate with the moon, or the white with the black?'It extolls war: 'It was a splendid sight to see brave battalions come on time after time over the barriers of their death'.It asks full obedience to the powerful: 'Behold your king! fight and fall for him, as is the duty of the brave man.'It shows the 'pleasures' of merciless shooting of elephants for their tusks.But on the other hand, it contains general human insights: 'the eyes of mankind are blind to the discredited and he who is defenseless and undone finds few friends and little mercy.'And what is life? 'It is a feather, it is the seed of the grass, blown hither and tither, sometimes multiplying itself and dying in the act, sometimes carried hence into heavens.''Out of the dark we came, into the dark we go.

The sotry is set in the late 19th century, and age of colonialism in Africa. It is told by Alan Quartermain, an expert game hunter in South Africa. He is contacted by Sir Henry Curtis, who wished to hire Quartermain as a guide to look for his lost brother. Two years earlier, Curtis' brother left to find the legendary mines of King Solomon. Fortunately, Quartermain had come into possession of a map showing the way to King Solomon's mines. The pair are accompanied by Captain John Good, a naval officer whose habits of cleanliness become comic, and Umbopa, an African porter with a mysterious secret. Needless to say, they encounter quite a few adventures along the way.Something that might be found objectionable is the racial attitudes in this book. There are several comments that modern readers may find uncomfortable. However, if you keep in mind the time period this was written in, it's racial attitudes were more advanced than the general attitude of the time. The African characters appear as human, but some of the characters make remarks which would not pass today. If you can keep in mind the time period this was written in, I think you can enjoy this adventure, but if you are sensitive about racial remarks, then I recommend you give this a pass."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"This was my second Alan Quartermain adventure and I am hooked.

I must have read the abridged version back then because I don't remember many of the scenes, and I did read it around age 15 or so.The good stuff: a mysterious map after an amazing treasure, this is the source work for creating Indiana Jones. The book has a lot of funny lines that would have gone over my head as a kid. But it is my favorite of favorites when it comes to adventure stories.The author clearly knows and loves Africa and Africans. At the beginning of the book he refuses to use the n-word to describe blacks because he says some of them are more gentlemen than the British.The bad: Some of the tribal war stuff is a little hard to visualize. There were some military planning that I glossed through. There's definitely an imperialistic flavor that was common for the time, so if you're easily offended and can get bogged down by that sort of thing, you may not enjoy it.It's not Pulitzer Prize stuff, but it's better. I recently read the Grapes of Wrath, which is award winning. But to get through to the end was a slugfest. This book seems fly through my fingers and I looked forward to every time I could pick it up again.Also this book is free in the Public Domain and will always be.

Characters encounter danger and adversity from the start to the very end. The strong ones survive; the weak ones don't last long.While some aspects of the story are dated, it is a great story.

Quartermain knows the man and goes in search of the Lost Diamond Mines of King Solomon (really, what better quest is there?) Naturally, on the way lie death and destruction; curses and blessings; cannibals and all the rest. They just don't make 'em like this any more.The review: What an extraordinary adventure!

But he is best known as the found of the Lost Worlds genre of literature. He was a contemporary of Edgar Rice Burroughs and other late 1800's - early 1900's adventure/romance writers, but in this case H. Rider Haggard is a very English author.The two novels I've read here are King Solomon's Mines (his first work in 1885) and Allan Quatermain (written in 1887 as the sequel. These two works, being the first and second about Allan Quatermain, actually cover his introduction and his death. There are other books in this series that came later, but they are all prequels to these two books, which were written first. These two books go hand in hand and I am combining the two into one review.The first novel, King Solomon's Mines, is the traditional Lost World work. Here we find Quatermain and his two companions Sir Henry Curtis and Captain Good, enter into deepst, darkest Africa in search of Sir Henry's brother. They are accompanied by a native Umbopa, who has a secret that will lead to a hidden treasure, a civil war and some high adventure.This is written in true Victorian manner, right down to the language. At the time Africa was mostly unknown and believed to have secreted some very savage tribes and the wildest of animals. The most anyone knew were stories that English hunters told over brandy and cigars at the Private Gentlemen's Clubs in London.Haggard had plenty of experience as he spent time in South Africa. This lends much authenticity to the works and the use of the local colloquialisms and the inclusion of Zulu and native names and language make the books feel realistic. There are parts where he describes the exact equipment Quatermain takes with him on the expedition, and he lists every rifle, every make, every model, every round and it is quite amusing to see what was considered important at the time.King Solomon's Mines is a look at a time and place when imagination made the unknown even more wild and exciting than it was in reality. It is a good read and as amusing as it is adventuresome.Allan Quatermain is another Lost World fiction piece, but the focus is more on the kind of Utopia Haggard had in mind in comparison to the kind of life experienced in England at that time.Again, we are taken into the deepest part of Africa with his companions Sir Henry and Captain Good, but this time it is in search of a hidden tribe of white Africans that is rumored to be hidden in the deepest part of Africa. Quatermain also takes along a faithful servant Umslopogas, a Zulu chief who has been a friend to Quatermain for a long time.A side note here. While the novels are characteristic of the English attitude towards their colonies, Haggard treats the black African as the noble savage, giving them due respect for their culture. I did not notice any kind of stereotyping, rather in this novel Umslopogas is a hero. Haggard does immortalize his black natives as individuals who stand out in a culture that breeds noble men of action, even if they are primitive in nature. This is Africa, and the black man is the lord and master of that continent. He also seemed very fond of the Zulu race in particular.So, Quatermain, Good and Sir Henry embark on an adventure to find the lost white tribe, and are rewarded with savage tribes, civil war, battles, treasure and beautiful women and Victorian romance. We also find Quatermain mortally wounded doing the honorable thing. It is a wonderful tale, and is made even more intriguing as we see into Haggard's idea of the perfect culture, uncluttered by greed, social status or muddy law. The culture rises and falls on love. We have civil war, romance and a perfect culture.I downloaded the free Kindle versions of King Solomon's Mines and Allan Quatermain, and the books were not that bad in formatting and editing. Nothing really blaring in spelling errors and the formatting was average. I find these two books to be well worth the free download.So, stick that copy of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen back in the DVD library and forget Richard Chamberlain in the lead - and give the original works a read. I think you will be delighted with these two books."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"Henry Rider's masterpiece introduces his reader's to big game hunter Allan Quatermain, a reluctant but effective and convincing hero.

Rider Haggard lived in (what is now) South Africa from 1875 until he returned to London in 1882. He published his first novel, King Solomon's Mines in 1885, a fantastic adventure beginning in Durbin, South Africa and reaching to unexplored territories. It became an immediate best seller, and rightfully so.The story is told in first person by Allan Quatermain, written as a manuscript for his son, though occasionally (a first novel mistake, it would seem), Quatermainaddresses \\"Reader\\", instead of his son as he does throughout most of the novel. In the manuscript, Quatermain tells of meeting with Sir Henry Curtis and Sir Henry's friend Good, who had come to Africa in search of Sir Henry's missing brother. The last heard of him had been that he was going to Durbin in search of treasure. Quatermain was able to tell Sir Henry of a man that fit the description, a man Quatermain had given directions that might have helped him find King Solomon's mines. Sir Henry persuades Quatermain to join them as guide, and what follows is an adventure tale of fast friendship, narrow escapes, devoted love, true evil and, of course, treasure.While it is dated in some ways, King Solomon's Mines remains an magnificent yarn, drawing in the reader with an exciting plot and lovely descriptions and interesting characters. It remains a fun read, even some 125 years later.Haggard shows a surprising sympathy for the African native, in relation to his era, and explains some tribal practices with a very tolerant touch. While it is still obvious to a modern reader that Haggard considers the white European to be superior, the African characters are not stereotyped or portrayed as ignorant or evil, though superstition is a characteristic. Haggard makes no denial of the beauty of the African women, but does make his point \\"can the sun mate with the darkness or the white with the black?\\" on a few occasions.While the three main characters are white Europeans, there are three less major heroes who are African: Ignosi, Infadoos and the lovely Foulata, and these characters have equally important parts to play as Quatermain, Sir Henry and Good. Overall, Haggard kept his African characters in the area between the prejudiced portrayal and the equally insulting \\"noble savage\\", seemingly ahead of his time.While King Solomon's Mines is not a quick fluff read, it is still a somewhat light swashbuckling tale, full of humor and excitement and solid writing.(Completely aside, I had to wonder just how titillating Haggard's many references to the mountains, Sheba's Breast, were to Victorians, especially given how often he described the \\"nipples\\" of these mountains, and their \\"firm roundness\\".)Note on the Kindle edition: foreign symbols, such as the British pound sign and accent marks, were unable to copy over from the font originally used and showed up as a \\"?\\" on the Kindle. This occurrence was not frequent enough to be a problem, and as the edition is free, I don't find it a deterrent to recommending this version."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"King Solomon's Mines must be one of the best adventure and action books of the 19th century. Parts of the story may seem a bit cliched at times but that is because so many writers and film producers in later years unashamedly copied from Haggard.

H. Rider Haggard paints a vivid picture that lets you participate in the adventure. I recommend this highly. I could not put it down."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"King Solomon's Mines is a straight forward adventure story. Two friends enlist the services of a crusty guide and a strong minded native to tramp across Africa in search for a missing brother, a brother who in turn was lost while searching for one of the greatest treasures known to legend (see title). To do so they must cross the desert, climb the mountains, confront an evil witch, and fight an epic battle.It's a quick read and a pleasant one. Only one bit goes down sour, a bit of racism residual from the time period. While one of the lead characters, Umbopa, is a strong, intelligent African man, an interracial love story is cut short by death, followed by the observation that white and black cannot marry anymore than day and night. Not exactly the most enlightened point of view.I love the writing and the story. If you could cut out that paragraph all would be well and this at least a four star book . . . but I suppose that would be revising history and literature, and so the book stands, or falls, as it is."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"I read another book by this author, Children of the Mist, which was fabulous.

Archetype or no, I didn't like it one bit.Where to begin? For one thing, though it was considered enlightened for its day, the book contains plenty of hard-to-stomach racism. It takes place in modern-day South Africa, and - to put it bluntly - the native South Africans are portrayed as inferior to whites. True, the author takes pains to state that some blacks deserve the title of \`gentleman' more than some whites, and to show that Africans have pride, nobility, and culture. But these observations are delivered within a fundamentally condescending narrative in which black servants are shown to venerate white skin, to be willing to give their lives to save their \\"masters,\\" and to aspire to be like their white overlords.The book is also dated in its joyful descriptions of African game hunting. A particularly disturbing description of the slaughter of eight African elephants - killed, of course, only for their ivory - was supposed to be exciting, but only made my stomach turn.These are, of course, modern complaints and one might argue that it's not fair to judge the book out of its time. Leaving aside these aspects, therefore, I turn to my other chief grievance, which is that the author failed to engender in me any interest in the fate of the protagonists. Why? Because they do not seem like sympathetic characters to me, but rather like willfully-unprepared fools. As an example, consider one incident in which these men must cross 100 miles of desert. They know in advance that they will have to cross the desert, and they know how big it is - both because they have a map, and because they can see the mountains on the other side of it. But do they bring along enough water for themselves to drink as they cross the desert? They do not. Not by half. What about shelter (in the form of a few blankets hung on poles, for example) with which they might shield themselves from the hot desert sun? Nope...they plunge into the desert with just two days' worth of water, and no shelter or appropriate clothes. I was therefore completely unsympathetic to their plight when they - (lo and behold) - began to suffer from dehydration. Similarly, when these foolhardy men at last reach the mountains on the other side of the desert, they begin to feel cold and hungry, because they have failed to bring any warm clothes or food with them. But why should I care? This is stupidity, nothing more or less.My last complaint with the book is that I found it predictable, and therefore dull. Having slogged through the first 1/3 of it, I felt as though I already knew most of what would happen...and indeed, when I looked it up on Wikipedia, I found that I was correct in all my guesses.It may be that this is a classic of English literature, but I feel that I must review the book on its merits as I see them as a reader - not as a historian. And from that perspective it gets two thumbs down."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"This book is full of the horrors of hunting and poaching for profit and sport. I couldn't stomach another chapter after the one titled \\"An Elephant Hunt.\\" I love classics and have read my share of them; this is full of atrocious viciousness and the base human qualities that have driven species to the brink of extinction through pain and suffering. It is NOT an \\"adventure\\" to kill for fun; it is abominable."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"King Solomon's Mines is one of the best adventures ever penned. Even the Victorian-English-speak dialogue adds to the realism. A lost brother, a great treasure, an exiled black king, a pitched battle, heroes, death, a vast and dangerous wilderness, a doomed love, strong friendships, one of the strangest and most evil villainesses in all of literature, and echoes of antiquity -- what more could you want? You could want literary excellence, wonderful pace, and a slight element of the occult. Well, Haggard provides those as well. The films VERY loosely based upon this great tale are horrible. This is a dream. Go read it. Unfold Da Silvestre's fragile treasure map and take the unforgettable journey that is King Solomon's Mines."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"Although fiction is not my normal fodder, I found this book to be refreshing. It narrates the harrowing quest of a few men for diamonds, for a missing brother, and for home. The villians were truly vile, the heroes were larger than life, and it was fun to be with them on their journey. No major theses were given, no important life questions were answered, but it made a few of my evenings a little more enjoyable."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"I first read this book at Kintail Lodge in Scotland (near the Isle of Skye). We were all rained in that day, so I just picked up this book from the library in the hotel. I was 12 years old then. It was absolutely the best book I'd ever read up till then in my whole life. Nice quick read too, not too long, and plenty of action going on. A great adventure. Nice warfare, and an evil witch (Gagool). No movie version has ever done it justice, but it would be nice if Spielburg could try again (very similar in atmosphere to the Indiana Jones stories but written nearly a century earlier).30 years later, I read it again. And it is still just as gripping a tale as you could want. Hasn't dated at all, and there is only some stilted attitudes in the characters that strikes one now as pretty old-fashioned (honor, glory, etc.). A great boy's book that will get even a reluctant reader hooked. There is even a slight prurient interest in the fact that the landmark mountains are called Sheba's Breasts.Excellent book to read at any age, if you want something quick, exciting, and exotic."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"Reading &quot;King Solomon's Mines&quot; reminded me of the joke about the guy who sees his first Shakespere play, and when asked what he thought of it, said, &quot;real good, but so many cliches&quot;. So it is with this classic adventure story: so much of the action and plot devices were similar to what I remembered from other adventure stories (and comic books and movies), yet Rider Haggard came decades earlier. Here is one of the prototypes (along with Robert Louis Stevenson's &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, written just a few years earlier) of the modern adventure-action story. There is lots to admire in this well crafted story: great action, excitement, characters, and exotic locations. If there's a kid you know that only wants to watch television or play video games, read this book with him or her. It shows what words on a page can do in the imagination of the reader.It is also interesting to see the book in its historical perspective. &quot;King Solomon's Mines&quot;, 1885, records European ignorance of and fascination with Africa, which was still partly (as Joseph Conrad later called it in &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;) a blank area on the map: The source of the Nile had been discovered only two decades earlier; Henry Stanley and Richard Burton were still living, the memories of David Livingstone and John Speke were still fresh; and the Berlin Africa Conference was taking place just as the novel was going into print. If that's not of interest to you, skip it. Want to curl up with a good book? Here's one for you and your kids."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"This book is entertaining, but stay away from the gateway movie classics edition which is teeming with typos. The worst editing I have ever seen."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"There's a story that, after coming out of a performance of_Hamlet_, an audience member was heard complaining: &quot;Allhe did was just string together a bunch of cliches!&quot;To some extent, _King Solomon's Mines_ has suffered asimilar fate. Modern audiences, jaded with inferiorreproductions, may groan when the English explorers awe thenatives by--with the help of an almanac and a solareclipse--darkening the sun. The convenient death ofinconvenient characters may seem contrived at time, and themystical gadgets of ancient civilizations have been sothoroughly explored by Indiana Jones and his like thatyou might wonder why you should bother to read the originalat all?In the end, _King Solomon's Mines_ is more than the sum ofits narrow scrapes, noble savages and Biblical booty.Haggard's masterful and often-underrated characterizationlets him weave a telling commentary about race and classinto the words of his unwitting narrator--while stillentertaining as only he can. Unlike some of hiscontemporaries' mindless colonial jingoism, Haggard treatshis black characters as more than obstacles to beovercome, and entertains the idea that English societymight be less than perfect after all. While not asambitious in its social commentary as my favorite Haggardbook, _She_, _King Solomon's Mines_ still leaves the readerwith something to think about, as well as being a goodadventure story in its own right."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"It's really too bad that most children who love the adventures of Indiana Jones have probably never read (or even heard of) Allan Quatermain and KING SOLOMON'S MINES. This is where it all started! Haggard's first novel chronicles the adventures of Quatermain (okay, so maybe he's not as cool as Indiana Jones), Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good as they search South Africa for Sir Henry's brother, who has vanished while searching for King Solomon's treasure.The novel is the real treasure. The story, while obviously written many years ago (1885), is still fresh and exciting. It was fun to discover this story as a 38-year old kid! Any age will enjoy it. And what a great adventure story to read to your kids instead of taking them to the latest action/adventure junker playing at your local theatre."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"In his Post Scriptum in 1907 the author, H. Rider Haggard, calls the novel a \\"romance\\" which in Victorian terms meant an adventure or at least something out of ordinary everyday life. In Nathaniel Hawthorne's words romance in those days meant \\"where moonlight and imagination meet\\". And surely King Solomon's Mines is that place. The dark, mysterious atmosphere of Africa has never been more chillingly depicted. Never has there been a more frightful villain than the witch Gagool. She is so totally lacking in scruples that when I first read the book I kept on making out her awful face in the fanciful wallpaper designs in my bathroom, and I was scared to go in there in the dark. Never has there been a more suspenseful situation in all of fiction than whether the characters will make it to the mines to begin with and once they get there whether they will escape. All these things make this story of Allan Quatermain the granddaddy of the later day thriller novel. Read it again and again and discover new riches each time."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"Read the book in 2-3 days on my new kindle, enjoyed it very much. Too bad the film doesn't look as engaging. Found the use of all the 'ye' and 'thou' in the dialogue with the natives to be a bot distracting considering the narrator doesn't use the same verbiage when describing things or in dialogue with his associates. Good read, I would recommend it."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"They don't write books like this any more, and that is both a good and a bad thing.You have to keep telling yourself that this book was written a LONG time ago, since it is a pretty safe bet that something in this book will offend virtually any modern reader. I found myself shaking my head in disbelief and laughing sort of the same way I used to laugh while watching Archie Bunker--except that Archie was an anachronism even during his first run on TV, and Alan Quartermain is quite enlightened for his time. Not that different from reading Edgar Rice Burroughs, really.IF you can get past that, and I hope that you can, this is a fantastic adventure novel. Absolutely top shelf---how did I miss this one? Full of heroic characters, dastardly villains, complex plots and schemes, hair-raising adventures, creepy settings, epic battles and something that I did not expect----humor. This book is laugh out loud funny even while telling a straight forward adventure yarn in the classic style. A style it pretty much invented, I might say, just as I think that it is no stretch to say that without Alan Quartermain there would be no Indiana Jones. In fact the whole vibe of the movie borrows quite a bit from Haggard's style.I have already bought a ticket for the remaining books in the series."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"The quote on the cover says \\"A splendidly entertaining book .... Inspired\\" and I think these words best summarise this book. Tahir Shah is the best travel writer I have ever read.

I wish I could live the life he does , going in search of legends, traversing countries, hoping continents, while constantly adding to his unending treasure of stories , human nuances and insights. Gosh it is overwhelming. In this book he breaks all the stereotypes of a famine ridden Ethiopia that I held, and I am sure most people I know hold as well. Now Ethiopia has a completely new portrait for me, the source of Solomon's Gold, Kingdom of Queen Sheeba, Country of Haile Selasie, Arena of Frank Hayter's Adventures, Mythical location for Garden of Eden &Hiding place of Ark of Covenant.

Quattermain has appeared in a number of books. filims, and serials, but this story marks his first.King's Solomon's Mines tells the story of the elephant hunter as he journeys in search of a secret kingdom, to recover a lost treasure and find a missing man. If the plot sounds familiar, that's because it is. But King's Solomon's Mines is not the copy; it is the predecessor to numerous other stories. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"A story of exploration that's intriguing the whole way through.

I was not disappointed. The story, told by Quartermain himself, moves along very naturally. It is a great adventure story, with big battles, tough decisions, quick thinking, and life or death struggles. You do, however, have to have a little appreciation for the fact that it was written in the late 1800's, so some of the plot devices are predictable and the outcomes forseen miles away, but it doesn't detract from the fact that the book is a fun, easy read."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"H. Rider Haggard wrote 14 Allan Quatermain novels and 4 short stories, everyone of which is alive with his distinctive world view. Indeed, Haggard went so far as to write in his autobiography: \\"I always find it easy to write of Allan Quatermain, who, after all, is only myself set in a variety of imagined situations, thinking my thoughts and looking at life through my eyes.\\"The Quatermain books are not mere adventures; they are all about Haggard's perception of the nature of the universe.One aspect of Haggard's \\"philosophy,\\" if you will, was that he didn't let religious dogma obscure his observation; and his observation bolstered what he knew intuitively, that it was doubtful that anyone could say anything definite about anything. The Allan Quatermain books reflected this by presenting fate as a joker. As you read Quatermain, you realize that concrete evidence doesn't really mean a thing, that contradiction abounded, and that there was no such thing as certainty. Nevertheless you also learn that there was a puppet master, without doubt real, who could, and frequently did, produce miracles, and reveled, too, in phenomena that was to a person's life like peripheral vision was to sight or whispers were to hearing.Frankly, I for one find it comforting and refreshing that a best-selling writer could consistently convey such an outlook in novel after novel. He wasn't just writing entertainments; he was writing entertainments that radiated a distinctive view of life and the universe. Perhaps, on some level, much of his readership shared those views, which may have been a reason why he became one of the world's bestselling and favorite authors virtually overnight.Interestingly, there is currently only one modern literary sequel to the Quatermain saga (opposed to a comic novels); it's a long (100,000 words) NEW Allan Quatermain novel, ALLAN QUATERMAIN MEETS SHERLOCK HOLMES IN ETHIOPIA, 1872 by Thos. Kent MillerAllan Quatermain Meets Sherlock Holmes in Ethiopia, 1872. It features some of the characters Haggard created alongside Quatermain--for example, Hans the Hottentot and Zikali the Zulu wizard--but in a mighty new adventure and in a style that parodies pastiche conventions.

I'm not complaining, though. I've been looking for more great fantasy ever since I started reading Rowling, especially since her latest books are for older kids. The Rune of Zachary Zimbalist is all about twelve-year-old Zachary travelling through time to save history from the evil Scatterers. I loved the twists and turns at the end, and I just bought the second book. I can't wait to read it!"},{"Title":"The Rune of Zachary Zimbalist (Connedim) (Connedim)","review":"\\"The Scatterers love chaos and pain, and they'll do anything they can to distort history. They leave their Rune behind as a sign of their success.\\" When Zachary's cat begins talking to a Mexican ghost, Zachary knows he's in big trouble. But as soon as he tries to show them the tattoo forced on him by a pair of school bullies, Zachary realizes it's far worse than he thought. For, although the Rune Tattoo on his arm has seemingly disappeared, the power of the Rune is already working to bring him under the Scatterers' control. So begins twelve-year-old Zachary's adventures in the land of The Connedim - the Connecting Dimension between the past and the future. Zachary's Tucson cat is really an ancient Egyptian Pharaoh in disguise, and the leader of the Interhistorical Alliance. Zachary's Mentor is the ghost of a Mexican girl who died over a century ago, and his new roommate comes from South Africa, a hundred and fifty years in the future! Each member of the Alliance protects history from the Scatterers by using their ability to communicate with animals and machines, to fly by talking to the air, and to travel through history by understanding time. Pamela Keyes adds a multi-cultural twist to the concept of a school for magical powers, first introduced in LeGuin's Earthsea Trilogy, and delightfully popularized by Harry Potter. The Connedim brings alive animal characters ranging from Zachary's cat and a pair of obnoxious flying falcon brothers, to a ponderous and eerie giant tortoise. The humans in the Alliance span thousands of years of history, and they all have the help of a \\"mandiball\\" - a combination cuddly pet, soccer ball, and fierce protector. And the Scatterers themselves, whose interference has resulted in events as dire as Hitler's Holocaust, are led by a trio of evil souls attempting to penetrate the Alliance and destroy its very foundation. As he fights against the Scatterers' increasingly bold attempts to turn him into one of them, Zachary finally learns why the Scatterers have marked him with their Rune. The lives of his friends, the fate of the Alliance, and even the very nature of history, have all come to depend on Zachary, alone. With plenty of action, nonstop suspense, unexpected plot twists, and even a touch of psychology (Zachary finally understands that he doesn't have to let one terrible mistake take over his life) this book grabs you in the first chapter and doesn't let you go until you turn the last page."},{"Title":"The Rune of Zachary Zimbalist (Connedim) (Connedim)","review":"I have never seen my 10-year old daughter so excited about a book before. She hasn't historically been much of a reader so I was just thrilled when she couldn't put down The Rune of Zachary Zimbalist. The Connedim: Book One. We read it out loud together, taking turns reading. I have to say I may have enjoyed it as much as her. The story is fun and exciting, the vocabulary was, at times, challenging for my daughter, which gave us opportunities to discuss new words. The fundamental lessons of doing the right thing, not letting one mistake lead to another, working hard, embracing diversity, all come across loud and clear without appearing preachy.The twists and turns of the plot kept us both guessing, and had my daughter using critical thinking to try to figure things out. I found it particularly gratifying to see her take that magical leap from reading the words, to enjoying the story, while she read this book. I look forward to starting Book 2, probably later today if my daughter has anything to say about it, and reading more of Pamela Keyes work."},{"Title":"The Rune of Zachary Zimbalist (Connedim) (Connedim)","review":"After finishing the book I immediately ordered the next one in the series \\"The Legend of Zamiel Zimbalist\\", in order to find out what happens next. Pam Keyes has accurately recreated the world view of a young adult that is neither sugar coated nor frightening. I think she has also created characters, particularly in the main character Zachary, which young adults can relate to. The book captures a lot of the inner thoughts of the main character and inculcates readers that there are rewards from controlling ones behavior. Zachary definitely matures in front of his reading audience in the book. Another important lesson is that we can transcend our mistakes and learn from them.One of the most compelling ideas of the book is that human history is fluid and those with \\"parlance\\" can exist both in their own time and other historical time periods.More chronologically advanced readers will appreciate the characters from history including a nod to a relatively modern Southwestern author, activist, (and perhaps...anarchist :-)in the guise of a (very wise) cat."},{"Title":"The Rune of Zachary Zimbalist (Connedim) (Connedim)","review":"Like young Harry Potter, Zachary Zimbalist lives uneasily amongst everyday people -- although in Zachary's case the problem isn't cardboard-thin nasty step parents, but very believable schoolyard bullies. And like young Harry Potter, Zachary has special abilities lurking under the surface, abilities just waiting to be developed. Not magic, but \\"parlance\\", a whimsical and beautiful ability to converse with his surroundings, including wind and lightning and animals. (Although it doesn't matter to me personally, for some people the absence of wizards and magic will make this book more acceptable for their children.)This book chronicles Zachary's first steps in using his parlance with help from Maria, a friendly Mexican ghost; Edy Aby, his cat/pharaoh and various historical figures who live in Connedim, a place that connects all the dimensions of time. For example, his flight instructor is none other than Wilbur Wright; his combat instructor is Alexander the Great.Zachary needs all their help, because the evil scatterers are after him, trying to recruit his strong parlance to their cause of spreading chaos and pain throughout history. All in all, this is an exciting and excellent first novel that has great, multicultural characters, a zesty Southwestern setting, and some delightful, highly original twists on a theme that is a favorite with young people.

Mason Brewer in the 1930s, most educated Blacks were too scornful of their own folk culture to record it, thus it was up to white writers such as Joel Chandler Harris to preserve them, with varying results depending on the collector. As Talley himself mentions in the intro, few Blacks in those days were willing to be candid with the white compilers of this material.Thomas W. Talley was on the verge of a culutral revolution. A professor at Fisk University, he was one of the few educated Blacks of his day who saw value in Black folk traditions and recalled the tales of his parents and other ex-slaves in rural Tennessee for his book \\"The Negro Traditions\\" in the 1920s. Unfortuantely, the manuscript was never published and lied unread at Fisk University for 58 years, until the editors with the assistance of Talley's daughter and grandson brought it to light.The tales require some work for the modern reader, as Talley uses the \\"Negro Dialect\\" commonly used at the time for attempts to replicte the speech of the black masses and is thus difficult for the modern reader who may not be familiar with this style to decipher. But once you get the hang of it, it's pretty enjoyable. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the intro notes that editors left out some stories from the original manuscript that sounded really interesting (I HATE when people do this! Let us the public decide!).

While fast and punkish there is a supprisingly tender(3? or is it 4?)way love story winding it's way thru all the mayhem.Baird gives us some fairly complex characters in nicely subtle way. She doesn't get lazy and break thru and tell us all about the characters omnipitently, as too many authors do now.A pretty good read."},{"Title":"Crashcourse","review":"Cyberpunk with a feminine touch (or slap). Anyway it's the story of three strange characters and an equally strange cast of supporting characters. The punk lingo is highly in evidence in the stream of consciousness narative. The action is dark, furious and there's a fairly high body count. A Strong sense of place and character brings you in and the fact that Ms. Baird is not afraid to maim and kill her protagonists is very refreshing. If you like cyberpunk, you'll like Crashcourse."},{"Title":"Crashcourse","review":"....sink your teeth into this one. The main characters (a thief, a sculptor, and a handsome actor) are sucked into a reality show/movie for the money. However, they don't know that the girl they just &quot;saved&quot; is a snuff film actress, and she loves to kill.Some memorable lines, too. Baird has a crisp, clean style--fiction that gleams like a space-age weapon."},{"Title":"Crashcourse","review":"This novel is what cyberpunk could be if it were allowed to grow up. Baird doesn't dwell on all the precious details of the tech behind the story; rather, she simply posits it, and credits the reader with enough imagination to do likewise. CRASHCOURSE is a story driven by character and action, a great amusement park ride with plenty of twists and &quot;Huh? Ack! Wow!&quot; moments. It would make a terrific film if they can resist messing up the story on the way to the screenplay. Unfortunately, the book's out of print at the moment (July 2000), but if you can find a used copy, jump at it."},{"Title":"Crashcourse","review":"I got this book as a stocking-filler at Christmas, but I love this book!

Especially since it's written in first person.If you can get around the fact that it's based in the slums of science fiction, in a situation that depresses you from the start and never truly cheers you up afterwards, the plot is kinda good, imaginative, and well-written.There's also occasional profanity in here, and lots of references to other literary works and such that you may not get.

So for those of you that want a more technical but less of a complete overview, the OCT book is for you.Both books have the same examples and in most cases the same questions used in the practice exams.I really feel the OCT book is not worth the money while the MFAT book is completely worth it."},{"Title":"CliffsTestPrepMilitary Flight Aptitude Tests","review":"In preparation for the Army AFAST test I bought this book and two other study guides - I'm so glad I got the other study guides because the CliffsTestPrep is FILLED with errors.

Sure, you can study by finding and recognizing the author's mistakes but in my opinion you should not have to question the correctness of a test prep guide. Now, I will be honest... the inaccuracies we found were only in the practice test sections, but since the errors were so profuse we didn't even want to look at the review section for fear that we couldn't trust the accuracy of information.Pass on this one and stick to the official military AFAST study manual!"},{"Title":"CliffsTestPrepMilitary Flight Aptitude Tests","review":"This book has the LEAST amount of study reviews among which the information given in the book may even mislead the test preparers.As many have already mentioned, this book has so many typos and misinterpretation of the problems/answers.Do not make yourself another helpless victim, and avoid this book, period.

Also, the knowledge and mechanics parts of the practice test in this book are nothing like the real AFAST! The AFAST is so much easier and so common sense esp on the mechanics part of the AFAST.

I had my first glance at a Bathory without knowing it so I finally found the book after a long search.The story, based on Leopold Sacher-Masoch's novel of the same name, but Pichard's version focuses more on her last few days of freedom in 1611--she died in captivity in 1614. There is rampant female nudity in this book and the torture and bondage scenes are pretty explicit, but Pichard's artwork is alternately attractive and grotesque. Erzebet herself is the best-drawn.It also takes liberties on facts about the Countess's life. For example, her obsession with blood began when a serving girl brushing her hair pulled too hard and the Countess struck her so hard, she drew blood. The blood dripped on her skin, and when she saw its effect, became convinced that blood could keep her young. There's a different version of that told in the Masoch-Pichard book.Anyway, it involves Emmerich, a young prince and his sister Isabel who are paying a visit to Bathory and hear of her reputation along the way. They see the ways she punishes lawbreakers and disobedient servants, which should have sent up red flags saying &quot;Run, Forrest, Run,&quot; but...Very very adult and sadistic, and definitely not for the squeamish. For those interested in Bathory, graphic novels, and maybe black metal fans into dark stuff, this is perfect. And its meagre 44-pages are potent enough to make Pichard's artwork a veritable impression on one."},{"Title":"Countess in Red","review":"Dreary and SO poorly written I could have cried! I have seldom seen a work with such flimsy plot and utterly insipid characters. What a shame!"},{"Title":"Countess in Red","review":"This is one of my favorite George Pichard graphic novels. There are a few things you should know about Pichards style before investing in this book. The women depicted in Pichard's works are not exactly what modern day viewers of adult art books would consider beautiful in the traditional sense. The woman are typically how one might imagine a poor French peasant... attractive but somehow very ordinary and raw in appearance. His works are quite old and in a pen and ink style that has the feel almost of old wood-block prints. This particular story works slowly up to some very graphic and intense images that are very sadistic in nature. If you are looking for an erotic story with lots of sex and attractive females... this book is probably not for you. If you are looking for a book that has a very gothic feel (not modern vampire Gothic) that has some very graphic and intense scenes... this is a good work to add to your library. If you are looking for an accurate history of Elizabeth Bathory... while most details are somewhat accurate... this is not a history book. If you are not into bdsm or only mild bdsm... this work is probably not for you. If you are use to reading modern graphic novels... you might not like this book. If you like a book that is a little different with unusual perverse and even mildly violent depictions ... this book might be for you."},{"Title":"Countess in Red","review":"Nothing is quite as disappointing as hoping for a good scary novel and winding up with a pathetic collection of silly, disjointed gore scenes that even grade-school kids wouldn't find exciting.

With his expertise in Kuk Sool, Hapkido, and Tae Kwon Do, he was certainly the right person to present the first book no this style not completed under the direct supervision of the WKSWF. Kimm succeeded in offering a lavish and educational volume on this inclusive modern Korean Martial Art. With the exception of Hyung (forms), Kimm completely demonstrates all required sequences of techniques up to the rank of Fourth Dan Black Belt Rank in the art of Kuk Sool Won (which translates roughly into National--meaning Korean--Skills School).At 760 pages, Kimm is able to include not only the sequential series of photographs detailing technique, but also a number of artistic photos which should serve the heart of any martial artist. The first 139 pages cover the introduction to the art--history, philosophy, stances, striking points, basic techniques, etc. Each Part is broken down into the required grouping of techniques. In Kuk Sool Won, Techniques are taught in groupings--for instance, you would learn a series of 15 basic techniques with a partner, then 11 defenses against wrist grabs as a group.In addition to and after the basic techniques are learned (how to strike, kick, etc), for the first keub (Kyu in Japanese, or junior belt) ranks in Kuk Sool, one must master 7 series of techniques. This includes 15 Ki Bon Sul (basic techniques), 11 Son Mok Soo (Defense Against Wrist Grab), 13 Eui Bok Soo (Defense Against Cloth Seize), 6 An Son Mok Soo (Defense Against opposite Wrist Seize), 15 Maik Chi Ki (counter strikes to vital points), 15 Maik Chak ki (Counter KICKS to vital points), and Cho Keub Hyung (beginner's form--not shown). All of the sequential techniques to 4th dan black belt are included, and should be of interest to anyone with a background in Kuk Sool, Hapkido, Jujutsu, or a Tang Soo Do/Tae Kwon Do style which includes any sort of grappling in their Ho Sin Sul (self defense) requirements.Every series of technique is completely illustrated and described. While I could fault Kimm for not delving deeper into history, he does remedy this in his subsequent books Hapkido and especially Hapkido II. If you can only afford one book by Dr. Kimm, I would Recommend Hapkido II--If you practice Kuk Sool Won or a Ki Do art in the lineage of In-suk Seo, this book might be more specific.With Kimm's background in martial art, and the apparent good terms he is on with fellow instructors in the USA, Korea, and otherwise Internationally, I eagerly await his future Publications--especially concerning History of Korean Martial Arts. If you have had difficulty finding Dr. Kimm's books, you'll be pleased to know that often Kimm's publications may be obtained by contacting the World Han Mu Do Association."},{"Title":"Kuk sool: Korean martial arts","review":"I own a copy, and without a doubt, it is an excellent, superb example of a reference manual.

It clearly explains Dr Winnicott's theoretical development, and where and how he disagrees with Freud and Klein, as well as illustrates that Winnicott was a human being with many significant personal problems he struggled with. It also portrays very nicely the politics that went on in London among the Kleinians, Freudians, and Anna Freud during the period. It is well annotated, for example it cites the only available source to find a clear write up of what is was like to be in psychoanalysis with Dr. Winnicott (A biography of Harry Guntrip who was in psychoanalysis with Dr. W.)

Combined with the experiences of a child, the result is a book filled with unintentional humour.The result is that her characters are at once children and adults. When taken for a ride in a cariage, her heroin kneels on her trunk and looks out the window, bouncing up and down in her excitement. When Mr. Salteena, whose ambition it is to be a &quot;real gentleman,&quot; is presented at court the Prince of Whales offers him ice cream. When he goes to visit London, Mr. Salteena sees nothing improper about sending the heroin to stay with the hero, unchaperoned.

But unlike its descendants, 'The Young Visiters' wasn't written by an adult ... probably.To my knowledge, there isn't an audiobook version of the full text. But there are a couple of gushing extracts contained on the Naxos compilation '1000 Years of Laughter' which demonstrate that it isn't just the troubled spelling which make the book so amusing. The introduction to those extracts lead us to believe that JM Barrie, who wrote the introduction, could have had much to do with the entire work. Certainly once Barrie had died, she never wrote again, but my feeling is that the nine-year-old Ashford probably was the author. The story is less than 60 pages long, and can be enjoyed in a couple of sittings, then repeatedly re-read.This work is likely to experience a dramatic surge in popularity this year.

When a novel can be read through in a couple of hours and give you laughs on every page, you'd be mad not to buy it. Plus you'll probably want to read it again. There's plenty of information surrounding the background to this unique book, so I won't repeat any of it here. But basically, anyone with an interest in humour, absurd romantic situations, social history and a love of the English language simply has to have a copy of this. The charm of this book lies chiefly in the reading, it cannot be understood by just having it explained to you. Nor does it translate well to filmed adaptation; the recent BBC dramatisation with Jim Broadbent made a real ham-fisted job of it, adding their own extra plot and even making up new dialogue and mis-spellings...unforgivable!!I agree with another reviewer who has mentioned that the J.M. Barrie forward is almost as entertaining as the book itself, drawing attention as it does to many of the best passages.

Does it appeal to Americans or to Britishers who are not familiar with the nuances of social pretensions in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries?Frank Swinnerton, and James Barrie are suspects for being the true authors but there good evidence (although I don't know if it's been recently reevaluated) for Daisy Ashford.The compartments in the Crystal palace in which the nobility live seem to me to be authentic products of nine year old imagination. Small children often come up with gems like that. The ability to create a coherent plot and follow narrative theme for the length of a novel, even if only a sixty page one is unusual for even a talented child. Children are lazy and, even if they write at length, their stories become fragmented, lose their thread, and are often derivative.

The ins and outs of the US space program are a backdrop to the novel.Marooned 1969 is the 2nd with this name. The first, written in 1964, concerned a marooned Mercury astronaut whose retro rockets failed to fire. Caiden then describes the US effort (via a Gemini spacecraft) and the Russian (via a Vostok) to rescue him. The 1969 book updates the hardware and concepts very accurately and with amazing foresight.Caiden is one of the first writers to take current hardward and concepts and write fiction to it...very realistic with novels easy to read. I have to beleive that Tom Clancy took a page out of Caiden's books.I highly recommend the book. If you are a fan of the US space effort, this is like eating ice cream.

In its brief 85 pages, it displays & examines countless mad ideas & intricate, glittering webs of human relationship, all in a simple but literate, elegant prose. It moves as swiftly as any space opera, but there's much more than spaceships & stellar explosions & jut-jawed heroes to be found here. Charles Harness not only anticipates the work of writers such as Samuel Delany & Roger Zelazny, he easily equals their best work.Anna van Tuyl, composer, ballerina, psychiatrist, is struggling to complete the score & dance movements to a piece called \\"The Rose,\\" She's become aware of strange mutations in her body, which she fears will disfigure her ... but they also seem to draw her toward the completion of her work.Assigned to analyze Ruy Jacques, a noted painter, she discovers that he has the same mutations, only more advanced than hers. Already his thoughts are moving in different planes of perception, and he seems to know her innermost needs & desires instinctively.But his insanely jealous & powerful wife, Martha Jacques, is working on a new & deadly weapon that could not only determine the fate of the Universe, but conquer Art in the name of Science. For that eternal philosophical struggle is embodied in their complex, dysfunctional marriage.Preceeding the fabled New Wave of science-fiction by a decade, this novella was finally reprinted in 1969, accompanied by a concise, appreciative forward by Michael Moorcock, one of the New Wave's luminaries. More than 40 years after that reprinting, Moorcock's words remain as perceptive & true as ever. This is a beautiful, witty, above all thought-provoking story of enormous energy & startling images -- and, sadly, out of print once more. But if you value quality work, seek out a used copy -- most highly recommended!Note: This edition includes 2 short stories, the droll \\"The Chessplayers,\\" and the humorous but philosophical \\"The New Reality,\\" which artfully plays with one of the oldest clich&eacute;s of science-fiction. Both are quite enjoyable, but it's \\"The Rose\\" that you'll want, and it's \\"The Rose\\" that will stay with you a long time afterwards."},{"Title":"Rose","review":"\\"The Rose\\" is a collection of short fiction by Charles L. Harness, which was originally published in 1966, though the works themselves are all from the early 50s. Containing just three works of short fiction, a novella, a short story, and a novelette, it is still very much worth seeking out.The first story is a novella titled \\"The Rose\\", which first appeared in the March 1953 edition of \\"Authentic Science Fiction Monthly, #31. It is an interesting work in which Harness pits science against art in the future. The main character is Anna van Tuyl, who is a composer and a psychiatrist, and thus is part of both the science and artistic worlds. Ruy Jacques is firmly in the art camp, and takes great delight in showing up his wife Martha who is the chief proponent of science. This lover's triangle works on two levels, both the human lover level as well as the dynamic between art and science and in both cases it is Anna who is caught in the middle.Science is the villain in this story, as represented by Martha who acts in a cold and vindictive way. Initially, one thinks of art as the positive force in the story, but in fact Ruy has some significant, if more human, problems as well. It is a well written story, and the dialogues between Ruy and Martha are very entertaining, as is the premise that art has preceded scientific learning throughout man's history. It is not difficult to see why this novella was nominated for the Retro Hugo in 2004 for works written in the year 1953.The second story is a short story called \\"The Chessplayers\\", which was originally published in \\"The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\\" in October 1953. This is a nice short humorous story about a chess playing rat, and a chess club which is out to beat the Russians at something. It is the weakest story in the collection, but that is rather easy to do and it is still a very enjoyable read.The last story is \\"The New Reality\\", a novelette which was first published in \\"Thrilling Wonder Stories\\", in December of 1950. This is an intriguing story which has a great premise and then took it in a direction which I didn't expect. A. P. Rogers is a field director for the Censor and investigates scientists who may be close to creating new sensorial which may change the fundamental nature of the universe. This is a very cleverly written piece which uses changes in scientific \\"facts\\" to create a unique and interesting story."},{"Title":"Directions for Communication Discoveries with Ignatius Loyola","review":"The author is also a Jesuit and his insights on the Ignatian Spirituality are deep and help not only the other Jesuits but also the faithful people interested in spiritual matters to improve their own spiritual life"},{"Title":"Industrial Robotics: Technology, Programming, and Applications","review":"This is a core-text of industrial engineering undergraduate studies- a well referenced, attractively presented, comprehensive users guide [pre-1990] to robotics for industrial applications. Beyond that, is the demonstration of the engineering approach to systems development in complex environments (e.g. business) that has a far wider application.Topics addressed include: the fundamentals, robot technology (control systems and components, robot motion analysis and control, robot end-effectors, sensors in robotics, and machine vision), robot programming and languages (including an introduction to AI), applications engineering for manufacturing (robot cell design and control, and economic analysis for robotics), robot applications in manufacturing (material transfer and machine loading/unloading, processing operations, assembly and inspection), implementation principles and issues (including safety, training, maintenance and quality), and social issues and the future of robotics.I suspect that a more recent revised version (if available), would be a similarly useful treatment of the subject."},{"Title":"Global Challenges: An Approach to Environmental, Political, and Economic Problems","review":"Sandler's book is very appealing in that he does not suggest that the panacea for all the world's collective action problems is a supranational government structure. In fact, he recognizes that \\"Nationalism is still alive\\" (Sandler, xiv) and therefore supranational solutions to these problems are unlikely. He searches for those conditions under which nations may act unilaterally (if their stake is large enough) or in a loose confederation to solve these \\"global challenges,\\" rather than calling for an improbable and impractical supranational solution. Furthermore, Sandler's argument is appealing because he is able to apply it to broad variety of international problems-from environment to disease and security issues. In each case, he applies the logic of collective action to suggest the conditions under which progress might be made toward a solution. Most interestingly, Sandler suggests that there are different games at work in many of these collective action problems, each with unique equilibria."},{"Title":"Global Challenges: An Approach to Environmental, Political, and Economic Problems","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It takes the logic of economic theory (primarily economic game theory) and applies it to problems that either are affecting, or potentially will affect, everyone on this planet.

An excellent book that can be read by all people regardless of their knowledge of economics, as everything is explained with the assumption that the reader has never been exposed to the concepts.

Just open it anywhere and start reading. You will be amused. There are bon mots from sports stars and politicos, from singers and actors, and from just about anybody famous or halfway so, most of them English speaking with a smattering of Europeans thrown in for a bit of haute culture.There are &quot;Special Categories&quot; such as Advertising Slogans, Cartoons (just the tag lines, not the drawings, including one of my favorites by Peter Steiner showing a dog at the keyboard of a computer who says to another dog, &quot;On the Internet nobody knows you're a dog.&quot; Oh boy, how true that is!), Film Titles, Misquotations, Opening Lines (of novels mostly) including George Orwell's &quot;It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.&quot; (This, from 1984, is given again under George Orwell.) There's a Thematic Index, &quot;Computers,&quot; &quot;Fashion,&quot; &quot;Love,&quot; etc., and a Keyword Index.Edited by Elizabeth Knowles, who also edits the traditional The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations 5th Ed. (2001), this book might be viewed as a companion to that larger tome. The layout and the organization are similar, but this book is set in a slightly larger type so it is easier to read, but with fewer words per page. The significant difference is that Modern Quotations begins in the twentieth century whereas the larger book knows no time constraints. Consequently, no Karl Marx here, no Charles Darwin, but there is singer Dean Martin who famously observed, &quot;You're not drunk if you can lie on the floor without holding on.&quot;To be fair, I should note that scientists are also quoted, and a lot of them. Richard Dawkins, Albert Einstein, Edward O. Wilson, Stephen Hawking, Richard Feynman, etc. made the grade. And philosophers: Bertrand Russell, Eric Hoffer, Gilbert Ryle, W.V.O. Quine, Yogi Berra, etc. as well, although Thomas Kuhn did not.Some people are here but not at their best (at least in my opinion). For example Satchel Paige reminds us not to look back, &quot;Something might be gaining on you,&quot; which is good, but I would prefer to hear again his advice on the social ramble not being restful. Or in the case of biologist Edward O. Wilson there is just one entry in which he corrects the old idea that the human brain begins as a tabula rasa, and that is only attributed to him by Tom Wolfe; however I would have preferred something like, &quot;It is exquisitely human to make spiritual commitments that are absolute to the very moment they are broken&quot; or &quot;When the gods are served, the Darwinian fitness of the members of the tribe is the ultimate if unrecognized beneficiary&quot;--both from On Human Nature (1978).There is of course a noticeable Brit bias to the selections, especially in the sense that minor British politicians appear but we are spared those of the American sort. In truth, the publishers have a good eye for the English language marketplace and include a number of quotes from Canadians, Indians and Australians.The question arises, if you have the larger, more general Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, should you buy this book? To answer this I compared the number of 20th-century quotations from the larger book with those in this book and found that not only are there a lot more, many of the people quoted are given additional space and sometimes different expressions. In only one case did I find a 20th-century person that appeared in the larger book left out in this one (actress Michelle Pfeiffer who wasn't saying much anyway). On the other hand, Sylvia Plath was cut from ten to eight quotations. But then again Norman Mailer went from four to six.Sometimes there is an improvement in clarity in this volume. Gilbert Ryle is quoting as writing &quot;The dogma of the Ghost in the Machine.&quot; In the larger book this is tagged with the words, &quot;on the mental-conduct concepts of Descartes.&quot; With no Descartes to cross-reference here, we find the very sensible, &quot;the mind viewed as distinct from the body.&quot;Although Editor Elizabeth Knowles does not say so in so many words in her brief Introduction, the criteria for inclusion is not just having said something pithy and striking or funny and penetrating, or even something at all witty. Instead what really counts is that you are or have been famous for at least fifteen minutes (Andy Warhol). So the way to look at a book like this is to take it as a soundbite history of modern times.Bottom line: buy this because it really is an interesting way to view the modern era, and besides the quotables from the likes of, e.g., Johnny Rotten (&quot;We're so pretty, oh so pretty, we're vacant&quot;) and the Spice Girls (&quot;tell me what you really, really want&quot;) are not likely to make the next edition, and because it is what people say, in what context, while being who they are, in reference to some event, that really spells out what it was like to be alive in the twentieth century."},{"Title":"The Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations (Oxford Paperback Reference)","review":"We did not have this book in our library.

The two main characters - Ronnie and Susan have been damaged in some way in their childhood and it shows what can happen when they get older and meet - and the two are soulmates. But this is no love story - it is a brilliant psychological thriller with a lot of emotion and sadness too.The book starts off with an account of Ronnie's life with his single mother Anna, and the nasty family they have to live with in his early childhood - his aunt and her sons are constantly cruel to him and his mother and that has a big influence on his personality. It then goes on give us background on Susan's life, whose mother remarries after her father's death to a man outwardly popular and wealthy in the community but who rapes his step-daughter at night. The story goes through the years of their childhood which sets the scene for the tragedies that are to follow. The pace and build up of when they meet took its time, but it was a very interesting journey getting there and getting to know their characters and motivations as it set the scene for when they finally meet when they are teenagers. I liked their early days together as they really seemed suited to each other, until other events took place.The characters were real, the storylines (particularly Susan's) will make you feel real emotion for her and anger and the cruelty of schoolkids. Despite this she is a strong character. And it also gets frightening and suspenseful towards the end - but we were expecting something like that throughout the whole book and had a few surprises towards the end. Ronnie is a tragic figure, keeping his secrets well hidden from everyone that even I wasn't sure whether he had really done something truly bad as it did allude to it early on, but not until he finally reveals it is his personality really shown for what he is (a sociopath). Despite this I really felt for Susan and in a small way hoped they could stay together, but it could never be after finding out his dark secret and I hoped he could just let her go. Ronnie I found hard to get to know, but that's probably because he had 2 faces and only showed the good side. I found his relationship with his mother to be a bit unnaturall (and its not exactly cool to be a mummy's boy)and he was very submissive towards her. Both his and Susan's mothers were very naive and weak characters. The ending was good too as it left you with some hope for Susan. I highly recommend this book - I read it in two sittings!"},{"Title":"Apple of My Eye","review":"This novel has all the plot and details it needs to be a great story. Intricate circumstances that are mostly believable even if at times rather extreme. There is also a lot of pathos, empathy and compassion. The story of two generations of young people, the first generation becoming grownups, the fathers and mothers of the second generation.The first remark here is that the two younger ones, a boy and a girl, a daughter and a son, are both deprived of their fathers, by different circumstances but the result is the same. This is a characteristic that reveals something about the imagination of the author. The boy is deprived of his father even before birth, a soldier on the way to the front in 1944. The daughter is deprived of hers by his sudden death when she is seven, in front of her eyes due to a massive heart attack. The two mothers have one single problem : to survive and both will reach the same solution : to get married for one and remarried for the other.In the first case it will be with a good man. In the second case with a despicable man. But the only objective was wealth both for themselves and for their children, though it seems to be more for the son than the mother in one case, and definitely for the mother more than the daughter in the other case. The whole book is thus the detailed stories of these two children who become teenagers.The daughter will live on her recollection of her father and suffer the stepfather who is abusing her sexually as long as she is a child. He stops when she gets into puberty. The son will survive with relatives who despise his mother and exploit and humiliate her. What is amazing is that both will develop a killing instinct, in the daughter's case to protect those she loves, and in the son's case to get even with those who make him or those he loves suffer, including by killing an innocent child if necessary.It is possible, for sure, but rather extreme and kind of rather schematic as an explanation : the absent father is an easy and convenient explanation that does not convince many people any more. The real criminal mind has been deprived of his father from birth and raised by his humiliated mother in a constant environment of vexations and insults. And yet we find it hard to believe. Something is missing. It is the deeper personal fantasizing that any mental construction needs in order to exist. In other words there is no depth in these characters' psyches because they are only working along some kind of purely logical line. What's more they speak and they live most of the time with other children or teenagers. And there the novel becomes unbelievable. The children and the teenagers speak the same language as the narrator, as the author, mainly an adult language in perfect oxfordian syntax.And that makes the story cold, even distant. We do not feel these kids, and yet the situations and events should create a lot of pathos, and it does not as much as it could have done. Which explains why the end seems rather artificial. A teenager does not commit suicide out of a whim and certainly not because it follows a logical line. The suicide has been built into the teenager by cicumstances and has been constructed by the consciousness or un-consciousness of the child over many years.A suicide is always the result of a desperate situation but also and at the same time of a long process that makes the child, teenager or adult responsive to the desperate situation that then can trigger the attempt. And that is totally absent from the book. Some may think or say that a suicide can be the result of a very intense and short-lived crisis.This is totally false because only those who have integrated a suicidal tendency and personality will respond that way, and a suicidal personality is in a way the bodydouble that lives behind your own self all along, speaking to your own self and interacting with him, till the crisis comes and then the bodydouble takes over and strikes. Never Ronnie has the beginning of a starting point of such a double personality, of a secret shadow of his public self. It is not enough to be secretive, if he is.In fact someone who is everything but secretive can be suicidal. The second layer of his personality will be kept totally secret and invisible and most people will never know about it. That's the depth that is lacking in all these characters, along with the language of their psyches and age. That's unlucky because once again the plot and events are quite rich and acceptable. It could have been an extremely poignant novel. It is just a good story.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Jewish Law in Gentile Churches: Halakhah and the Beginning of Christian Public Ethics","review":"\\"...one can perceive some suggestive and subtle contributions to the ongoing discussions concerning New Testament ethics with respect to Torah and apologetics. The book as a whole seems to lack comprehensiveness and an overall cohesiveness in its presentation. Many of the chapters are from articles or lectures that he has done for various occassions, and the author readily admits that there were probably many more things he could have read or said. Nevertheless, each chapter and major section is pregnant with possibilities ready to explode into volumes of their own, and the incompleteness served only to further my interest. The bibliography looks impressive and up to date, especially with respect to interactions with new perspective writers. His exegesis, while obviously not free from an interpretive grid, seems reasonable and restrained from dogmatic agendas. Even when he seems critical of protestant/reformed exegetical consensus, his criticisms remain compatible with reformed confession, in my opinion. At some points (e.g. synoptic relationship), he draws from some higher critical assumptions, but in a fashion that is not incompatible with faith and the inerrant authority of Scripture. The reading level is somewhat challenging with its appeals to original languages and modern theological vocabulary, but he usually provides enough context for those who have not been through seminary. Overall, I believe that Bockmuehl provides a convincing case for the underlying Jewishness of Christianity with respect to ethics and public discourse. Those interested in a diachronic and synchronic treatment of biblical natural theology, ethics, and church apologetics should be careful not overlook this book.\\"From an overview and review:"},{"Title":"Football Crazy","review":"In his first book (Diamond Geezers), Williams' protagonist is an ex-soccer hooligan, here, his protagonist is an alcoholic soccer star. Hugely talented and perpetually soused or high, Lee Sweeny appears to have been heavily modeled after real-life superstar Paul Gascoigne (see Granta 45: Gazza Agonistes for a great mini-bio on him). The owners of Lee's unnamed London team, Archie and Gerrard McKay are also drawn from real life, obviously meant to evoke the memory of the Kray twins. The book covers what happens when Lee reaches the end of the line, his marriage to his high-school sweetheart in a shambles, his alcohol and drugs intake at a maximum, his career headed for disaster, his no-good brother back in his life, and a mysterious blackmailer miling him for 10,000 a month. Lee's alcholism and self-destruction are depressingly real, and Williams repeatedly tantalizes the reader with flashes of a nice Lee. There are some nice bits, especially regarding corruption in the Italian Serie A, where lee plays for a few seasons. In the end though, you know they story's a tragedy, and the ending is just too much of a downer."},{"Title":"The rationale of mesmerism","review":"The reviewer purchased the Cornell University Library Digital Collection edition with just big and dark enough type faces to read. No deduction of stars in this case but the Kessinger edition is probably more easily readable. The book cover misspells the author's surname by omitting the second \\"t\\", in contrast to the reprint itself which is correct: \\"Sinnett\\". No deduction for this either but it is a bit annoying.The author starts off quite well and the first 6 chapters are generally quite lucid. From the 7th chapter onwards, A. P. Sinnett increasingly tries to reconcile the phenomena and theory of mesmerism (animal magnetism) to the doctrines of Madame H. P. Blavatsky's theosophism, to which he largely adhered. For a succinct critical analysis of theosophism and of the related subject of spiritism, see Ren&eacute; Gu&eacute;non's books (English translations of the French originals) \\"Theosophy: History of a Pseudo-Religion\\" and \\"The Spiritist Fallacy\\".The specific issue eluding A. P. Sinnett and causing him to \\"unravel\\" in respect of animal magnetism, at worst in the chapter on \\"clairvoyance\\", is the failure to clearly differentiate the spiritual (symbolised by the element of air) from the psychic (symbolised by the element of water). This leads him to amalgamate both in the \\"astral plane\\" and to confuse things further by reference to a \\"higher ego\\" etc.The author does not fail to repeat perhaps the most erroneous \\"new age\\" theosophist dogma, literal belief in what is termed \\"physical reincarnation\\". Authentic traditions do not refer to \\"incarnation\\" but rather to \\"sheaths\\" or \\"envelopes\\", and they clearly distinguish \\"transmigration\\" (voyages of beings amongst an indefinity of universes, of which our own from quarks to mega-galaxies is but one) from \\"metempsychosis\\" (re-use of psychic elements cast off during transmigration, analogous to re-use of matter in bodies).Although at best a fine intellect, the author simply forgot that the spiritual concerns universals, not particulars. The latter are transcended by the realisation of \\"anima mundi\\" (universal soul, param-atma), the \\"mirror\\" reflecting \\"spiritus mundi\\" (universal spirit, Param-Brahma)."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of History","review":"As with a lot of 18/19th century German philosophy (Herder, Kant, etc), you find yourself plopped down into a view of the world animated by such unfathomably large abstract concepts (Spirit, Thought, Will, Essence) that you have to wonder why the author even bothers. Every concept is contingent upon and reduces into every other concept, or evolves into it, or whatever. This is not an attempt at an original inquiry as much as it is Hegel attempting to put together a historical justification for his broader philosophical system by attempting to anatomize the pyschological 'states' of various periods of history, a dubious project, at best. An awful lot of it boils down to this kind of sinister justification for a brand of uber-nationalism which seems eerily reminiscent of what made the first half of the twentieth century such an unbelievable nightmare. Though maybe some of my issues with the text have to do with the Sibree translation, which is piss-poor at best. After reading this, I kind of suspect that Hegel's prominence in Western philosophy has more to do with his creation of a system so byzantine that its nearly impossible to coherently refute (Which means it must be right. Right?) rather than from any profound insight it offers"},{"Title":"The Philosophy of History","review":"Worst book ever written. Run for the hills! Run away! Upon reading, anticipate headaches.

He believes that there has to be reason that cause all the historical events.. That reason is the struggle for freedom of human kinds. This central theme is presented through out the book. The way Hegel present the history is not through chronological order but he present it as being from East to West. This representation of the his history is very interesting in itself. By the time that Hegel wrote Philosophy of History, China was still under imperial rule therefore chinese could have much of the freedom. One of the criticism that I have on Hegel is that he threat the Far East as the strange and unrelated area.. Next interesting point that I found in this book is that the western civilization start from Greek.. (I definitely agree with him because Greek is the birth place of western philosophy, art, and politics).. By the time Roman take over the Europe, the center of culture m! ove from Athens to Rome..(Here, again everything moved from East to West). During the Roman Era, there were struggles of people against imperialism... In the sections about Roman, he wrote about the development of Christianity. As an advocated Christian, Hegel believed that Christianity is the divined political plan for people to be free from Roman Emperor.. (That's my interpretion of the Hegel's section on Christianity. It may be different from Hegel original idea) The last section he used Germany as the example of how modern nation evolved. In other word, he traced the history of Germany from barbaric period, to age of Holy Roman Empire, to the era of Germanic empire.. The transition from Holy Roman Empire to the Germanic Empire is the struggle for freedom from Catholic church by Germanic states..."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of History","review":"This is a work from the full flower of German Idealism. Hegel thought we could trace the history of consciousness by making a specialized study of the historical development of a few (hand selected) civilizations. Hegel makes history more fun, but proving a massive thesis with examples doubly selected to fit (only some facts matter, only some civilizations matter) is suspect. Any thesis based on history seems questionable, as the 'facts' of history are already considerably picked over. For example, historical 'facts' may survive because they are chosen to be recorded by the winners of wars. Some historical facts are survive by accident--depending on which written records still remain.Marx turned Hegel on his head with dialectical materialism, a Marxist joke on Hegel's dialectical idealism. However, I think knowledge of Hegel isn't essential to understand Marxist philosophy. Hegel is essential background for Kierkegaard's works. Hegel is also a background source for deconstructionism, that modern haven of 'historical facts selected to fit the theory.'"},{"Title":"The Philosophy of History","review":"This book was wonderful. It shouldn't be read as a history but more as a philosophy. Even there, it is a bit short of the greats. Why then do I call it wonderful? It is a view into the past intelligentsia. His history is antiquated; from a modern perspective some of it is wrong. However, it is great to see the history of views about history and the philosophy of them. I am not a pursuer of the P.C., and understand that the context of civilization, at his time, is the molder of his views. Old books such as this are windows into time and are treasures to be cherished. As far as his philosophy I intend to read more of his work in the future to get a better perspective, but I found it interesting. I am on board with Hegel in that we should pursue our Ideal of the Greek Golden Era to maintain a lofty goal for civilization. Which can be summed up by Thucydides in his description of Athenian life; &quot;We love the beautiful, but without ostentation or extravagance; we philosophize without being seduced thereby into effeminacy and inactivity (for when men give themselves up to Thought, they get further and further from the Practical--from activity for the public, for the common weal). We are bold and daring; but this courageous energy in action does not prevent us from giving ourselves an account of what we undertake (we have a clear consciousness respecting it); among other nations, on the contrary, martial daring has its basis in deficiency of culture: we know best how to distinguish between the agreeable and the irksome; notwithstanding which, we do not shrink from perils.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Philosophy of History","review":"In his Philosophy of History, Hegel stated, \\"Philosophy concerns itself only with the glory of the Idea mirroring itself in the History of the World. . . . [W]ith all the changing scenes, the History of the World . . . is this process of development and the realization of Spirit - this is the true Theodicaea, the justification of God in History. (Hegel, 457) As stated in the previous review, Hegel's Philosophy of History has impacted the modern historian of past decades as well as the postmodern historian of more recent decades. Hegel's worldview and resulting philosophy of history can be better understood within the cultural context of Hegel's homeland of Germany, especially in the areas of Pietism and German idealism.In his work, Christianity Through the Centuries, Earle Cairns explains that in Germany, Lutheranism of the of seventeenth century emphasized the intellectual aspect of religion. The cold orthodoxy of Lutheranism resulted in Pietism, which emphasized the subjective aspect of man's relation to God. Cultivation of a pious life included good works as an expression of true religion. Pietism emphasized prayer and individual Bible study with the Holy Spirit as an Illuminator of the Bible. (Cairns, 272, 413) Hegel stated, \\"Luther repudiated the authority of the Church, setting up in its stead the Bible and the testimony of the Human Spirit.\\" (Hegel, 416-417) Hegel's background of Pietism seems to have influenced his view of Luther's role in the Church.Within Pietism, indifference to doctrine led to some adopting the philosophy of idealism. (Cairns, 272, 413) Where the Enlightenment appealed to human reason, Romanticism appealed to human imagination, which was capable of recognizing the profound sense of mystery which arises from realizing that the human mind cannot comprehend the finite world, let alone infinity. Human subjectivity and inwardness were now seen as a mirror of the infinite. Confident that they could know the inner secrets of absolute reality, the idealists concluded that all objects of knowledge, and indeed the whole universe, are the products of an absolute subject, an Absolute Mind. (McGrath, 227-228 & Stump, 306, 316) Hegel conceived history as the \\"development of humankind's awakening consciousness.\\" (Nash, 109-112) Romanticism identified the infinite with human subjectivity and inwardness. Hegel likewise described the history of philosophy as the development of the Absolute's self-consciousness in the mind of humanity.Hegel defined truth as the synthesis of humanity's subjective will (their own thinking) and the universal Will (which is objectified in the laws and organization of the State). Hegel believed the World Spirit is working out its own freedom throughout the process of history. When humans act feely, they advance self-consciousness in their nation. Different eras of history manifest different degrees of freedom which become incarnate in one nation at a time. (Nash, 109-112) Hegel spoke of the rational will of the whole society, yet he viewed morality as an element in the dialectic process representing the relation between freedom and duty, between the universal will and the individual will. Stumpf explains that for Hegel, the highest freedom occurs when the individual acts according to the universal, rational will of the whole society. In his Philosophy of History, Hegel used examples of various peoples who represented \\"three moments in the development of freedom.\\" (Stumpf, 312-316) Hegel described these three moments in terms of the Orient, the Mediterranean, and Hegel's own Christian Germany.Hegel identified the Orient as the first moment, which included the immersion of Spirit in natural life. In all the pagodas, the Brahmins instruct prostitutes and dancing girls. \\"Theological doctrine - relation of religion to morality - is here altogether out of the question.\\" (Hegel, 157) The State appeared first in [China and India] as an immediate, natural unity - as a despotism. Because the form of government was an absolute monarchy, freedom in such Asian states was merely potential. (Nash, 113) The Orientals knew nothing of freedom except that the potentate alone could do what he wished. (Stumpf, 315) As stated earlier, Hegel described the history of the world in terms of \\"changing scenes.\\"During the second moment of Hegel's history, the scene shifted from the Orient to the Mediterranean. Hegel explained that \\"God not appear to the Greeks in the flesh. . . . [b]ecause man was not duly estimated, did not obtain honor and dignity, till he had more fully elaborated and developed himself.\\" (Hegel, 249) The nations of Greece and Rome rejected despotism in favor of aristocracy / democracy. Among the Greeks, the notion of law was the important innovation. (Nash, 113) Although the Greeks and Romans knew the concept of citizenship, they limited this status only to a few and regarded others as being by nature slaves. (Stumpf, 315) Since only some were subject to law in Greece, the essential rights of all people were not yet recognized. Therefore, freedom for the Greeks was an accident. (Nash, 113)In the third moment of Hegel's history, the scene shifted from the Mediterranean to Germany. Within the Christian Germany of Hegel's time, the Pietists emphasized the subjective rather than the objective. The subjectivism within Pietism seemed to merge with Hegel's interpretation of Lutheranism. Hegel believed the Lutheran understanding of Truth \\"is not a finished and completed thing; the subject himself must be imbued with Truth, surrendering his particular being in exchange for the substantial Truth, and making that Truth his own. . . . In the Lutheran church the subjective feeling and the conviction of the individual is regarded as equally necessary with the objective side of Truth. As subjective Spirit gains emancipation in the Truth, Christian Freedom is actualized. (Hegel, 416-417) Hegel believed freedom reached its full realization in his homeland of Germany. In his final chapter, Hegel described the Modern Time of Germany in terms of Reformation, political development, as well as Illumination and Revolution.In his discussion of Reformation in Germany, Hegel stated, \\"That harmony [of Objective and Subjective Will] which has resulted from the painful struggles of History, involves the recognition of the Secular as capable of being an embodiment of Truth; whereas it had seen formerly regarded as evil only, as incapable of Good--the latter being considered essentially ultramundane. It is now perceived that Morality and Justice in the State are also divine and commanded by God, and that in point of substance there is nothing higher or more sacred.\\" (Hegel, 422) Hegel seems to elevate the secular state as the most true, the most sacred of all substances.In his discussion of political development in Germany, Hegel described a certain phenomenon common between the Catholic and the Protestant world as a tendency of the human mind to regard \\"the Inward, the Abstract, and the Religious element\\" as \\"utterly alien to the secular.\\" As man awakened to the \\"lively consciousness of his subjective life and the inward origin of his volition,\\" he considered his \\"belief in Evil, as a vast power the sphere of whose malign dominion is the Secular.\\" (Hegel, 425) Hegel seems to reject the dualism of Plato (between the temporal and the eternal).In his discussion of Illumination and Revolution, Hegel used the term Eclairissement (Aufklarung) when referring to Reason. He defined Reason as \\"the Laws of Nature and the substance of what is right and good.\\" (Hegel, 441) For Hegel, the dialectic process in the ethical sphere is constantly moving toward a synthesis of subjective spirit and objective spirit, towards knowledge of the Absolute. Since the Absolute is disclosed in Nature and in the human mind, human reason can reach the inner essence of the Absolute. (Stumpf, 307, 312-316) For Hegel, human reason is sufficient for knowledge of the Absolute. Hegel seems to ignore the Christian understanding of faith.Hegel described his homeland of Germany in terms of Reformation, political development, as well as Illumination and Revolution. Hegel described the \\"Essence of the Reformation: Man is in his very nature destined to be free.\\" (Hegel, 416-417) In Hegel's own Christian Germany, he believed, the state rose out of the particular forms of freedom existing in the past into universal freedom. In the constitutional governments of his day, all men were free. (Nash, 113) Hegel's description of modern Germany as a sacred state pointed to the Reformation as the basis for man's freedom.Hegel's understanding of freedom is a primary theme in his political theory of the state as well as his social theory of the family. Within Hegel's theory of the state, man's freedom begins with the single unit of the family wherein individuals grow up, leave the family, and enter into that larger context of similar individuals that is called civil society. These individuals now chart out their own lives and have their own purposes. (Stumpf, 313)One feminist writer, Patricia Jagentowicz, points out that Hegel \\"excludes woman from the spheres of civil society and the state, the spheres in which man manifests his freedom.\\" (Mills, 81) In her review of Feminist Interpretations of G. W.F. Hegel, Elke Heckner described Hegel's social and political theory as \\"extremely influential within political philosophy. . . . Hegel's theory of the state has shaped two current versions of political theory: standard versions which ignore the role of sexual difference in Hegel and feminist revisionist interpretations of Hegel.\\"A second feminist writer, Heidi M. Ravven, points out that Hegel's concept of the family is superseded by civil society and government. Hegel considered the \\"piety of the hearth\\" as a \\"profoundly subjective state of feeling. The immediate and undifferentiated reconciliation of self and other in feeling that characterized the family is precisely similar to the customary harmonious political life of the ancients as Hegel describes it in The Philosophy of History.\\" (Ravven, 234-235) Although a prevalent theme in Hegel's history of the world seems to be the ultimate goal of freedom, feminist interpretations of Hegel indicate that his concept of freedom did not include freedom for women.Seyla Benhabib writes from a secular perspective, stating that Hegel rejected the notion that gender definitions are naturally defined. Nevertheless, the concept of the European nuclear family is reflected in his acknowledgement of functional complementarity between genders in the modern state. The female is confined to the private sphere and the man (due to his superiority) is in the public sphere. Hegel considers men and women to be spiritually different, defining women as \`lesser' human beings. Like Plato and Aristotle, Hegel not only assigns particularity, intuitiveness, passivity to women and universality, conceptual thought, and \`the powerful and active' to men, but sees in men the characteristics that define the species as human.\\" (Benhabib, 29-31) In his discussion of political development in Germany, Hegel seems to reject the dualism of Plato (between the temporal and the eternal).Joan Burgess writes from a Christian perspective. She explains that \\"Mind/body dualism has tended to equate femaleness with the body, with nature, and with the earth. Maleness has been equated with the spiritual, the intellectual, and the cultural. Women's bodies are also commonly viewed as sources of sinfulness; therefore, denigration of the body and bodily experience is equated with pursuit of spirituality. That which is corporeal and natural is regarded as inferior to that which is spiritual and cultural. Van Leeuwen points out that any view of women as inferior cannot be supported biblically. (Winfrey, 153-154)In the nineteenth century, the conception of the Bible as an ethical guidebook became fashionable due to the influence of German idealistic philosophy. (Cairns, 444)Hegel believed the highest duty in Scripture is the command to love God and to know God. He stated that in his day, public opinion had shifted from the question of knowing God to the doctrine that it is impossible to know God. (Hegel, 14)For Hegel, the history of the world developed as a \\"rational process, constituting the rational necessary course of the World-Spirit - that Spirit whose nature is always one and the same, but which unfolds thus its one nature in the phenomena of the world's existence, . . . presenting itself as the ultimate result of History. (Hegel, 10) One scholar describes Hegel's Geist. . . as \\"a transindividual principle that unfolds in history.\\" Geist. . . transforms nature into a second world, externalizing \\"itself in history by . . . shaping the given such as to make it correspond to itself, to make it embody its own subjectivity, that is, reason and freedom.\\" (Benhabib, 29) Hegel's statements indicate his belief that human reason is sufficient for knowledge of the Absolute. Hegel seems to ignore the Christian understanding of faith.The Christian historian John Warwick Montgomery criticizes Hegel for his error in purporting to deduce historical substance and goal from reason itself. . . . The [Hegelian] dialectic can describe a continual refinement of evil as well as a continual refinement of good. Hegel's chief error is his \\"conviction that the historical dialectic is moving toward the specific goal of freedom.\\" (Montgomery, 18-19, 30) Although a prevalent theme in Hegel's history of the world seems to be the ultimate goal of freedom, feminist interpretations of Hegel indicate that his concept of freedom did not include freedom for women.In his introduction, Hegel stated, \\"God governs the world; the actual working of his government--the carrying out of his plan--is the History of the World.\\" (Hegel, 36)Hegel concluded his work by stating \\"Philosophy concerns itself only with the glory of the Idea mirroring itself in the History of the World. (Hegel, 457) In his work, The Meaning of History, Nash sated that Hegel honestly believed the history of ideas had reached its fulfillment in his system, which, if so, would bring about a frightening proximity between Hegel's mind and the mind of God. (Nash, 106)Stumpf believes the power of Hegel's thought can be measured by the fact that most 20th-century philosophy represents ways of revising or rejecting aspects of his absolute idealism. (Stumpf, 302) Ultimately, Hegel's Idealism and its goal of freedom theoretically elevated the State over God, resulting in a practical loss of freedom for several generations of those living under totalitarian systems of government.Although Hegel's description of modern Germany as a sacred state pointed to the Reformation as the basis for man's freedom, Hegel's description of the State as the ultimate expression of truth and morality, the most sacred of all substances, seems to be the embodiment of his World Spirit. Hegel's concept of the State was instrumental in the development of Marxism with its denial of freedom for both men and women.Freedom for men and women can only be found in God whose truth and righteousness transcends His creation. In Acts 5:29 we read, \\"We ought to obey God rather than man.\\" The government of God over his creation supersedes any government established by man."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of History","review":"Having just read the introduction (which is the theoretical core of the work), and having read a different translation, I can safely say that Sibree's translation progresses about as smoothly as one sloshing around in a Turtle(tm) pool full of runny egg-whites with three Sumatran carpet- sharks tied to one's back. This is an essential philosophical text; but try and get just the introduction (*Reason and History,* translated by Robert Hartman on Macmillan/Lib.

He angered some people by saying that History is Freedom, and so those countries which did not have Free States (in 1821, the year he wrote his book) were not truly part of History but part of the Pre-historic period. He begins with a narrative of Africa in 1821 which was steeped in Slavery, both internal and external. He stated that all nations were once at this level of Pre-history, where no king could last more than a year. But China was the first nation to make One but only One Person free, namely, the Emperor. This was the beginning of History. From this point Hegel traces those nations which increased Freedom slowly - from Egypt to Assyria to Babylon to Persia to Greece to Rome to Spain and then Europe as we know it today. The Idea of a Free Republic was born in Greece, but was first made material in Rome. Caesar opposed the Republic because he knew that the fullness of time had not yet come for it; so he opened up barbarian Europe instead. The Free Republic eventually grew to a point where a great, courageous World Historical Individual, Napoleon Bonaparte, overthrew the Medieval structures and paved the way for the eventual abolition of Slavery. Hegel was an Abolitionist and lived to see England and Spain renounce Slavery, but died long before Lincoln, so his view of the USA was pretty pessimistic."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of History","review":"Hegel's lectures on History (along with those of his on Law) probably represent the most accessible introduction to the thought of this very important German idealist.Hegel's ideas on history and social organisation and Law had a critical influence on many key 19th and 20th century Philosophers, including Karl Marx, Isaiah Berlin and Karl Popper. While some philosophers followed Hegel, many also vigorously rejected his ideas and thought, and it is only more recently Hegel is undergoing a kind of rehabilitation in Philosophy.This reaction though is understandable since Hegel is a very difficult philosopher to both read and understand. His prose is certainly in my experience the most awfully written and most obscure of any philosopher, and much of the time Hegel seems to be writing nonsense which makes little sense (especially in his more idealist works like phenomeology of spirit). It is understandable then why Schopenhauer called him a 'charlatan' who spouted nothing but 'sophistry' which ruined the intellectual background of Germany, and Bertrand Russell said his philosopy stems from a 'set of simple logical mistakes.'Nevertheless Hegel is a great Philosopher, and the fact he is extremely obscure does not invalidate some very original and profound and interesting ideas which are to be found in his philosophy, especially in his notion of the dialectic, of Spirit manifesting itself through history and historical events, of his interesting reaction to Kant, his ideas on Art and the reactions to his philosophy from students like Marx. His idealism also influenced important philosophers like Fichte and Schelling in the 19th century, and in the 20th century idealists such as McTaggart, F.H. Bradley, and J.N. Findlay, who built on his thought and provided valuable new philosophical ways of thinking about the Absolute and in bringing religion and mystical experience back into a better relationship with Philosophy, given much of Philosophy since the time of Hume has savagely attacked religion as meaningless nonsense. In the 21st century, it is probably Hegel's thought on ethics, art, history and religion which have the most relevance."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of History","review":"Philosophy of History is Hegel's most accessible introduction to his thought.The introduction and preface are the most valuable parts of the book.Much of the book is only of historical interest.

There are racist and jingoist views in this book that seriously date it.On the other hand, the book clearly expresses Hegel's spiritual philosophy of an evolving God who learns from the history of the world that is his thought.For those who are looking for an introduction to Hegel that is written in his own words, this book is invaluable."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of History","review":"(The page numbers come from the Brittanica Great Books Series, volume 46).Hegel is trying to overcome the dilemma that social life poses: per man's subjective life the important thing is freedom of spirit. However, man also lives in community and the norms of the community often bind his freedom of spirit (it is to Hegel's credit that he recognized this problem generations before Nietszche and the existentialists).Given Hegel's commitment about the fulfillment of spirit, it follows that communities grow. As seen above, Hegel's applies to history the problem of self-fulfillment. How does man realize the fulfillment of the Idea?Eastern Cultures: Hegel notes that these cultures--India, China, Persia, Egypt--were unable to bring about a harmony of spirit and sense. The Greek world developed from the Oriental world because it was able to embody Geist in such a way to emancipate spirit from \\"dead matter\\" (258).Jews: realization that God is pure, subjective Spirit. Ends up negating finite reality.Greek: opposite of Jewish mentality. Harmonizes God with \\"natural expression.\\" Ends up with idolatry. Greek polis is pariochial. Each state his its own God. A universal realization of spirit is thus impossible. Men were identified with Greek state. Democracy natural expression. There is a necessary contradiction within the Greek polis: only represents a part of finite reality.Romans: Origin of the idea as \\"Person,\\" bearer of \\"abstract right\\".Christianity: the finite subject and absolute spirit can be reconciled. The task of history is to make this reconciliation public--this is the Church.Germans: they were to take it to the next stage.The rest of European history is a working out these processes, a transformation of institutions. It is hear that we see feudalism, etc. At this point we need to correct a mistake about Hegel: Hegel is not saying that world history climaxes with Prussian Germany. There is no sensible way he could have believed that. Germany was weak and defeated when he wrote (it would have been interesting and perhaps more perceptive to say that Russia was the bearer of the World Spirit, especially in light of 20th century politics). Nonetheless, as Hegel notes and as his critics routinely miss, history did take an interesting turn in the 19th century and the force of ideas does not simply stop because the historian wants them to stop.Monarchy and the StateHegel sees \\"the state\\" as the mode in which the individual enjoys his freedom, but only in the sense of the willing according to the whole. In order to avoid confusion, Hegel must be seen as continuing Herder's thoughts: healthy states are organic outgrowths of individuals and communities (170).Another term of possible confusion is Hegel's use of \\"constitution.\\" By it he does not mean the vehicle of salvation that American conservatives think. A constitution is simply how society is arranged and not necessarily on paper (173).Hegel writes, \\"Now monarchy is that kind of constitution which does indeed unite the members of a body politic in the head of government as in a point; but regards that head neither as the absolute dictator nor the arbitrary ruler, but as a power whose will is regulated by the same principle of law as the obedience of the subject (208).American constitutionalists love to pretend that monarchy = despotism, but Hegel demonstrates that this is not the case. If we judge the world on how modern America develops, we will fail to understand Hegel. In Hegel's time, as per most of history, societies were often ethnically unified along a cultural (usually religious) center. Because of that, the monarch usually would not will something to the detriment of his subjects. Today's America, however, is officially predicated on the negation of that unifying center and Americans, even (especially!) conservatives, cannot understand that.Hegel warns of the chaos of the Republicanism that plagued Greece and Rome. While it is good that man is free and makes decisions, the problem arises when all men are free and make decisions that contradict one another. This kind of Republicanism necessarily leads to oligarchy, for the the individual with the most power and money will make the most powerful decision (and thus negate the weaker individual's decision and free choice). By contrast, Hegel points to the monarch as the final arbiter (281).ConclusionThis is probably the best place to start with Hegel. One should consult a history of philosophy manual and get reasonably familiar with Hegel's terms. Having done that, this text is fairly easy to read, if somewhat boring at times."},{"Title":"The Philosophy of History","review":"An OCR copy should not be the first copy to come up on Amazon's site.

The most modern thing about her is her E-mail account. Other than that, life's just like it was 30 years or so ago ... playing imaginary games with scooters for horses; \\"quicksand\\" to be pulled from, jigsaw puzzles that will explode if they aren't finished on time. And, of course, hanging out with your best friend. Grownups don't get to do that nearly as often as kids do.Dora's best friend is named Ally.

The only thing I would have changed is the suddenness of the book's ending. But some people may think that is perfectly appropriate.One factor which should be noted is the extraordinary care given to the words. Not just what Dora writes, but HOW she writes it. The whole book is her diary (complete with a little flap that \\"locks\\" it). The text is all written in the laborious printing of a child. Take a good look at that and you'll realize it's at least 10 times harder to do when you're an adult and have learned penmanship, than when you were a child and were just starting out writing extensively.There are lots of watercolor paintings showing Dora and her friends as well. Dora has very big brown eyes and always dresses in a red pants outfit. The outfit threw me for a minute, but hey, it's the 21st century now! Dora is also left-handed (I think the author must be, too). There are many bonus items thrown in as Dora draws little pictures all around the margins of her diary.

It covers her experimenting God in her bathroom where no one would know...sounds like a lot of us: \\"If I do that, someone might see and think I'm crazy!\\" God meets you where you are, as long as your heart is in the right place.It talks about miracles from health, to food and oil multipling; in our day. It also talks about praying and nothing happens, but don't give up. It shares about God giving directions and then people follow those directions even if it seems impossible and takes 9 months to figure out what the directions were talking about.I helps me to be excited about Gods things, and to practice on myself, if I'm the only one around :-) ! And for me, just because I can't figure it out right away, it doesn't mean I should think God was not in it.

God answers the sincerity of our hearts when we cry out for more of the power of the Holy Spirit- He answered Cindy Jacobs and He will answer you as well and fill you with power. An apparent difference author Jacobs noticed after receiving the Holy Spirit was the Scriptures came alive. Skepticism changed to radical belief when she received prayer in church, fell under the power of God, and was instantly healed of her headache.Her diligent study of the Scriptures provided answers and her simple child- like faith took God at His word. She challenges us as follows: \\"I want to challenge you to include the laying on of hands in every part of your life. You don't have to have a huge measure of faith to begin. Simply do it because it is in the Bible and God said to do it!\\"Included will answer questions and provide information on the following:- How do you learn to test what you think to be a supernatural experience?-Just how does the gift of discerning of Spirits operate? What are things that negate the effectiveness of discernment?-Tips on how to flow in prophetic evangelism- Facts about angelsYou will read about the early pioneers that led the miraculous with signs and wonders including John Lake, John Alexander, Maria Woodworth-Etter, Smith Wigglesworth, and Aimee Semple McPherson.A vision from an angel told her she would lead a company of women who would preach the gospel, do miracles, and transform the nations. Since then her world- wide ministry and television program has transformed the lives of countless women. Cindy Jacobs will go into detail about wonders, the examples of how it is displayed, and draw from Scriptural accounts to reiterate it's unique design within the miraculous. Her personal experiences shared will speak volumes about her tenacity, fearless approach to situations, and her extreme desire to do and be all God has called her to.

It all started with a man's death. Loving to stay faithful and loyal to his partner, Rafe promises to take care of things!

And so problems begin right from there! How can our hero, Rafe make Anne believe the story of her father's death, and in what he told him to do? And if she did believe him, how will he keep the big-headed man and his salty men away from her? And most of all, Will he succeed in doing all that? If you're not interested enough, I'll be happy to say that that ain't all what's in store. Louis L'Amour always finish it with a handful of spice on each story he writes! Go get it, and you won't regret it!.."},{"Title":"Crossfire Trail","review":"When it comes to reading Louis L'Amour the modern western fan is faced with having to take things in context. Remember that L'Amour's works were primarily written in the fifties and sixties and, as a result, have a certain &quot;dignity&quot; about them that no longer applies with the westerns of today, especially those on the big screen.Take CROSSFIRE TRAIL for example. There is plenty of action here but it is painted much more subtly on L'Amour's canvass than, let's say, on those of Larry McMurtry or on Clint Eastwood's or Kevin Costner's movie screens. Frankly L'Amour or his readers would not have tolerated the raw, often harsh violence of today's western s offerings.L'Amour wrote with a clear sense of nostalgia and romance about the west. He was much for the kindred spirit of John Wayne and John Ford than of McMurtry, Eastwood or Costner.I thoroughly enjoyed CROSSFIRE TRAIL, a tale of revenge, deceit and, as is the case with all L'Amour tales, of ultimate white-hatted triumph and justice. The fan of the movie of the same title, starring Tom Selleck, should note that there are some differences between the screenplay and the book. But all in all the story is the same and is just as enjoyable in print as the story told on the big screen. Read it in the correct mindset and you have a masterpiece.Douglas McAllister"},{"Title":"Crossfire Trail","review":"Louis L'Amour often wrote novels of men whose strength of character was their best redeeming quality although they were handy with guns and were rough and tough when it mattered. Rafe Caradec's promise to a dying man kicks off this tale that begins on a ship and plays out in Wyoming amid lawless men and unfriendly Indians. The story has touches of romance and plenty of shootouts and fistfights, and as usual, the bad guys get what's coming to them. Caradec does seem to good to be true but the tale is a good read and ranks as one of his best western yarns."},{"Title":"Crossfire Trail","review":"Louis L'Amour may not have had the prettiest writing style but his westerns had such an easy and relatable accessability to them that readers readily snapped them up. And, actually, L'Amour's love of the wild west and the old frontier was so palpable that many passages of his novels did end up reading like poetry. I've read most of his stuff and, bar none, this guy is my favorite writer of westerns (well, okay, Zane Grey, as well). CROSSFIRE TRAIL is just one sample of L'Amour's ability to transport the reader back to the old west, when your word meant a whole lot more, when men were hardy (and probably very dusty) and a trusty horse and a well-oiled pistol determined life or death. I'm sure things weren't so black and white back then or that simple, but L'Amour drew a clear line between the dastardly and the heroic. And, always, always, he told an exciting story.L'Amour's protagonists are basically all cut from the same mold. Much like how one takes it for granted that mystery author Dick Francis's heroes are inevitably urbane, unassuming, and grittily resolute in the face of adversity, Louis L'Amour almost without exception writes his leading men as lean, tall, strong, upright and very capable. They're all heller with a gun, peerless in a brawl and savvy in the ways of the west. Rafe Caradec, the central character of CROSSFIRE TRAIL, fits all this to a T. In the parlance of his time, Caradec is a man to ride the river with.CROSSFIRE TRAIL was published in 1954, and it's a testament to L'Amour's skills and timeless appeal that this story doesn't at all read as dated. It's a fast-paced story of survival in the wilderness and a reckoning in Wyoming. Rafe Caradec, on the surface, is a rough sort, skilled with a gun and with his fists. A man of commanding presence, he escapes from forced shipboard labor, vowing to keep a promise he made to Charles Rodney, a dead friend left behind. Rafe makes his way to Wyoming, set on looking up and protecting Rodney's family and wresting back Rodney's ranch, of which ownership is currently in question. In the tiny cowtown of Painted Rock, Rafe Caradec runs into a world of trouble.He learns quickly that Painted Rock is controlled by a gang of scoundrels and stone cold killers. Worse, the gang's conniving head honcho, Bruce Barkow, is engaged to Rodney's beautiful daughter, Ann. Worse than that? Ann doesn't at all believe Rafe's story and instead suspects that Rafe is out to get the ranch for himself. But Rafe is not without unexpected facets. He's able to buffalo the thugs with mere talk (even if it's talk bolstered by the threat of imminent violence). In a courtroom scene, he smoothly acquits himself from a charge of murder. Gradually, Rafe begins to turn the tide. And, naturally, Bruce Barkow, slated initially as the book's prohibitive Big Bad, persists in resorting to underhanded means. But someone lurks in the wings and, as it turns out, this hombre is a lot worse and far more frightening than Barkow.To add more texture to the thing, the Sioux hover somewhere in the backdrop and there's the mystery of why Barkow so covets Rodney's land. CROSSFIRE TRAIL, like most of L'Amour's novels, reads like a bullet and offers plenty of Rafe Caradec bracing his enemies, resulting in blazing gunplay and a hellacious brawl or two or three. And while L'Amour never was one to get muddied too much in epic love story, he does throw in the occasional romantic spark. Let's just say, it's not too long before Ann Rodney begins to have serious misgivings about her shifty fiance.No surprises in this book, as CROSSFIRE TRAIL isn't really Louis L'Amour at his tiptop best. But nonetheless this is a pretty riveting no-frills read, and it's a lot of fun watching the dangerous Rafe Caradec outtalking, outthinking, and outfighting those what done him and his friends wrong. Reading Louis L'Amour's vivid descriptions of the lay of the land and the people inhabiting it, you can't help but soak in the old west atmosphere and the rugged culture. As usual, L'Amour tacks descriptive sobriquets onto several of his characters (Texas Brisco, Bully Borger, Gee Bonaro, Trigger Boyne), catchy nicknames being an element prevalent in the western mythos. And, as well, the occasional homespun vernacular lends one more touch of authenticity. I've said this elsewhere, there's Zane Grey and there's Louis L'Amour. In my eyes, every other western writer takes a back seat."},{"Title":"Crossfire Trail","review":"&quot;Law was still largely a local matter&quot;.

Not because of the tough and gritty &quot;Howdy Pardner&quot; kind of cowboy, but because I find him funny, his characters likeable, his books a quick read and an amazing escape from reality. Sometimes, too many of the books I read are too serious, or too dramatic, or too thought provoking, but Louis Lamour can be counted on for straight facts. There is always a bank robber, and always a person who &quot;needed killin'&quot; and always a damsel in distress or a least a damsel who catches the main character's eye.

The story opens as four Westerners flee from Baskul to avoid a oncoming war. Soon they find themselves highjacked and deposited by the valley of the blue moon also known as Shangri la. The story line then follows the lead character (Conway) and the supporting characters as they struggle to understand the valley, their place in the world and ultimately they must decide to either stay in the valley or return the outside world. Obviously written for the pre-WWII generation Hilton brings to the front the philosophical ideas of peace and warnings of \\"man's upcoming struggle that will eventually destroy civilization\\".The story line is dated and one can, at times, question it's political correctness but it's a good, quick read for anyone interested in religion and spiritual matters. I saw the movie years ago and liked it. After reading the book I would have to say that I like the book more."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"How convenient that Shangri-la has so much gold that it can afford bringing in extravagant outside goods like the bathtubs from Ohio. Apart from that obvious weakness in the plot, though, this is still a pleasant book, and the reason Hilton gives us for Shangri-la's existence -- a refuge for civilization during the next war -- is a haunting one considering the book's being written so close to World War II, and then doubly haunting considering its eventual nullification by the atom bomb (whose effects could reach Shangri-la and destroy it along with the rest of the world). The novel is somewhat long on talk and short on action, and all but the main character are too one-dimensional (hence I must downgrade to a &quot;6&quot;), but you're still better off reading it than not.

The carefully hidden monastery is an incredible Shangra-la, but some of them are unwilling to accept paradise, and a plot to escape is quickly collaborated. Escaping and trying to survive in an unknown land is a great adventure story by itself, and Milton's choice of characters shows a great understanding and disappointment for human kind as a whole. But some of the characters rise above this abyss and demonstrate a great optimism, and a chance for a tattered war torn world to survive. This book is an all time classic, and shows that the state of the world hasn't really changed in 75 years.

The only quibble I have is that the American character, Barnard, talks like a British version of an American, and so is unconvincing to this Idahoan.

But in the years since, the book has grown a bit outdated and upon second reading it's not quite the five-star novella that one recalls.I loved this book when young and hadn't read it in at least 25 years--when I recently picked it up again I was surprised by many things I hadn't noticed before. The author has not just created an ideal world where time slows down, but has also created a place where there is no right or wrong, Christianity (and Catholicism) are changed to the point where they become meaningless, and war is always just beyond the horizon. There are also references to everything being done in moderation in this perfect world, including vices such as doing drugs and having sex with strangers. It isn't quite the spiritually uplifting message that some claim it is.All these years later the message of the book now seems odd--it paints an almost perfect world where everyone gets along by allowing some people to get away with doing what is now considered wrong. It says that the way to live longer is to give up all your passions and become passionless. That seems the opposite of conclusions from studies about people who age successfully today.Having seen the 1970s movie more recently than I had last read the book, I was surprised how different the film story was. In some ways I like some of the movie's changes better. In comparison, the book doesn't flow as well (using an opening and closing narration), but that was Hilton's style to intentionally make the narrative rather choppy and even understated. He did it in Goodbye Mr. Chips and it happens again here.Today his writing style seems dated and it takes awhile to get fully into this book. He is still a great author who raised fascinating issues in this book, especially as they apply to what was happening just before World War II. If you give it time the last half speeds by to a very intriguing conclusion."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"My interest in reading Lost Horizon came from having seen the Frank Capra film several times. I was aware that the produces of the film had tried to remain as close to the book as possible but I found the differences between the book and the film to be refreshing.Lost Horizon is a riveting book that is difficult to put down. One might classify the book as part adventure, part philosophy in the blending of the exotic location and Christian and Buddhist beliefs. It is needless to say that the book is well written; the chapter I found of highest interest is Robert Conway's conversation with the High Lama. The writing of that chapter was so very natural and the discussion of such interest it was like being an observer of the scene, and was a chapter I did not want to break.The characters of the four kidnapped people, Mallinson, Miss Brinklow, Barnard and Conway are subtly drawn and their different reactions to Shangri-La are interesting. Miss Brinklow wants to create a Christian mission, Barnard is eluding the law and happy to have found a safe haven and Mallinson cannot be reconciled with the peaceful paradise of the lamasery; but it is Conway, of course, who has center stage. The character of Conway, a world-weary man who discovers that Shangri-La as a place of destiny, must reflect much from the personality of James Hilton. Conway is very complex; a person who has wisdom beyond his years but is not, as he confesses, a hero and is partly a coward. Indeed, Conway's firm decision to remain at Shangri-La is successfully changed by Mallinson. The conversation between the High Lama and Conway expresses many ideas that applied to Hilton's time and also to the present day. The description by the High Lama of the \\"coming storm\\" struck me as appropriate for today. In Hilton's time there was the threat of war on a vast scale as Japan had its eye on occupying large parts of China and the rise of Fascism. Today, it is world terrorism and leaders that want to take us into war without having a clue to the consequences.In short, this is a marvelous tale that is fantastic to read; a book that one can re-read with great pleasure."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"LOST HORIZON was written just as the shadows of the conflict that was to become World War II were beginning to darken the world. Not for nothing is the \\"narrator's\\" note to the reader dated 1933; that was the year of Hitler's ascension to power. The story begins in Berlin. It's evident that James Hilton wrote LOST HORIZON as an elegy to a world that had vanished forever at Ypres and the Somme. His protagonist, Conway, is a survivor of the European slaughter of 1914-1918, who has been rendered dispassionate by his experience in war, much like Somerset Maugham's Larry Darrell inThe Razor's Edge, in many respects a similar work.No doubt Hilton recognized that whatever shards were left of the Century of Human Progress were going to be ground to dust motes in the coming cataclysm. LOST HORIZON is Hilton's prayer that something of worth survives the coming Dark Age. Since LOST HORIZON was written, violence has been the coin of the human realm, and our technology has outpaced our thought and enslaved us. Time has accelerated beyond our ability to tolerate it. Many human beings have suffered and are suffering from their perceived inability to slow everyday life to a manageable speed. Domestic Violence, street violence, bullying, substance abuse, rudeness, anger, and many other social and personal problems have been the result. The pacing of LOST HORIZON is, by comparison, as languid as a river of honey. Anyone who comes here expecting an Action/Adventure yarn is going to be bitterly disappointed. However, for those of us, like Conway, who are preservationists, a visit to the Valley of the Blue Moon is a delight.There are a few flaws in Hilton's tale, mostly surrounding his less than thorough grasp of both Chinese culture and Tibetan culture, and the differences between them. He hardly addresses Buddhism. Though typical for their era, they occasionally cause Hilton to fall into the patronizing tone of the imperialist era. His Orientals are all stereotypically inscrutable. His main protagonists (even the Lamas) are Westerners. There's a decidedly European feel to Shangri-La, and there's actually very little of the \\"East\\" in LOST HORIZON. Even the philosophy of \\"moderation,\\" attractive as it is, is an imperfect interpretation of the Buddhist Middle Way. At the same time, these \\"flaws\\" help to make this story more accessible to its intended European-based audience, most of whom (reasonably or unreasonably) probably can't find Tibet on a map nowadays.Conway's story begins in Afghanistan. He is a British Consul serving in that country, along with his young assistant, Mallinson. Tribal violence has broken out, and the two emissaries are being forced to flee back to British India, in the company of two chance companions, Miss Brinklow, a Missionary, and a Mr. Barnard, from America.They are not long aloft when they realize that their flight has been hijacked by a pilot whose apparent design is to fly them across the Kunlun Shan Range and into Tibet. The plane crash lands, causing the pilot's death. Weather conditions are hideous; a fierce blizzard has caused a whiteout along with subzero temperatures and stocks of food and water are nonexistent. Each one of the four survivors addresses what seems to be imminent death differently. Conway is unperturbed and accepting. Barnard evidences a dry humor. Miss Brinklow reaches for her Bible. Mallinson is full of plans to trek back to India in the teeth of the storm.Rescue comes on the first clear day in the form of a line of porters headed by a man in a sedan chair, a Mr. Chang, who invites the four to the remote lamasery of Shangri-La in order to rest and recuperate. Although Mallinson agrees to visit Shangri-La merely to collect supplies and hire porters so that they can set out for India the next day, he is overruled by Conway, Barnard and Brinklow, each of whom recognizes the need to marshal themselves.The lamasery is in a virtually impregnable valley called Blue Moon, and it is a surprise, being equipped with all forms of modern conveniences like hot water plumbing and steam heat. Chang, who has become a kind of Social Director for the four, explains that Shangri-La is a monastery whose belief system centers around the idea of moderation. Thus, modern conveniences are melded appropriately with traditional practices. Beyond that, Chang does not put himself out to answer questions.Each of the four settles down to wait, with varying degrees of patience. Miss Brinklow convinces herself that she must save the \\"heathens\\" living in the Valley from themselves; min her eyes, \\"moderation\\" is sin and their obvious happiness is inexplicable and most unacceptable. Barnard, for his part, admits that he is a Bernie Madoff-type character on the lam from the authorities after contributing mightily to the Great Depression. However, he reasons that his discoveries of precious metals in the Valley will redeem him in the eyes of the world.Conway, for his part, falls in love with Shangri-La. He is quickly introduced to the High Lama, who reveals himself to be a former Capuchin Priest, Father Perrault, who was born in 1689. Perrault explains to Conway, in a long centerpiece to the book, that he first came to Shangri-La by chance. As with Miss Brinklow, he was seized with conversionary fervor, but as time has passed, he has come to see Shangri-La as a refuge and repository for world culture, a place that will be overlooked in the coming World War, which, he prophesies, will be infinitely more destructive than Conway's war, and will end in an unprecedented conflagration that will devour everything. His own incredible longevity he attributes to the air of the Valley, which seems to confer great vitality. Here, he assures Conway, a man will have time to explore even the deepest mysteries of the most seemingly improbable knowledge. Several of the monks he introduces to Conway are studying obscure subjects and dedicating their lives to minutae. One man is Chopin's student, perfecting his teacher's unfinished musical pieces.Mallinson merely wants to leave. He mocks Conway's belief in the High Lama. He hates everything about Shangri-La, and is shrill in his denunciations of the \\"Chinks\\" and old men who \\"wait like crouching spiders\\" in the place, working toward some unknowable, undoubtedly horrible, end. \\"I wish I had a plane,\\" he tells Conway angrily. \\"I'd bomb this place into bits.\\" All he wants to do, in his youth, is return to the British cantonments for tea dances and flivver races. Quite unexpectedly his is the voice of reason to whom Conway listens, and they depart Shangri-La as the story ends.There is so much here. Conway, dispassionate, nevertheless falls under the spell of the mysterious Valley of the Blue Moon, while the seemingly more credulous and superficial but passionate Mallinson reflects the thinking of a modern skeptic. Where Conway has always doubted the outside world and yet accepts the magic of Shangri-La, Mallinson believes wholeheartedly in the modern world and sees no magic in the lamasery. And although Conway accompanies Mallinson out, as the narrator finishes his tale, it is obvious that Conway is attempting to return to Shangri-La.Whether Mallinson or Conway is the hero all depends on the reader's outlook. Shangri-La promises freedom, but is the old Lama telling the truth? Are we called upon to act? Are we called upon to reflect? Is reflection action, and action reflection? Given conditions in the modern world, is a retreat to a genteel, timeless place an act of surrender or an act of bravery? When and where are we prisoners in our own lives? Or are we always free?"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"James Hilton's Lost Horizon, first published in 1933, is the enchanting, though cerebral, short novel that gave birth to the utopia of Shangri-La, a paradise set in a Christian-Buddhist monastery and largely self-sufficient village in the isolated high mountains of Tibet. Told as a captivating story within a story, the drama revolves around a cluster of enticing mysteries: Why are protagonist Hugh Conway and the other foreigners being flown by a seemingly mad pilot high above the remote Kuen-Lun mountains of China? Is Conway's story of his two-month stay in Shangri-La believable?; Does this almost timeless utopia, where people live in equanimity and age ever so slowly, actually exist?; Does Conway find his way back to Shangri-La to take charge following the death of the 250-year-old High Lama?The basic storyline, including Conway's love for a youthful Tibetan girl he meets in Shangri-La, is provocative enough to have served more than once as material for an entertaining Hollywood movie, but, in my opinion, the greater value of the work lies in the author's articulation of an emotionally appealing and intellectually intriguing life-philosophy. Conway is a British consul whose mild personality and muted career ambition lead to his assignments in far-away places outside the mainstream of power and politics. As such, he is the perfect newcomer to Shangri-La, where people are moderately hard-working and honest, where different ethical systems and religions are condoned as being \\"moderately true,\\" and, above all, where the lamas who run Shangri-La \\"are only moderately certain\\" of their own beliefs! After entering Shangri-La, often more by chance than choice, lamas-in-training find that their youthful desires gradually recede, to be replaced by a deeper wisdom. Over many decades of living in Shangri-La, significant events from their past lives come into sharper focus to serve as reference points for refined scholarly pursuits and purposeful contemplation about the future.As voiced through the High Lama's prognostication of a storm that \\"will rage till every flower of culture is trampled, and all human beings are leveled in a vast chaos,\\" Hilton warned in the 1930s, the decade leading up to World War II and the development of nuclear weapons, about the destructive path our conflict-prone society was on. Along with his warning, however, Hilton optimistically professes faith in \\"a new world stirring in the ruins,\\" with Shangri-La \\"preserved as by miracle for a new Renaissance.\\" Assuming this forecast to be moderately true, let's hope that Conway really has returned to Shangri-La, even though the rest of us may never get there!"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"What do you get when you mix a Brit with a Texas Oilman, a London Society female missionary and an Oxfordian highbrow who specializes in whining and negative thinking. Place them in the 1930s, shake well in a stolen aircraft, fly them to an unknown part of the world somewhere in the Himalayan/Tibetian and run them out of fuel.What you get is a bloody good adventure that is written a bit like a Kipling tale. The story begins in India and takes you to Shangri-La, located in the valley of the \`Blue Moon', a place of moderate perfection. For in Shangri-La the cardinal rule is &quot;moderation&quot;- the key to extended life. In this microcosm of moderate perfection you will find a world where aging is retarded significantly and life exists to appreciate the aesthetic.Though the book was published in 1931, the &quot;First Paperback Ever Published,&quot; it has an ageless \`Celestine Prophecy' style. Of course it was not the first \`Spiritual Adventure' story written but it was the first to incorporate first world technology (aviation) with spiritual wisdom. Not a romping, gut tingling, adventure tale, it does drag at times, but the ending has a nice twist and there are some adages that bring the read to a pensive pause. &quot;People make mistakes in life bybelieving too much, but they have a damned dull time if they believe too little.&quot; Recommended"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Although Hilton wrote a number of well-received novels, such as Goodbye, Mr. Chips, his bittersweet classic about a mysterious Eden high in the Himalayas is probably the work for which he is best remembered.The story still has the power to captivate, and its appeal led director Frank Capra to make the classic movie about the book. The film was an interesting departure from Capra's normally upbeat tales of American life. Perhaps in a way, it isn't so different from his \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" and \\"It Happened One Night\\" in that it shows Capra's belief that people are fundamentally good and that even the not so good ones, if given the chance (such as in landing in a paradise like Shangri-La), will reform and choose to lead better lives.In that sense, in \\"Lost Horizon\\" Capra gives us a parable not only of Paradise Lost and Regained (as when the Ronald Colman character is tricked into leaving but ultimately returns), but a vision of how people would act if they could indeed create or find the perfect society.When the panicked and exhausted group of travellers, who have narrowly escaped death twice, first in their escape from the inflamed Baskur and then in the plane crash, arrive in the city, their only concern is to escape and get back to \\"civilization.\\" But slowly, even the most sceptical and cynical of them (except for Colman's brother), eventually come to appreciate their newly found Eden, and we see how they themselves begin to change and are ultimately transformed now that they've left the harrowing environments of the imperfect, unjust, dangerous, and ultimately savage and cruel societies of the outside world behind.Thomas Mitchell, the shrewd businessman, who may have defrauded people of millions of dollars of his company's stock, at first only sees an opportunity to make a killing selling Shangri-La's gold to the outside world. Soon he's completely forgotten about his opportunistic business schemes and can only think about his project of building modern plumbing and bringing other modern conveniences to the people of Shangri-La.Edward Everett Horton, the older, aloof archaeologist, and the young and bitter tubercular woman, are at first suspicious and convinced they've been shanghaied and brought to Shangri-La for sinister reasons. But under the healing and rejuvenating effects of Shangri-La's life-extending ambience, Horton stops aging and the young woman's terminal illness is healed. Now, both mentally and physically invigorated (as well as being very different people from when they first arrived), they realize they've truly found Paradise and no longer want to leave.For Colman, the energetic Foreign Secretary, who has spent his entire career roaming the Far East, Shangri-La is like deja-vu itself, and he realizes he's been searching for it his entire life. Unlike the others, he needs no convincing. The only misfit is Colman's younger brother, who is never able to accept the place, and finally decides to leave.Lost Horizon is a fascinating cinematic vision of Paradise Found, and I wonder, how many of us would choose to leave our present lives to dwell there?I would."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"This timeless and visionary novel, while inflicted with some British chauvinism that was common at the time, deserves to be called a classic. Here we have the story of four Westerners who in the 1930s are kidnapped by plane and crash-landed in an uncharted Tibetan valley. They are welcomed into a life of ease and luxury at a suspicious lamasery, Shangri-La, where the monks speak English and enjoy Western books and modern technologies. It turns out that the four abductees were recruited to add to the population of the local village and can never leave, while the lead character Conway is ordained to become the new High Lama. It turns out that this apparent Utopia may not be so fulfilling after all, and that is the key message of the novel. Hilton gives us the struggles of a man who has been damaged by the horrors of war and the modern rat race, and just wants to find a place to get away from it all. But even a place as peaceful as Shangri-La is not so wonderful under the surface. Maybe Utopia is truly impossible to find in our world, both geographically and spiritually.This novel does have a few problems in characterizations and politics. Other than Conway the characters are shallow and one-sided. The one female among the Westerners, Miss Brinklow, is very narrow and nearly invisible, while the non-Westerners are mostly anonymous. Most importantly, the book comes close to sinking under what could either be called a lack of political correctness or immense British snobbery from Hilton's writing tradition. The High Lama is a European and actually states that \\"Europeans of the Nordic and Latin races\\" are the best candidates for enlightenment, while the Tibetans and Chinese in the story are presented as servants or bureaucrats. This is a condescending and unfortunate slight to Buddhism and the traditions of Tibet. Luckily, higher philosophical insights make this novel much bigger than the sum of its parts.

I have read it over and over and each time I feel like I am reading for the first time. Mr. Hilton wrote in such a way, that you feel that you are right there and you can't put the book down until you finish it. I too would like to know Mr. Hilton's life story; although I had wondered if his book &quot;Time and Time Again&quot; was somewhat of a biography. I find it amazing that a book written over sixty years ago can still have such appeal."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"The first time I read Lost Horizon, was in the summer of my sophomore high school year, for a reading requirement. I didn't think I would enjoy any of the other books on the list: The Red Badge of Courage, The Old Man And The Sea, A Tale Of Two Cities. That was literature, and I learned that literature meant alot of beautiful passages, finely crafted human emotions but all terribly and painfully boring. Lost Horizon was going to be another preachy epic, about the human condition.I was wrong.Turned out I consumed the novel in two afternoons with my 16-year old adolescent mind. I was lost in a world, where a woman stayed beautiful for ninety years, a land protected as secret from society, an eden.Bangkok is attacked and four passangers find themselves on a plane, being evacuated from the burning city. Barnar - a mysterious american with oil fields in north, Miss Brinklow - a dellusioned missionary who thinks she can convert anyone to christianity, Mallinson a british youth and Conway the adored hero of the novel.They find themselves abducted into paradise, where no one grows old, where wars can't find their way over high peaks, where the vanity of the world stops, and art masterpieces and books are hid away from a 'dying world'.The only way back to the rest of the world is to wait for porters that come into Shangri-La and trade goods. The problem is the porters have no regule schedule, they may show up next month or next year. Mallinson the youth, misses his girlfriend left back in london and his family. He's anxious to get back and watches the other comrades daze into a fatefull sleep, earning to stay in Sri-Lanking, the perfect paradise.Conway is 38. He's tired after the war, with no real purpose in life. He thinks about settling down and Sri-Lanka is the perfect place.Barnar has other reasons to stay. A bit sinister, but who can blame him to leave paradise? It's his perfect escape from his crimes and the punishment that awaits him on the outside.Miss Brinklow views the settlement as a perfect mission ground where she can convert the 'non-believers' to christianity.The day of escape comes and Mallinson finds he's the only one trying to leave.I've read the Lost Horizon this week.

This book is so good--That I want to keep it for myself and not share it with anyone--As if it was written just for me. \\"Lost Horizon\\" is a mainstream novel and a masterpiece making use of a succinct yet uncomplicated writing style. Recently I had a memory of Frank Capra's film version of this novel--That I first saw over 40 years ago--And I decided to watch it again. I was so impressed and moved by the picture that I decided to read the novel. The film captures the essence of the novel; although the on-screen characters were significantly changed by Capra--Presumably to pull at the heart strings more effectively. Yet despite the characters, and their relationships to each other, having been modified for the movie version of \\"Lost Horizon\\"--The film and its definitive message still end up resembling the book quite closely. This novel--That Amazon categorizes as \\"metaphysical\\"--Will melt any cynic's heart. The idea of living peacefully, serenely and stress-free may be compelling in theory to many Westerners--But their fascination would not be enough for them to give up their striving, competing, overworking and generally not enjoying life to the fullest. In Buddhism all suffering is created in the mind, and so the lamas of Shangri-La use their practice of clairvoyant meditation to keep it at bay. Yet ultimately what guides Shangri-La is the principle of moderation, where one avoids being \\"too virtuous\\" as well. Reading \\"Lost Horizon\\" I could not help but be reminded of Herman Hesse's \\"The Glass Bead Game\\"--Another masterpiece which also deals with the themes of a Utopia influenced, and intertwined with, aspects of Eastern philosophy / religion--In particular the practice of meditation. In closing--The idea of a \\"world apart\\"--Where mankind is encouraged to be the \\"highest possible version\\" of itself--Is a timeless notion that will always be seductive.Stephen C.

When they crash land on a high plateau and are almost instantly met by a caravan of porters carrying a monk, they realize that their kidnapping was not by chance or a random incident.They are taken to the mysterious Shangri La, a monastery that sits above a bustling town nestled secretly in a valley. The monastery is complete with a library, music room, and all sorts of modern comforts. The guests inquire about returning to civilization, but their hosts, the monks, are extremely vague regarding the details of how they might do so. Soon the four guest begin to suspect that something sinister is lurking in the background of this utopia.The main character, Conway, takes a liking to Shangri La, and is eventually invited to meet with the Head Lama. Conway is told the history of Shangri La, and learns the secret that has been covered since their arrival: the monks of Shangri La practice a combination of meditation and narcotics that enables them to achieve extreme longevity. Some of the monastery's monks are over two hundred years old. The novel moves toward a climax in which one of the guests tries to escape, just after Conway witnesses the Head Lama die and is asked to succeed him.This story is full of twists and turns, though for a large portion of the text nothing really happens. The author uses a very subtle tool to introduce the story, and it pays off in the epilogue, when the reader is left wondering whether or not Lost Horizon is a true story. The mix of Buddhist and Christian teaching is interesting, making the philosophic dialogues between Conway and the Head Lama intriguing.

The book and the film are very similar, so my love for the film has transferred to the original work. Lost Horizon is the story of four people, an American, a young British soldier, a middle-aged British man, and a female missionary, who have the misfortune of being kidnapped on an airplane. They are crashed near a mysterious and dismal mountain somewhere in Tibet, and all seems to be lost to them, including their pilot who dies in the crash. However, they are rescued by a group of men who live in a strange valley nearby. They call their oasis Shangri-La.The middle-aged British man is named Conway; he has the best grasp of the goals of Shangri-La of any of the people in his group. Instead of fidgeting when he is told he and his friends will never leave the villiage, he embraces his new home where everything is done in moderation. He marvels over the expensive library of treasures and begins to love a tiny Chinese girl with a fondness for music. He has the good fortune to meet the High Lama of the monastary there and to be told the secrets of Shangri-La.Conway's sentiments narrate the story, and his calm personality resonates with the reader and makes the sometimes outlandish beliefs of Shangri-La become vivid and desirable.This is a magical book with the same feeling of hope and inspiration that is present in Frank Capra's films. Although it was written in the early 30s, the sentiments are applicable in today's world. Thus, it is a timeless classic that every person should have the good fortune of stumbling upon.

If you have never read Hilton's classic, and you are a person with an optimistic spiritual outlook, then The Lost Horizon is a must for you. If you read it and want to believe it, then you should visit Burma and the temples of the ancient city of Pagon, and then spend time in the three kingdoms of the Himalayas: Nepal, Ladakh and Bhutan, in that order.

I would no sooner give it away to a friend, than a year or so later, a 'thirst' for it would develop, and I'd have to purchase it anew for a re-read.Why?Initially, it was because I was looking for such a place (as Shangri-La) on planet earth. But after the passage of a few years, I gave up on my search, thinking that this personal wish was simply an impossible dream. Luckily, deep inside me, that wish failed to go away. My heart knew that 'if you want something badly enough, you will attract it.'The author, James Hilton, may have had knowledge about such a place (besides what was merely in his artistic imagination).Did Hilton find his Shangri-La? Apparently not, but that should not prevent others from finding it. James Hilton could have been serving as an 'instrument' through which others would be led to their own Nirvana.Shangri-La was a place where people were truly free, living under a loving benevolence, able to pursue their interests - interests that tended to become more and more noble over time. These seekers (finders) were also fortunate to live to an extraordinarily advanced age - 'living forever.' Shangri-La was a place removed from the rest of the world (and from today's world as we know it).But what about today? Does Shangri-La still exist? In France? Yes. In Italy? Yes. In Russia? Yes. In the U.K.? Yes. South of the Border? Yes. In Canada and Australia? Yes. In the U.S.? Yes. Everywhere? Yes. Then how many Shangri-Las are there? There is only One Shangri-La.Is Shangri-La Buddhist? Christian? Islamic? Jewish? Zen-ish? Sufi-ish? Yes. As in James Hilton's book, residents of Shangri-La have many backgrounds and come from several nations.Can anyone find this exalted place? Not 'anyone', but 'someone' can. Perhaps one in a million may find it - yes, even today. If You seek it, don't abandon your quest. Keep seeking and you will be attracted to it . . . and you will live forever - truly.\\"Lost Horizon\\" (the original 1933 novel by James Hilton) is a 'must-read.'James Kowalick"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"I read this book as part of a utopian literature unit in my AP English class. From a political standpoint, this book sparks questions about a utopian society, then answers them with simple, intelligent examples. The emotions that Hilton illustrates are somewhat vague, but he manages to convey a sense of hidden love, peace, and happiness during Conway's stay at Shangri-La. I found myself captivated by the utopian lifestyle, and amazed at the beauty of a seemingly &quot;perfect&quot; community. I give this book four of five stars, however, because I felt it was just a little shallow and would benefit from more details- still an excellent read."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Hilton's novel still has the power to take you away to a land frozen in time. Knowing the 'secret' as you read still doesn't diminish its impact, but I'm jealous of those readers in 1933 who had the advantage of mystery as they read on."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect upon first reading Lost Horizon. I thought that since it invovled a group of people stranded in some uncharted land, that it wouldn't be anything unique.However, I was pleasantly surprised. As the story unfolds, the passengers of the plane discover that their pilot is in fact not the one they had originally hired. As a result, they end up at some strange destination far from where they had planned.As the weeks pass, however, the main character secretly learns from one of the head monks that it is very unlikely a transport will actually come to the area anytime soon. Eventually the rest of the group learns of this, but only one of them really finds it bothersome. The rest have found the new land very comfortable and heaven-like. The character who wishes to leave for home in America actually falls in love with a young native woman who lives at the monastary (she appears to the be the only female in the area). In the end, they both manage to return to America, and the rest of the group remain, in love with their new home.Although Lost Horizon is not the same genre I am usually interested in, I must say that it was a very pleasing read. James Hilton describes the landscape beautifully as if you were actually there. He causes the reader to take a step back from the fast pace of contemporary life as he brings to life an environment of true serenity and happiness.I recommend Lost Horizon to those that appreciate intelligent writing as this novel is bursting with it. It should be required reading for all English and philosophy classes."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"I am a chinese reader, I hope to know the life story, the booklist of Jemas.

He had been interested enough in the story to prepare a manuscript. Conway, Mallinson, and Barnard were in an airplane headed for Peshawar, but going in the wrong direction. They had left Baskul, Persia. In their company was a missionary, Miss Brinklow. Miss Brinklow used to belong to the LMS, London Missionary Society, but she disagreed about infant baptism. The plane landed. The pilot was unconscious and died that evening. Everyone but Conway was affected by the altitude and it was cold. Part of Conway, (his record at school had been brilliant), was always an onlooker.A robed figure emerged from the lamasery of Shangri-La. The name of the mountain was Karakul, twenty eight thousand feet high. Conway surmised they were in Tibet. He knew very little Tibetan. Chair-bearers transported the members of the party to shelter. The atmosphere of the lamasery was Chinese rather than specifically Tibetan. (Conway was to find out later that the religion practiced was a mixture of Buddhism and Christianity.) There were about fifty lamas present and others who had not completed their studies, including the guide, Chang. Some of the lamas were neither Chinese not Tibetan.Mallinson, only twenty four years old, wants the party's return journey to be arranged right away. Conway senses that their arrival had been expected by the inhabitants. The puzzle of their arrival at Shangri-La begins to fascinate Conway. It is deemed by the guide that it is unlikely anyone from the outside world would be visiting Shangri-La to carry supplies to the community sooner than two months hence. Miss Brinklow and the American, Barnard, do not consider staying at Shangri-La for two months a hardship. Conway is used to service in exotic places, but the situation for Mallinson is difficult.The lamasery has collections of books and art of China and Tibet. It is discovered that Barnard is traveling on a forged passport and is wanted by the authorities. Chang advises Conway excitedly that the High Lama has agreed to see Conway which is contrary to usual practice and is obviously a great honor. It seems that for thirty eight years there was a Christian mission in Lhasa.Conway learns the members of their party are supposed to stay forever. The place is known as the valley of the Blue Moon. The lamas are ageless. In the end Conway sees the High Lama on a number of occasions and learns he has been designated the successor. Barnard, having worked as a mining engineer, ascertains that the place is a gold mine. Mallinson and Conway are determined to leave and, thus, Conway becomes the subject of the traveler's tale compiled by Rutherford."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"There wasn't much of a plot in this book. Nothing exciting happens, and nothing is deffinate. There isn't much of an ending either.. the only reason i kept reading it was because i liked the size of the book.. heh"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"&quot;Lost Horizon&quot; is definitely not the best book I have ever read. It starts out with four men talking about different things when they come to the conclusion that they all know Hugh Conway, who was kidnapped along with three others. Their plane crashes in the mountains, and they are rescued and taken to a place called Shangri-La. Here they experience a lot of peace because Shangri-La is away from the ongoing war. Many things happen, and Conway along with one of the others decides to leave. This is the way the book ends, except for the Epilouge where Rutherford again talks about Conway and tries to figure out where he is. This book is definitely for those who like weird things. It was not the best book for my tastes."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"I had to read this book for a book report and found it difficult to follow. If I had to stop in the middle of a chapter, I would start reading and be confused. If I had the time to read whole chapters without interruption, I think I would have had an easier time reading and comprehending this book.At first, I wasn't sure if the beginning was the present and Shangri-La was a flashback/narrative or if the beginning of the book was the prelude to ending up at Shangri-La."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"I ordered this thinking I would get a lovely hardcover edition of a favorite novel. What I got was a cheesy production that was not even typeset properly. Unfortunately I don't see another new hardcover edition on Amazon to order instead.

GREAT SERVICE"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"A member of my book club chose this as our book to read this month. It is a short book, but it took me forever to get through it. It's not hard to read, but it is terribly boring. I finally trudged through it. The last 2 chapters were the best, most interesting for me. It leaves the reader wondering what happens to the characters. It felt like a book I would have to read for school and write a report, or have a discussion about it.The other members of my club seemed to like it o.k., but I couldn't bring myself to stir up any happy feelings for it. It felt like school. I'll leave it at that."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"No, I don't at all understand how anyone can assign even the first star to this putative literary work. I invested a goodly fifty pages without noting the first scintilla of action or intrigue, although I did suffer through reference after reference to 1920s practices and customs at Oxford--couched in impenetrable Edwardian slang. I had absolutely no idea what was going on, other than that I was bored witless."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Let me begin by saying I loved this book. I cannot say enough about how much I enjoyed reading it. The thing that is harder to nail down is why I loved this book. It has some of the typical elements I enjoy when reading a novel - engaging characters, a meaningful plot and an ending that leaves you with quite a bit to chew on. But I have read dozens if not hundreds of novels that fit that description and none of them seem to fit on the same plane as this book. I think the thing that struck me the most was how this book captured the sense that there is something wrong with this world, it does not function as it was intended to. The wars, the poverty, the pain, the suffering, all of them part of the everyday world that surrounds us (unless you live in a bubble and simply choose to ignore them), yet it always feels like there has to be a better way. This is expressed so clearly in the driving force behind establishing the monastery of Shangri-La, to preserve the great works of man, and man itself even, from man and the path of destruction he seems to be on. That way when the wars have finally wiped out all we have ever done (and maybe mankind along with it) there will be a preserve, untouched and intact, to begin anew. Ah the thought of beginning anew, without the flaws, without the problems. What person has not wished for that, yearned for it even? I think that is why this novel touched my soul. It so beautifully expressed how man longs for Heaven, though few would label it as such. The common longing is expressed here and Hilton's answer seems to be that of man's salvation brought about by man which is fascinating to compare and ultimately contrast this against my own views of who will bring salvation to man, ChristI loved this book."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"I think the first thing that struck me was how timeless this story is, the search for a personal utopia, the subtle morality, the ideal of moderation. The quotes struck me as so appropriate for the modern age, even though the book was written in 1933. \\"laziness in doing stupid things is quite a virtue.\\" \\"Time enough for everything\\" and the ever popular \\"the meek shall inherit the world,\\" an old time biblical favorite. The book is charming and elegant, about a magical place for everyone."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"What a beautiful and wondrous book! I was completely captivated by the mysteries of Shangri-la. Our hero Conway's adventure was an awe-inspiring tale of a monastery hidden deep in a Tibetan mountain range, where the lamas lead extraordinary existences. Theirs are privileged lives steeped in wisdom and secrecy. Their isolation and longevity allows them a unique position in the world and very few outsiders are privy to their secrets. Hilton's use of the high lama's telepathy is certainly prophetic, considering the book was written prior to World War II.Lost Horizon was a great adventure story as well as a picture of an ideal society. Hilton's dream on utopia was brilliantly written and enchanting."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"I first read LOST HORIZON many years ago, after I'd seen the film (which, frankly, rather ruins the tale for me, but not enough to destroy the pleasure in reading it). When on a trip to China, staying in the Xian Shangri-La Hotel and having run out of my own books, I picked up their copy (a very nice little hard-cover available for sale at the Horizon Club).It was a joy to be transported back in time... when the British Empire was slowly collapsing and world-weary consul, Conrad, is escaping a revolution with 3 others (an American, a missionary and a junior diplomat) when their plane is mysteriously hi-jacked. They find themselves crash-landing with a soon-deceased pilot somewhere in the Himalayas and are rescued by a party of Tibetans carrying an aged Chinese man. He leads them to Shangri-La--a lammasery beneath a high moutain, above a particularly lush, cultivated valley.Shangri-La has become a sort of archetype for hidden/lost utopian societies. The echoes of this book are discernible in many latter works. But here is the original (or one of the originals, since Shangri-La itself is naturally based on previous ideas). Hilton's work is spare, but still magical, depicting a time of turmoil, just before the death and destruction of the Second World War. Conrad, the hero who is not a hero, has lived through WWI and it has both taken something from him... and given him something--something that seems to culminate in his finding peace and wisdom and himself at Shangri-La. But can modern man truly find peace? Or will the world and its madness be a call that's too strong to ignore?Visit Shangri-La and see for yourself!"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"I read this book because quite a few Lost fans believe the series is based on this book. I thought the book was a quick read and interesting. I could see the parallels with the series. I did get some insight but I also believe there are numerous references in the series to other story lines - like Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead. If you are a Lost fan I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"This book is written so well. The author describes the people and the scenery wonderfully. I really enjoyed reading this book and getting involved with the story the author was telling. I started reading this book for several reasons. First, I read a list of the best Novels of all time and this was in the top ten. Second I read an interview in the magazine section of the Sunday, New York Times several months ago. The interviewer asked Donna E. Shalala (served as Secretary of Health and Human Services in Pres. Clinton's cabinet) what was her favorite book and she said James Hilton's Lost Horizon. I then decided I had to read it. I read the book with crib notes with me, so I wouldn't miss any symbolism, but you don't need the crib notes to understand the book. Get the book and read it, jump into the experience; Shangri-la is not far away."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"This story is about a young man named Conway. Through past experiences and actions became a legend. He and three others have been kidnapped and brought to Buddhist monastery in the Tibetan Plateau. They are at first unwilling to stay at the valley of the blue moon, but they have no choice. Throughout the story Conway learns the history of the valley and it's high lama. The high lama has left Conway with an imperative choice. He bestowed upon Conway the future of Shangri-La, and Conway must choose between loyalty to the high lama or loyalty to his companion Mallison.This story is what originally began my interest in the oriental cultures, and also my interest in classic literature. It was entertaining to read because of the style in which it was writ. The tradition shown by the lamas, the moderation shown by them began the learning of these cultures that I have taken upon myself. Also how the high lama's explanation of Shangri-La was not vague nor was it in depth. The respect shown to the high lama by the people has also contributed to the code of behavior I now follow. I enjoyed this book because it was entertaining and educational."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"I saw the film at a young age.

Well, it was.It's a short read but I can't say this one merits the word 'classic'."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"This is a classic novel from the 1930's. It was very popular at the time and sparked a movie of the same name. It was to a large extent America's introduction to Tibet.

Adapted here in film, it is a wonderful vehicle for beautiful images of Jane Wyatt, and Ronald Colman. Filmed against an early version of architectural and landscape modernism, it also has the earmark grand processionals with torch lighting seen only in movies by De Mille and the remarkable conclusion of Disney's Fantasia. The setting of Shangri-La, not in the all too familiar computer reconstruction of today, but in the grand style of bygone stage sets, reminds us of early influences of modernist architecture. The Cranbrook Academy styles of early architects and designers, the graphic lines of Mies van der Rohe, and the ornamentalism of Edward Durrell Stone, combined with interior design including arts of ancient Eastern, Asian cultures make for graphically beautiful mise en scene of the inaccessible and remote dream of Shangri-La.An ideal society rich in inner spiritual growth rather than dogmatic religion and government, it is self-sustaining, save only for supplies from the outside. Smitten with the atmosphere of luxurious idealism where all have a share of beauty, destitute survivors of a plane crash in the mountains of Tibet come to it's mysterious tiny entrance in one of the most wildly remote parts of the world only to find out who they really are. The revelations in this tiny pocket of beauty reminds of all the escapism with which we might all be longing for today amidst a world of ever increasing danger and barbaric greed. The conclusion is, of course, a perfect one which procures the 'hero' his place in life, as the chief Dali Lama.A 'must have' for any Hilton fan, dreamer of his own Shangri-La, or escapist from the current unstylish visions of today's Hollywood hard edged filmography. Don't look for any brutality, in-your-face sexuality, gore, vulgar language, inuendo; you will find only adventure, some action in the brutal arrival and departure scenes all done in Capra style that would become mature years later. It is heavy in matters of style filmed with pomp and circumstance, relieved by characters who have at last found their way in life. It's simply a gorgeous Classic Black and White.Ray W. ClarkePalm Beach & ClevelandLost Horizon"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Anyone with any interest in Buddhism will be fascinated by this book.

Is there really a Shangri-la or Mt. Karakal??? It makes you wonder... if life is like that of the characters...it's a real cool book!"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Having read some of the reviews on the book, and just myself having finished reading it, it seems people fall into one of two camps: either you get it or you don't. It is the story of a man in the early twentieth century looking for more to life than what he has. Oh, he's got the good pay, the prestige, the job, yet he is unfulfilled. he is not happy. He has a \\"full\\" life, but it a meaningless life to him. He doesn't feel like he's actually accomplished anything. So, he and three others are captured and taken to unknown territories. Mallinson is, I think, kind of our everyman character and to a slight degree Conway's conscience. He is also the one who cannot seem to find peace in Shangri-la, a place of idyllic peace and beauty. He needs the loudness of \\"modern life\\", whereas Conway seems to have found what he is looking for, ie, the simple life and a purpose for life. His life didn't seem to make sense before arriving, but it now seems to make perfect sense. Where Mallinson sees purgatory or hell, Conway sees heaven. So, in the end, why does he leave? I think he felt a certain responsibility to Mallinson. I think he figures if he can get Mallinson home safely he can go back. I do like the vague ending. You don't know for sure Conway got back. You don't know if the lamas had a \\"Plan B\\" to account for maybe Conway leaving. I think he made it back; of course I am a bit of a sucker for a happy ending. There is a definite eastern philosophy slant, which I am all right with, as I am into the subject. Maybe that's part of the reason I like it.One can have their own opinion as to how the story is told, but the story itself is a good one. It is relatively quick reading as well. If you need explosions three times a page, or lots of action, this isn't for you. Not that it's actionless, it just isn't necessarily typical \\"action/adventure.\\" It was a thoroughly enjoyable read for me though."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"There is nothing to be quick about except buying this book, reading it, selling the car, selling the house, selling the kids, and going to look for Shangri-la. This book is really good, I think I put it down twice. It is full of suspense.I know where the real Shangri-la is located, it's not Zhongdian, I COULD tell you but I won't. Not until I go back there."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"This book is one of the best I have ever read. There is, between its pages, a world of solace and hope depicted as delicately and expertly as a haiku. The only unfortunate thing about it is that we cannot literally travel to Hilton's Shangri-La."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Lost Horizon is a very introspective book. Metaphors abound perhaps, but what I'm inclined to take from the book each time I read it are the questions asked. Questions of purpose and what it all means. It's very thought provoking without being tendentious.Stylistically, Hilton is economical, but very capably sets a mood that permeates the entire narrative whether in describing the landscape or the more subtle aspects of the different characters. For me, the mood is one of relaxed contemplation.In another context, it's a wonderful travel book. It takes the reader to a faraway place and implicitly invites him to make choices and contemplate weighty issues in this most unlikely of settings.Lost Horizon is not a literary masterpiece, but it's a good story and very clever in its presentation."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"A wonderful, suspenseful, beautiful book -- not afraid to be idealistic AND clear-eyed.

It is a mysterious and spiritual tale that will keep you reading until the end. However, I was disappointed that in the prologue, the basic ending was revealed. This removed some of the suspense from the overall story. But there are certain surprises at the ending itself, which ended abruptly and left me wondering for a long while after. Overall, this was a very good story well worth the read and I recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Who wouldn't be charmed by a tale of life in a stress free utopia where life is long and there is time to pursue the better things in life? However, in the lamastary of Shangri-la, issues arise as newcomers must determine whether to trust those who promise such a life and whether giving up what we have in the outside world is a fair tradeoff for the blissfull life at Shangri-la. On one level, &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; is escapist fantasy. On another level, it is highly thought provoking."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"The story of a group of people who survive an airplane crash in Tibet and find shelter at a mysterious monastery is extremely well known, but unlike most novels, Lost Horizon is less about its characters and their siutation--interesting though those elements may be--than it is about their thoughts and ideas. Written as it was on eve of World War II, these thoughts and ideas center upon developing a way of life that preserves, rather than destroys, that which is finest in both humanity and the world in general.The novel is elegantly and simply written and possesses tremendous atmosphere. Although enjoyable as a purely &quot;fun&quot; read, it is also thought provoking, and the thoughts it provokes linger long after the book is laid aside. I can not imagine any one not being moved by the book, both emotionally and intellectually, regardless of their background or interests. If such a person exists, I do not think I would care to meet them.Although James Hilton wrote a number of worthy novels, Lost Horizon is the novel for which he is best remembered, a great popular success when first published and a genuine masterpiece of 20th Century literature."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"When I was a teenager, I went to see the movie Lost Horizon seven times. During my 74 years, I read the book many times. After I retired, I made four trips to that part of the world, and spent many months each time searching for that wonderful Shangri-La dream. If you have never read Hilton's classic, and you are a person with an optimistic spiritual outlook, then The Lost Horizon is a must for you. If you read it and want to believe it, then you should visit Burma and the temples of the ancient city of Pagon, and then spend time in the three kingdoms of the Himalayas: Nepal, Ladakh and Bhutan, in that order. You will be moved to tell others, or write about your spiritual experience. I was so moved. May your days be filled with the magic of life. Sirrom"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"What struck me most about this book is how non-dated it was for having been written in 1933. First of all, the story starts in Afghanistan during an airlift to evacuate foreign nationals during an anti-western revolution. Next, the main characters are essentially skyjacked to an unknown destination against their will for unknown purposes. As for the characters, they seem very familiar and contemporary also: a world-weary and burned-out government bureaucrat, a gung-ho and impatient young military officer, a business man that has stolen over 100 million dollars from investors through stock fraud, and a fundamentalist Christian missionary that believes in one \\"true\\" religion and holds all others in contempt. There is also the conviction among several of these characters that globally \\"the whole game's going to pieces.\\"However, there is also something hauntingly timeless about this story. It occurs to me that the hidden civilization of Shangri-La is based on the mythical kingdom of Shambhala, where immortal masters live that look after the evolution and welfare of mankind. The great mountain of Karacul that looms over the valley also seems symbolic of Mt. Meru- the axis of the cosmos- and where the gods are reputed to dwell. It is certainly no coincidence that most of the people that find Shangri-La are the world weary- and the journey comes close to killing them. That would seem to be a metaphor for spiritual enlightenment. For this is what the lucky and the worthy find in Shangri-La, all the time in the world, or rather out of the world, for contemplation, preservation of all the worthy attainments of the human race, and the pursuit of wisdom. Sounds pretty close to heaven to me....An interesting side note is the fact that _Lost Horizon_ was the first paperback title ever published by Pocket Books in 1939. This particular edition bears the same classic cover art as the original."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"When I read this book, I was transformed! I could actually breath the fresh, cold, Himalayan air that Conway and his entourage and the people of Shangri-La breathed. The language the novel is written in is beautiful and picturesque.When Conway and his companions flee the warring land they come from, (in a way) they find themselves hijacked, whisked away to paradise: Shangri-La, a place where the air is clean and the living is natural and spiritual and, &quot;moderate.&quot; Where people live naturally long lives, hundreds of years, in peace, in love, at one with nature. Hilton's book wisely illustrates that some can never be happy in paradise, they must go on and on searching, but too incredulous to ever actually find anything. In Shangri-La the people, the good, natural people await the destruction of the &quot;outside world,&quot; which will surely occur at it's own hand sooner or later as long as people rule themselves with war, lack of moderation, hatred, and a lack of regard for the spiritual nature of humanity. Then the people of Shangri-La will spread the paradise to the far reaches of earth. No doubt, James Hilton has read not only the Bible, but many other spiritual books, because I find myself thinking of Buddism, Judaism, Christianity (as opposed to Christendom), Hinduism, and other Eastern religions and forms of spirituality and well as Western religion and forms of spirituality. What an inspiring view.The &quot;outside&quot; world will eventually destroy itself if humanity continues on the road of &quot;unintelligent leadership,&quot; war, hatred, discrimination, excess, selfishness, lack of moderation, lack of respect and care for nature, lack of conservation, lack of respect for self, and lack of respect and care for other human beings and all our fellow animals. The question is: Will there be a &quot;Shangri-La&quot; there to save us? Do we really want to take that chance?"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Lost Horizon is the perfect book for a slow day. Just sit outside, with a glass of tea and a fuzzy kitten in your lap. The novel is a slow moving, delightful story, with fully human characters set in a setting of fantasy.

The story is about four individuals' unplanned trip to the mysterious Shangri-La, located in an isolated location in Tibet. Shangri-La is a place where people live stress free and in moderation. This novel, written in 1933, is highly readible and moves quickly. This wistful tale poses many questions such as &quot;is it better to live stress free with time on our hands or to live in the modern world with it's material opportunities?&quot; Another question is &quot;do we believe things based on trust and hope or solely based upon the credible evidence?&quot; A third question might be, &quot;is moderation in a happy, stress free situation better than a world where we feel great passions but also endure periods of unhappiness?&quot; This wonderful tale is a great antidote to the stress of the modern world."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"When we were kids, our grandparents used to take us to Radio City Music Hall for the movie and Christmas Pageant every year. The year I was 12, the movie was a remake of Lost Horizon--my most graphic memory from that night is my horror when the woman suddenly aged after leaving Shangri-La. As it turns out, that version of the movie is pretty dreadful, while Frank Capra's 1937 original is widely considered to be a classic. At any rate, I liked the film enough to read the book and also Hilton's other classic, Goodbye, Mr. Chips, and I loved them both. Recently, our library got a restored edition of the Capra film and we enjoyed it thoroughly. So I went back &amp; reread the books.I assume most folks know at least the rough outlines of the stories. In Lost Horizon, Hugh Conway, a British diplomat, is skyjacked and he &amp; his traveling companions end up in the Himalayas. Eventually they are lead to the hidden Valley of the Blue Moon and the city of Shangri-La, where folks do not age and the powers that be are collecting all of the world's knowledge and greatest artworks, so that it will be safe from the turbulent political storms of the outside world. Eventually, the high lama reveals to the diplomat that he has been chosen to take over leadership of Shangri-La and after an abortive attempt to leave (at the insistence of one of his fellow travelers), Conway returns to assume his destined place in Shangri-La.Good-bye, Mr. Chips, on the other hand, is about an eccentric but lovable British schoolmaster, Arthur Chipping (Mr. Chips). Seemingly destined to be a bachelor for life, he meets and marries a young woman who loosens him up quite a bit, before dying in childbirth. Chips is left alone, except that is for the succeeding generations of boys who pass through Brookfield School. After decades at the school, he retires, telling the assembled alumni, &quot;I have thousands of faces in my mind. ... I remember you as you are. That's the point. In my mind you never grow old at all&quot;, only to be called back during WWI, at which point he becomes acting headmaster. One of his duties is to read the list of the school's war dead; for everyone else they are just names, but for Chips, each name has a face attached. After the War he reretires, after 42 years teaching Roman History and Latin at Brookfield.On the surface, these two stories couldn't be more different, but reading them now I realize how similar they actually are. Shangri-La is an oasis of civilzation in a world that was after all between two World Wars. It is a place where the great achievements of our culture will be preserved, even if war consumes the rest of the World, which for much of this Century seemed like a possibility. Mr. Chips, meanwhile, is the living embodiment of institutional memory. The classes of boys, the teachers and headmasters, even the subjects and teaching methods, come and go, but Chips has remained throughout. He &quot;still had those ideas of dignity and generosity that a frantic world was forgetting.&quot; He embodies the pre-War world and its values. In his book Mr. Bligh's Bad Language, Greg Dening says that: &quot;Institutions require memory. A memory creates precedent and order.&quot; In the very midst of an epoch that was witnessing an unfettered attack on all of the West's institutions and values, Hilton created Shangri-La and Mr. Chips; both represent the conservative ideal--providing a bridge of memory to all that is beautiful and good and decent in our past, lest, in our zeal to create a perfect world, we forget the qualities and accomplishments which bequeathed us the pretty good world in which we live.These books are unabashedly sentimental and I'm sure some would even find them mawkish. But I love them and I appreciate the subtley non-political way in which they make the most important of political points: even as we move forward we must always preserve those things and ideas of value in our past.Mr. Chips GRADE: A+Lost Horizon GRADE: A"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"The Lost Horizon, by James Hilton, is possibly the best book that I have read in the past year. Published in 1933, it remains relevent and provocative to this day.The Lost Horizon, much like Catch-22, is part of an elite group of books whose name or central characters have become a permanent part of the English vocabulary. In this book, this was done with Shangri-La, the land high in the mountains of Tibet where a group of worldly men and women stumble upon a valley of mystery and matchless beauty. A quick search on dictionary.com reveals that it means1. An imaginary remote paradise on earth; utopia.2. A distant and secluded hideaway, usually of great beauty and peacefulness.While the term Shangri-La is famous, the book is not nearly as wide-known or wide-read in recent years. Countless books by countless authors depicting utopia have been published, but only a couple has grabbed the attention of and lingered in the imagination of the public long after its initial publish. So what is special about Shangri-La, the valley of the Blue Moon? Read to find out.I could not put this book down. I had an mid-term exam the next day, but I stayed up to read the book past midnight. The basic plot of the book can be found by a simple glimpse of the editorial write-up on this site. The actions are fast-paced, the characters intriguing in their peculiarities. Yet this book has a philosophical edge that distinguishes it from a mere thriller. The true center of the book is ideas and thoughts rather than actions. Much thinking is done by the characters, trapped in the monastery of Shangri-La by the mountains and the snow. When Mallinson, the hot-blooded young captain who is desperate to get out of Shangri-La and return to Britain, snaps 'Well, if you happen to like prison,' to Barnard who was observing the beauty of the landscape, Barnard remarks that 'My goodness, if you think of all the folks in the world who'd give all they've got to be out of the racket and in a place like this, only they can't get out! Are we in the prison or are they?'In Shangri-La, the appreciation of beauty and the pursuit of wisdom is valued above all else. Rejecting the virtues of hard work and ambition, they adopted a philosophy of moderation in all things, 'avoiding excess of all kinds - even excess of virtue itself.' The author, Hilton, was not merely creating entertainment (although this he does) in this book. He was concerned about the future of England and all mannkind. Written after the aftermass of the destruction of the WW1, and the whole of western world being driven to a state of pessimism and despair by the worldwide economic condition, Hilton was concerned with another dark cloud that gathered on the horizon, namely the first signs of WW2. The lamesery of Shangri-La was imagined to be a living, breathing time capsule designed to salvage a gentle, civilized way of life from the destruction Hilton sensed had been unleashed by the Great War. Above all Hilton hated wars, which had the potential to 'destroy the fragile beauty and learning, accumulated over centuries of humanity, in the matter of a second.' With the invention of the atomic bomb after his time, this could now literaly come true. Out of the barbarism of the war rose Shangri-La, even if only in the imagination. In an age where the Western and the non-Western world alike engage in meaningless wars and acts of terror, this book is more relevant than ever in this century than ever before.Buy this book and read this book. The 7 bucks or so that you pay for it is more than worth the price of admission into Shangri-La."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"In the depths of the worldwide economic depression as the war drumbeats began in Germany, James Hilton wrote a quirky, imaginative book about the potential to escape the harsh reality. In so doing, he caused each reader since then to wonder what the right balance of tranquility and challenge really is. Like the best books about possible utopias, Lost Horizon leaves much to the reader's imagination. Undoubtedly, you will conjure up solutions to the riddles left open by the author that will be especially pleasing to you.Although the book is clearly set in the 30's with a British perspective, many of the themes struck me as universal. As the book opens, there's an intriguing prologue that sets just the right tone for the story. You are to read a manuscript about the experiences of one Hugh &quot;Glory&quot; Conway, H.M. consul. The manuscript opens with airplane hijacking that seemed all too realistic. Quickly, the hijacking turns into a surprising adventure as the passengers unexpectedly arrive in a little known part of Tibet and are escorted to Shangri-La, a lamasery sitting atop a hidden valley of peace and tranquility. While there, they await an opportunity to arrange passage with the bearers who are bringing a shipment that is expected in 60 days. Conway, however, learns the secrets of Shangri-La and finds himself faced with an extraordinary set of choices.To me, Shangri-La is a metaphor for the mental tranquility that many spiritual practices can bring. For anyone who has enjoyed these practices, you will know that it can be tempting to withdraw totally into them. To do so can be delicious, especially for the frazzled soul. At the same time, we are made of flesh, blood and boil with emotions that seek their venting through action. How can the two instincts be reconciled? You are left to come to your own conclusions, and that's one of the great beauties of this fine book.The book has several weaknesses that will bother most readers. Except for Conway, the character development is minimal. The book is too conveniently filled with people in Tibet who speak perfect English. Morality is held a little bit too much in suspense for the book to be as spiritual as it had the potential to be. There's a heavy overlay of British Empire perspective that will seem remote to current readers as well.The ideal reader for this book is someone who enjoyed Butler's Erewhon or H.G. Wells's The Time Machine.I was left thinking that we each need our own personal Shangri-La today more than ever. May you find a way to carry it with you!"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Since Heinrich Harrer's &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; (based on author's true story) and &quot;Return to Tibet&quot;, I had caught myself in a reading spree on everything related to Tibet, whether fiction or non-fiction. Tehn I came across James Hilton's &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;. I had to admit that the book caught my attention with an engaging plot that four people brought against their will to mysterious Shangri-La, set in the hidden mountains of the Blue Moon, a place where nobody ages. The mysterious and suspending plot is what makes this Hawthornden Prize-winning novel catchy and was made into motion pictures several times.Despite the splendidly written text, the storyline itself was not developed very extensively. Most of the text describes the story of Hugh Conway, who was trapped by the fascination of eternal life. The sudden and abrupt ending of the novel was somehow disappointing to me."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Awesome book, very interesting, fairly quick read.If you are one of the people who believes that \\"nothing ever happens\\" in this book, then perhaps you need to take a step back and really contemplate what transpires in this book.

The unofficial leader of the four is Conway, a British embassy relations-sort of man. Rather than being outraged, Conway is content in the serene and spiritual surroundings.*** None of the female characters ever develop beyond a paragraph or two, and the scope of the plot only involves arriving at and possibly leaving Shangri-La.*** The prologue and epilogue to the story, however, are very well done and extend the mystery of Shangri-La. Does this place truly exist? Are people able to prolong their lives in spiritual and intellectual enlightenment? Was Conway just spaced out on herbal drugs or perhaps suckered by cult fanatics?*** The book has no final answers. Its main goal is to detach people from the modern sense of time and the often unhappy pursuits we impose on ourselves and each other.

I like the way the book leaves you hanging and longing for more at the end. I would recommend this read."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Sorry, this novella didn't arouse any passion but did stir up some frustration in me. Perhaps it's because of my own expectations and the multitude of 4 & 5 star ratings here or the british reference writing or the somewhat choppy style; perhaps it's that the morals it teaches have been exhaustedly dissected with parallel novels at the time and since this book was written. I suppose it's all of the above. The story is good, the ending is good, even the sparse development of the characters is good, albeit I was not able to wrap myself around anyone's humanity except partially the main character's.It's Marxist \\"ends justifies the means\\" message is striking but never dealt with; a huge moral hole. But that's also the reality of the Marxist road map. This cultural utopia denies man's drive to do better with his position and his material betterment. An inner drive in all of us that should never be ignored or quelled. The parallel lesson that Shangri-la is not so much a place as a growth within oneself makes for some good thought provoking cud. The addictive draw of a utopian society is a political demon we face everyday. But hopefully, eventually, we experience our own confrontations that draw us back to the reality of our lives with a lesson to try to do better.Anyway, it's good. For the time it was written it was probably great. Read it. Just don't make the mistake I did of getting your hopes up too high. The message has been beaten to death."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"A plane is kidnapped and its passengers end up in lamasery in Tibet.

I first read the book when I was a teen, so I remembered little about it. But, I have watched the film countless times, it being one of my favorites. And, as I completed the book this time, I discovered that experiencing both media at the same time that I had changed my view about books being turned into movies. By most generous comment about Hilton's book is to give him credit for something we may overlook. When my friends and I talk about reading books by Grishom or Baldacci (for example), we sometimes have trouble remembering one book from the other after time has passed. It's not that they're not wonderful books, but the authors today tend to write in one specific genre for most of their careers. But, like Charles Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol\\", which you don't mistake for any other Dickens work, and which is unique in fiction, \\"Lost Horizon\\" is a book of Hilton's which you don't mistake for \\"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\\" or \\"Random Harvest\\"; or for that matter, its unique story isn't confused with any other author's work. Shangri La holds a unique status in fiction, and it belongs to Hilton for all time.And then you have the film version from Frank Capra in 1937. And here is where my thoughts have changed regarding to translating books into movies. We all know that sometimes it is done well, and sometimes it is a massacre. But I have begun to look at it as evolution in story telling. In my view, Capra changes, but actually improves upon Hilton's story telling. For example, in the Hilton book you get the impression that Conway is a COMPETENT, but MIDDLING person in the British diplomatic corps. So why would the head lama be so enthusiastic about him that he would kidnap an airplane full of people to bring him to Shangri La? Capra painted Conway as the marvel of the British diplomatic corps and explained that the head lama had read books by him and saw a likeness in thinking. That makes more sense in explaining why the kidnapping. Similarly, the book provides no love interest for Conway, while the film does...which gives Conway even more purpose in fighting the odds to return to Shangri La.That's why this is one of those situations in story telling where I suggest you read the book and watch the film...in that order. Both are true gems."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Hilton's Lost Horizon is often credited with being the origin of the Shangri-La myth, and indeed it is a compelling story. Written in the 1930s, the book is both a product of the turmoil and chaos created by the First World War and subsequent worldwide depression and anticipatory of the conflagration to come. Nestled in-between in both time and place is Shangri-La - an oasis of calm and \\"moderation\\" in a world of excess and fanaticism.Four people, the world weary Conway, his deputy Mallinson, a 1930s American Bernie Madoff named Barnard, and a missionary named Miss Brinklow, are kidnapped and flown high into the Himalayas. When their plane crashes they find themselves drawn into a secluded valley utopia where they find things aren't always what they seem.Hilton does a wonderful job describing the beauty of Tibet, and has a way of inspiring, through Conway's own recounting of his adventures, a sense of wanderlust. There were times when reading this that I found myself actually holding onto images of white-capped mountains and green florid valleys with incredible vividness and a growing desire to just be out of doors (this book would make excellent camping reading). There were moments of Western Eurocentrism, as to be expected of a 1930s novel that mainly centers on a British consul's adventures in areas of their far reaching empire, and occasionally the dismissive tone of the narrator toward native Tibetan society and culture were annoying. But, again, one has to remember the context of its construction, and at that, these attitudes become part of the story itself in it's theme of East vs. West. Many of the characters represent the dichotomies of those two cultures and Hilton consciously blends them to produce a utopian world in the valley in-between those two worlds. Shangri-La has running water and heated plumbing, combined with lonely solitude and contemplation reminiscent of a Buddhist monastery. It combines a feudal agricultural economy and authoritative political system, while simultaneously allowing for the absolute freedom of individuals living in the valley.Throughout, one gets a sense of a sad desire to avoid what Hilton can see on the Horizon: the Second World War - this is especially so once the lamas reveal what the purpose of Shangri-La actually is. Aside from all the social and cultural commentary the book provides, Lost Horizon is just a really fun mystery that reminds one of the old travel novels of the 19th and early 20th century, when there were still places to be explored and customs that seemed odd. It definitely was the perfect follow-up for Moloka'i and if anything has stoked my desire to read more good historical fiction.("},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Book was exactly like description! James Hilton is one of my all time favorite authors. Will purchase from this seller again. Great customer service!"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"\\"Lost Horizon\\" is widely considered to be one of (if not the) seminal science-fiction works. It speaks to the universal human desire to find utopia and live long enough to enjoy it. This is one of the rare books that I was semi-reading, reading a dozen or so pages a month, and became so involved when I reached the plot twist I immediately had to finish it.While I love the book, especially the massive twist in the middle, the ending leaves me wanting. Without giving away too much, while I like the open-ended quality, I found the plausibility of one of the main characters finding their ideal world and, with hardly a second thought, abandoning it almost on impulse rather remote. This left a sour taste in my mouth of what was otherwise an amazing book."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"This novel was beautiful, almost more like a long poem than a novel because of its unhurried pace and evenness of plot. I enjoyed the part of the book when the four spent their time at Shangri-La the best....it was a very relaxing, yet mind-opening read. I only wish that Mr. Hilton had portrayed Conway's \\"new position\\" at the end of the novel, rather than having him exit in the manner he did.I don't want to spoil any of the outcome, but the ending was a bit brisk....I wanted to know more about the second chapter for Conway. Overall, though, an absolute must-read for any hard-core literature fan. It is easily devoured in one sitting...think of it as a 'deep tissue massage' for the mind - the depth and intricacy of the concepts hit you immediately, but the relaxation and peacefulness linger for a while."},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"Wars do strange things to those who fight them. The trenches of the First World War have left Conway, James Hilton's most memorable hero, feeling himself old long before his time. When he and three others being evacuated from the British consulate at Baskul find themselves kidnapped - flown to a Tibetan monastery, instead of to safety as they expected - he accepts the situation with an ease that infuriates his hero-worshipping young colleague, Mallinson. Conway takes easily to Shangri-La's life of isolated serenity. When he learns why he and his companions were brought to that remote and secret valley, he's not angry. Instead, he feels so oddly at home that only for love's sake will he leave....I first read \\"Lost Horizon\\" in Grade 8, and remembered it fondly enough to pick up a copy when it recently crossed my path again. I read everything else by James Hilton that I could find during the years between. Definitely, this book is a fine author's master work.

Years later I re-read it, a little apprehensive that I would find it dated and contrived. It is neither. Lost Horizon is, quite simply, a triumph of the story-teller's art. A simple tale of idealistic faith in the human spirit, James Hilton's famous novel is crafted in unadorned, crystalline prose. It is, by turns, moving, mysterious, surprising and, ultimately, profoundly inspiring. Lost Horizon may not satisfy those too sophisticated to allow themselves to give in to its sentimental simplicity. But I highly recommend it to readers willing to suspend disbelief and to surrender to the wonder of a transporting fairy tale as they take a magical and unforgettable journey to the Valley of the Blue Moon.

In a way, the book is quite prophetic--the High Llama's dream of a world of continual war is a mirror of what would occur only a few years ahead. (And think about our own--a continual war against terror, lost jobs, and and a dying culture filled with violence and meaningless sex, and lies.) As one reads this novel, at least for me, I found myself wanting to try and find or, if possible, create a place that could be for me and my friends and family a Shangri-La.

I had never forgotten it in all the years that have intervened.I am not exactly sure how things like this seem to happen, but recently I was struck with the idea of re-reading some of my \\"great books\\" from high school and early in my (now becoming long) life. Searching for this James Hilton masterpiece I discovered that it is celebrating it's 80th Birthday shortly, and also it's 50th anniversary with me! So, in honor of that \\"double\\" date, I promptly decided to immediately obtain another copy and re-read it. In my search here, I discovered this particular edition and decided upon it. It is reproduced from an original copy of the book, and also I note, in limited quantities of 250 copies at a printing.It is lovely to look at and to hold if you are like me, a hopeless old romantic! Reproduction of the original cover, and printed on ecru paper to have the look of an original, etc. The pages are, really, like looking at/reading an original edition. Beautifully produced and handsomely bound. Having been in the printing and publishing industry for my entire career, I truly appreciate efforts put in to reproduce grand old books, etc., for the pleasure of people today. It bespeaks the importance of certain items/pieces that this attention is placed thus to provide them for us in what today is pretty much a \\"throw-away-world\\" and gives us something more substantial to hold onto, or in our hands, as we read or re-read these works of importance to us.If you have never read this great book, I cannot recommend strongly enough that you do. It truly would be a shame should you not ever have had the pleasure of experiencing the words and message laid before one here in this book. If you have read it, you already know that which I speak of. However, have you ever tossed the idea about of a re-visit to Shangri-La as Conrad so desperately did? As I said above, I am a hopeless old romantic, so it is perhaps natural that I would be just as deeply pleased, moved, and \\"wish for\\" a lovely time and place such as Chang's Blue Mountains and the valley between...the valley that holds/held so very much.I would urge you to read, or re-read, this truly magic, magisterial, work by James Hilton. Truly, it belongs on everyone's \\"read\\" or \\"to read\\" list....and \\"more than once\\"!~operabruin"},{"Title":"Lost Horizon","review":"The story line in the book Lost Horizon, although fiction is totally understandable that such a valley could exist in the Himalayan Mountains. The piece about eternal life is what makes the story so interesting as that is what a lot of people would want (not necessarily me). I have travelled to an area similar with the high snow capped mountain on either side of the pass and drop down into beautiful valleys. This book is a great read for ages from teens to adults. It is an easy book to read and put down and when you pick up again to follow on with the story line.

It also appears in his first collection of stories called 'Nine Stories.'It tells the story of an American G.I. who for one part of the story is in Devon England where he is in training. On one lonely day off he goes into a tea-room and meets an English child and her small brother. Her name is 'Esme' and she is a precocious beautiful and sensitive child with whom the G.I. has a friendly, and somewhat from his point- of- view ironic conversation. The language is pure Salingerese. The little brother acts up and is chided by his sister. He recites a riddle , : What did one wall say to another\\" and hilariously gives the answer \\"Meet you at the corner\\" When the soldier returns the answer at his asking another time he gets upset. But at parting the soldier asks him the question and the little boy gets his spirit back by again giving the answer. More important the soldier and the little girl in some way assauge each other's loneliness. She is lonely for her father who has been lost in the war. He is lonely, lonely.The scene then changes to an Army headquarters in the heart of the European theatre. The same soldier is on the verge of breakdown when he receives a letter from Esme , which somehow brings him back to a sense that there is something beautiful, whole , humane in the world, something worth living for.The story of course must be read to be felt truly. My summary is poor. It is such a beautiful story.I truly suggest you read it. \\"It will make you laugh. It will make you cry.

He was my age but I didn't know anything about the incident when it actually happened. I finally read the book just now at age 35 and WOW!

It is about a little boy's triumph over tragedy. People can be cruel but they can also be kind....David faces many obstacles in his road to recovery but God is faithful and David continually bounces back. I feel like this \\"little boy\\" (who was/is actually my age) has become a friend. I have found a kindred spirit in this child and in the hearts of the kind people in this book. There is also his mom, Marie, who is his advocate and best friend, her fiance, John, Ken & Judy Curtis--a wonderful Christian couple who introduce them to Christ, then there is the Buena Park Police Dept who work tirelessly to keep David and Marie safe, and even set up a find to raise money to pay his medical bills (!), the hospital staff who took care of him, Reggie Jackson, who took time out of his busy schedule to visit David regularly both in California and also when David was transferred to Schreiner's in Boston!!! Also the people across the nation who reached out to offer emotional, financial and spiritual support. You will feel like you have made a bunch of new friends.

You are required to have an access code, which the publisher's technical support person says must be purchased in addition to the book.Poor editingThis book may be the most poorly edited textbook I've encountered in 5 years of university classes. The additional shame of it is that the subject matter is Technical Writing, which should /begin/ with good editing. A few examples of editing issues, which often seem to be related to the very point the author is advising against, are given below.To have a typo (\\"tremperatures\\") in an example in which the author advocates \\"bolstering confidence\\" by \\"preparing a neat and carefully proofread memo\\" is counterproductive.The author cautions against graphics that detract from your message or confuse readers, then uses one. Page 343 contains a graph with a confusing relationship between the \\"Salary\\" scale on the vertical axis and the various animal populations on the horizontal axis. Were these paid beasts?There is an excellent point presented on page 226, which states that the words /this/ or /that/ should be followed by a noun when used as an echo word at the beginning of a sentence. At the top of the same page, however, the author uses /these/ without a noun after it, and again two pages later, on page 228, he uses the phrase, \\"when this happens,\\" again with no associated noun.I don't understand the author's phrase, \\"but they can always lead to the unethical treatment of other people,\\" on page 228. I understand \\"they can lead\\" and \\"they always lead,\\" or even perhaps, in rare circumstances, \\"they always can lead,\\" but not \\"they can always lead.\\"Troubling gender choicesIn addition to the poor editing, the author made troubling gender choices for the characters presented in his examples. In the first few chapters, \\"Sarah\\" is a metallurgist, while \\"Larry\\" is a nutritionist; \\"Alyssa\\" receives correspondence from \\"Frank\\" on testing she required; \\"Marti\\" is a mechanical engineer, while \\"Donald\\" uses inflammatory language in his memo.ConclusionI have no idea what other texts may be available for technical writing instruction, but if I were a professor, I'd be looking for them."},{"Title":"Technical Communications: A Reader-Centered Approach","review":"Very impressed.

I began by looking through numerous Top 100 Horror Books lists and adding titles that looked interesting to an Amazon Wish List. In all the various lists I researched, F. Paul Wilson's The Keep was a mainstay.The setup is great...at the height of WWII a group of Nazis are stationed in an old castle-like keep due to its strategic location. It's a strange edifice, a perfectly maintained keep that has been around for 500 years and yet no one knows who built it or why. Everything about it is foreboding; from its un-mortised stones, to its location on the dark side of the mountain, to its 49 rooms and countless hidden passages, to the 16,807 strange crosses imbedded into its walls. No birds nest there, and travellers who spend the night flee come morning with the nightmares of being trapped and hungry fresh in their minds.But none of this deters the Nazis and one by one, they begin to be murdered in the keep. For they have disturbed a force of evil and it has been awakened. An additional attachment of SOS elites are sent in to assist, but find themselves being nothing more than additional prey. In desperation the Nazis consult a Jewish Romanian folklore expert for assistance and as he, his daughter, and a stranger named Glenn meet, the true horror of the keep is revealed.The Keep is finely wrought fiction. The characters are as strongly portrayed as the setting, and the take on the Vampire mythos is fresh and original. F. Paul Wilson does an excellent job plotting this adventure so that it never lags. His imagery, dialogue, and prose are beyond reproach. Add to these considerable talents a knack for small set pieces that are truly dark and twisted, and you should have the recipe for a perfect tale of horror.However, that is where it falls short in my estimation. It is not scary or horrifying. I do not recall my eyes widening in horror the same way they might have in similar literary/horror efforts (e.g. Salem's Lot). However, that does not mean it was not without merit. On the contrary, it is a great read that delivers on many fronts...just don't expect to be scared."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"This is a very good book. It kept me on the edge of my seat and I read it incredibly quickly. This book is one of my all time favorites (Except I didn't like the last 1/4 of the book)."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"&quot;The Keep&quot;, it must be said up front, is one of the most engaging and fast-paced horror novels I have yet read. It would be an injustice to compare it to, say, Stephen King, since the novel already has Wilson's own unqiue voice. However, it's his fourth novel, if I'm correct, and not without its flaws that have obviously been corrected in later stories, most notably the Repairman Jack series.Wilson acknowledges a debt to Lovecraft, Howard, and Smith, and indeed, &quot;The Keep&quot; brings the best elements of these giants together. The slithering menace and brooding malevolence of Lovecraft, the no-nonsense action and violence of Howard, and the dreamy vistas and horrors of Smith spring to life on every page.The setting of &quot;The Keep&quot;, the Romanian mountain pass, and its mists and village candlelight, is classic and has been unsurpassed in its description and atmosphere. The story itself is highly original, provocative even, since the reader is constantly forced in a dilemma of chosing sides, and is confronted with the notion of good and evil, black and white, opposites that have been bred into us since we have been children. And now, in knowing that the entity that slays German soldiers (the story takes place in the Second World War) is evil itself, but that the German soldiers are another evil personified, the reader feels discomfort: after all, one has to choose sides.As said, there are a few flaws. &quot;The Keep&quot; is in essence an adventure in the tradition of the above mentioned writers. Sometimes, however, the story and prose halts a bit when it is concerned with the main characters. Even though Wilson has been daring in mingling black and white into grey, characters like Magda and Glenn do stay a bit superficial, only to flare up sometimes in overtly melodramatic behaviour. Of course, love and conflict are the ingredients of great adventure stories, but one just can't escape the notion that Wilson wanted to take the story's conclusion and the development of the characters into a slightly different and less happy direction. For instance, ambigous characters in the end get shoved from the story, while the good characters see the dawn of a new day in true (sugarcandy) Hollywood fashion, even more happy after the harrowing ordeals than before them.Had Wilson persevered in his ambivalent plot straight towards the end I believe &quot;The Keep&quot; would have been an even greater story, but as it is, it is already a very entertaining tale that any adventure, dark fantasy, or horror fan (excuse my pigeon-holing) shouldn't be without. It's one of those books you take with you to bed at night only to find in the morning that you forgot there was such a thing as morning."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"Not bad. Not great either. Some parts were downright weak (I'm thinking here of the scene wherein we are introduced to the spinsterish, bookish, middle-aged heroine. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it blatantly didn't fit here. Methinks the author was under the impression that it was important to work in a description of her as quickly as possible. To be fair, he also worked in a physical description of the male lead as early as possible, and with equal awkwardness.) The ending was kind of... well, without spoiling, the most I can say is that you have seen this ending before, even if you've been living in outer Kurdistan.This was all the more disappointing as the middle tantalizingly held out the possibility of a really surprising twist, and kept the suspense going. Suspense was definitely the strong point of the novel. The opening scenes, with the 'Something is murdering my men' hook, were quite good. The concept of a battle, not really between good and evil, but in trying to decide which is the lesser of two evils has a lot of real-world resonance.Overall: Actually, I would recommend this one for a snack, but I'm being harsh with it because it could have been much more."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"I enjoyed this book. From the very beginning, a classic war between good and evil. First we think it is the Nazi's, a horror created by man. Yet the evil goes deeper than that, drawing the reader into a spellbinding black tale. Page by page we learn to love some of the characters, hate others, and fear for the fate of mankind. The author superbly weaves us into the tale, until ultimately we are caught up in the battle ourselves. I was left wondering, was this a tale of mythical proportions or was it an attempt to force us to see what our very humanness is capable of? Either way, the story gets my vote."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"It is very hard for me to like books. But I picked this one up. I love pretty much anything about World War II. Plus I love anything about Vampires. Putting them both together makes a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"Packed full of supernatural and historical elements, this is a fun and entertaining read. Wilson combines these supernatural elements in a rather convincing manner with his WWII backdrop. The ending is pretty satisfying as well, and the whole book moves along at a fast pace. It's exciting and certainly a joy to read - though it definitely requires a rather major suspension of disbelief. I am definitely curious to check out Wilson's other books now!"},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"As one reviewer stated, Wilson actually gets the reader to sympathize with the Nazis. Not an easy task but he pulls it off brilliantly. In fact, the most human character in the book is a German officer, even though he is not the hero. I wont ruin any surprises for the new reader but suffice to say this. This is a novel that reads like a brilliant movie. The words flow off the pages and it is so easy to see everything that happens. The last hundred pages fly by FAST. This was indeed made into a movie but it needs to be done again and done right. If the right director can work this, I see it is a potential masterpiece. A must read."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"Given the positive reviews, I thought this book would be better than it was. At first, this seemed to be a new and interesting take on the supernatural boogeyman-in-the-closet genre. Creepy atmosphere? Check. Despicable bad guys inexplicably dying? Check. Mysterious monster in the dark? Check. But then, the book took a sharp left turn into romance novel territory, which I found confusing (and annoying). The denouement was completely predictable. I anticipate reading another of F. Paul Wilson's novels before adding him to (or crossing him off) my list of authors to follow."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"F. Paul Wilson's \\"The Keep\\" has a pretty solid reputation in the horror genre. Certainly, the premise is intriguing: Nazis arrive at a keep in Romania in anticipation of \\"Operation: Barbarossa,\\" release something evil, and one by one become victims. But something happens in the last third of the book: a novel that has been a legitimately creepy Lovecraftian horror novel abruptly becomes a stand Howard bit of sword and sorcery. The end result is unsatisfactory.At this point, I will issue a \\"SPOILER ALERT!\\" I just can't discuss this novel, and my frustration with it without examining some of the key plot points.As I said, it starts quite nicely. Erich Kaempffer, a sturmbannfurher of the SS, has been given a new assignment. He is to go to the Dinu Pass in Romania to investigate a telegram from Captain Klaus Woermann to the high command, stating that \\"something is murdering my men.\\" Woermann has occupied a mysterious keep, one with an unusual history: it has been kept immaculate for centuries by the locals, in the employ of parties unknown. It is surrounded by unusual crosses. Birds refuse to nest in it. And anyone who attempts to stay the night is given to bad dreams. Naturally, the Germans disregard this. One greedy fool goes poking around, opens a chamber, and promptly has his head torn off. Over the next week, a victim is taken each night.Kaempffer, who is bucking for a promotion to his own death camp, grudgingly takes the assignment. Kaempffer and Woermann have a great deal of animosity between them, stemming from Kaempffer's acts in the First World War. That is exacerbated by Woermann's disdain for the Nazi part and Hitler.However, Kaempffer proves just as impotent to prevent the grisly murders. So, Theodor Cuza, an expert on the region, and his daughter, Magda are summoned. The tension is further heightened by Cuza's poor health and the fact that father and daughter are Jewish. And, a mysterious man, simply called Glenn, who \\"knows\\" the truth of the keep, soon arrives.And from here, the novel becomes less horror and more adventure. Cuza soon encounters the monster. Everyone believes it to be a vampire, but in fact it is something far more sinister. And it soon becomes clear that its influence is unhealthy to Cuza, as he grows more enchanted with the notion of using the monster to destroy Hitler, while growing suspicious of Magda's relationship with Glenn.The major problem with this novel is the structure of the narrative. Wilson starts the novel squarely focused on Woermann and Kaempffer as antagonists forced to put aside their relationship to fight the horror. However, as the novel progresses, it soon becomes clear that the real heroes of the novel are Magda and Glenn. Which is frustrating because Glenn is never really drawn fully as a character. Magda is reasonably solid, but Wilson reiterates many times just how much she has given up for her father, how strong she is inside, and how unattractive to men she thinks she is. In the meantime the sympathetic Woermann and the evil Kaempffer are simply dropped when they have served their purpose to the narrative, without any real sense of closure, despite effectively carrying the novel from page one.Another problem is the switch in genre. With Glenn's arrival, and the truth revealed, the horror vanishes, and instead we get what must have been the inspiration for \\"Highlander.\\" I really don't want to go too much further into it, but, suffice to say, I really wished that the monster had been a simple vampire.Wilson can tell an entertaining story. It's just the sense that I had been playing some sort of literary shell game when I finished the book that really bothered me. This is a shame, because I really felt as if there was the germ of a great idea here. It just was never allowed to grow organically."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"A friend asked me to describe THE KEEP. I had to tell him I couldn't say too much about this complex novel for fear of giving away vital plot lines before he could read for himself.Set in World War II, THE KEEP follows a German Army troop as they move into a Romanian mountain fortress to protect a strategic entry point from enemies. Then 'something' starts picking them off one by one. Reinforcements arrive by way of an SS extermination squad which is no more successful in vanquishing the unseen foe. Then we're introduced to Professor Cuza, his daughter, Magda, and Glenn, the mysterious stranger. What ensues is one of the most uniqe vampire stories I have ever read. The power struggle between Captain Woermann and SS Major Kaempffer provides constant tension and conflict throughout the story. Molasar, the resident vamp, is so evil and fascinating; I'd like to see more of him. But he's not your garden-variety vampire; Wilson throws in a few twists to the traditional vamp tale. This novel brilliantly combines history, military strategy and politics, vampire myth, and suspense to create one incredible story. Some Nazis get disposed of along the way which, in my opinion, is never a bad thing.This is a great read. I couldn't put it down, and I can't wait to move on to the next in the series."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"This was the first book that I read by F. Paul Wilson, and it is still the best.The pacing, characterizations, and novel aspects of the Keep make it a book that I have re-read numerous times.If imitation is the most sincere form of flattery then the Keep wins. It was made into a movie (OK, not a great movie, but still a major release film), a comic, and a role-playing adventure for Dungeons and Dragons.Spoilers follow ...The premise of the story is that there has been a war between cosmic forces. The bad force is called the Otherness, and the good force ... well, the good force is just kind of neutral towards people. That is revealed in later books by Mr. Wilson.)There is a Lovecraftian feel to the concept, but it is probably most closely related to Paul Edwin Zimmer's series of books where he posits a world by world war between the evil, seven Great Ones and the forces of light and goodness.Long ago, during the first age (14-15 thousand years ago), the last battle raged on Earth between these forces using forces that would be described today as magic. In the end, there were only two champions left, Rasalom [Eeeeeevil] and Glaeken [Good]. Glaeken was imbued with many powers by the forces of good. Glaeken is able to defeat Rasalom in that pre-history, final battle, but Glaeken enjoys being an immortal demi-god. As long as Rasalom is not destroyed, Glaeken figures that he can continue to live forever. This turns out not to be the best plan though, because, unfortunately, Rasalom continues to come back. Think of the Black Plague ... Rasalom. Think of the Great Flood ... Rasalom. Yes, yes, there is a pattern here. At some point, prior to WW II, Glaeken is able to defeat Rasalom and inter him in a remote Keep.That will teach him!And for a few years ... all is well ...As the story begins, the Nazis are moving into a remote village and taking over a cursed keep. The entire keep is covered with metal runes that appear to be some version of a cross, but the reader comes to find out that these are psychic conduits for the power of good from Glaeken's magic sword's hilt.The Nazis move into the Keep and begin doing the bad things that Nazis do. Rasalom feeds off of the Nazis' evil acts and grows stronger, influencing the Nazis to do even more evil acts.Eventually Rasalom convinces the Nazis to release him and to remove the sword hilt from the Keep, releasing Rasalom into the world.Dum - dum - dum ...So, Glaeken is forces to fight Rasalom in a climatic battle on the walls of the crumbling Keep, and eventually slays Rasalom again.With Rasalom gone, Glaeken's immortality fades, the sword shatters, and the hero wins the mortal girl of his dreams; they go off to live happily ever-after.One of the best things about the Keep is that the author reveals the back-story gradually. The reader is given just enough information chapter by chapter to give the descriptions of the events additional meaning, but not enough to spoil the story.For example, when the Keep is first breached, Glaeken receives a psychic warning and he has to travel from the Greek coast up into the Carpathian Alps.Also, even the secondary characters do reasonable, logic things. When Glaeken attempts to enter the Keep across the drawbridge, the Nazis lay waste to him with submachine gun fire. Yes, that is what they would have likely done.All in all, a very good read!I highly recommend the Keep!Now an addendum ... since Mr. Wilson wrote this book, he wrote a whole series of follow-on books that eventually saw Rasalom reborn and (after nine books or so) casting a giant curse that would bring the Old Ones back to the Earth.In the original series, the final climatic scene finds the heroes from all of the various intermediate books sitting around a table in New York city with a reforged magic blade and the original magical hilt. Each of them slams the hilt onto the tang of the blade, and nothing happens ... until Glaeken does it, and then the sword lights up with holy fire.Glaeken, who is an old man at this point, staggers out to the biggest, baddest nearly hatching \\"Bad Thing\\"(TM) and destroys Rasalom's nearly metamorphosed Eeeeevil form.It was a wonderful end to a very fun series.At some point though, Mr. Wilson decided to introduce a new character, Repairman Jack, into the mix and started re-writing the whole series.Honestly, I am torn.I have read several of the Repairman Jack novels, and Mr. Wilson's writing has only gotten better over the years. Also, Jack makes a compelling character. While Glaeken was kind of a superman, Jack is more ordinary. He still exhibits close to supernatural abilities in some areas (e.g., resisting the uber-virus in Hosts), but he can get beat-up, feel pain, and even be killed.Mr. Wilson has hinted that Repairman Jack will play a critical road in the new final novel (to be released in 2012), but I am hoping that Glaeken does strike the final blow against Rasalom again this time around.[I was fairly bummed when Glaeken's bride from the Keep was revealed to be suffering from dementia in By the Sword. While reasonable, it was an unnecessary downer.]In service,Richthe Original Dr. Games since 1993"},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"REVIEWED BY THE FUNKY WEREPIGTHE KEEP has a special place in my heart. When I was a young dude I saw the movie first and I left confused and trying to block the image of a naked Scott Glenn from my mind. But I caught that it was based off a novel I could actually buy. And I thought if there's a book, it's got to be better. It opened a whole new world for me. Reading.This book swept me away me as a teenager. Back in WWII, Germany soldiers occupy an abandoned keep. The locals warn them that no one stays long but is there a bigger evil than the Nazis? They don't think so. Until one of their men die each night, their throats ripped out and blood drained. The Nazis bring in an expert on the keep, a Jewish scholar and his daughter to solve the mystery. And from nowhere a mysterious stranger arrives, summoned by the monster awaking within.Yeah, read again how complex that is. To juggle all of these plots and subplots, multiple characters and tension- and keep it historically accurate is beyond amazing. F Paul Wilson delivers the story with depth, emotion and pure terror. He doesn't tip-toe around the delicate matters the book faces such as the extermination of the Jews in death camps or how the Nazis view their superiority. He even skillfully paints one of the commanders as quite human and as a reader you can't help but side with him on several raw issues as he stands up to the blatant wrong his beloved country is doing. Wilson is so in control here it's like watching the fingers of a harp player.Perhaps the biggest thing Wilson does is tackle the classic vampire story. With all the over-saturation of the vampire market now and everyone trying to do something different, it's almost embarrassing to see The KEEP did it far better two decades ago. His character Molasar is easily the most frightening creature of the night since the original Dracula. And here is where Wilson shows his mad skills- there are times you root for Molasar because of the possibilities he offers in ridding the world of another real horror- the Nazis. An intense plot twist and Wilson never stops spinning which side you should be on.I recently went back and reread THE KEEP after many many moons because I wondered what I may have missed in my younger days. I missed everything. I dug the book before. But now I've discovered just how little I knew about brilliant writing. Thank you book stores for keeping this available and thank you conventions where we get to meet these legendary writers. But most of all, thank you F Paul Wilson. Your novel snatched me away and scared the crap out of me. Again."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"F. Paul Wilson's The Keep is one of my all-time favorite horror novels. On its surface, the story could have been pure camp with its Nazis vs. something even worse plot. But to Wilson's credit, the novel transcends such a over-simplified synopsis.Set during World War II, Nazis show up at a tiny Romanian village high in the Carpathians to man an ancient fortress known only as the keep. Ignoring the warnings of villagers not to stay in the keep after dark, the Nazis start disappearing and dying in gruesome ways after a few of the soldiers pry a stone loose that seems to lead to some sort of ancient cavern.First suspecting that villagers are responsible for his missing men, the leader of the German force soon has to call in reinforcements and an expert. The expert turns out to be a Jewish professor and his daughter who had been marked for the death camps. In one of the more intriguing bits of vampire lore, Wilson presents the professor with a crisis of faith when he tries to understand why the creature shrinks from crosses, but a Star of David has no effect on it. This could have been offensive in the wrong hands, but Wilson handles it well ... and, indeed, the reader does come away pondering why vampires have such an aversion to crosses when other religious symbols seemingly don't affect them.Then, just as it seems ultimate evil is about to triumph over merely human evil, a new force joins to fight in the mysterious form of The Adversary, a character who will play a role in several other Wilson novels that make up the Adversary Cycle.The Keep is one of those novels that have been around for years and is now being given new life and a new format on Kindle. I loved re-discovering it and racing my way through in over the course of a cold, wintry weekend. This has been - and still is - one of my favorite contemporary horror novels."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"During the World War II a small detachment of German soldiers arrives at a remote Romanian mountain pass. Their mission is to stay at the Keep, a mysterious centuries-old fortified structure, and from there to watch over the pass. However, one of the soldiers inadvertently disturbs something within the Keep and is consequently murdered in the most horrific way imaginable. On every subsequent night another soldier is murdered under similar mysterious circumstances. The news of these murders reaches the German high command, which decides to send a group of notorious Einsatzkommandos to sort things out. Despite their initial arrogance, they too end up being stymied by an evil that seems to defy their imagination. Things become complicated with an arrival of a few outsiders, some who come voluntarily and some who had been forced to help with the investigation. It all culminates in a terrifying and brutal final showdown.This is a fairly original variation on the theme of vampire and Dracula lore. I decided to read this book after watching the eponymous Michael Mannmovie. (Which, unfortunately, has not been released on DVD yet. The movie was very atmospheric and visually intriguing, but many points of the plot development left me wanting for more information. The book fills in some of these gaps. The first half of the book and the movie are more or less identical, with only some minor alterations that don't change much in terms of the plot development. Some of the latter scenes in the book, however, are also much more horrifying than anything that could be seen in the movie. In the final part of the book we find out more about the mysterious evil presence in the Keep, its origin and its purpose. Personally, I was not too impressed with these explanations - they were not too imaginative for my liking. In fact, it might have been a good idea to leave them out of the movie version after all.Overall, this is a well written and intriguing supernatural horror thriller that will please all the lovers of this genre."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"Maybe it's because there are so many vampire & zombie stories out now that this book doesn't pack quite as much a punch as it could. It's appropriately moody and dark, and it's quite well written. It was very entertaining read and I got through it pretty quickly. The Kindle edition is well formatted.This takes place during WWII at a \\"keep\\", which is a 500 year old fortification guarding a pass that the Nazis think is important. The murders start the first evening that a Nazi contingent becomes stationed there. A group of SS is brought in to help solve the murders. There's the standard Evil Nazi, and a surprisingly good Nazi (fighting for Germany, not Hitler, doesn't like how the Jews are treated). A Jewish scholar and his daughter are brought in as experts in the Keep's history to try to solve the murders. There's also a mysterious stranger who travels from afar to fight the evil.This story is more an exploration of personalities than a hack and slash horror fest, which I liked. There's an evil presence that needs to be stopped, and there are some horror elements, but it never really devolves into yucky grossness. I really liked it."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"I picked The Keep to read again to find out if my original opinioned still held and I found the story just as enthralling as it was when I read it twenty years ago. This is a classic horror story and one of my favorite books by F. Paul Wilson, who is a master of this horror genre.The setting is 1941 Romania wherein lies a deserted 500 year old castle keep that is occupied by a small squadron of German soldiers and before long one of the German commanders senses that there is something unusual about the keep which is inlaid with crosses and the castle's caretaker warn the soldiers not to touch the crosses. Before long, an unseen force begins murdering the Germans and eventually chaos breaks loose.This is an outstanding supernatural horror tale of the quintessential battle between good and evil. The Keep is a modern vampire classic which explains the origins of vampire legends and folklore. This book is a riveting page turner and horror fans will enjoy this captivating and macabre tale from F. Paul Wilson."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"This was a fun interesting page-turner of a horror novel. Probably in the 3.5 star range.This premise was good, Nazis hunted by a supernatural killer in a ancient keep. It's just that the writing was a little stilted at times and the romance between two of the main characters was too prominent and even a little trite and boring. It would have been better ended prior to the epilogue imho.Overall, it kept me turning the pages and proved to be an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"This is one great horror novel. Set in an ancient keep in the Romanian mountains during world war 2 the Keep holds something ancient, something truly evil. When a group of German soldiers use the Keep as a garrison the horror is released and set upon the world. Even the dreaded SS are no match for this. Great character development set among a truly chilling atmosphere makes The Keep one book not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"Being a writer myself, the one thing that I think I learned the most from reading F. Paul Wilson's The Keep, was his masterful way with dialogue. If you want to feel like the characters in a book are talking right in front of you, or if you want to \`really' feel like you know and care about the characters speaking, then start reading this guy right now.A spooky castle nestled away with no evidence of who owns it or what it's for. Thousands of strange crosses mounted all over it. Rumors of no one being able to spend one night in it due to psychotic nightmares-these three things alone make for the beginning of a great story.But then a regiment of Nazis take control of it, or think they are taking control of it. The men start to be killed in the most gruesome of fashions, and their commander cannot find out who or what is doing it. They can't leave yet because of orders, and each man continues to be murdered in as much a strange and evil way as the first.F. Paul Wilson weaves a suspenseful, creepy story that you'll find you cannot get enough of. You will buy more of this guy's books: count on it.The Keep is an excellent place to start if you haven't read Wilson. Just prepare for his writing to cast a spell of chills over your entire mind and body."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"I always loved the story. &quot;The Keep&quot; is one of my favorite books and I read it twice. I loved the rivalry between Woermann and Kaempffer. Klaus Woermann and Erich Kaempffer are my favorite characters in this book. I found them fascinating."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"Quite possibly the best book I've read. Kept me mesmerized for hours, and one dark, thunderous night, I put it down until someone came home to keep me company as I finished reading. Kept me on the edge of my seat.The Keep, by F. Paul Wilson, is a classic good vs evil story about WWII nazies and a vampiric being locked up for centuries. I lost track of the book for years, and now look forward to reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"This book is a \\"goodie\\" I remember from my youth, and is one of the books that inspired me to be a writer. I'm glad to see it offered as an ebook for the Kindle. It's a great read!Rod Redux, author of Mort and The Oldest Living Vampire Tells All"},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"A platoon of German soldiers is sent to guard a mountain pass leading to the strategically important Romanian oil fields during WW2. They establish a base in a 15th Century Keep, where they inadvertently disturb an ancient evil, and the soldiers start dying at the rate of one a night. After a plea for relocation from the Captain heading the platoon, a squad of Death's Head SS commandos, headed by an ambitious SS Major, is dispatched by German High Command to help them. Death and mayhem ensue.I thought this was a great premise for a horror story: Nazis pitted against a bloodthirsty monster. This is the kind of story that could let the author play all sorts of games with the reader's sympathies, to create complex characters, and to really explore the nature of evil. Unfortunately Wilson instead keeps the story pretty black and white, by introducing other \\"good\\" characters in to the story and making them the major protagonists. This ends up making all the characters two dimensional stereotypes: the evil, cowardly SS major; Glen, the Champion of light, bound through the eons to oppose forces of evil; Magda, the feisty heroine, who hides her beauty and her brains under her dowdy peasant garb; her father, the crippled but brilliant professor; etc.The story would have been much more interesting if Wilson had made the Wehrmacht Captain Woermann and the SS officer the central characters, and depicted them in shades of gray. And frankly I could have done without the Magda and Glen characters altogether - the chapters that focus on them are turgid, overwritten dross, which I soon found myself skimming over. The book is at its best when Wilson just narrates the action in the Keep.Now, to give Wilson his due, he does tell a good story, and he certainly kept me turning the pages all the way to the end. I also like direction he took with the \\"monster\\" - it wasn't what I expected, or what he leads you to think for most of the story.Overall this is a fun, enjoyable read, I just wish Wilson's characters hadn't been so cardboard and obvious."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"All I can say is this is one of my all time favorite reads. This story will grab you from the very beginning and never let you go. After I finished reading the Keep I found myself wanting more. I hope F. Paul Wilson's other writings are as good as The Keep, if so I'll be a very happy lady."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"I really liked the first half of this book. The second half of the book turned into a kind of horror-romance novel that I didn't like so much. If you like the idea of a horror-romance novel you'll probably like this book."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"I thought this book was fantastic. Great horror novel that kept me reading till wee hours of the morning. You could picture the castle and really picture the characters in your mind. F. Paul Wilson writes great horror novels, read the Tomb as well. The Keep would make an excellent movie. The character of Magda is a bit wishy washy with her sexual awakening, and Glenn seems like a supernatural hero but the vampire lore and Vlad the Impaler seems so real and scary. great book to read on an airplane, a real page turner!! enjoy"},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"The first 200 pages were absolutely engrossing. I was gripped by the incredible suspense that Wilson manipulates to amazing effect. The &quot;Something is murdering my men&quot; line is pure horror genius. However, the villain is essentially revealed halfway through the book, and he ceases to be scary anymore because he is now &quot;out of the closet.&quot; I will admit that it was still exciting, but it ceased to be a horror novel at that point, and became more of a fantasy/adventure. And the ending did not live up to the hype on the back of the book. A good read overall, but don't expect to be terrified."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"Plainly put, this book is a superb read. Check out some of the other reviews, And forget about what they say!!!Read the book if you want a great experience, a good read, and a great chill."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"F. Paul Wilson's horror novel, \\"The Keep\\" is a fun and eerie tale set in the midst of the Second World War. When German soldiers begin disappearing at an old castle in Romania on the eve of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, reinforcements are sent to investigate. What they find is much more horrific than any of them could imagine. And a predominant local Jew will have his faith and his loyalty to his daughter tested as he finds an unlikely ally against the Nazis, a creature that quite possibly is even more evil. This book definitely throws the reader some red herrings and keeps him on his toes, and offers a great surprise ending. Wilson succeeds in creating a deep feeling of chaos just beneath the surface of otherwise stable characters and common situations. This ability sets Wilson as a captivating and supremely entertaining writer. There are a few moments that drag, but not many. Fans of horror will surly enjoy this macabre tale of supernatural terror."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"A great book that I'd recommend to any fan of the horror genre (with a very tiny dash of fantasy thrown in for good measure!!). I loved how Mr. Wilson created a truly original spin on the whole vampire legend and how the mysterious Glen character fit into it (I don't want to spoil \\"Molasar\\" for anyone who hasn't read the book yet, but expect some good twists!). I'm always fascinated by credible and creative retellings of famous legends/myths/mysteries.My ony complaint is Magda - while I have no problem with her as a character, I had a problem with some of her dialogue. Sometimes it bordered on cheesy, the way she would describe her love for Glenn, or the predicament she was in.Otherwise, this is a great book that I can see myself reading again a couple years down the road. I thank the author for keeping me up late at night watching the shadows for an entire week!"},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"\\"Soon all will be in chaos. And then the real horror will begin . . . The rich will not be able to buy their way out, the pious will not be able to pray their way out, the crafty will not be able to sneak or lie their way out. Everyone will suffer . . . People will be born into misery; they will spend their days in despair; they will die in agony . . . And the worst of it all, there will be no more hope.\\" This dire prophesy from The Keep, the first book in Wilson's Adversary series, describes the apocalyptic outcome for humankind should an ancient force of darkness win the cosmic game it plays with an opposing force of light.My paperback lists 6 books in the Adversary series: The Keep, The Tomb (with an appearance by Repairman Jack), The Touch, Reborn, Reprisal, and Nightworld. In particular, The Tomb and The Touch can stand alone, but I strongly recommend that the others be read in sequence, as characters and themes carry over from one to another. Wilson's epic battle between light and dark forces from the First World, go beyond traditional conflicts between God and Satan; thus, these books are not simply re-hashings of Rosemary's Baby or Damion. In the words of a character in Reborn: \\"Satan? Forget Satan! Something evil is coming . . . When it gets here, you'll long for your Antichrist. Because prayers won't help you. Neither will guns or bombs.\\"I thought The Keep was an excellent horror novel with solid writing, a brisk pace, well fleshed-out characters, and a chilling adversary. The story takes place in the early 1940s when the Nazi army was rolling relentlessly over Western Europe. However, at a remote Romanian outpost in the Transylvanian Alps, a small force of German soldiers encounters an ancient evil that proves more than their match. To Wilson's credit, he avoids painting all members of the German military with the same brush -- Captain Klaus Woermann, who deplores the excesses of the Nazis, must cope with Major Kaempffer, the SS officer sent to assist him in halting a string of brutal murders that have left the garrison reeling with confusion and terror.Two other plots run parrallel to the main story: A learned Jewish professor and his daughter, struggling with their growing awareness of the horror of concentration camps, must fight their own battle against a force that destroys character by increments, leaving only the base, venal aspects of human nature. Will their beliefs and values be undermined? How will each choose when faced with the seductive promises of ultimate evil? And what choices will the standard-bearer of light make when his growing love for a human woman begins to pull him away from his cosmis duty?"},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"i just read the keep at the begining of this year, unaware that it was the first of a series of books by f. paul wilson in the adversary cycle. we are introduced to several characters that follow the story through decades. an unknown force terrorizes german and nazi troops sation to hold the keep. we have a battle between faiths and beleifs that call into question the foundations in which some characters stand. an excellent true horror read. it an intricate set up to the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"This was the second F.

Better than early Koontz"},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"The setting is Dinu Pass in the Transylvanian Alps of Romania. The time is Spring 1941, in the middle of World War II.A weary, ragtag column of German soldiers work their way up the pass road to a odd twelfth century castle, known as the Keep. Through a sleepy village and the morning fog, Captain Woermann gets his first glimpse of the bizarre structure. As he crosses the bridge over the moat, he puzzles how the castle has been built backwards compared to normal castles, with the large stones on the inside, instead of the outside. Almost like it was built to keep something inside, rather than outside. The strangeness of the Keep continues inside, where hundreds of peculiar nickel crosses have been mortised into the stone walls at regular intervals.Captain Woermann, has orders to occupy and hold the structure. As he and his men are settling in, a couple of his soldiers bring an elderly and a younger man. They are father and son caretakers. Their progenitors have been maintaining the Keep for hundreds of years. Who pays them, they know not. Their family merely receives periodic stipends in payment for their work.The caretakers are surprised when Woermann tells them, he is claiming the Keep in the name of Third Reich and they will be occupying the premises, the caretaker tells them no one stays overnight in the Keep. Those that sleep there, never stay more than once. All have had nightmares and some have gone mad.Woermann feels there is evil within the Keep but he has orders. The next morning one of the soldiers is found dead and another is missing. The dead soldier's head had been ripped off. Woermann continues to loose troops nightly and requests help. Careless soldiers in search of treasure have freed a supernatural monster and provided sustenance for it's weakened state as well.The help that finally arrives in the form of a SS Sturmbannfuhrer Kaempffer and his men, only makes matters worse. Confident that the killings are the result of partisan fighters, Kaempffer has ten villagers executed, but the killings continue, each more gruesome than the last and strange things start to be noticed about the corpses as well.The story gets a little complex hereon. Eventually a sickly Jewish Scholar of ancient languages and his daughter are brought in to decipher messages, that have been left in ancient Cyrillic script. An ageless warrior named Glaeken leaves Portugal for Dinu Pass, once again called to duty after receiving a vision of the imminent freedom, of his ancient maleficent adversary. circumstances creep inexorably toward a reprise of the titanic battle fought eight centuries ago between good and evil.ConclusionSeldom do I read a book more than once. The Keep is one of the exceptions. The Keep was written almost twenty-five years ago by a New England doctor by the name of F. Paul Wilson. This was the first book I read by him but not the last. I have been so impressed with his brilliant stories, fluid, easy going writing style and the sheer novelty of his plots, that I never fail to pick up his latest book.After the Keep, I picked up and read The Tomb a book that is every bit the classic, The Keep is. The Tomb featured, for the first time, the irrepressible Repairman Jack, one of contemporary literature's most popular an beloved characters.In The Keep, the primary characters kept changing or maybe I should say the author kept adding characters so, you didn't get a good feel for any one character. We start out with Captain Boermann and Kaempffer is added. They obviously have a past and in addition to the normal tension between regular army and SS troops, didn't like each other. Rosalom (the Vampire like evil entity) was hard to pinpoint. At one poin the was killing Nazis and I found myself hoping he was a good creature but in reality he was worse than even the Nazis. The ailing professor was good and pure and Rasalom needed him, so he temporarily cured the professor's ailments. He had even the Jewish Professor fooled into helping him by convincing him he would help the Jews by killing Hitler. Then of course we ultimately have our hero Glaeken, who has battled Rasalom before and has traveled across Europe to confront him again. None of these characters are in the forefront long enough to get a feel for, but if this is a weakness in the story I didn't notice.The story comes at you, fast and furious. It is thrilling and terrifying all in one. The creature is the personification of evil and gains strength each day. I don't think it started out that way but The Keep, became the first book in a series, known as the Adversary Series. The Keep is one of my favorite books. 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"Wilson is a master at characters and intricate fast paced plots. I read Deep as the Marrow first and know Dr. Wilson through his medical practice. I decided to purchase The Keep based on reviews by readers and was absolutely floored.

Eery description of the entity and a fantastic villian.. Molasar. I know how it really is spelled but why ruin it for the uninitiated.

A garrison of German soldiers during WWII are sent to occupy a small, oddly constructed keep in Romania. The first night there, two of the soldiers, in an attempt to steal a gold cross, disturb the keep's only occupant. In the following days, they don't make it through the night without a soldier being killed. An SS regiment is sent to stop whatever is going on, but men continue to die. There is also great tension between the SS commander and the German army commander who isn't a Nazi and has become disillusioned by the war. They eventually bring in an old professor and his daughter, the professor being an expert on Romanian history and who knows more about the keep than anyone else, even though he has barely punched through the cloud of mystery surrounding it.Up to this point I loved the book. A great premise, smooth writing and good characterization of the two battling German commanders. However, when the professor finds out who was released that fateful first night in the keep, I found it to be a letdown. I thought it was too early to fully reveal the menace and in the end, wasn't very scary.

And I have to say \\"The Keep\\" is one of the best books I've ever read of any genre. Read it, and disregard the movie. My friends told me that if I love the book, which I do, then do NOT see the movie so I never have. So even if you're not normally a horror fan, read this. Wilson's a master of description. You feel like you're in that cold, clammy Keep as the shadows and the night close in...."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"\\"Something is murdering my men.\\"This is my first F. Paul Wilson book I've read and I just have to say it won't be my last. What can I say it's a horror book with Nazi's. Right from the start this book had me hooked. Wilson created a great setting and mood for something to mysteriously start killing Nazi's while they use the keep as a military post. The characters have a lot of depth and really allow the reader to feel what they are feeling. This is a very good horror book. It's not over the top bloody or anything but there is a real story here with a great supernatural background. Really fun read."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"One of the best books ever written in horrow fiction, definately one of the most original. The story is great, so are the characters and the dark atmosphere. Nazi soldiers are being horribly eliminated one every other night by something unseen in an ancient keep located in the dark Carpathian mountains in Romania. This evil presence is superbly created by F. Paul Wilson. His best work to date."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"This is a great horror novel, with genuine creepiness. When nazi troops stationed at a remote Keep in Romania start dying horribly, one for each night, their commander sends a message to High Command stating &quot;something is murdering my men&quot;. An SS squad is sent to stop the problem, their commander convinced partisan activity is to blame. But no mortal can be attributed to the continued demise of troops. Suspicion of the supernatural at work brings the nazis to enlist the aid of an ailing history and folklore professor, who happens to be a Jew. Meanwhile, a mysterious stranger has started a journey to confront the evil in the Keep once again...This novel is extremely entertaining, the death scenes are explicit, the terror truly felt. The explanation of the evil entity is intriguing in premise. The characters are written in animated style, solid, and never shallow. When reading this I felt like I was there, which really added to the fear factor. Definitely a classic horror tale, atlhough requires a high level ability to suspend disbelief."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"If you've been perusing the horror section for a truly captivating novel which will both frighten you and yet keep you reading far into the night, then look no further.

This is definitely one of the books worth buying, reading and keeping in your bookshelf for future reading. It is that good!"},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"This book is one of the best books I have read in a long time. I find myself re-reading this book over time after time. F.

I blasted through Harry Shannon's terrific &quot;Night of the Beast,&quot; and then started my copy of &quot;The Keep.&quot; I could not have planned a better sequence if I'd tried. This is a total, pulp-style blast of a book. I think the Scott Glenn movie, which was kind of a dud, had caused me to forget how delightful the original novel was. It kept me up half the night !I highly recommend it. Really fun!"},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"A friend of mine suggested The Keep and mentioned that it was a horror classic. The Keep takes place in Romania during WWII where German Troops occupy a Keep for use as a lookout point.The troops discover a hidden room and when that room was opened it unleashed a horrible entity which starts to kill the troops.It is a good book, but honestly, I expected more out of a \\"horror classic\\". I did enjoy it, it had an alright ending and it reads fairly fast. Like I said though, I expected something more from the Keep. Perhaps it just did not live up to the expecations I had previously placed on it.If you want a decend read, then definately read the Keep."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"The Keep does not seem to be the kind of story to launch a six book narrative cycle, but it did.

Paul Wilson, is the greatest book I have ever read! Even from the beginning, Wilson's chilling narrative grips the reader and doesn't let them go. The book is full of nonstop action and excitment that any reader will enjoy.As I read through the first hundred or so pages, I couldn't put the book down. I just kept reading and reading, awaiting the next death and trying to figure out which one of the pitiful nazi soldiers was going to get what they deserve. Then as Magda and her father came to the keep, I was wondering how, and if, they were going to get out alive. The Keep is &quot;a modern classic of vampiric evil&quot;, that explains the origins of all vampire legends and introduces two powerful adversaries who have been battling against each other since the beginning of time. It is the first book in the adversary cycle, a six book collection of thrilling and shocking novels, each one as powerful as The Keep. Any reader, whether a horror fan or not should go out and read F. Paul Wilson's shocking tale of vampiric evil: The Keep"},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"I had never read a book by F. Paul Wilson when I came across \\"The keep\\" on the pages of Amazon.com. The plotline surely got me interested. Nazis, a castle, romanian folklore and a monster lusting for blood. Besides, I had never read a true horror book, and reviewers stated that \\"The keep\\" surely was one of them.While Wilson knows how to create a tense and dark atmosphere for his story, helped by the chosen close environment of the mentioned keep atop the romanian alps, the characters' development lack conviction. The first half of the book is surely good, full of complex misteries, such as the cross-like indeture that covers all the keep's walls, and the shadow of a hung man in a painting. As we read futher through the plot, though, the book changes focus. New characters are introduced - including the all-time-hate-favorite-Nazi-SS-lust-for-killing-Colonel - and the atmosphere of the tale is lost. There is a romantic interest - unnecessary in my opinion - and at this time the change of pace is bad to the story. Only in the final chapters Wilson is able to get back to his initial development, once again keeping the reader's attention.When I finished the book, I thought \\"This is a very strange story\\", but after a while I began to see that \\"The keep\\" surely is a very fine book, though not what I was expecting. I read it with the wrong state of mind. People say this is a \\"true horror story\\". It's not. It has some horror elements, sure. But, all in all, \\"The keep\\" is the beginning of a series of thriller books with a dark atmosphere and has, as main motive, the ancient battle of good against evil.Anyway, Wilson's style and competent writing kept me interested in buying \\"The tomb\\", the second book in the \\"Adversary Cycle\\".Grade 8.1/10"},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"Sometimes it's hard to live up to the hype. The Keep is a classic example of this axiom. There is no need to rehash the plot as there are 60-something reviews that do just that. I thought the story was good and very creepy until the vampire (or whatever he is) was revealed. After that the suspense just fizzled out leading to a very predictable but entertaining finale. This was a decent horror story, but one of the greatest ever? c'mon, give me a break."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"This was the first book by F. Paul Wilson that I read, years ago, when it first came out in paperback. I'm actually a little surprised that I picked it up, the WWII/Nazi thing was a little offputting, not an area of interest for me. However, it was a horror book, and I love a good scary story, so I guess that's why I was willing to give it a shot. What a great book! A very moody, atmospheric book, with a slow buildup that was just...delicious. If you like horror books and you have not read this one already, give it a try. I think you will be glad you did."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"I'm not sure how many times I've read this book now with this latest read but it remains one of my all-time favorites. I really recommend it to EVERYONE that has not read it. If you do you'll probably say it's become one of your favorites too."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"Finger swiping (I read it on the kindle) action that had me up later at night than I wanted to be. Why haven't I read F. Paul Wilson before? From one scene to the next, the plot and characters hammered at me, making me want to read more. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five had to do with the fact that I thought more could have been done with the warring German officers. Other than that...perfection."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"Having read all of the Repairman Jack novels, I couldn't wait to finally get around to the Adversary Cycle and I was not disappointed. I can only hope that the rest of the series is as great as the first. My ultimate goal is to get to the revised version of Nightworld where the Repairman Jack series and the Adversary Cycle are both concluded. I have tried to read it as the end of Repairman Jack but I simply did not know the characters well enough to enjoy it. It is interesting to see the parallels between the two series in this book, but I truly believe I would have loved the book on its own without the tie ins. Wilson is a gifted and talented author and I am continually grateful for the fact that he is so prolific."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"This is my third or fourth time reading this book. I recently purchased this book because I started to reread the Repairman Jack series, this time (for the most part) in succession and I wanted to refresh my knowledge of the background of the adversary. As I started to get back into The Keep, I couldn't help but smile from remembering how the Nazis get the tables turned on them by something more starkly evil than their cruelty could ever hope to be. This time around, I caught some of the H.P. Lovecraft references that I missed the first and second times. This book is a homerun for horror fans; if you've never read The Keep and love authors like Lovecraft, Poe, Barker, Blatty, King, and maybe a little Michael Moorcock (Eternal Champion, anyone?), this is a must read. I can't wait to read the redo of Nightworld (the last book in the Adversary Cycle) with Repairman Jack's role expanded."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"It's not a traditional Stoker vampire story but it's still not bad. after a couple of chapters it became a real page turner.

I had seen the movie years ago and the book was so much better. Thank You"},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"F. Paul Wilson's THE KEEP is one of the best atmospheric horror novels ever published. Cleverly plotted, ably written and featuring characters of remarkable depth and complexity, it does a great deal to single-handedly destroy the sterotype that \\"scary\\" books can't rise to the level of art.THE KEEP begins in early-mid WW2, with a small unit of German soldiers occupying a deserted castle in the Translyvanian Alps. When one of the soldiers foolishly disturbs a secret chamber in the cellar, however, he discovers that the castle isn't deserted after all. Something was sleeping inside...and it woke up hungry. A week later, Wehrmacht HQ receives a chilling telegram from the German commandant: \\"Request immediate relocation. Something is murdering my men.\\"THE KEEP is actually many carefully interwoven stories. Captain Klaus Woermann is a tough, principled officer of the Prussian school, appalled by the effortless ease with which an unseen, possibly supernatural killer is butchering his elite soldiers. SS-Major Erich Kaempfer, dispatched with a \\"special action commando\\"to crush what he initially is sure is a guerilla insurrection, is a pitiless killer who views his assignment as a way to wangle a concentration camp command and settle an old score with Woermann. Magda Cuzar is a lovely Romanian Jewess forced to accompany her wheelchair-bound father, a folklore expert, Theodor to the keep, in the hopes that his expert knowledge of its history may prove the weapon the Germans need to save themselves. And mysterious traveller Glenn may or may not be the missing piece of the puzzle everyone needs to survive the night.Wilson's novel distinguishes itself from the pack by virtue of its very strong and well-drawn characters and by the individual trials each much endure in the bloodthirsty corridors of the keep. He plays heavily on classic themes of Gothic horror but adds some surprising and unexpected twists which prevent the story from falling into predictable conventions. Just as importantly, it establishes from the very first chapter a feeling of dread which intensifies to an almost unbearable degree as the story goes on. The gore-spattered climax comes almost as a relief.Many reviewers mention THE KEEP as being part of Wilson's \\"Adversary Cycle\\", but it should be clearly understood this book was written as a stand-alone work and doesn't obligate the reader to buy anything else. Nor is there any need. THE KEEP does for itself, and it does just fine.Pleasant dreams."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"I lost alot of sleep staying up to the wee hours reading this wonderful story.F Paul wilson is a great story teller.His other books in the series night world,the tomb and the touch are must reads as well"},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"In 1941 a small contingent of Nazi soldiers occupies an abandoned keep in the mountains of Romania. The origins and purpose of the keep are shrouded in mystery, but the Germans care little about such things. The first night of their occupation, one of their number pulls one of the stone blocks that forms a cellar wall. In search of buried treasure, he instead finds a quick and grisly death. By breaking into a secret chamber, he has released something that had been trapped for 500 years. The remaining soldiers quickly come to believe that it is a vampire, but is it really? The quest for answers leads them to recruit an old professor, Theodore Cuza and his daughter Magda, who happen to be Jews.The Keep is the first in F. Paul Wilson's Adversary Cycle series of six novels. After this series was written, Wilson went on to start the Repairman Jack series that is up to eleven books with more to come. Since this is where the whole epic starts, it's virtually a must read for fans of either series. The story is part horror, part character study. Captain Woermann is semi-sympathetic German officer because he is not a Nazi and is sickened by the actions of the SS and others. Yet, he is not exactly pure of heart so most readers will probably have a love/hate relationship with him at best. Magda and her father are the story's innocents as they get dragged into a lethal situation. They are threatened with death if they don't help the Nazis, and death later even if they do.The Keep clocks in at just over 400 pages and that helps keep it from dragging too badly. It's not the tightest plot you'll ever see, but it mostly pushes forward and holds a reader's interest. The climactic battle at the end is worth the journey and should satisfy most. I would recommend this book to any Wilson fans and as a starting point to anyone interested in trying his work. The other obvious choice for beginners isThe Tomb (Adversary Cycle/Repairman Jack), which is the second of the Adversary Cycle series and introduces Repairman Jack."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"This book is great, its got it all, action, adventure, exotic locations, and a sense of dread that stays with you. Wilson really makes the Keep seem alive against the backdrop of WWII. I know that this says that this is the first book in the Adversary cycle but I found that this book is just as good as a stand alone novel. Very good!"},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"Is the enemy of my enemy my friend? That seems to be the central question in The Keep: when some dark supernatural force starts picking off Nazis, does that automatically make it benevolent? The pursuit of the answer makes this book a good, effective horror story.The Keep is a small structure in the Transylvanian Alps. In 1941, the Germans realize it is strategically located and some soldiers are sent to occupy it, led by Captain Woermann. Woermann is an old-school soldier and generally not a bad guy; he hates Nazis, but believes the army will outlast the Hitler regime. He is also leery of the Keep; it is too well-maintained, there are all sorts of crosses on the walls and there are no birds anywhere near it.A couple of his soldiers try to loot a cellar and instead wind up unleashing some dark force that begins killing around one soldier a night. Woermann wants to leave the Keep but is ordered to stay. Instead, he gets \\"relief\\" from some SS troops, led by the vile bully, Major Kaempffer. Kaempffer, despite his boasting, can do nothing and soon his people are dying as well. A little research, however, leads Kaempffer to grab Jewish historian Theodor Cuza and his daughter Magda in an attempt to find answers. Meanwhile, a mysterious red-haired man crosses Europe heading towards the Keep.Cuza does appear to provide some help, finding out the creature's name is Molasar and that he hates Germans. This appears to make the pair allies, as Cuza knows exactly what the Nazis are capable of. But what is Molasar? And what is his agenda? Therein lies the mysteries that make this such a good book.In fact, this is top-notch horror, marred only by a final chapter that saps some of the energy out of the book. But I am willing to dismiss those last few pages (they don't really upend the plot) and focus on the rest of the book, which takes traditional elements of horror and adds enough twists to make this a good, original work."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"Wilson's chilling narrative grips the reader and doesn't let them go.

This is a novel for those who love vampire stories, especially Dracula. It's a novel that takes the reader to an occupied Nazi village in Romania.

That gives you an idea of my place of the Scare-o-meter. This was not scary. It was a quick read, mostly fun, some good twists. I found the denouement disappointing, a rabbit out the hat, as if the author found himself boxed in by his own narrative and was rather perplexed as how to finish up the tale."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"Without the love story, this would have been a really great creep fest. What a strong and gloomy beginning! But it seems to disintegrate about half-way though- like a vampire in sunlight. Color me one of the stinkers."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"The Keep made for a pretty bad movie. However, until reading this book I had no idea that the movie was actually better than the source material. This story starts out very solidly, with a great premise and very nice set-up. About the middle, though, the book completely shifts and becomes a paint-by-numbers adventure story. I strongly suspected that the book was going downhill when the \\"vampire\\" made its first appearance to the old man and his daughter. It just took all the menace away from the proceedings. From this point forward, The Keep is just a silly, silly story with a conclusion so ridiculous and \\"Hollywood\\" that I could never recommend this book to anybody. Ever. It's lunacy that this book has such a high rating on Amazon."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"Now that Tor has re-issued all of Wilson's books in new paperback editions my local library finally has a copy of THE KEEP and I had the chance to read this book which I'd been trying to track down in a cheap or free copy for several years. Frankly, it should've stayed out of print. This is clearly the work of a novice writer. It's filled with overwrought metaphors and is heavily influenced by extremely old fashioned stylists. The writing is laughably amateurish and suffers from a poor editor who missed cutting out huge chunks of repetitive narrative and entire chapters of unnecessary \\"character development\\" that interrupt the story's flow. The book should be less than half it's turgid length. The writing is also sloppy - it continually flits back and forth between a quaint and florid anachronistic style and poorly constructed, very contemporary, sentences. The dialogue also suffers this schizoid identity problem - it's a mix of that arch period manner of talking you hear in old 1930s movies and then will shift into speech lifted from a bad 1980s made-for-TV movie revealing when it was originally written and published. When I reached the point in the story when the secret cache of forbidden books was unearthed in the walls of the keep I smiled and actually laughed. Here are all those damned books of demonology that appear in the Cthulhu Mtythos stories by Lovecraft, Derleth and his gang. And I kept waiting for the Lovecraft \\"old ones\\" to appear. But what do we get? A lame vampire rip-off. The book boils down to nothing more than a tired twist on the vampire legend with Nazis as victims and a hero with a magic sword. I have to mention the most jarring and ridiculous part of the book: thrown in for the hell of it is a trite romance between the damsel in distress and a red-haired hero. The hero is an obvious vampire hunter (although he is dealt with ever so mysteriously and we are meant to believe that he is a villain, it is not hard to be fooled here) who carries a secret weapon in a long case that no one is supposed to touch or else. Just like those Gothic dumbbell heroines in any Had-I-But-Known book Magda opens the \\"untouchable\\" case and discovers the magic sword right out of some Robert E. Howard story. The hero discovers her with the sword in her hand, loses his temper, but almost immediately after grabbing her away from the sword and case he also loses his identity and he transforms into an escapee from a trashy Harlequin romance. Then follows the obligatory (and typically censored) sex scene that had me rolling my eyes. The virgin heroine is ravished by our muscular and scarred he-man. She has a beautiful body described in great detail; he has nothing but shoulders and chest. He, of course, \\"enters\\" her and she is transported into an ecstasy beyond her imaginings. Are you kidding?! What is this doing in a book of \\"Lovecraftian horror\\"? This really was a sad reading experience for me. But I kept plodding ever onward through a mountain of clich&eacute; and predictable scenes, jaw-droppingly awful metaphors and horrid dialogue hoping something new and different would happen. But it's just a long-winded, repetitive and hokey homage to all the Weird Tales boys. Amid all this I could faintly hear the writer whispering to me (at times shouting at me!): \\"Look at me! I'm a Weird Tales fan. I can fill up 400 pages with allusions to my favorite writers and write just like those pulp guys.\\" But I'm afraid I will have to strongly disagree. I am astonished at all the rave reviews here. The Emperor is naked, kids! One of the 100 Best Horror Books of all time? Absolutely not."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"Buoyed by the praise garnered for this book ... I purchased this book with reasonably high hopes. However, it turns out that the best part of the book was in the imagining. Unfortunately, the story is dull, populated with cardboard characters, and instead of building to a satisfying denouement, the book cranks along on rusty gears, until it slowly and thankfully eases to a halt.From this purchase onward, I have learnt to read...reviews from the \\"Lowest rating first\\" What a pity I can't set that choice as my default."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"This is a dreary novel, thin, neither very thrilling nor scary.The Keep refers to a mysterious ages-old fortress in the remote Transylvanian Alps, the heartland of Romania's folklore. The purpose of the Keep and it's builders are a secret even to the inhabitants of its neighboring village. Each brick in the Keep carries an inlaid brass and nickel symbol resembling a crucifix. Nobody has been able to spend so much as a night in the Keep - nightmares interrupt sleep. That is, until the Spring of 1941 when the German army, fresh from its victories in Western Europe, marshals its forces for an eastward stab. With the nearby Dinu Pass a likely route for a German advance into Russia, the Keep becomes an obvious staging point, and the book opens with a unit of Wehrmacht troops moving into the silent fortress. Then German soldiers begin to die at the rate of one very night, their throats torn out, one man completely decapitated. Their commander, Captain Woermann is no lover of the Nazi cause, (which is why he's been sent far from combat, to Romania) yet has no choice but to call upon the hated SS. The Wehrmacht soldiers have no love for the SS troops who they feel are over-glorified executioners in dress-gowns - good for nothing but murdering large numbers of unarmed jews, gypsies and other undesirables, while the einzatskommando of the SS look down on their less than racially pure-minded comrades in army gray. When the gory deaths continue, both the SS and the Wehrmacht turn to Theodore Cuza, a crippled Jewish academic who has made study of the Keep his life's work. With Magda, his beautiful yet morose daughter in tow, Cuza is brought to the Keep to reveal its secrets for the Germans. The Keep, instead, reveals the embodiment of its evil to the professor, naming itself to Cuza and offering an alliance of sorts with him against the Germans. Meanwhile, a mysterious stranger, Glen, journeys across the Mediterranean to the Keep. On arrival, he strikes up a relationship with Cuza's daughter, but it's the monstrous resident of the Keep that he's really after. The stage is set for a battle between the enigmatic Glen and the dark resident of the Keep....and it's still a horrible novel. F. Paul Wilson doesn't put much effort into writing a scary book. The resident of the keep, shadowy at first, eventaully reveals itself to Cuza. There are hints that the monster is being less-than open, but the \\"true\\" story as told by Glen isn't much scarier a revelation. (Wilson merely swaps one not-so-scary tale for another). Both Glen and the evil Molasar's version of their shred story hint at being the source of the vampire legend, but neither version becomes more than a generic derivative of it. Wilson merely swaps one not-so-scary story with another, and neither one is revealed in a way that generates chills. Another problem is the scary parts themselves - there aren't any. German soldiers drop like flies, but there's nothing scary about serial insecticide. The victims themselves seem no more defined than the anonymous soldiers who drop like flies in Chuck Norris movies, and those aren't scary either (unlike the people who repeatedly and compulsively watch them). Hard pressed to advance the plot while the soldiers die but before the climactic battle (and with the monster already revealed), Wilson creates conflict between Cuza (who sides with the demon with the idea that the monster, for its evil, can do the world a favor by turning Nazi Germany into his next feeding ground) and Magda (who trusts Glen's more ominous description of the demon and its motives), but nothing comes out of that. Then there's the final battle - let's call it the anti-climactic battle. Finally, the most critical error - the Nazis are supposed to be scary, but they're not. Wilson hints at the Nazi's atrocities, but the Nazis themselves aren't that scary, obviating the irony of one monster meeting another. With the war in its early stages, the Nazis have just begun their death-campaign , one that will rival for terror any of the vampire legends. The SS commander had been on his way to Ploesti, the site of a massive Romanian petro-refining complex. (The large number of rail-way junctions necessitated by the oil refineries also make the site an ideal one for building a new death camp, one to rival Auschwitz), but there's no hint to the inhumanities the SS commander has seen or contemplates, no hint of irony at the methodical annihilation of SS troops mirroring the death unleashed by those same SS. The Nazi's were the real vampires of Europe, but these blackshirts seem less competent than those you'd see on an episode of \\"Hogan's Heroes\\". If you want chills, rent John Carpenter's \\"Prince of Darkness\\", but keep this off your shelves."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"About as scary as He-man fighting Skeletor, but not nearly as cool. Picked it up because it was recommended by an Amazon reviewer that liked it better than \\"The Terror\\" by Dan Simmons. Could not have been more disappointed. \\"The Keep\\"'s premise is interesting. There are Nazis and something like a vampire. Sparks should fly but they absolutely do not. The writing is crap. There is no tension, no dread, no atmosphere. The characters are two-dimensional. The love story makes the Darth Vader-Princess Amidala romance in the recent Star Wars movies look sophisticated. The story itself is laughable; trite, boring and, most damning, not the least bit scary. How can so many people be so wrong? 5 stars? Amazon reviewers, j'accuse."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"Yeah, that sounds like an exaggerated proclamation. But it's true. F. Paul Wilson has a knack for writing thrillers (the \\"Repairman Jack\\" series, for example); in \\"The Keep,\\" he just combines it with some extra-large doses of horror.In the Romanian mountains, a bunch of Nazis have stumbled upon a deserted structure. Called a \\"keep\\"--though that's not what it really is--its purpose is a mystery, as are the strange crosses placed at precise intervals on all the walls. There's also the fact that no birds have nested at the keep, and no one is permitted to stay inside overnight...But those darn Nazis always were foolhardy. Something is released that first night, something that defies description. It moves stealthily through the shadows, it murders with explicit savagery...and its bloodlust is endless...Only one mysterious man and one determined Jewish woman can stop this evil...if the time has not already run out...Evil vs. evil. F. Paul Wilson's \\"The Keep\\" is the first novel in what became known as the \\"Adversary Cycle,\\" a series of loosely based novels all tied together at the end. \\"The Keep\\" stands alone, however, as an exemplary example of how a horror novel should be written. Delictable, terrifying, and unforgettable!"},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"I first read this book over twenty years ago, when it was first released and loved it. I decided that it was time to give it another go around to see if my original opinion of it still held. Well, time has certainly not diminished the power of this book to hold the reader in its thrall. I still love this book, and it remains my favorite book by this author.As far as horror stories go, this one is definitely up with the best of them. The author has written a riveting page turner with this tautly written, inventive tale. The author has taken some vampire folklore and given it a new twist. In the hands of this master of the horror genre, the quintessential battle between good and evil takes on a new dimension.In Romania, deep in the heart of the Transylvanian Alps, lies the Dinu Pass. In April of 1941, a small squadron of German soldiers has been ordered to occupy a small, deserted, five hundred year old castle keep at the Dinu pass. From the beginning, Captain Klaus Woermann senses that there is something unusual about the keep. Looking as if it had just been built and inlaid with brass and nickel crosses in every corridor, crosses that the caretaker for the keep exhorts the Germans not to touch, the keep is an architectural oddity.Soon the games begin, as an unseen force begins murdering his men. Captain Woermann sends a message to the high command. To his dismay, they respond by sending a Nazi squadron of einsatzkommandos under the leadership of SS Major Kaempffer to quell whatever local guerilla activity is, undoubtedly, responsible for the murders. Soon, these death's head troopers begin succumbing to the same fate as their German Army counterparts, and all hell breaks loose.Enter the ailing Dr. Theodor Cuza, a Romanian Jew and former professor at the University of Bucharest. Although suffering from the ravages of scleroderma, he is ordered by the Nazis to the keep, as he is an expert in the history of the region. It is hoped that he will be able to shed some light on the mysterious keep and enable his hosts to defeat their unknown adversary.Accompanied by Magda, his daughter, they find themselves confronted with the cruelty of the Nazis, the unexpected kindness of Captain Woermann, and something from their worst nightmares that has them call into question their deepest beliefs. Then, a mysterious red-headed stranger with piercing blue eyes also appears, and nothing is ever the same again.This is one of the premier horror stories of all time. Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"I bought this book...ooh, I don't know...maybe two years ago, in some used bookstore, simply because the front cover said &quot;A Novel Of Deep Horror&quot;. For two years (I guess) the book just sat there in my room, doing nothing. Then, on August 1 (a date that I will not soon forget), I began reading this (don't ask me how I came to do it--maybe fate?), and I was immediately hooked! The first couple of chapters of this masterpiece were horrifying, terrifying, and with just enough gore to please the standard horror audiences (me included), but not gross-out. The book takes place in 1941, in a place in the Transylvanian Alps called the Dinu Pass. In Dinu Pass is a small castle, or Keep, and it is here that the story occurs. The book starts off in the present, where Major Sturmbanfurer Kaempffer recieves a message from the Keep, saying, quite simply, &quot;SOMETHING IS MURDERING MY MEN.&quot; Then the book takes a sort of flashback, where Captain Klaus Woermann of the German Army is assigned with a small league of his soldiers there to watch for any possible invasion by the Russians. Woermann has this sort of dread feeling the minute he crosses the threshold of the Keep and into its courtyard, but he cannot think why. And the whole book just goes on and on, and never lets up until the end. I recall one particular sentence in one of the first couple of chapters that is a real haunter: The horror has begun. These four words are what truely captivated me more than anything else. I will not begin to tell what this &quot;horror&quot; is, but I will only say, READ THIS BOOK. F. Paul Wilson is a uniquely talented writer, and he writes very clearly, with well-developed characters, great visual settings, and quite some scary scenes (let me tell you!). What is really unique about this book is the setting: 1941 in Romania, one of the few countries not totally taken over during this mighty war. As a matter of fact, there is not a single American in the book; in addition, I only recall seeing the word &quot;America&quot; in the last 40 or so pages, only once or twice. There is also something else unique: for a long time, the main character of the book is Klaus Woermann, and he his of the German Army--one of what once were the &quot;bad guys.&quot; In this book, the reader learns of his internal hatred of Nazism, as well as how he only joined the war for the honor of prideful battles of justice. I rooted for him, believe it or not, and future readers might do so, too. F. Paul Wilson's character development was excruciatingly *real*. When minor characters died off in the book, they had a small introduction before this. This is much like the usual writing style of another author (James Herbert--nearly *all* his characters are like this), but this is a good thing--if there is no introduction or background to a character, their being killed off is as sad a moment as seeing those cardboard cutout characters from those old B-horror movies. We *need* some intro, and this is it. There are so many other things I would want to talk about from this book, but unless everyone in the entire world read--and enjoyed--this book, I cannot share them. This review was written not only to show my feelings for the book, but to interest other people in reading it. Therefore, I will leave all the wonderful--and horrible--surprises for newcomers to discover. This book will one day be a classic, along with other such terrors as The Shining, I Am Legend, and so many more. I have yet to see the movie, but many people hated it, and from what I've heard, it is more influenced by this book than based upon it. Whatever the movie is like, read this book first, if not instead. I guarantee readers of all sorts--horror, romance, science fiction, fantasy, the works--will enjoy it. Purchase and enjoy this book, people, and don't get too scared..."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"The Keep is important to the Third Reich. So when German soldiers stationed there start to die the SS is sent to investigate and DESTROY whatever enemy they find.But what happens when the enemy is more powerful, more ruthless and even more sadistic than the Death Squads sent to fight it?The story started out very strong, a mixture of horror, mystery and even a touch historical novel. The characters seemed real, the plot solid and the flow was smooth. The fears that Theodor Cuza develops about his religion and his faith, the interplay between Erich Kaempffer's naked greed and Klaus Woermann's military professionalism, only add to the reality of the setting.But near the end the story started to get a little too wild, turning from a vampire/between a rock and a hard place/Lovecraft book into something more fitting of fantasy/Evil vs. Good/E.E.&quot;Doc&quot; Smith book."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"I picked this book up because I kept hearing that it was a true classic of horror. It also seemed to stand out among fans as being Wilson's best work. While I enjoyed The Keep and agree that it is a very solid novel, I found that there were way too many flaws and annoyances to grant it such status.During World War II, a German SS squad take over the Dinu Pass in Romania. Nestled deep in the Transylvania Alps, it is a direct link to Russia and the Germans want to solidify their position in the pass should relations between them and Russia deteriorate. Within the pass there is a castle-like structure referred to as \\"The Keep\\", which is where the Nazis barricade themselves and spend the night. But every night, a Nazi dies at the hands of an evil, inhuman apparition. Is it a ghost? A vampire? Dumbfounded, they bring in a Romanian professor who is an expert on local folklore (and who also happens to be Jewish) to shed light on the situation.Mainly due to its setting in WWII, I was expecting this novel to be a relatively complex read for a horror novel but it's not at all. It reads very easily, and the WWII setting is clearly only a backdrop and things like war and politics are rarely discussed. It's really more of a pulp novel about an inhuman monster battling human monsters (The Nazis). Okay so who are we as readers supposed to root for? I wasn't sure myself. What I found original here is how Wilson suddenly made the monster into a tangible presence halfway through the book. It was fascinating to read about the monster's origin and history. Wilson also packs the first half of his book with loads of suspense. As the monster kills one Nazi per night, readers are kept on their toes as they wonder which will be the next Nazi to suffer a horrible death.Now for the bad: The suspense, horror and intrigue Wilson built in the first half of the book almost completely disappears in the second half. The monster seldom kills people, the 3 new characters introduced are annoying (professor, his daughter and Glenn), and the entire mood of the story changes. It's not even a horror story anymore but makes a complete 180-degree turn into a medieval fantasy novel of ancient good versus evil. Add to that the sickly sweet romance between two of the characters and it completely kills the buildup the novel had. These romance scenes were incredibly cheesy, the writing punctuated by exclamation points all the time like \\"Oh, how I love him so!\\" or \\"How strong his arms were!\\" and made me feel like I was reading a dime-a-dozen romance novel from the supermarket shelves.I suspect those people proclaiming \\"The Keep\\" to be one of the best horror novels ever simply have not read that many horror novels. I don't want to give the wrong impression however: I still think \\"The Keep\\" is a solid novel, therefore my 4-star rating. It just didn't turn out to be the classic I was expecting it to be."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"Simply the best horror story book that I have ever read in my entire life time. It is a gripping story det against the background of WW2 that tells of a detachment of German soldiers sent to occupy a fortification in the Translyvanian Alps in Romania, to keep an eye on the Russian movements. But Captain Woermann and his men discover something so evil, something so terrible, that it starts slowly taking one of his men at a time. The SS are dispacthed to deal with the problem and the rivarly between Woermann and the SS commander, Major Kaempffer is great, it keeps more tension throughout the entire book. Anyway, it was an awesome story of horror and evil. I am sorry to say that the movie was a dissapointment, for you own sake... READ THE BOOK FIRST or you may discourage yourself from ever wanting to look at this story again, please it is a shame for such a great book to be devastated by a mediocure movie."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"Initially, I resisted reading this book because it featured Nazis. I've read too many books over the years where the author uses Nazis as villains because it's an easy out and he couldn't come up with a more original bad guy. Not so Paul Wilson! The Nazis are not only the victims in this story, but Wilson even manages the near impossible and we sympathize with them! How original it that!*The Keep* is so richly detailed that it is a pleasure to read. Wilson skillfully draws you bit by bit into the story and before you know it, you're hooked! One sentence, &quot;The horror had begun&quot;, sent chills down my spine!The evil that is unintentionally unleashed is a fascinating unknown, and the good guys may not turn out to be as good as we originally thought. Who or what is killing the soldiers, one per night? There are no easy answers. I loved the ironic twist of the Nazi commander having to ask for the help of a Jewish scholar in order to save his men. A nice touch.This is yet another one of those books that will keep you up all night to find out how it ends. I can't wait to read more of Wilson's novels! Two thumbs up for *The Keep*!"},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"The Keep revolves around a Nazi Officer and his men who are stationed in the Romanian Mountains, charged with setting up a base in an small abandoned Castle, the \\"Keep\\" of the book's title. When a greedy soldier disturbs some of the Keeps unorthodox architecture, and soldiers start dying, an elite SS troop is sent in to stop the killings. And things get worse....A romanian folklore expert is brought in to decipher strange writing found at the scene of one of the murders, a frail old man who just happens to be Jewish....so you can imagine how he feels about keeping Nazis alive. Throw in the old man's daughter, a mysterious man carrying a mysterious package, and one of the nastiest monsters in horror novel history, and you've got all the ingredients for a \\"keeper\\" (HAHAHA...) of a book.Does Wilson deliver? You betcha....Molosar is one of the nastiest pieces of work this vampire fan has ever encountered, and the way that Wilson explains the vampiric mythology of crucifixes and garlic and mirrors is nothing short of fascinating. I spent much of the book trying to puzzle out his many little riddles, such as why Molosar fears the Cross when Cuza wields it, but kills a Nazi who is holding a cross. Wilson deftly keeps the reader guessing, and in this day of saw-the-ending-coming -a mile-away books, that's something special. I'm looking forward to reading the second book of \\"The Adversary Cycle\\", The Tomb."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"When I first read &quot;The Keep&quot; I was drawn by the historical time period involved. As I read on the excellent way that Mr. Wilson portrays characters,scenery,and story line in a most tangible way kept me spellbound for the rest of the book. Anyone who enjoys historical or geographical accuracy in a compelling story line will want to read this book. I've read this book numerous times,including once aloud for a friend . I believe this is one of my favorite books/stories. Definitely a must read!"},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"&quot;The Keep&quot; is really, in its basic form, a pulp horror novel and it covers some familiar territory: slimy, evil things in the dark that no one believes is there till their dead, characters getting mad at each other rather than at whatever is killing them. But &quot;The Keep&quot; is better than one might expect, and it is raised far above its humble horror premise. First of all, the setting elevates it: Set during world war II when the greatest horror in history was playing out, in an isolated keep that is brought into the modern world beautifully but given a hint of gothicism. Yet the &quot;typical&quot; scenes of horror here are elevated because of Wilson's genuine talent for giving the reader chills. The way he describes the darkness &quot;enveloping&quot; people is truly frightening, and there are many further scenes that induce terror, two dead men standing over a sleeping man's bed and etc. Then the characters - here is where Wilson truly excels. One might think that you can feel nothing for these characters, since they are Nazis. But throughout a large part of the book, the main character is German Captain Klaus Woermann, who despises Nazism and would really rather not be at the keep, he feels sorry for the suffering caused. He is a truly likeable character for the most part, but more importantly, he feels REAL, all the characters do. Even small characters who are only in the book for a few pages are given in an introduction, a brief history that truly makes you feel for them and for their situation. The finale gets a little to fantasy-ish for my personal tastes, as well as the final explanation behind the killing force in the keep, but thats a minor thing. There are so many scenes of spine-chilling horror in this book that it truly is a rarity of its type."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"this must be it. The Keep is a well-written story with very original ideas. The style the author uses to write about the darkness enveloping people is really scary. I first read it more than 10 years ago and continue to re-read it. The story is timeless and the publisher should continue reprinting the book!"},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"I recently picked up a copy of The Keep at a used book store, fondly remembering it to be one of the best novels I've read. I thought I might reaquaint myself with the story, and if it turned out to be as good as I remembered, read the rest of the series. Very quickly I found myself finished with this book and actively searching for the rest in the series, all of which I found and devoured immediately. F. Paul Wilson's novels are superbly written and are wonderfully woven together into the climax with Nightworld. Start with The Keep, but don't stop until you've gone through the series and finished with Nightworld."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"This is honestly the best horror novel I've ever read. I first read it a few years ago at a time when I had already been desensitized to horror, having read such books for years.

Not full of gore, but intelligent battle between ancient evil and good(?) or is it that clear cut? Look forward to the rest of the series. Yet again the Nazis get beat up and made to be laughable - not a bad thing at all"},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"There are very few books that I keep on my shelf to read more than once, but this is one of them. The setting is mesmerizing: a mysterious keep in Transylvania. Who built it and why? These questions haunt the German captain who stations his men there.Set in WWII, the author does a great job of evoking the feelings of the time. The German captain has a disdain for the Nazi SS squad that comes to \\"rescue\\" the men who are being killed. It is a fascinating combination of a vampire creature and a true monster--the Nazi who is on his way to command a death camp.The only let down is the female character and the love affair. The character is a lame stereotype. Worth a read, though, and part of a larger series (although it stands alone just fine)."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"After reading rave reviews of THE KEEP I felt compelled to check it out. Then, inside the book, I found there was a website. After checking out the message board filled with adoring fans, I started the book with high expectations. Perhaps that was the problem. The premise is certainly very original and the new spins on vampire folklore were very creative. I failed to find the story to be at all scary as I did in books like SALEM'S LOT. The mysterious \\"hero\\" who spends nearly half of the book racing to get to the keep because time is of the essence,does no more than sit in the bushes and stare at it for several days... I'll give the author one more chance with the next book in this series THE TOMB but I'll be sure to buy it...at a discount."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"This pretty good vampire book poses the question: who are worse, vampires or Nazis. One might argue that the fact that both groups are such classic and obvious bad guys makes the premise too easy and unoriginal. However, it offers the interesting opportunity to compare ancient and modern concepts of evil. And I must say that it was quite satisfying to read about the SS troops soiling their pants with fear. I thought that the first half of the book was the better. Wilson does a good job writing about the Nazi soldiers setting up shop in an apparently unoccupied old keep in Romania, getting pick off one-by-one in particularly grizzly manners, and slowing coming to the unsettling realization that the offenders were not local resistance fighters or other human agents. The second half of the book focuses less on the Germans and more on a Jewish professor and his daughter, who find themselves caught between a rock (the Nazis) and a hard place (the vampire). The second half is marred by mistakes common to horror novels. First, the daughter develops a love interest, which is unnecessary to the story and takes up too much space. The book is a better read without it. (Fortunately, it's easy to skim over that stuff.) Second, Wilson fiddles too much with vampire lore, again unnecessarily. I won't go into the details for fear of giving away too much. It's enough to say that his fiddling extends beyond questions of how well garlic works as a vampire deterrent. In any event, despite its flaws, The Keep is a decent vampire book, which puts it above the vast majority of what's out there these days."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"SS Sturmbannfuhrer Erich Kaempffer has just received a promotion and a plum new assignment. After a year's tutelage at Auschwitz, learning how to run an efficient concentration camp and implementing the Reich's final solution, Heinrich Himmler has rewarded him with a death camp of his own. Romania's new Division of Race and Resettlement is going to be busy for the next year or so, rounding up Jews, gypsies and other undesirables to transport to the facility, now under construction, in Ploiesti, north of Bucharest. It is April 1941.Then word comes through that Kaempffer is to make a detour. A small regular German army detachment under the command of Captain Klaus Woermann is stationed in an ancient castle, the Keep, in the Dinu Pass, a remote area of the Transylvanian Alps. The location is of interest to the Germans because of its strategic position to nearby oil fields. The captain had sent a communique to Headquarters in Berlin: \\"Request immediate relocation. Something is murdering my men.\\" The SS major must make the inconvenient trip to investigate, along with a contingent of his einsatzkommandos (SS goons).Kaempffer and Woermann had known each other since their teens, when they fought together in the Great War. Woermann, a regular army officer and non-party member, had distinguished himself in WWI as a hero. Kaempffer, a fanatic Nazi, had not. Now their soldiers keep dying, both army and SS, each in a manner more gruesome than the one before. Clearly something supernatural is involved which is brutally sucking the life from living souls. The Keep's occupation by foreign soldiers, and their continual tampering with the castle's structure while searching for \\"hidden gold,\\" have released an evil entity - the MOST EVIL entity. When a message is found, written in blood in an unknown language, it is decided an expert must be called in to assist the investigation. Unfortunately for everyone, the SS major refuses to abandon the Keep, as this may look like a failure to Heydrich, Himmler and cohorts. An elderly, sickly Jewish scholar from Bucharest, knowledgeable about Romanian history, folklore and extinct languages, is ordered to the castle. Accompanying him is his lovely daughter, Magda.Meanwhile, in Tavira, Portugal, a red-haired man awakens from a nightmare with a sense of foreboding. Grim-faced, he suddenly understands. He had hoped this moment would never come, but he is ready. He is called Glaeken, and he begins his trip across the 2300 mile length of Mediterranean Sea, through Turkey to Romania, immediately. Soon another war will begin, one which will rival even Hitler's war.Parts of \\"The Keep\\" are extremely scary, horrifying actually. A fantasy element is also present in the explanation of the evil \\"entity's\\" history, and Glaeken's, along with the building of the Keep. I found this to be fascinating stuff. During these segments the novel is fast-paced and riveting. However, there are areas of the narrative which plod, and while I enjoyed the romantic subplot, I am pretty sure hard core horror fans will not. The gratuitous gore, is just that - unnecessary, and becomes almost comical at times - especially since the gore belongs to Nazis. Overall, I did enjoy this. It is not a masterpiece of horror but it will certainly hold your attention. Recommended!JANA"},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"I am a lover of good writing.

The episode of Magda working through gypsy songs on her mandolin rings authentic. The trip of the red headed mystery man from Portugal across the Mediterranean and though the sea of Marmara in wartime builds a solid suspense.But as the story develops, it drifts into a series of stale cliches, becoming ever more superficial and tiresome and petty as it progresses. The love scene between Magda and Glenn is both completely predictable and pathetic, as it chews cud of every cheap pulp romance. The brutality and sexual beastliness of the SS Komandos has been told thousands of times already, and seldom as badly as here. The occult mysteries try to be original, but they teeter on the brink of banality as they rehash the common lore. As soon as the origins and history of the two main antagonists become known, the outcome is thoroughly predictable. And since this is set up as a conflict between primeval forces of good and evil, one would expect the \\"good\\" to be good. But he is completely amoral -- manipulative and heartless -- with only preservation of his own power as his reason for existing.But with all that, it was good enough to keep me fully engaged for most of a day as I redd from cover to cover. I groaned over the bad parts hoping something better would come soon -- and sometimes it actually did.Maybe three stars are a bit generous here, but since the author kept me reading in spite of myself, I'll have to grant him that much.Nota bene: I was reading the original hardcover first edition from my son-in-law's library.

In desperation, they send for an old Jewish scholar and his daughter, whose expertise on the keep may provide some answers. At this point, the book was a real page turner, but then a character who goes by the name of Glenn showed up and the story devolved into a morass of fantasy tropes complete with magical swords. Perhaps reading this with full knowledge of its context as a part of Wilson's Adversary Cycle is more rewarding, but for me it was an unsuccessful hybrid of gritty horror rooted in historical fact with a metaphysical cosmology that comes out of nowhere to provide an unsatisfying deus ex machina ending."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"I won't go into the story as you can get the basic setup from every other review here(Nazis, old Keep, monster, etc). While this book is not the classic some people make it out to be, it is still a enjoyable read. I would not say this is a Horror novel as much as it is a blend of Lovecraftian Horror, Fantasy and, for good or bad, a touch of Romance(which can be skimmed if desired as those parts do not affect the plot/story much). There are also some really truly great contrasts/psychological aspects also: For example, without spoiling the plot, the conflict between the Professional Solider and the SS Commander is rather well written.If you have a Kindle, don't hesitate as this book is $3 and a great bargin. I am looking foward to reading the next book in the series and Wilson's other works to see how they measure up."},{"Title":"The Keep","review":"Something lurks within the walls of a castle and its killing Nazis. Such a simple premise does little justice to F. Paul Wilson's joyfully entertaining 1981 horror novel \\"The Keep.\\" It's a great page-turner, combining elements of fantasy, Bram Stoker with more than a little military angst. The Nazis amidst supernatural elements has been done many times, from James Herbert'sThe Spearand Katherine Kurtz'sLammas Night, all the way up to the 2009 cult filmDead Snow. Wilson keeps a straight face and finds time to pull a Whitley Strieber (The Wolfen) by providing a unique explanation for the existence of monster folk legends. Make no doubt, \\"The Keep\\" is a potboiler on the level of a comic book, but he dedicates excellent passages to character development, most notably the tragic figure of Captain Woermann.The grizzled leader of a World War II German patrol, Woermann is ordered to occupy a castle in the Carpathian Mountains of Romania. His soldiers arrive and find the moldy structure to be peculiarly desolate, with neaby villagers in grand Hammer Horror Film tradition wanting nothing to do with the foreboding fortress. Embedded within the ancient walls are a series of gold crosses and with growing anxiety, Woermann begins to realize the castle was built as an entrapment to hold something within. That unnameable Lovecraftian presence is eventually unleashed and, on a nightly basis, soldiers are murdered. Woermann strings up lights, organizes men into teams of twos and places a 24-hour guard. Nothing works, and come nightfall his increasingly hysterical soldiers begin to witness an eerie presence lurking within the shadows. Entertaining stanzas no doubt, and I appreciated Wilson's devotion to portraying Woermann's anxiety at being unable to protect his men. Here's a German soldier painted in sympathetic tones.Naturally, the SS are called to the rescue, and these black-clad jackboot-strutting sadists are confronted with an evil more potent than their darkest fantasies. When ancient writing, written in blood of course, is discovered above the body of yet another victim, the stormtroopers drag in an elderly Jewish professor who is an expert in this kind of stuff. Ultimately this demonic specter, adorned in clothes from the Middle Ages, is discovered to be an ancient creature who gave rise to the original vampire legends. Where there's dark, there's light, and an equally powerful angelic presence is soon en route to the castle to put the old vampire back in his \\"keep.\\" But not before a lot of Nazis meet their maker. I love this stuff.Wilson is a fine American writer (by way of New Jersey) of horror and supernatural fiction. Perhaps not as well known as Stephen King or Dean Koontz, he's been hammering out these delicious tomes since 1976. \\"The Keep,\\" his first international bestseller, was where it all began. He would go on to write five sequels known as The Adversary Cycle (The Tomb,The Touch,Reborn,Reprisal,Nightworld). But \\"The Keep\\" stands alone as a tale that will capture demented imaginations. Film director Michael Mann, at home within the crime underworlds of \\"Thief,\\" \\"Manhunter\\" and \\"Heat,\\" oddly took on this project for his 1983 workThe Keep [VHS]. It had a great cast and superb special effects, but completely soared off the rails in a peculiar acid-induced frenzy when the demonic vampire appears. No matter. If you want an introduction to Wilson's fine pen, \\"The Keep\\" is a memorable place to start."},{"Title":"The bad Popes","review":"a well written book, a great read for those interested in history, especially those drawn to the history of rome."},{"Title":"The bad Popes","review":"E.R.
