But why do we fill our leisure time with the activities we do? And what do our hobbies say about our culture? Steven Gelber here traces the history and significance of hobbies from the mid-nineteenth century through the 1950s. Although hobbies are often touted as a break from work, Gelber demonstrates that they reflect and reproduce the values and activities of the workplace by bringing utilitarian rationality into the home, imitating the economic stratification of the marketplace, and reinforcing traditional gender roles. Drawing on a wide array of social and cultural theory, Hobbies fills a critical gap in American cultural history and provides a compelling new perspective on the meaning of leisure.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Cda_QMSGK3sC&dq=Amateur+Craftsman%27s+Cyclopedia+of+Things+to+Make&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Legionary (Roman World)","description":"A reconstruction of the life of an actual Roman soldier focuses on his brave service as part of the Seventh Legion in central Europe under the Emperor Trajan around 85 A.D.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PPc4eDM_1-MC&dq=The+Legionary+(Roman+World)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Swimmer (Apple Paperbacks)","description":"Swim better and enjoy every lap with Total Immersion, a guide to improving your swimming from an expert with more than thirty years of experience in the water.

One approach is through psychometric testing, but such an approach often puts the \\"cart before the horse\\"--the test before the theory. Another approach is to use evolutionary theory. This criterion has been suggested by a number of individuals in the past, from Charles Darwin in the more distant past to Howard Gardner, Stephen Gould, Steven Pinker, Carl Sagan, David Stenhouse, and many others. The chapters in this book address three major questions: 1. Does evolutionary theory help us understand the nature of human intelligence? 2. If so, what does it tell us about the nature of human intelligence? 3. And if so, how has intelligence evolved? The goal of this book is to present diverse points of view on the evolution of intelligence as offered by leading experts in the field. In particular, it may be possible to better understand the nature and societal implications of intelligence by understanding how and why it has evolved as it has. This book is unique in offering a diversity of points of view on the topic of the evolution of human intelligence.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zb5XXzxzj2IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Golden Slumbers Audio","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KaINAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Discovering Sociology: Using MicroCase ExplorIt","description":"This best selling software-based workbook lets students explore dozens of sociological topics and issues, using data from the United States and around the world.

The typewriter taunts him, and he abandons it for days until the night he hears the sound. It is faint, at first, but grows louder. It reminds him of something he can't quite place. He begins to type, describing the sound - the first words he's written in months. On the page, a train appears far in the distance, speeding across the plains. As he continues to write, the train's destination appears on the horizon: a small town from the 1950s - Escardy Gap. Escardy Gap is a re-creation of the writer's hometown in the Midwest. The characters that begin to appear - Mayor Raymond, Station Master Walt - are all memories from his childhood. A pack of boys abandons their baseball game, running toward the unexpected train, and with a start the writer recognizes himself as one of them. Who or what is on the train and why it has come to Escardy Gap does not seem important. The words are flowing faster than they ever have. But the writer has a terrible sense of foreboding, and though something doesn't seem quite right about this train and its passengers, he can't stop writing. This may be the blockbuster novel that saves his career. Or it may be the beginning of his descent into madness as the disturbingly real creatures of his imagination threaten to take over both the story and his life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DWSHHAAACAAJ&dq=Escardy+Gap&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scotland Yard Photo Crimes from the Files of Inspector Black","description":"Photographs and drawings offer clues to twenty fictitious crimes, with points awarded for deducing the correct solution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_NccbQsbagEC&dq=Scotland+Yard+Photo+Crimes+from+the+Files+of+Inspector+Black&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paper City","description":"A collection of urban fantasy stories featuring cities--whether real or imaginary and throughout history--and how they affect the lives and experiences of their inhabitants.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QSlKIAAACAAJ&dq=Paper+City&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lives of the English Poets","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bLSDIKnvGO8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pillsbury Family Cook Book","description":"Here is the all-purpose cookbook you'll use again and again, filled with recipes you'll love from the name you know and trust-Pillsbury. * Nearly 1,000 up-to-date recipes, all triple-tested in Pillsbury's famous kitchens * More than 300 color photos of step-by-step techniques and finished dishes * Cooking Basics chapter with key information on kitchen tools, ingredients, nutrition and more * Wide range of delicious dishes, from familiar favorites to contemporary choices * Complete menu ideas for breakfasts, lunches, dinners and entertaining * Low-fat and 20-minute recipes at the beginning of every recipe chapter * Cook's Notes and Tips with easy timesaving ideas, serving suggestions and more BONUS SECTION!

It started in the early 19th century, when Samuel Hahnemann, a German medical doctor, discovered that he could stimulate remarkable healing by prescribing medicines in a more holistic way. He carefully observed not just his patient's main complaint, but also other physical, mental & emotional symptoms which he found very important for selecting the curative medicine. In time, he discovered that side effects were virtually absent & curative action most profound when the doses were extremely small. The discipline of homeopathy was built on these successes, & Hahnemann set down its principles in this book, the ORGANON OF MEDICINE. Widely acclaimed by homeopathic physicians as the most understandable & accurate translation, this book describes a powerful weapon against the acute & chronic diseases of modern life.

Before Roe v. Wade, hundreds of thousands of illegal abortions occurred in the United States every year. Rickie Solinger tells the story of Ruth Barnett, an abortionist in Portland, Oregon, from 1918 to 1968, to demonstrate how the law, not back\\\\alley practitioners, endangered women s lives in the years before legalized abortion. Women from all walks of life came to Barnett, who worked in a proper office, undisturbed by legal authorities, and never lost a patient. But in the illegal era following World War II, Barnett and other practitioners were hounded by police and became targets for politicians; women seeking abortions were forced to turn to syndicates run by racketeers or to use self\\\\induced methods that often ended in injury or death. This new edition places abortion politics in the context of reproductive justice today. Despite the change in women s status since Barnett s time, key cultural and political meanings of abortion have endured. Opponents of Roe v. Wade continue their efforts to recriminalize abortion and reestablish an inexorable relationship between biology and destiny. The Abortionist is an instructive reminder that legal abortion facilitated women s status as full members of society. Barnett s story clarifies the relationship of legal abortion to human dignity and shows why preserving and extending Roe v. Wade ensures women s freedom to decide for themselves what is best for their health.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aWOcDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Abortionist:+A+Woman+against+the+Law&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vesuvius Club (Lucifer Box Novels)","description":"Meet Lucifer Box: Equal parts James Bond and Sherlock Holmes, with a twist of Monty Python and a dash of Austin Powers, Lucifer has a charming countenance and rapier wit that make him the guest all hostesses must have.

First published in 1946, and now in its Seventh Edition, the Handbook has long been considered the definitive guide to the field of developmental science. Volume 2: Cognitive Processes describes cognitive development as a relational phenomenon that can be studied only as part of a larger whole of the person and context relational system that sustains it. In this volume, specific domains of cognitive development are contextualized with respect to biological processes and sociocultural contexts. Furthermore, key themes and issues (e.g., the importance of symbolic systems and social understanding) are threaded across multiple chapters, although every each chapter is focused on a different domain within cognitive development. Thus, both within and across chapters, the complexity and interconnectivity of cognitive development are well illuminated. Learn about the inextricable intertwining of perceptual development, motor development, emotional development, and brain development Understand the complexity of cognitive development without misleading simplification, reducing cognitive development to its biological substrates, or viewing it as a passive socialization process Discover how each portion of the developmental process contributes to subsequent cognitive development Examine the multiple processes  such as categorizing, reasoning, thinking, decision making and judgment  that comprise cognition The scholarship within this volume and, as well, across the four volumes of this edition, illustrate that developmental science is in the midst of a very exciting period. There is a paradigm shift that involves increasingly greater understanding of how to describe, explain, and optimize the course of human life for diverse individuals living within diverse contexts. This Handbook is the definitive reference for educators, policy-makers, researchers, students, and practitioners in human development, psychology, sociology, anthropology, and neuroscience.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MB_PBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Street Cops","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XsAzAQAAIAAJ&dq=Street+Cops&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dancing Skeletons","description":"One of the most widely used ethnographies published in the last twenty years, this Margaret Mead Award winner has been used as required reading at more than 600 colleges and universities. This personal account by a biocultural anthropologist illuminates not-soon-forgotten messages involving the sobering aspects of fieldwork among malnourished children in West Africa. With nutritional anthropology at its core, Dancing Skeletons presents informal, engaging, and oftentimes dramatic stories that relate the author s experiences conducting research on infant feeding and health in Mali. Through fascinating vignettes and honest, vivid descriptions, Dettwyler explores such diverse topics as ethnocentrism, culture shock, population control, breastfeeding, child care, the meaning of disability and child death in different cultures, female circumcision, women s roles in patrilineal societies, the dangers of fieldwork, and facing emotionally draining realities. Readers will laugh and cry as they meet the author s friends and informants, follow her through a series of encounters with both peri-urban and rural Bambara culture, and struggle with her as she attempts to reconcile her very different roles as objective ethnographer, subjective friend, and mother in the field. The 20th Anniversary Edition includes a 13-page  Q&A with the Author  in which Dettwyler responds to typical questions she has received individually from students who have been assigned Dancing Skeletons as well as audience questions at lectures on various campuses. The new 23-page  Update on Mali, 2013  chapter is a factual update about economic and health conditions in Mali as well as a brief summary of the recent political unrest.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cQVhAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Recording Studio Design, First Edition","description":"Philip Newell's comprehensive reference work contains pearls of wisdom which anyone involved in sound recording will want to apply to their own studio design. He discusses the fundamentals of good studio acoustics and monitoring in an exhaustive yet accessible manner. Recording Studio Design covers the basic principles, their application in practical circumstances, and the reasons for their importance to the daily success of recording studios. All issues are approached from the premise that most readers will be more interested in how these things affect their daily lives rather than wishing to make an in-depth study of pure acoustics. Therefore frequent reference is made to examples of actual studios, their various design problems and solutions. Because of the importance of good acoustics to the success of most studios, and because of the financial burden which failure may impose, getting things right first time is essential. The advice contained in Recording Studio Design offers workable ways to improve the success rate of any studio, large or small.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YzxNuBPTiiYC&dq=Recording+Studio+Design,+First+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Berries: A Country Garden Cookbook","description":"Featuring recipes for fabulous delights--including jams, preserves, pies, tarts, breads, jellies, and more--made from berries of every variety, this elegant cookbook is illustrated with color photos throughout. 40 recipes. 48 photographs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=69t9NAAACAAJ&dq=Berries:+A+Country+Garden+Cookbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Embedded Media Processing (Embedded Technology)","description":"In the past, embedded engineers needed to utilize a combination of traditional microcontrollers and DSP's (digital signal processors) in order to produce optimal designs for use in multimedia applications. However, this multiprocessor design technique is tough to implement, because it requires the engineer to write twice the code. Further, the designs resulting from such a marriage are limited because two processors cost more, take up more physical space, require more memory, and use up more power than just one would. And so a new kind of processor, the EMP (embedded media processor), was born! An embedded media processor combines the best aspects of a traditional microncontroller and a DSP for use in a multimedia product. As the demand grows for smaller, faster, multifunction, portable embedded products, such as video-enabled cellphones and pda's that play music or games, EMP's become more popular. As a result, an increasing number of engineers need to migrate from using multiprocessor methods to using EMP's in their designs. This book is the one-stop shop for the many engineers who need to understand what embedded media processors can do, and how to implement them. KEY FEATURES: comprehensive subject coverage with emphasis on practical application essential assembly language code included throughout many real-world examples using Analog's popular Blackfin Processor architecture This book provides information that engineers cannot get anywhere else. The discussion of EMP's is general enough to assure that engineers using any EMP, not just the Blackfin, will benefit from it. The book's in-depth analysis will allow engineers to decrease product development times and increase robust design for applications in multimedia. For about $50, the engineer is equipped by the experts and empowered to succeed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4auaDSdzLwsC&dq=Embedded+Media+Processing+(Embedded+Technology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Royal Panoply: Brief Lives of the English Monarchs","description":"From medieval conqueror to Renaissance autocrat to Victorian Empress to modern melodrama, Royal Panoply is the story of some of the most fascinating people in world history.

It remains one of the largest losses of life ever in a maritime accident.

The key message of the Gita is how to resolve our conflicts and live in harmony with the deep unity of life, through the principles of yoga and the practice of meditation. Easwaran grew up in the Hindu tradition and learned Sanskrit from an early age. A foremost translator and interpreter of the Gita, he taught classes on it for forty years, while living out the principles of the Gita in the midst of a busy family and community life. In the Gita, Sri Krishna, the Lord, doesn t tell the warrior prince Arjuna what to do: he shows Arjuna his choices and then leaves it to Arjuna to decide. Easwaran, too, shows us clearly how these teachings still apply to us  and how, like Arjuna, we must take courage and act wisely if we want our world to thrive.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xcvJAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Core Exam (Accelerated a+ Certification Study Guide)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_I3ruQEACAAJ&dq=Core+Exam+(Accelerated+a++Certification+Study+Guide)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Microeconomics: A Modern Approach (3rd Edition) (Addison-Wesley Series in Economics)","description":"At a time when both scholars and the public demand explanations and answers to key economic problems that conventional approaches have failed to resolve, this groundbreaking handbook of original works by leading behavioral economists offers the first comprehensive articulation of behavioral economics theory.

Yet somehow the gay Latino doesn?t fit into this sound-bite identity and usually isn?t included in national media images. Rane Arroyo offers a corrective. Known primarily as a poet and playwright representing the gay Latino community, Arroyo has also been publishing prose throughout his career and now gathers into this book a storm of writing that has been gaining strength, drop by drop, for more than ten years. How to Name a Hurricane collects short stories and other fictions depicting Latino drag queens and leather men, religious sinners and happy atheists, working class heroes and cyberspace vaqueros?a parade of characters that invites readers to consider whether one is more authentic a gay Latino than another. Whereas actual hurricanes are given names, the gays given voice in this collection must name themselves?and these narratives in turn reveal something of the \\"I\\" of Hurricane Rane. Whether portraying a family gathering as Brideshead Revisited with a mambo soundtrack, recounting the relationship of transvestite Louie/Lois and her bisexual Superman, or bemoaning \\"feeling as unsexy as an old bean burrito in a 7-11 microwave,\\" Arroyo tracks the heartbeat of his characters through a shimmering palette of styles. Here are monologues, a story in verse, and other experimental forms appropriate to experimental lives?all affirming the basic human rights to dignity, equality, love, and even silliness. When the AIDS epidemic first hit, many Latino families destroyed any remembrances of their gay and bisexual sons that might betray their pasts to la familia or el pueblo. Arroyo?s writings return the ghosts of those sons to the families, bars, dance clubs, and neighborhoods where they belong. By penetrating to the I?s of narrative hurricanes, these stories honor the survivors of our ongoing cultural storms.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WJ69Ar5tKWgC&dq=How+to+Name+a+Hurricane+(Camino+del+Sol)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Best American Erotica 1993","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7_bnyQEACAAJ&dq=The+Best+American+Erotica+1993&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dying For Dana","description":"While investigating a violent robbery that targeted two of his closest friends, prosecutor Max Travis becomes invovled with Dana Waverleigh, a beautiful and enigmatic woman desperate to escape her former lover, Jack Nizhl, an unbalanced meth addict and one of the robbers involved in Max's case. 15,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Jxt1DA0MTTUC&dq=Dying+For+Dana&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The World of Jeeves","description":"Thirty-four tales relate the adventures of Jeeves, the perfect butler, and his scatterbrained employer, Bertie Wooster, as they fumble their way through London and the English countryside in the 1920s","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=btNXAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+World+of+Jeeves&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blow Negative !

Its explosive growth in popularity was followed by an inevitable taming as arabesques became staples in book illustration, poetry publications, and even the decoration of printed scores. The subversive potential of the arabesque was preserved in one of its most surprising offspring, the comic strip: born at the moment when the cholera pandemic first swept through Europe, the comic translated the arabesque s rank growth into unnerving lawlessness and sequences of contagious visual slapstick. Focusing roughly on the period between 1780 and 1880, this book illuminates the intersecting histories of avant-garde theories of writing, visual culture, and even the disciplinary origins of art history. In the process, it explores media history and intermediality, social networks and cultural transfer, as well as the rise of new and nontraditional art forms.

With billions of dollars at stake, and the nation's economic future on the line, Newbridge Capital sought to become the first foreign firm in history to take control of one of Korea s most beloved financial institutions. In a proud country still reeling from a humiliating International Monetary Fund bailout in the Asian Financial Crisis, Newbridge Capital had to muster every ounce of skill, determination, and patience to bring the deal to closing. Shan takes readers inside the battle to win control of the bank a delicate, often exasperating process that meant balancing the goals of Newbridge with those of the government, bank employees, and Korea's powerful industrial titans. Finally, the author describes how Newbridge transformed and rebuilt the struggling bank into a shining example of modern banking as well as a massively profitable investment.

Sherman is a highly original work written for middle-grade readers, but accessible to history buffs of all ages. Indomitable in her patriotism and courageous in her personal life, Dolley Madison springs from these pages a laerger-than-life First Lady. She sparkles as a hostess at diplomatic parties at the President's Mansion, partners her president-husband with her honed political skills, and delights in outrageous fashions. Her feathered turbans, rouged (!) cheeks, and unladylike use of snuff are in sharp comtrast to her sober, restrictive Quaker upbringing. And, at a crucial moment in American history, she proves herself a true hero, one who dares to love her country more than self. In a series of interviews, she beguiles a young reporter who aims to present a living hero to inspire children. Their lives are entwined as vivid scenes unfold, and the reader is drawn into the drama of love, war, and everyday life in early America. Full page illustrations provide pictorial representaions of the text. Sherman is a gifted storyteller and her distinctive voice rings true in this engaging work. \\"Call Me Dolley\\" earns a place on school library shelves beside Abigail and Mary: Sisters Under the Skin in this series of historical fiction about real First Ladies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I9XzPAAACAAJ&dq=Call+Me+Dolley&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"His name is not God: Then what is his name & what does \\"God\\" mean?","description":"If you have ever picked up a Bible, attended a church, or entered into a spiritual conversation with a Christian, you are probably well acquainted with these two terms: \\"God\\" and \\"the Lord\\". Both are frequently used in reference to the creator of the heavens and the earth. For many people, those words actually represent His name. What about to you? Is \\"God\\" His name? Or, is it \\"the Lord\\"? His Name Forever is a must read for anyone who wants to know His true name. It is a book that will help you understand why all those other terms ever used are not His Name Forever. There is a Story Behind the Name of God that explains its significance to Him and to those who have worshiped Him in times past. There is only one name that He revealed as His own. Is that name even relevant today? As you read, you will see that this one name did not change, but people did. From the time of Seth in the Old Testament to the era of the Messiah in the New Testament, the Almighty One had the same name. This book will explain, in an easy to follow way, why so few people, even today, call Him by His name. After reading this book that is well-researched and supported by biblical and other historical documents, you will be challenged to call Him by His Name Forever.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zgwRDjIP568C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mo Te Upoko-o-te-ika/for Wellington","description":"A photography collection.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3TS3QwAACAAJ&dq=Mo+Te+Upoko-o-te-ika/for+Wellington&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Music","description":"Fundamentals of Musical Composition represents the culmination of more than forty years in Schoenberg's life devoted to the teaching of musical principles to students and composers in Europe and America. For his classes he developed a manner of presentation in which 'every technical matter is discussed in a very fundamental way, so that at the same time it is both simple and thorough'. This book can be used for analysis as well as for composition. On the one hand, it has the practical objective of introducing students to the process of composing in a systematic way, from the smallest to the largest forms; on the other hand, the author analyses in thorough detail and with numerous illustrations those particular sections in the works of the masters which relate to the compositional problem under discussion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N-lCPgAACAAJ&dq=Fundamentals+of+Music&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Taste of Home's Contest Winning Annual Recipes 2005","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9VNbMgEACAAJ&dq=Taste+of+Home%27s+Contest+Winning+Annual+Recipes+2005&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Embedded Multitasking (Embedded Technology)","description":"In an embedded system, firmware is the software that directly interfaces with the microcontroller, controlling the system s function. The major forces driving the embedded firmware development process today are reduced development times, increased complexity, and the need to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. These forces translate into strenuous design requirements for embedded engineers and programmers. Many low-level embedded microcontroller designs have insufficient memory and/or architectural limitations that make the use of a real-time operating system impractical. The techniques presented in this book allow the design of robust multitasking firmware through the use of interleaved state machines. This book presents a complete overview of multitasking terminology and basic concepts. Practical criteria for task selection and state machine design are also discussed. Designing multitasking firmware is arduous, complex and fraught with potential for errors, and there is no one,  standard way to do it. This book will present a complete and well-organized design approach with examples and sample source code that designers can follow. Covers every aspect of design from the system level to the component level, including system timing, communicating with the hardware, integration and testing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4dq8g4OWngkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SQL Server CE Database Development with the .NET Compact Framework","description":"Author Tiffany takes an in-depth look at all aspects of SQL Server CE 2.0 and the .NET Compact Framework, the most significantly updated area of Visual Studio 2003.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eS2kVXcspmIC&dq=SQL+Server+CE+Database+Development+with+the+.NET+Compact+Framework&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"China's Provinces in Reform: Class, Community and Political Culture (Routledge in Asia S.)","description":"China is a far larger and more diverse country than many people in the West realise. The provinces that make up the country are considerable social, economic and political systems in their own right. They are comparable in size and complexity to European states. China's Provinces in Reform is concerned with the impact of economic reform and social and politial change within the provinces at the immediate sub-central level of the People's Republic of China. One of the main aims of this book is to question over-generalizations about China's development in the reform era. However, the provincial analysis of social and political change in China also has the potential to reveal even more in a comparative perspective. This is the first volume of a series and covers Guangxi, Hainan, Liaoning, Shandong, Shanghai, Sichuan and Zhejiang. It is part of a project conducted by the Institute for International Studies at the University of Technology, Sydney, that will provide the most thorough and up to date analysis of China's provinces yet published.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5M-EAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"... Eothen,","description":"Eothen is the earliest work of Alexander William Kinglake, best known as the historian of the Crimean War. It is an account of a tour or rather of selected adventures which occurred during a tour undertaken in the Levant in 1834, but was not published until ten years later. The biographical notices of the are somewhat meagre, as by his dying directions all his papers were destroyed. He was born near Taunton in 1809, and educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, at which latter he is said to have been the friend of Thackeray and Tennyson. On leaving college he started on his Oriental tour with Lord Pollington (the Methley of Eothen), and on returning to England was called to the Bar at Lincoln s Inn, and obtained a lucrative practice. But the life was too tame to suit his taste. In 1845 he visited Algeria, and went through a campaign with the flying column of St. Arnaud; and in 1854 went to the Crimea with Lord Raglan, and was present at the battle of Alma. On returning to England he decided to go into politics, and was elected for Bridgewater in 1857 in the Liberal interest. He seems to have been a poor speaker, and to have exercised little parliamentary influence; but we are told that in 1859 he was strongly opposed to the Conspiracy Bill, which was introduced after Orsini s attempt to murder Napoleon III., and that in 1860 he denounced the cession of Nice and Savoy to France. In both cases he was apparently actuated by his personal dislike of Napoleon, which is evident in his historical works. In 1868 he was again returned for Bridgewater, but unseated on petition, for bribery. One might have supposed that he had acquired this habit in the East, but his biographers assert that he knew nothing of the irregularities which were committed by his agents. But the chief business of his later life was the composition of the History of the War in the Crimea, of which the first two volumes appeared in 1863, and the seventh and eighth (completing the work) in 1887. He died in 1891.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zyYlDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The War Of The Worlds. 1938 Radio Broadcast","description":"The War of the Worlds is a science fiction novel by English author H.

Within six months, Barbara Schoichet lost everything: her job, her girlfriend of six years, and her mother to pancreatic cancer. Her life stripped bare, and armed with nothing but a death wish and a ton of attitude, Barbara pursues an unlikely method of coping. At the age of fifty she earns her motorcycle license, buys a Harley on eBay from two guys named Dave, and drives it alone from New York to Los Angeles on a circuitous trek loosely guided by her H.O.G. tour book and a whole lot of road whimsy. On the open highway where she daily takes her speed to a hundred Barbara battles physical limitations and inner demons on a journey that flows through the majestic Appalachian Mountains, the enchanting Turquoise Trail, and all along America s iconic Route 66. She is awed by the battlefields in Gettysburg, stunned by the decadence of Graceland, and amused by a Cadillac graveyard in the middle of nowhere. She meets kind strangers, odd strangers, and a guy who pulls a gun on her for cutting him off. She is vulnerable but sassy, broken but determined to heal . . . or die trying.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9ZiTCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ants Go Marching One by One (Sing - With - Me Ser.)","description":"After they push the button on the cover, children can sing along as they listen to a the melody.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4cIFPQAACAAJ&dq=The+Ants+Go+Marching+One+by+One+(Sing+-+With+-+Me+Ser.)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Becoming Visible : An Illustrated History of Lesbian and Gay Life in Twentieth-Century America","description":"This book is based on an exhibition in 1994 at the New York Public Library.

An introduction provides an overall view of the Italian Campaign and the role of the 92nd Infantry Division.

Information on the early life and military training and experience of General Ned Almond is provided, along with the stories of Vernon Baker and John Fox, who emerged as leaders but endured a long struggle for recognition.

Black knew he was destined to become a Ranger. With their three-hundred-year history of peerless courage and independence of spirit, Rangers are a uniquely American brand of soldier, one foot in the military, one in the wilderness and that is what fired Black s imagination. In this searing, inspiring memoir, Black recounts how he devoted himself, body and soul, to his proud service as an elite U. S. Army Ranger in Korea and Vietnam and what those years have taught him about himself, his country, and our future. Born at the start of the Great Depression, Black grew up on a farm at a time of great hardship but also tremendous national determination. He was a kid who toughened up fast, who learned the hard way to rely on his strength and his wits, who saw the country go to war with Germany and Japan and wept because he was too young to serve. As soon as the army would take him, Black enlisted. And as soon as he could muscle his way in, he became a Ranger. As a private first class in the 82d Airborne Division headquarters, Black withstood the humiliations of enlisted service in the peacetime brown-shoe army. When the Korean War began, he volunteered and trained to be an Airborne Ranger. In Korea, this young warrior, his mind and body bursting with the lusts of adolescence, grew up fast, literally in the line of fire. In clean, vivid prose, Black describes the hell of giving his all for a country that lacked the political resolve to give its all to a war against the North Koreans and the Chinese. If Korea was frustrating, Vietnam was maddening. The heart of this book is devoted to the years of action that Black saw in Long An Province starting in 1967. Black writes of the perplexity of collaborating with South Vietnamese officers whose culture and motives he never fully understood; he conjures up the sudden shock of the Tet Offensive and the daily horror of seeing fellow soldiers and innocent civilians slaughtered sometimes by stray bullets, often by carelessness or treachery. Vietnam challenged everything Black had come to believe in and left him totally unprepared for the hostility he would face when he returned to a war-weary America. Written with extraordinary candor and passion, A Ranger Born is the memoir of a man who dedicated the best of his life to everything that is great and enduring about America. At once intimate in its revelations and universal in its themes, it is a book with profound relevance to our own troubled time in history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MskPTOpPLewC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Patti Smith : An Unauthorized Biography","description":"A profile of this cultural and musical icon examines her place in the 1970s rock scene, her relationships and friendships with other famous individuals, her choice to stop performing and raise a family, and her return to musical life in the 1990s","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DM813EFRYcoC&dq=Patti+Smith+:+An+Unauthorized+Biography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Into the Garden (Thorndike Core)","description":"Founded in 1961 at Sieur de Monts Spring in Maine s Acadia National Park, the Wild Gardens of Acadia display, preserve, propagate, and label native plants in areas simulating natural plant communities.

A decade before the story opens, two men referred to as the Patron and Guide of mankind were leaders of an influential religious movement. When a radical faction of their followers threatened to unleash an apocalypse, they recanted all of their teachings and abandoned their followers. Now, after ten years of silence, Patron and Guide begin contacting their old followers and reaching out to the public, assisted by a small group of young people who have come to them in recent months. Just as they are beginning this renewed push, the radical faction kidnaps Guide, holding him captive until his health gives out. Patron and a small core of the faithful, including a painter named Kizu who may become the new Guide, move to the mountains to establish the church s new base, followed by two groups from Patron s old church: the devout Quiet Women, and the Technicians, who have ties to the old radical faction. The Baby Fireflies, young men from a nearby village, attempt to influence the church with local traditions and military discipline. As planning proceeds for the summer conference that will bring together the faithful and launch the new church in the eyes of the world, the conflicting agendas of these factions threaten to make a mockery of the church s unity or something far more dangerous.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DSZ9Gyaf0YwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Libation Bearers: The Orestia Parts 1 and 2","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RxPKAAAACAAJ&dq=Libation+Bearers:+The+Orestia+Parts+1+and+2&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Greatest Story Ever Told","description":"Presents one of the most enduring and best-selling international classics about the life of Jesus Christ, written to be historically and biblically accurate in terms of the stories of the events and people in the Gospels of the New Testament.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tL95Smhd9rcC&dq=The+Greatest+Story+Ever+Told&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Un mundo raro","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1kxqAAAAMAAJ&dq=Un+mundo+raro&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sandwich Generation: Adult Children Caring for Aging Parents (Garland Studies on the Elderly in America)","description":"First published in 1998.

Her Elegiac Sonnets sparked the sonnet revival in English Romanticism; The Emigrants initiated its passion for lengthy meditative introspection; and Beachy Head lent its poetic engagement with nature a uniquely telling immediacy. Smith was a woman, Wordsworth remarked a quarter century after her death, to whom English verse is under greater obligations than are likely to be either acknowledged or remembered. True to his prediction, Smith's poetry has virtually dropped from sight and thus from cultural consciousness. This, the first edition of Smith's collected poems, will restore to all students of English poetry a distinctive, compelling voice. Likewise, the recovery of Smith to her rightful place among the Romantic poets must spur the reassessment of the place of women writers within that culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qvlx3wxoHJ0C&dq=The+Poems+of+Charlotte+Smith+(Women+Writers+in+English+1350-1850)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Birds of Georgia Field Guide","description":"Identify Birds with Georgia s Best-Selling Bird Guide!

In WWII, Olds quickly became a top fighter pilot and squadron commander by the age of 22 and an ace with 12 aerial victories. But it was in Vietnam where the man became a legend. He arrived in 1966 to find a dejected group of pilots and motivated them by placing himself on the flight schedule under officers junior to himself, then challenging them to train him properly because he would soon be leading them. Proving he wasn't a WWII retread, he led the wing with aggressiveness, scoring another four confirmed kills, becoming a rare triple ace. Olds (who retired a brigadier general and died in 2007) was a unique individual whose personal story is one of the most eagerly anticipated military books of the year.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9VblEKkvPZ0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Arabian Nights Entertainments","description":"The Arabian Nights Andrew Lang - One Thousand and One Nights is a collection of stories collected over many centuries by various authors, translators and scholars in various countries across the Middle East and South Asia.

After. Baby. These three words are whispered by mothers everywhere who find themselves stumped and shocked by the state of their sex lives. Naughty Mommy Heidi Raykeil has been down that road and chronicles her experiences in her online column Sex in the Suburbs. Raykeil knows firsthand that there are still plenty of things our mothers (and friends, and doctors) don t tell us about motherhood, but that every mother should know. While the media continues to bombard us with images of sex everywhere we turn, the reality for married couples with children today is much different. Do-it-all-moms seem to be doing everything except IT. Raykeil is out to change that. Confessions of a Naughty Mommy is a funny, honest, and sexy account of Raykeil s search for her missing libido lost in action after she gave birth to her daughter. She takes readers along on her journey from mystified and frustrated new mom through the bumpy awkwardness of reigniting the home fires during naptime and date night to a newfound discovery and appreciation of sex after baby. With humor, grit, and style, she shares what has worked for her and her husband, as they balance their dual roles of parents and lovers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-fgUAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Faceting for Amateurs (3rd Edition)","description":"The author of, \\"FACETING HISTORY: CUTTING DIAMONDS AND COLORED STONES\\" has for a long time had a deep interest in learning how the early faceters (cutters) of diamonds and colored gemstones were able to complete their work. What methods did they use? What equipment did they have to make success possible? How soon did they discover how to complete the many phases necessary to accomplish their work? How did the equipment and methods differ between fashioning diamonds and faceting colored stones? These are just a few of the questions that the author wanted to find the answers for. In looking for answers to these and other questions, the author found that there were bits and pieces of information available in many previous books, but there was not a good book available that would answer most of his questions. Upon hearing the author ?s remarks about this fact, one of the librarians at the wonderful library located at the Gemological Institute of America ?s Carlsbad campus said that if such a book was not available, \\"maybe you should write the book!\\" Well, the author had been thinking of doing just that, but the remark caused the author to see the light and agree to get started on the project. Little did he know then that the project would require many months of eight hour days over seven day weeks to get the book completed. He decided to write a book that would answer these and other related questions that he had. The thought also occurred to him that such a book would be a valuable volume to be placed in libraries of individual faceters around the world. He realized that such a book would also be of great value to anyone who works behind a Jewelry store counter. A successful sales person is one who is knowledgeable about the products that they are selling. A book of faceting information would be extremely valuable if read and re-read from time to time. A customer in the Jewelry store will no doubt be favorably impressed by a sales presentation that is made with the use of interesting and informative information about diamonds and the various colored gemstones. The customer will be convinced that the sales person knows about what they are talking. The author has spent nearly three years on the project of researching the GIA library and other libraries, along with the extensive personal library of gemstone related books that he personally possesses. Many conflicting reports were noted in his study. He has made the statements in his book reflect the most commonly accepted opinions, of the most respected authors ? works that he has found in his research. History is only obtainable from the earlier works of other authors. We cannot go back to the long past centuries ourselves, to see first hand what really happened and when it happened. A study of faceting history requires making the best choices of the information that is available. This completed book answers questions as to why the fashioning of diamonds was/is so different from the faceting of colored gemstones. The book compares the needed equipment and the methods that have brought the greatest successes. In addition, a great deal of other information connected to faceting is included. There are seven chapters in the book and there are over 125 photographs of the early equipment and methods that were used. The photographs show the faceters, the workroom conditions, and the tools and equipment that they used to complete beautiful and lasting gemstones. The book chapters are titled: An Introduction to Faceting, Early Man ?s Stone Appreciation, Diamond Fashioning Procedure and Equipment, Colored Stone Faceting Procedure and Equipment, The Evolution of Cut Designs, Famous and Historic Gemstones, Sources of Diamond and Colored Stone Rough, and lastly, Advances in Faceting Over the Past One Hundred Years.

From an hour before the last New Year's Day of the war until late January, this quiet corner of northeastern France was rent by a vicious attack intended to physically and politically split the French from the western Alliance. Ultimately involving 5 German and 2 American corps, some of the finest remaining German formations were thrown into this last toss of the dice against American units ranging from the highly-experienced 45th 'Thunderbird' Infantry Division to the completely green all-infantry task forces of the 42nd, 63rd, and 70th Infantry Divisions. Dangerously overextended to facilitate the adjacent Third Army's drive to relieve the pressure in the Ardennes 'Bulge', some Seventh Army units held, many bent, and an exceptional few even broke as the savage German drive came painfully close to driving a geographic and political wedge between the Americans in the north and their French allies in the south.

It tells of the war between Eteocles and Polynices, sons of Oedipus, for the throne of Thebes. Rich in incident and always dramatic in tone, it unfolds a panorama of human ambition and violence, triumph and catastrophe. Though remaining within the Homeric and Virgilian tradition, it achieves its own power and vitality in thought, language, and description. This new translation captures all power of the Latin original, demonstrating that the Thebaid is not only a masterpiece of poetry but a compelling story, at times horrifying, noble, and pathetic, of humankind bound by the power of Fate.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1J3BQgAACAAJ&dq=Thebaid+(The+World%27s+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Under the lilacs (The Beacon Hill book shelf)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"English 3200 Tests","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Graphic Communications Today","description":"Learn what it takes to become a skilled graphic communicator!

Dick's novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, combines noir with science fiction to create a groundbreaking cyberpunk vision of urban life in the twenty-first century. With replicants on the run, the rain-drenched Los Angeles which Blade Runner imagines is a city of oppression and enclosure, but a city in which transgression and disorder can always erupt. Graced by stunning sets, lighting, effects, costumes and photography, Blade Runner succeeds brilliantly in depicting a world at once uncannily familiar and startlingly new. In his innovative and nuanced reading, Scott Bukatman details the making of Blade Runner and its steadily improving fortunes following its release in 1982. He situates the film in terms of debates about postmodernism, which have informed much of the criticism devoted to it, but argues that its tensions derive also from the quintessentially twentieth-century, modernist experience of the city  as a space both imprisoning and liberating. In his foreword to this special edition, published to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the BFI Film Classics series, Bukatman suggests that Blade Runner 's visual complexity allows it to translate successfully to the world of high definition and on-demand home cinema. He looks back to the sciencefiction tradition of the early 1980s, and on to the key changes in the 'final' version of the film in 2007, which risk diminishing the sense of instability created in the original.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DSBdDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The lost cities of Africa","description":"The aim of this book is to present what is now known and what seems reasonable to believe about some leading aspects and achievements of African life and civilization during the pre-colonial period, and thus to contribute to an understanding of Africa today.

Now, a quarter of a century has passed since Merton's death, and the journals are the last major piece of writing to appear by the 20th century's most important spiritual writer. The first of seven volumes, Run to the Mountain offers an intimate glimpse at the inner life of a young, pre-monastic Merton. Here readers will witness the insatiably curious graduate student in New York's Greenwich Village give way to the tentative spiritual seeker and brilliant writer. Merton playfully lists everything from his favorite lines of poetry and songs to the things he most loves and hates. Thomas Merton was an inveterate diarist; his journals offer a complete and candid look at the rich transformations of his adult life. As Brother Patrick Hart, general editor of the series notes, \\"Perhaps his best writing can be found in the journals, where he was expressing what was deepest in his heart with no thought of censorship. With their publication we will have as complete a picture of Thomas Merton as we can hope to have.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sWoEXAOfapwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The life and tragic death of Bruce Lee","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=junhAAAACAAJ&dq=The+life+and+tragic+death+of+Bruce+Lee&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Transit of Venus: The Brief, Brilliant Life of Jeremiah Horrocks, Father of British Astronomy","description":"New biography of the great British astronomer, Jeremiah Horrocks, who led the way for other greats like Newton or Halley.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q44KqAAACAAJ&dq=The+Transit+of+Venus:+The+Brief,+Brilliant+Life+of+Jeremiah+Horrocks,+Father+of+British+Astronomy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scientific Method in Practice","description":"This textbook will enable scientists to be better scientists by offering them a deeper understanding of the scientific method.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&dq=Scientific+Method+in+Practice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mel Bay's Celtic Encyclopedia: Mandolin Edition","description":"This comprehensive book contains over 120 Celtic tunes arranged for mandolin presented in standard notation and tablature.

To help him achieve this, Ken Canfield offers a three-part plan. First, a dad should examine his own heart. Next, he should take steps to improve the way he connects with his children. Lastly, he should take a longer range view and plan specifically for a lifetime of involved fathering. Canfield's plan addresses a father's past-a father should resolve his relationship with his own father in order to effectively build a relationship with his children. Canfield also explains how to build the four \\"walls\\" or dimensions, of fathering: involvement, awareness, consistency, and nurturing. He then supplies a plan for the future. From being a new father to being a grandfather, dads face challenges at each stage of their life. With the long-range perspective this book provides, fathers can anticipate and prepare for the changing situations they'll face. Based on years of careful research involving thousands of fathers, this book is a solid reference tool for dads.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VwcVYEssa-0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Vampire: A Casebook","description":"Vampires are the most fearsome and fascinating of all creatures of folklore. For the first time, detailed accounts of the vampire and how its tradition developed in different cultures are gathered in one volume by eminent folklorist Alan Dundes. Eleven leading scholars from the fields of Slavic studies, history, anthropology, and psychiatry unearth the true nature of the vampire from its birth in graveyard lore to the modern-day psychiatric patient with a penchant for drinking blood. The Vampire: A Casebook takes this legend out of the realm of literature and film and back to its dark beginnings in folk traditions. The essays examine the history of the word  vampire;  Romanian vampires; Greek vampires; Serbian vampires; the physical attributes of vampires; the killing of vampires; and the possible psychoanalytic underpinnings of vampires. Much more than simply a scary creature of the human imagination, the vampire has been and continues to haunt the lives of all those who encounter it in reality or in fiction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PpTWQDc0dqEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The peaceful palate: Fine vegetarian cuisine","description":"A collection of vegetarian and vegan recipes presented alongside the nutritional findings of recent years.

And now we can add to that list The Stormwatcher... For this remarkable, fine and almost unclassifiable book is a complete breath of fresh air, even considering his past achievements. The story is simply (!) the interaction of a group of somewhat dysfunctional friends during a two-week holiday in a lonely cottage in the Dordogne region of France. The group comprises James and his French wife, Sabine, and their two young daughters - Beth and the confused Jessie -plus James's one-time colleague Matt and his wife, Chrissie ... and, just to make things interesting, the sultry Rachel, another work-chum of James and one with whom he has shared considerably more than the occasional business meeting. As the story progresses we discover that one of the party - an unnamed instructor whose identity is kept hidden until the end of the book - is engaged in secret lessons with the impressionable Jessie, for reasons not immediately clear. Meanwhile, courtesy of a nicely-realized series of tense-changed flashbacks, we learn more of the instructor's background and an almost symbiotic relationship in which both she and her lover speak only lies to each other. All the time, Jessie grows more intense and confused while, around her, other members of the party grow, by turn, increasingly belligerent or subservient, manipulative or malleable, paranoid or confident. And underpinning the sequence of events is an intense feeling of primal sensuality evoked both by the environment and an approaching storm (its progress cleverly interjected into the proceedings by a series of half-page chapters explaining meteorological behaviour) and by the behaviour of the adults as their feelings for each other - and their protectiveness and confusion at the antics of and comments from young Jessie - swirl and eddy.\\" Signed by the author.

This is the goal of the Khan Academy, a passion project that grew from an ex-engineer and hedge funder's online tutoring sessions with his niece, who was struggling with algebra, into a worldwide phenomenon. Today millions of students, parents, and teachers use the Khan Academy's free videos and software, which have expanded to encompass nearly every conceivable subject; and Academy techniques are being employed with exciting results in a growing number of classrooms around the globe. Like many innovators, Khan rethinks existing assumptions and imagines what education could be if freed from them. And his core idea-liberating teachers from lecturing and state-mandated calendars and opening up class time for truly human interaction-has become his life's passion. Schools seek his advice about connecting to students in a digital age, and people of all ages and backgrounds flock to the site to utilize this fresh approach to learning. In THE ONE WORLD SCHOOLHOUSE, Khan presents his radical vision for the future of education, as well as his own remarkable story, for the first time. In these pages, you will discover, among other things: How both students and teachers are being bound by a broken top-down model invented in Prussia two centuries ago Why technology will make classrooms more human and teachers more important How and why we can afford to pay educators the same as other professionals How we can bring creativity and true human interactivity back to learning Why we should be very optimistic about the future of learning. Parents and politicians routinely bemoan the state of our education system. Statistics suggest we've fallen behind the rest of the world in literacy, math, and sciences. With a shrewd reading of history, Khan explains how this crisis presented itself, and why a return to \\"mastery learning,\\" abandoned in the twentieth century and ingeniously revived by tools like the Khan Academy, could offer the best opportunity to level the playing field, and to give all of our children a world-class education now. More than just a solution, THE ONE WORLD SCHOOLHOUSE serves as a call for free, universal, global education, and an explanation of how Khan's simple yet revolutionary thinking can help achieve this inspiring goal.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xz-gkDYm4UUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chrysanthemum Lace","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FsToAQAACAAJ&dq=Chrysanthemum+Lace&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ten Pearls of Wisdom: Achieving Your Goals & Capturing Your Dreams","description":"In the tradition of Napoleon Hill, here is a ten-step plan for achieving personal and professional success using Eleanor Jacobs' ten pearls of wisdom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nuXIti4RjZgC&dq=Ten+Pearls+of+Wisdom:+Achieving+Your+Goals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kidnapped: Child Abduction in America","description":"A look at famous kidnapping cases in American history explores the obsessive attention such cases arouse and what they say about the American family, the justice system, and the media","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FTODQBLxy_AC&dq=Kidnapped:+Child+Abduction+in+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Freemasonry in the American Revolution","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z73qAQAACAAJ&dq=Freemasonry+in+the+American+Revolution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essays on Man and Culture","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mind In Tibetan Buddhism","description":"Details the nature of mind and its functions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2HbYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Mind+In+Tibetan+Buddhism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Writing Research Papers","description":"Publishing your research in an international journal is key to your success in academia.

Yet most women s stories of personal growth after motherhood tend to remain untold. As writers and mothers, Andrea Buchanan and Amy Hudock were frustrated by what they perceived as a lack of writing by mothers that captured the ambiguity, complexity, and humor of their experiences.

Citing the pioneering work of historian of science Thomas Kuhn and economist James Buchanan, Michaels and Balling demonstrate that it was inevitable that global warming would be distorted by the political sphere and that most scientists would either stand mute or actually assist in that process. But, the authors argue, such distortions in science are always temporary, and inevitably the scientific community will concede that earlier forecasts dramatically exaggerated the threat of global warming.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Vokbfbxq0E4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Child Honoring: How to Turn This World Around","description":"To launch an international campaign on behalf of the world's children, Nelson Mandella spoke of the need for action to address the many threats facing children around the globe.

He was director of CRIFO (Civilian Research, Interplanetary Flying Objects) - one of the world's largest research groups during the mid-5Os, and publisher of its newsletter, ORBIT (1953-1957). He also worked in cooperation with the United States Air Force (1953-1957), investigating and reporting UFO activity, having been assigned a special code number for reporting to the Air Defense Command in Columbus, Ohio. For over 30 years, Stringfield served in several of the major UFO organizations in a public relations capacity. From 1957 to 1970, he was public relations adviser with the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). Later on, he was Director of Public Relations and a board member of the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON). He was also a regional investigator for the Center for UFO Studies, directed by Dr. J. Allen Hynek. Stringfield was an executive with DuBois Chemicals, an international manufacturer. Stringfield retired in 1981 as Director of Public Relations and Marketing Services for DuBois Chemicals, a division of Chemed Corp., after 31 years service with the company. From 1967-1968 he served as Early Warning Coordinator for the University of Colarado UFO Project, screening UFO reports for possible scientific study. Stringfield was also an advisor to Sir Eric Gairy, former Prime Minister of Grenada, 1977-78, during his efforts to establish a UFO research agency within the framework of the United Nations. Stringfield passed away in 1994, leaving a string of fascinating publications behind, one of which is \\"UFO Crash Retrievals: Status Report II: The UFO Crash Retrieval Syndrome - New Sources, New Data,\\" based on a talk Stringfield gave at a MUFON convention in 1978. This is the second volume in Stringfield's influential 7-part \\"UFO Crash Retrieval Status Report\\" series, in which he lays the groundwork for the theories that made him famous. In looking at various UFO crashes throughout the U.S. in previous decades, Stringfield, the first researcher to exclusively focus on UFO crashes, shares many intriguing details about a number of major UFO cases. This extremely rare volume has been lovingly reproduced exactly as it was first published 35 years ago. The material inside, which was shocking to many observers in those days, is finally gaining acceptance. Today, Stringfield's sober, objective research on crashes like Roswell and Kecksburg seems increasingly relevant. In a field filled with pretenders, Stringfield shines as the \\"real deal.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lKMeswEACAAJ&dq=The+UFO+Crash+/+Retrieval+Syndrome,+Status+Report+II:+New+Sources,+New+Data&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"It's Not Easy Being a Bunny (Beginner Books(R))","description":"This Beginner Book starring P.J.

These books have idealized, worshiped, slandered, celebrated, constructed, and deconstructed her. The present work draws on the most reliable of these books and offers a portrait of Helen as the archetypal woman of Western culture. This is the story of a consistent, however dissembling, hatred for women. It is not only the story of the hatred of men for women, but also the story of the self-hatred of women instilled by the culture of misogyny. Based on the best scholarship, this is also a psychological analysis of why a species so prone to loneliness and self-doubt would sever itself in two, deny itself the intimacy, recognition, and comfort of equals, and make the embodiment of beauty and life into an icon of shame. This is a book that will fascinate all feminists and infuriate some men.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jmzXAAAAMAAJ&dq=Helen:+Myth,+Legend,+and+the+Culture+of+Misogyny&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hanging Judge","description":"Elmer Kelton, voted \\"The Greatest Western Writer of All Time\\" by the Western Writers of America, is a legend in the field of Western literature.

For nearly 70 years before the Civil War, orchards and grazing land covered the area. When Camp Campbell was settled during the war where Sixth and U Streets now lie, thousands of fighting soldiers and then freed men and women flocked to the area. The fighting ceased, and many people remained to construct small wood frame homes, churches, and businesses that eventually gave way to the elegant rows of substantial brick townhomes lining the surrounding street today. The rise of racial segregation in the early 1900s cultivated the Greater U Street area into a \\"city within a city\\" for the African-American community, and it remained so until the urban riots of 1968. The 1920s and 1930s witnessed a thriving cultural scene, with entertainers such as Sarah Vaughn, Pearl Bailey, Cab Calloway, and the neighborhood's own Edward \\"Duke\\" Ellington frequenting private clubs like Bohemian Caverns and other venues such as the Howard, Dunbar, Republic, and Lincoln Theaters. Known by many as the \\"Black Broadway,\\" Greater U Street was unique in that many of its institutions-Industrial Bank and True Reformers Hall among them-were designed, financed, owned, and built utilizing the talents of such emerging African-American professionals as banker John Whitelaw and architect John A.

In 1968, Donald Crowhurst was trying to market a nautical navigation device he had developed, and saw the Sunday Times Golden Globe round the world sailing race as the perfect opportunity to showcase his product. Few people knew that he wasn't an experienced deep-water sailor. His progress was so slow that he decided to short-cut the journey, while falsifying his location through radio messages from his supposed course. Everyone following the race thought that he was winning, and a hero's welcome awaited him at home in Britain. But on 10 July 1968, eight months after he set off, his wife was told that his boat had been discovered drifting in mid-Atlantic. Crowhurst was missing, assumed drowned, and there was much speculation that this was one of the great mysteries of the sea. In this masterpiece of investigative journalism, Nicholas Tomalin and Ron Hall reconstruct one of the greatest hoaxes of our time. From in-depth interviews with Crowhurst's family and friends and telling excerpts from his logbooks, Tomalin and Hall develop a tale of tragic self-delusion and public deception, a haunting portrait of a complex, deeply troubled man and his journey into the heart of darkness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sx4ojwEACAAJ&dq=The+Strange+Last+Voyage+of+Donald+Crowhurst&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Friends: The One about the #1 Sitcom","description":"Let your best buds know that you'll be there for them with this DIY gift book inspired by the gang from Friends: Rachel, Ross, Joey, Monica, Phoebe, and Chandler.

Ethel Person views romantic love as a powerful agent of change, arguing that it is as central to human culture as it is to human existence. This new edition of Dreams of Love and Fateful Encounters emphasizes the relevance of passion not only to lovers but also to mental health professionals whose patients often enter treatment because of love-related issues--from the inability to love or make a commitment to the perils of extramarital love to love sickness or loss of love. She forthrightly addresses not only the power of love to unlock the soul but also its inherent paradoxes and conflicts. Employing a philosophical perspective in order to understand the existential dilemmas posed by love, and a cultural perspective in order to understand its cultural variability, Dr. Person breaks with contemporary intellectual and philosophical dismissive assumptions about romantic love. She acknowledges love's vital importance and power, proposing that passion serves an important function not only for the individual but also for the culture while charging psychoanalysis with a reductionist emphasis on sexuality and psychopathology that has narrowed the focus of inquiry into love. Among the issues she discusses are: romantic love's sources in our early lives, its relationship to imagination and creativity, and its capacity to enable the lover to transcend the self how romantic love often demands a reordering of values and promotes personal growth by exposing the self to new risks and possibilities the transformational potential of transference love in the therapy process flaws in the common misperception that women are more influenced by romantic love than men considerations of homosexual love, love across generations, and love triangles, focusing on the individual growth that can result from such relationships Citing accounts of love drawn from literature, film, and real life, Person focuses on the lover's internal soliloquy and external dialogue with the beloved that can develop over an individual's life. An uplifting resource for people experiencing failing or unorthodox romances, Dreams of Love and Fateful Encounters boldly takes on issues pertinent to lovers, to professionals who encounter patients for whom key conflicts revolve around romantic love, and to anyone who has struggled to understand the importance of romantic love in his or her own life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=34RengEACAAJ&dq=Dreams+of+Love+and+Fateful+Encounters:+The+Power+of+Romantic+Passion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Body Shop","description":"A skin- and hair-care book.

Terror and History in Pol Pot's Secret Prison.","description":"The horrific torture and execution of hundreds of thousands of Cambodians by Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge during the 1970s is one of the century's major human disasters. David Chandler, a world-renowned historian of Cambodia, examines the Khmer Rouge phenomenon by focusing on one of its key institutions, the secret prison outside Phnom Penh known by the code name \\"S-21.\\" The facility was an interrogation center where more than 14,000 \\"enemies\\" were questioned, tortured, and made to confess to counterrevolutionary crimes. Fewer than a dozen prisoners left S-21 alive. During the Democratic Kampuchea (DK) era, the existence of S-21 was known only to those inside it and a few high-ranking Khmer Rouge officials. When invading Vietnamese troops discovered the prison in 1979, murdered bodies lay strewn about and instruments of torture were still in place. An extensive archive containing photographs of victims, cadre notebooks, and DK publications was also found. Chandler utilizes evidence from the S-21 archive as well as materials that have surfaced elsewhere in Phnom Penh. He also interviews survivors of S-21 and former workers from the prison. Documenting the violence and terror that took place within S-21 is only part of Chandler's story. Equally important is his attempt to understand what happened there in terms that might be useful to survivors, historians, and the rest of us. Chandler discusses the \\"culture of obedience\\" and its attendant dehumanization, citing parallels between the Khmer Rouge executions and the Moscow Show Trails of the 1930s, Nazi genocide, Indonesian massacres in 1965-66, the Argentine military's use of torture in the 1970s, and the recent mass killings in Bosnia and Rwanda. In each of these instances, Chandler shows how turning victims into \\"others\\" in a manner that was systematically devaluing and racialist made it easier to mistreat and kill them. More than a chronicle of Khmer Rouge barbarism, Voices from S-21 is also a judicious examination of the psychological dimensions of state-sponsored terrorism that conditions human beings to commit acts of unspeakable brutality.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SAaDVeQB8BkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nez Perce Summer, 1877: The U.S. Army and Nee-Me-Poo Crisis","description":"Nez Perce Summer, 1877 tells the story of a people s epic struggle to survive spiritually, culturally, and physically in the face of unrelenting military force. Written by one of the foremost experts in frontier military history, Jerome A. Greene, and reviewed by members of the Nez Perce tribe, this definitive treatment of the Nez Perce War is the first to incorporate research from all known accounts of Nez Perce and U.S. military participants. Enhanced by sixteen detailed maps and forty-nine historic photographs, Greene s gripping narrative takes readers on a three-and-one-half month 1,700-mile journey across the wilds of Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana territories. All of the skirmishes and battles of the war receive detailed treatment, which benefits from Greene s astute analysis of the strategies and decision making on both sides. Between 100 and 150 of the more than 800 Nez Perce men, women, and children who began the trek were killed during the war. Almost as many died in the months following the surrender, after they were exiled to malaria-ridden northeastern Oklahoma. Army deaths numbered 113. The casualties on both sides were an extraordinary price for a war that nobody wanted but whose history has since fascinated generations of Americans.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Bq1-EAAAQBAJ&dq=Nez+Perce+Summer,+1877:+The+U.S.+Army+and+Nee-Me-Poo+Crisis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Semi-Markov Processes and Reliability (Statistics for Industry and Technology)","description":"At first there was the Markov property. The theory of stochastic processes, which can be considered as an exten sion of probability theory, allows the modeling of the evolution of systems through the time. It cannot be properly understood just as pure mathemat ics, separated from the body of experience and examples that have brought it to life. The theory of stochastic processes entered a period of intensive develop ment, which is not finished yet, when the idea of the Markov property was brought in. Not even a serious study of the renewal processes is possible without using the strong tool of Markov processes. The modern theory of Markov processes has its origins in the studies by A. A: Markov (1856-1922) of sequences of experiments \\"connected in a chain\\" and in the attempts to describe mathematically the physical phenomenon known as Brownian mo tion. Later, many generalizations (in fact all kinds of weakenings of the Markov property) of Markov type stochastic processes were proposed. Some of them have led to new classes of stochastic processes and useful applications. Let us mention some of them: systems with complete connections [90, 91, 45, 86]; K-dependent Markov processes [44]; semi-Markov processes, and so forth. The semi-Markov processes generalize the renewal processes as well as the Markov jump processes and have numerous applications, especially in relia bility.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eB_oBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Systems of War and Peace","description":"War and peace are as important as other institutions- science, politics, family, economy, religion, etc.- but rarely receive the same level of sociological attention. Systems of War and Peace covers this gap by presenting a coherent framework for understanding why and how wars start and end; what military organizations are, how they function, and where they came from; plus, how peace has been achieved in the past and how it can be achieved in the future. The balance of topics is intended to provide a sufficient basis for understanding the whole spectrum of violent social conflict and the reasons why some peace efforts have failed and others have succeeded. The second edition has been updated to include recent developments and new topics. Since the first edition in 1994, there have been no international wars, but there has been a host of rebellions, civil wars, interventions, and terrorist attacks. At the same time, some conflicts have abated and peacemaking attempts have been ongoing in many venues. A number of topics neglected in the first edition, such as sexuality in the military, have been added.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cx65AAAAIAAJ&dq=Systems+of+War+and+Peace&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Steinbeck: A life in letters","description":"\\"Surely his most interesting, plausibly his most memorable, and . . . arguably his best book\\"  The New York Times Book Review For John Steinbeck, who hated the telephone, letter-writing was a preparation for work and a natural way for him to communicate his thoughts on people he liked and hated; on marriage, women, and children; on the condition of the world; and on his progress in learning his craft.

The first edition of this groundbreaking text showed that the SPC paradigm of W. Edwards Deming was not at all the same as the Quality Control paradigm that has dominated American manufacturing since World War II. Statistical Process Control: The Deming Paradigm and Beyond, Second Edition reveals even more of Deming's philosophy and provides more techniques for use at the managerial level. Explaining that CEOs and service industries need SPC at least as much as production managers, it offers precise methods and guidelines for their use. Using the practical experience of the authors working both in America and Europe, this book shows how SPC can be implemented in a variety of settings, from health care to manufacturing. It also provides you with the necessary technical background through mathematical and statistical appendices.

In it, the lost twin sons of the old merchant Egeon both named Antipholus find themselves in Ephesus, without either one even knowing of the other s existence. Meanwhile, Egeon has arrived in search of the son he thinks is still alive and has been sentenced to death for the  crime  of being from Syracuse. To add to the confusion, the two Antipholuses have twin servants, both named Dromio. As the four men unwittingly encounter each other, the play is crammed with wildly escalating misunderstandings before the truth emerges and Egeon is pardoned. Shakespeare bases his story on Plautus s Menaechmi, a play about identical twins who accidentally meet after a lifetime apart. He borrows from another Plautus play by having Adriana, the wife of one Antipholus, entertain the other. The spirited Adriana often gives speeches evoking strong emotions as do other characters at times. Even here, Shakespeare suggests complexities beyond the farce. The authoritative edition of The Comedy of Errors from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes: -The exact text of the printed book for easy cross-reference -Hundreds of hypertext links for instant navigation -Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play -Full explanatory notes conveniently linked to the text of the play -Scene-by-scene plot summaries -A key to the play s famous lines and phrases -An introduction to reading Shakespeare s language -An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play -Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library s vast holdings of rare books -An annotated guide to further reading Essay by Arthur F.

Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition software. Few people have had as dramatic an influence on modern ideas of child education as Maria Montessori. Born in 1870, Montessori was an Italian physician and educator. Maria drew on her own experiences working with children as well as insights from her Roman Catholic faith to pioneer a new way to help children learn. Her approach, known as the Montessori Method, continues to be used with great success today. In the preface to Maria Montessori's treatise on childhood learning The Secret of Childhood, Maria's son Mario clearly articulates the vision that his mother shared. In the first words of this preface, he writes: \\"Today's problems with regard to youth and childhood are the most patent proof that teaching is not the most important part of education. Yet the delusion persists that teachers form the person through their teaching of the child.\\" At the center of the Montessori way is an understanding of the child as a person worthy of respect. She writes, \\"I have come to appreciate the fact that children have a deep sense of personal dignity. Adults, as a rule, have no concept of how easily they are wounded and oppressed.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZwbiyAEACAAJ&dq=The+Secret+Childhood+%5BFirst+Printing%5D&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sea-Doo Water Vehicles Shop Manual 1988-1996 (Clymer Personal Watercraft)","description":"Sea-Doo Water Vehicles 88-96","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0jXfwAEACAAJ&dq=Sea-Doo+Water+Vehicles+Shop+Manual+1988-1996+(Clymer+Personal+Watercraft)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"World Regional Geography","description":"World Regional Geography by Finlayson provides a concise and accessible introduction to the major concepts in Geography through an exploration of the world's regions.

On the east coast, early in the twentieth century, this spirit was captured by Charles Ives (whose music lay virtually ignored and unperformed until the world caught up with him, forty years later). On the west coast, Henry Cowell and John Cage encountered similar critical resistance. Their pioneering flair was an act of defiance: Americans throwing off the shackles of European tradition and inventing a new language, seeking to redefine what could or could not be embraced by the term 'music'. No single book to date has concentrated on this particularly rebellious trend in American music. American Pioneers investigates the life and work of the major American innovators - including Carl Ruggles, Edgard Varese, Harry Partch, Colin McPhee, Lou Harrison and members of America's youngest composing generation - revealing the colourful and often idiosyncratic nature of these characters, and focusing on the peculiarly American quality of their artistic motivation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=juwYAQAAIAAJ&dq=American+Pioneers:+Ives+to+Cage+and+Beyond+(20th+Century+Composers)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The encyclopedia of Isshin Ryu karate: Book one beginner to green belt","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=14wUHAAACAAJ&dq=The+encyclopedia+of+Isshin+Ryu+karate:+Book+one+beginner+to+green+belt&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Some thoughts concerning education (Pitt press series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WiI8tQEACAAJ&dq=Some+thoughts+concerning+education+(Pitt+press+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A kind of loving","description":"A novel about a young man who learns the difference between physical attraction and love, and comes to assume responsibility for making an unromantic marraige succed.

Beginning with this seemingly obvious fact of religious transmission, Harvey Whitehouse goes on to construct a testable theory of how religions are created, passed on, and changed. At the center of his theory are two divergent 'modes of religiosity: ' the imagistic and the doctrinal. Drawing from recent advances in cognitive science, Whitehouse's theory shows how religions tend to coalesce around one of these two poles depending on how religious behaviors are remembered. In the 'imagistic mode, ' rituals have a lasting impact on people's minds, haunting not only our memories but influencing the way we ruminate on religious topics. These psychological features are linked to the scale and structure of religious communities, fostering small, exclusive, and ideologically heterogeneous ritual groupings or factions. In the 'doctrinal mode', on the other hand, religious knowledge is primarily spread through intensive and repetitive teaching; religious communities are contrastingly large, inclusive, and centrally regulated. While these tendencies have long been recognized in the history of the study of religion, the modes of religiosity theory is unique in that it explains why these tendencies exist. More importantly, Whitehouse does not give the final word, but invites us to join a series of collaborative networks among anthropologists, historians, archaeologists, and psychologists, currently trying to falsify, confirm, or refine the theory. Are you tired of the flood of descriptions and interpretations of religions which offer no clear strategy for evaluation, comparison, and testing?

Can we choose who to love? Is romantic love rational? Can we love more than one person at a time? And can we make ourselves fall out of love? In On Romantic Love, Berit Brogaard attempts to get to the bottom of love's many contradictions. This short book, informed by both historical and cutting edge philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience, combines a new theory of romantic love with entertaining anecdotes from real life and accessible explanations of the neuroscience underlying our wildest passions. Against the grain, Brogaard argues that love is an emotion; that it can be, at turns, both rational and irrational; and that it can be manifested in degrees. We can love one person more than another and we can love a person a little or a lot or not at all. And love isn't even always something we consciously feel. However, love -- like other emotions, both conscious and not -- is subject to rational control, and falling in or out of it can be a deliberate choice. This engaging and innovative look at a universal topic, featuring original line drawings by illustrator Gareth Southwell, illuminates the processes behind heartbreak, obsession, jealousy, attachment, and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QEiPBQAAQBAJ&dq=Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Weeds of California,","description":"This encyclopedic yet easy-to-use 2-volume set covers 262 individual entries, including a full description of 451 species and another 361 plants compared as similar species, representing 63 plant families. 13 shortcut identification tables for groups that share similar, unusual, or relatively uncommon characteristics. 2 grass identification keys - a key to all characteristics including inflorescences and reproductive parts and a key to vegetative characteristics only. 67 tables comparing important characteristics of difficult-to-distinguish weedy species.

Consequently in the Puritan tradition there are many written prayers and meditations which constitute an important corpus of inspiring devotional literature. Too often ex tempore prayer lacks variety, order and definiteness. The reason for this lies partly in a neglect of due preparation.

Then the Gods left Enshar to walk amongst the stars and they left the Darvinor, ranked highest amongst the Elven folk, as their custodians. But the Darvinor were hungry for knowledge that was kept from mortal races and they led the children of Enshar away from the enlightenment of the Gods and so brought down the Darktime upon them all.\\" For an age of unaccounted years, utter chaos engulfed the world and all that was learned was lost. Then hope was rekindled in the form of the legendary Books of Law, three great tomes that contained the lost beliefs and rituals of the twenty-seven religions that had existed before the Darktime. The scattered tribes of the Humans were united in the northern continent of Eldoria and a new enlightened era began, the Age of the Redemption. Two thousand years have passed since the discovery of the Books of Law and the nations of Men now dominate Eldoria, from the frigid realm of Char-Endl, to the exotic desert lands of the Theocracy of Y'sira. They have unlocked the secrets of steel and stone but their ascendancy has been very different than our own world. For in Eldoria, Man has also learned the secrets of Magic, resulting in a reliance on arcane power that has retarded the emergence of science. Combined with the suspicion and secrecy that the abundance of religious institutions apply to any new discoveries, Man has remained locked in a quasi-medieval level of technology. Yet Man is not alone in Eldoria. TheDwarven Stonekin once dwelled in mines beneath the great mountain ranges, but for many centuries they have been abandoning their old ways and coming to live amongst the cities of Men (though their elders still tell tales of ancient glory). And in the east, the Leezari Elves have recently emerged from a self-imposed isolation from before the Darktime, seeking allies to help them in their eternal war against the Goblinkynd of Ahr-Ganiz. Civilisations have arisen, empires have come and gone but the temples of the Gods remain constant, involving everyone in their rivalries and machinations. Political intrigue is almost a sport amongst the clergy and a talented individual can keep their purse full by serving the many and varied clandestine causes of the twenty-seven priesthoods. Yet far from the great cities, there are still places that remain untouched in the modern world, such as the great forests of Llanish Highlands, the impenetrable jungles of Po-Ka or the Outlands, where magic is weak and inconstant. Great fortunes lie in wait for those bold enough to journey there to uncover the relics and treasures of the past. Eldoria is the new d20 campaign setting from Comstar Publishing; an immersive world of angerous liaisons, mystery and expeditions down dungeons deep. Adventure awaits.. Contains: - A unique mythos - Fully detailed background history - Descriptions of realms and cultures - New items and monsters to include in any campaign","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R1scAQAACAAJ&dq=Encyclopedia+Eldoria&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to Biotechnology: An Agricultural Revolution","description":"Introduction to Biotechnology: An Agricultural Revolution provides students with a basic understanding of the concepts that contribute to agriculture s biotechnology revolution.

Having lived mostly in the remote deserts of Arizona and New Mexico with no access to formal training, Partch naturally created theatrical ritualistic works incorporating Indian chants, Japanese kabuki and Noh, Polynesian microtones, Balinese gamelan, Greek tragedy, dance, mime, and sardonic commentary on Hollywood and commercial pop music of modern civilization. First published in 1949, Genesis of a Music is the manifesto of Partch's radical compositional practice and instruments (which owe nothing to the 300-year-old European tradition of Western music.) He contrasts Abstract and Corporeal music, proclaiming the latter as the vital, emotionally tactile form derived from the spoken word (like Greek, Chinese, Arabic, and Indian musics) and surveys the history of world music at length from this perspective. Parts II, III, and IV explain Partch's theories of scales, intonation, and instrument construction with copious acoustical and mathematical documentation. Anyone with a musically creative attitude, whether or not familiar with traditional music theory, will find this book revelatory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8JVQAQAACAAJ&dq=Genesis+Of+A+Music+(Music+Book+Index)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Shadow of Blooming Grove: Warren G.

Drawing upon a broad range of naturally-occurring NMCs, including types that fall outside the domains of relative clause and noun complement constructions, Yoshiko Matsumoto argues for an analysis of NMCs that gives an important role to semantics and pragmatics. The framework in which this approach is presented draws from, and further refines, concepts of frame semantics. By using a frame semantic definition of semantic integration, the author reveals the commonality of diverse types of NMCs in Japanese, and posits a tripartite classification of NMCs which is both more comprehensive and more revealing than the traditional dichotomy between relative clause and noun complement constructions. As the first comprehensive and systematic study in English of Japanese NMCs with diverse lexical heads, this work is further notable for its detailed discussion of the dependence of NMCs on both linguistic and extra-linguistic context.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vThCAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Chaucer (Cambridge Companions to Literature)","description":"Table of contents","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FIWtAeCVO5QC&dq=The+Cambridge+Companion+to+Chaucer+(Cambridge+Companions+to+Literature)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Different Hours: Poems","description":"In Here and Now, the lucidity of Dunn's language makes his poems seem effortless.

Row upon row of soon-to-be-forgotten titles. That's not the case with this book. It is a classic! \\"The Colour of Courage\\" is the remarkable true story of the epic horse trip made by famed Australian equestrian explorers Sharon Muir Watson and Ken Roberts. During the course of their mounted journey the young friends discovered enough adventures to satisfy even the most jaded reader, ranging from riding through leech-infested jungles to trying to herd their horses through some of the toughest terrain on earth. Yet, if many of these pages are testaments to courage, other sections carry the reader away to the forgotten corners of back-country Australia. For Ken and Sharon are not just horse people. They are the dust of Australia given a voice. Here are the old drovers recounting lost stories. Here are the little people of a big land recounting their tales. And here are two young people alive with vitality, ablaze with bravery, and determined to ride the length of an inhospitable country on a do-or-die journey. Ken and Sharon were the first to ride Australia's 5,000 kilometer long Bicentennial National Trail. They will not be the last. But what is certain is that this book, and their legendary ride, will never be forgotten.

Psychologists and neuroscientists refer to these distinctly human foibles, biases, and thinking traps as  cognitive errors.  Cognitive errors are systematic deviances from rationality, from optimized, logical, rational thinking and behavior. We make these errors all the time, in all sorts of situations, for problems big and small: whether to choose the apple or the cupcake; whether to keep retirement funds in the stock market when the Dow tanks, or whether to take the advice of a friend over a stranger. The  behavioral turn  in neuroscience and economics in the past twenty years has increased our understanding of how we think and how we make decisions. It shows how systematic errors mar our thinking and under which conditions our thought processes work best and worst. Evolutionary psychology delivers convincing theories about why our thinking is, in fact, marred. The neurosciences can pinpoint with increasing precision what exactly happens when we think clearly and when we don t. Drawing on this wide body of research, The Art of Thinking Clearly is an entertaining presentation of these known systematic thinking errors--offering guidance and insight into everything why you shouldn t accept a free drink to why you SHOULD walk out of a movie you don t like it to why it s so hard to predict the future to why shouldn t watch the news. The book is organized into 100 short chapters, each covering a single cognitive error, bias, or heuristic. Examples of these concepts include: Reciprocity, Confirmation Bias, The It-Gets-Better-Before-It-Gets-Worse Trap, and the Man-With-A-Hammer Tendency. In engaging prose and with real-world examples and anecdotes, The Art of Thinking Clearly helps solve the puzzle of human reasoning.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5VYAAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Science and Human Values","description":"Science and Human Values was originally a lecture by Jacob Bronowski at MIT in 1953.

After such knowledge, what forgiveness? With care and erudition Bronowski argues that scientific endeavour is an essentially creative act, part of a great shared human interest in ourselves and the world around us; and, routinely, a process of trial-and-error, the end of which is not - cannot be - preordained. 'Above all, Bronowski strove to make science and technology answerable to social progress, to 'human values.' He anticipated the deepening gap between the 'two cultures' and knew that the sciences must be restored to a place in political common sense.'

I?m half in love and half dead. It stands to reason that I?ve come upon a difficult task. Despite his disclaimer, it seems no difficult task at all. One of the pioneers of Chicano poetry and a highly esteemed artist in the Mexican American community, Luis Omar Salinas is a poet with Tex-Mex bordertown roots whose work is studied at the Sorbonne. Beginning with his legendary first book, Crazy Gypsy, he has been a major figure not only in Chicano literature but in all of American poetry?both a poet of the people and a voice for other poets. In Elegy for Desire, Salinas has crafted visionary poems about growing older and looking back on a rich life of poetry. In this quiet yet hallucinatory volume, Salinas offers us a prismatic collection of odes, elegies, and cantos of desire?complex poems about our place in the world. Poems to be savored in solitude, or better still with an intimate companion. Few poets, Latino or otherwise, are as daring with love poetry that is so honestly fierce. Salinas gives us a meditation on gently aging while continuing to celebrate personal experience that draws upon the world. One need only sample these rich, elegant stanzas to recognize the wealth of wisdom found in their words. Elegy for Desire is a testament to a singular talent that has survived for decades . . . and will continue to inspire long beyond his lifetime. The dead can?t complain, and lovers always do. Well, I?m here, and that is important.

Geometric algebra was invented by William Kingdon Clifford in 1878 as a unification and generalization of the works of Grassmann and Hamilton, which came more than a quarter of a century before. Whereas the algebras of Clifford and Grassmann are well known in advanced mathematics and physics, they have never made an impact in elementary textbooks where the vector algebra of Gibbs-Heaviside still predominates. The approach to Clifford algebra adopted in most of the ar ticles here was pioneered in the 1960s by David Hestenes. Later, together with Garret Sobczyk, he developed it into a unified language for math ematics and physics. Sobczyk first learned about the power of geometric algebra in classes in electrodynamics and relativity taught by Hestenes at Arizona State University from 1966 to 1967. He still vividly remembers a feeling of disbelief that the fundamental geometric product of vectors could have been left out of his undergraduate mathematics education. Geometric algebra provides a rich, general mathematical framework for the develop ment of multilinear algebra, projective and affine geometry, calculus on a manifold, the representation of Lie groups and Lie algebras, the use of the horosphere and many other areas.

Comprised of five chapters, the publication studies the three crises (slow growth, growing inequality and the environmental emergency) affecting economies and societies around the world, placing particular focus on those of Latin America and the Caribbean. It goes on to present a framework for analysing these crises in an integrated manner and measuring their magnitude in the specified regions. It then examines the quantitative impacts on growth, emissions, income distribution and the external sector under different policy scenarios, highlighting the potential of various policy combinations to forge a more dynamic growth path, with lower emissions and greater equality. Further identifying seven sectors that can drive sustainable development and proposing policies to foster these sectors, the publication concludes with an analysis that links up macroeconomic, industrial, social and environmental policies and the role of the State in building consensus for their implementation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1IVqzgEACAAJ&dq=Mass+transit+that+favors+the+poor:+Medellin%27s+Metrocable+is+an+economic,+social+and+political+anomaly.:+An+article+from:+National+Catholic+Reporter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-House,: With autobiographical notes,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NF3pWqKdDbIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ANTI-FAT NUTRIENTS","description":"In an easy-to-understand style, Clouatre presents 17 categories of nutrients, plus the latest and most complete information available on metabolic biochemistry, why diets can actually increase body fat, how alcohol affects metabolism, and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x6Msu0PfhhkC&dq=ANTI-FAT+NUTRIENTS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clifford's Animal Sounds","description":"Clifford the small red puppy meets a variety of animals and discovers what kinds of sounds they make.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LfdcHAAACAAJ&dq=Clifford%27s+Animal+Sounds&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Works of George Eliot (24 volume set)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ytYjAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Laugh So I Won't Cry: Kenya's Women Tell the Stories of Their Lives","description":"Helena Halperin presents portraits of a diverse selection of Kenyan women, describing the struggles they face in everyday life, including childrearing, work & unemployment, genital cutting, ethnic tensions & how they are responding to a new government that is promising huge reforms","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NN8SAQAAMAAJ&dq=I+Laugh+So+I+Won%27t+Cry:+Kenya%27s+Women+Tell+the+Stories+of+Their+Lives&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Loving Search for God: Contemplative Prayer and the Cloud of Unknowing","description":"\\"A powerful, even stunning job of explaining contmeplative prayer...an excellent guide for anyone interested in deepening his or her Christian prayer life.\\" - Publishers Weekly>","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-5b7HePJM3EC&dq=The+Loving+Search+for+God:+Contemplative+Prayer+and+the+Cloud+of+Unknowing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood Angels: Deus Encarmine (Warhammer 40,000)","description":"Retreating following an ignominious defeat, the Space Marines are given reinforcements from a new army led by the legendary primarch, Sanguinius, a fierce warrior who has supposedly been dead for centuries.

Full length practice tests paralleling the actual exams are presented in our companion volume, REA's The Best Test Preparation for the CLEP General Exams.\\" ABOUT THE CLEP GENERAL CBTS Who takes the CLEP General CBTs and what are they used for? CLEP examinations are usually taken by people who have acquired knowledge outside the classroom and wish to bypass certain college courses and earn college credit. The College-Level Examination Program is designed to reward students for learning - no matter where or how that knowledge was acquired. More than 2,900 colleges grant credit and/or advanced standing for CLEP exams. This makes CLEP the most widely accepted credit-by-examination program in the country. Although most CLEP examinees are adults returning to college, many graduating high school seniors, enrolled college students, and international students also take the exams to earn college credit or to demonstrate their ability to perform at the college level. There are no prerequisites, such as age or educational status, for taking CLEP examinations. However, you must meet specific requirements of the particular institution from which you wish to receive CLEP credit. Most CLEP examinations include material usually covered in an undergraduate course with a similar title to that of the exam (e. g., History of the United States I). However, the five exams covered in this book do not deal with subject matter covered in any particular course but rather with material taken as general requirements during the first two years of college. These general exams are English Composition (with or without essay), Humanities, College Mathematics, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences and History. Who administers the exams? The CLEP is developed by the College Board, administered by Educational Testing Service (ETS), and involves the assistance of educators throughout the country. The test development process is designed and implemented to ensure that the content and difficulty level of the test are appropriate. When and where are the exams given? The CLEP General Examinations are offered year-round at some 1,400 test centers in the United States and abroad. To find the test center nearest you and to register for the exam, you should obtain a copy of the free booklets CLEP Colleges and CLEP Information for Candidates and Registration Form, which are available at most colleges where CLEP credit is granted, or by contacting: CLEP Services P.O. Box 6600 Princeton, NJ 08541-6600 Phone: (609) 771-7865 Website: http: //www.collegeboard.com HOW TO USE THIS BOOK What do I study first? Read over this introduction and our suggestions for test-taking, take the first practice test in your subject to determine your area(s) of weakness, and then go back and focus your studying on those specific problems. Make copies of the appropriate answer sheets each time you take a practice test (answer sheets are located at the back of this book). Studying each subject thoroughly will reinforce the basic skills you will need to do well on the exam. Be sure to take the practice tests to become familiar with the format and procedures involved with taking the actual exam - and, of course, to make yourself completely comfortable with the material. To best utilize your study time, follow our CLEP General Examinations Independent Study Schedule located in the front of this book. This schedule is designed to guide you through one General Examination at a time. You should repeat the schedule for each exam for which you're preparing. The schedule is based on a six-week program but can be condensed to three weeks, if necessary, by collapsing each two-week period into one. When should I start studying? It is never too early to start studying for the CLEP General Examinations. The earlier you begin, the more time you will have to sharpen your skills. Do not procrastinate! Cramming is not an effective way to study, since it does not allow you the time needed to learn the test material. The sooner you learn the format of the exam, the more time you will have to familiarize yourself with it. FORMAT OF THE CLEP GENERAL CBTs The five computer-based CLEP General Examinations cover material taught in classes that most students take as requirements in the first two years of college. The General CBT in English Composition gauges the skills you would need to complete most first-year college composition courses. There are two versions of the English Composition exam - with essay and without essay. (Credit-granting policies differ among colleges. Check with your prospective school to find out which version is accepted.) The first version has approximately 90 multiple-choice questions, each with five possible answer choices, to be answered in 90 minutes. The second version has one section with approximately 50 multiple-choice questions, each with five answer choices, and a second section with one essay. The student has 45 minutes to complete each of the two sections. The approximate breakdown of topics is as follows: All-Multiple-Choice Version \\"Skills at the Sentence Level (55%)\\" - Sentence boundaries - Economy and clarity of expression - Concord/Agreement: subject-verb; verb tense; pronoun reference, shift, number - Active/passive voice - Diction and idiom - Syntax: parallelism, coordination, subordination, dangling modifiers - Sentence variety \\"Types of Questions Associated with These Skills: \\" * Identifying Sentence Errors: Candidate pinpoints violations of standard conventions of expository writing. * Improving Sentences: Candidate chooses the phrase, clause, or sentence that best conveys a sentence's intended meaning. * Restructuring Sentences: Candidate chooses the phrase that, because it most effectively shifts a sentence's emphasis or improves its clarity, would most likely appear in the new sentence created by the revision. \\"Skills in Context (45%)\\" - Main idea, thesis - Organization of ideas in paragraph or essay form - Relevance of evidence, sufficiency of detail, levels of specificity - Audience and purpose (effect of style, tone, language, or argument) - Logic of argument (inductive, deductive reasoning) - Coherence within and between paragraphs - Rhetorical emphasis, effect - Sustaining tense or point of view - Sentence joining, sentence variety \\"Types of Questions Associated with These Skills: \\" * Revising Work in Progress: Candidate identifies ways to improve an early draft of an essay. * Analyzing Writing: Candidate answers questions about two prose passages written in distinctly different styles and about the strategies used by the author of each passage. Multiple-Choice-with-Essay Version (Two Sections): \\"Section I - Multiple-Choice (50%)\\" - Skills at the Sentence Level (30%) See explanation for all-multiple-choice version. - Skills in Context (20%) See explanation for all-multiple-choice version. \\"Section II - Essay (50%)\\" - Candidate presents a point of view in response to a topic and supports it with a logical argument and appropriate evidence.

The reviews are designed to further students' understanding of the test material. Each review contains a description of what to expect on the examination and a thorough review of the major topics found on the exams. The English composition review is broken down into two areas - English language skills and writing skills. The humanities review is broken down into five areas - literature, visual arts and architecture, philosophy, music and performing arts. The mathematics review is broken down into seven areas - arithmetic, algebra, geometry and trigonometry, sets and logic, real and complex numbers, functions, and probability and statistics. The natural sciences review is broken down into seven areas - biology, chemistry, physics, earth science, geology, astronomy, and meteorology. The social sciences review is broken down into eight areas - political science, sociology, economics, psychology, geography, anthropology, western and world civilization, and United States history. SCORING THE CLEP GENERAL CBTs The CLEP General Examinations are scored on a scale of 200 to 800. This does not apply, however, to the English Composition with Essay Questions Exam. The essays on this exam are scored on a scale of 2 to 8. There is a drill question in the writing skills section of the English Composition review that asks you to write an essay on a given topic. To score your essay, we suggest you give it to two English teachers or professors to grade. Refer to the completed essays in the detailes explanations of answers section of the review for scoring criteria. The completed essays will show you what the judges will be looking for, and the essay score from the English teachers will help you judge your progress. When will I receive my score report? Right after you finish (except for the English Composition essay, which requires human graders and whose score will be mailed to you), the computer will generate a printout of your score report, which the administrator will hand you. If you want your scores reported to a college or other institution, you must fill in the correct code number on your answer sheet at the time you take the examination. Since your scores are kept on file for 20 years, you may also request transcripts from ETS at a later date. STUDYING FOR THE CLEP GENERAL CBTs It is crucial for you to choose the time and place for studying that works best for you. Some students set aside a certain number of hours every morning, while others choose to study at night before going to sleep. Only you can determine when and where your study time will be most effective. But be consistent and use your time wisely. Work out a study routine and stick to it! When you take our practice tests, try to make your testing conditions as much like the actual test as possible. Turn off the television or radio, and sit down at a quiet table or desk free from distraction. Use a timer to ensure that each section is accurately clocked. As you complete each practice test, score it and thoroughly review the explanations for the questions you answered incorrectly; however, do not review too much at one sitting. Concentrate on one problem area at a time by reviewing the question and explanation, and by studying our review until you are confident that you completely understand the material. Keep track of your scores and mark them on the scoring worksheet. By doing so, you will be able to gauge your progress and discover general weaknesses in particular sections. You should carefully study the review sections that cover your areas of difficulty, as this will build your skills in those areas. If you do poorly on a section, do not develop a negative attitude - it only means you need to further review the material. You should carefully study the reviews that cover your areas of difficulty, as this will build your skills in those areas. A negative attitude could prove to be your biggest stumbling block. It is important that you get a good start and that you are positive as you review and study the material. TEST-TAKING TIPS You may never have taken a standardized computer-based test, but it's not hard to learn the things you need to know to be comfortable on test day. Know the format of the CBT. CLEP CBTs are not adaptive but rather fixed-length tests. In a sense, this makes them kin to the familiar pen-and-paper exam in that you have the same flexibility to back and review your work in each section. Moreover, the format hasn't changed a great deal from the paper-and-pencil CLEP. You are likely to see some so-called pretest questions as well, but you won't know which they are and they won't be scored. Use the process of elimination. If you don't immediately see the correct answer among the choices, go down the list and eliminate as many as you can. Confidently casting aside choices will help you isolate the correct response, or at least knock your choices down to just a few strong contenders. This approach has the added benefit of keeping you from getting sidetracked and distracted by what in fact may be just an occasional tricky question. Importantly, your score is based only on the number of questions you answer correctly. Read all of the possible answers. Just because you think you have found the correct response, do not automatically assume that it is the best answer. Read through each choice to be sure that you are not making a mistake by jumping to conclusions. Work quickly and steadily. You will have only 45 minutes to work on an average of 50 questions in each section, so work quickly and steadily to avoid focusing on any one question too long. Taking our practice tests will help you learn to budget your time. Acquaint yourself with the CBT screen. Familiarize yourself with the CLEP CBT screen beforehand by logging onto the College Board Website. Waiting until test day to see what it looks like in the pretest tutorial risks injecting needless anxiety into your testing experience. Be sure that your answer registers before you go to the next item. Look at the screen to see that your mouse-click causes the pointer to darken the proper oval. This takes far less effort than darkening an oval on paper, but don't lull yourself into taking less care! THE DAY OF THE EXAM Preparing to Take the CLEP CBT On the day of the test, you should wake up early (after a decent night's rest, one would hope) and have a good breakfast. Dress comfortably so that you are not distracted by being too hot or too cold while taking the test. Plan to arrive at the test center early. This will allow you to collect your thoughts and relax before the test, and will also spare you the anxiety that comes with being late. No one will be allowed into the test session after the test has begun. Before you set out for the test center, make sure that you have your admission form, Social Security number, and a photo ID with your signature (e.g., driver's license, student identification card, or current alien registration card). The test center administrator will ask you for photo ID when you arrive. After your test center fee is collected and registration is completed, you will be assigned to a computer. You will then key in the standard personal information, including credit card information. Next, you'll take the tutorial. During the Test Finally the exam will be upon you. Here's what to expect: - Since it's built right into the CLEP testing software, an on-screen non-graphing scientific calculator will pop up for the College Mathematics CBT. You should take into account, however, that a calculator is not deemed necessary to answer any of the test's questions. - Scrap paper will be provided to you for all CLEP CBT examinations. - At times your computer may seem to slow down. Don't worry: the built-in timer will not advance until your next question is fully loaded and visible on screen. - Just as you can on a paper-and-pencil test, you'll be able to move freely between questions within a section. - You'll have the option to mark questions and review them. - You may wear a wristwatch to the test center, but it cannot make any noise which could disturb your fellow test-takers. - No computers, dictionaries, textbooks, notebooks, scrap paper, briefcases, or packages will be permitted into the test center; drinking, smoking, and eating are prohibited. You may, however, bring your own nonprogrammable calculator if you're sitting for the CLEP College Mathematics CBT. Consult College Board publications (including the Collegeboard.com website) for details. After the Test Once you have informed the test center administrator that you're done, you will end your session on the computer, which in turn will generate the printout of a score report (except for the English Composition essay, which requires human graders and whose score will be mailed to you) that the administrator will hand you. Then, go home and relax - you deserve it!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Fhf21I1Gc1sC&dq=CLEP+Geology+(College+Level+Exam+Ser.+:+Clep-15)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oldtown Folks","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NekRAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","description":" The Queen of paranormal romance.

Burton Peretti argues persuasively that this distinctive American music has been a key thread in the tapestry of the nation's culture. The music itself, its players and its audience, and the critical debates it has prompted, tell us much about changes in American life since 1910. Mr. Peretti traces the emergence of jazz out of ragtime during a time of tumultuous growth of cites and industries. In the 1920s jazz flourished and symbolized the cultural struggle between modernists and traditionalists. As American sought reassurance and self-esteem during the Great Depression, jazz reached new levels of sophistication in the Swing Era. World War II encouraged rapid changes in popular tastes, and in the postwar decades jazz became both a voice of a globally dominant America and an avant-garde music reflecting social and political turmoil. Today, Mr. Peretti concludes, jazz symbolizes important cultural trends and enjoys a new prestige in a complex musical scene. Jazz in American Culture tells a peculiarly American story, evaluating the music as well as those who created it, and opening new perspectives on our cultural history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4Qh1AQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of the Jesuits: their origin, progress, doctrines, and designs (Bohn's illustrated library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FNL0ngEACAAJ&dq=History+of+the+Jesuits:+their+origin,+progress,+doctrines,+and+designs+(Bohn%27s+illustrated+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Boston cooking-school cook book,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1H8EAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Is Your Thyroid Making You Fat?

In Songs of a Housewife, we hear the voice of an emerging feminist, a voice that stubbornly and--given the political climate of the 1920s--courageously insists that women be respected. Fans of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings will be surprised and ultimately delighted by this long overdue collection.\\"--Connie May Fowler, author of Sugar Cage and Before Women Had Wings \\"Makes available for the first time [the] early work of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings. . . . Reveals themes, attitudes, phrases, habits of speech . . . and a predilection for irony that characterizes [her] later work.\\"--Peggy W. Prenshaw, Louisiana State University \\"Rawlings's poetry is surprisingly good. . . . solid, traditional poetry about subjects that will never go out of fashion.\\"--Joel Myerson, University of South Carolina More than a decade before writing The Yearling and Cross Creek, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings was a young housewife-journalist living in Rochester, New York. In 1926, the Rochester Times-Union did a trial run of her column-in-verse, Songs of a Housewife. To the editor's surprise, the column proved immensely popular; over the next two years, Rawlings published a poem a day, six days a week, and gained a wide syndication. When she moved to Florida in 1928, however, the poems were forgotten and--until this collection of roughly half of them--never reprinted. In the 250 poems collected here, Rawlings presents homespun advice on such subjects as the trials and tribulations of being a cook, mother, friend, relative, and neighbor. She dedicates many to her favorite subjects: gardening, cooking, pets, and nature. Throughout, her goal is to entertain, to educate, and to give a voice to the housewife who sees her role as a creative and important one. In the process, of course, she also invariably reveals a great deal about herself, and devoted readers will be curious to see how the Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings they know and love is evident here, in these early and spirited poems. Because little is known about Rawlings's life during this period, Songs of a Housewife is valuable as commentary on her evolving attitudes as a woman and as a writer, and many of the same themes appear in her later works. As a reflection of the life of a middle-class woman struggling to carve out an independent and fulfilling role for herself, these poems also offer a rare insight into the life of women in the late 1920s. Rodger L. Tarr is University Distinguished Professor of English at Illinois State University. His most recent publications are Short Stories of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings (UPF, 1994) and Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings: A Descriptive Bibliography (1996).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QypmQgAACAAJ&dq=Poems+by+Marjorie+Kinnan+Rawlings:+Songs+of+a+Housewife&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Forbidden Flowers: More Women's Sexual Fantasies","description":"Since the 1968 publication of Nancy Friday's outspoken erotic masterpiece, My Secret Garden, women's sexual lives have undergone a revolution - and so have their fantasy lives.

Deeply influential and wonderfully productive, he is remembered for dozens of masterworks, from The Firebird and The Rite of Spring to The Rake's Progress, but no dependable biography of him exists. Previous studies have relied too heavily on his own unreliable memoirs and conversations, and until now no biographer has possessed both the musical knowledge to evaluate his art and the linguistic proficiency needed to explore the documentary background of his life--a life whose span extended from tsarist Russia to Switzerland, France, and ultimately the United States. In this revealing volume, the first of two, Stephen Walsh follows Stravinsky from his birth in 1882 to 1934. He traces the composer's early Russian years in new and fascinating detail, laying bare the complicated relationships within his family and showing how he first displayed his extraordinary talents within the provincial musical circle around his teacher, Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov. Stravinsky's brilliantly creative involvement with the Ballets Russes is illuminated by a sharp sense of the internal artistic politics that animated the group. Portraying Stravinsky's circumstances as an  migr  in France trying to make his living as a conductor and pianist as well as a composer while beset by emotional and financial demands, Walsh reveals the true roots of his notorious obsession with money during the 1920s and describes with sympathy the nature of his long affair with Vera Sudeykina. While always respecting Stravinsky's own insistence that life and art be kept distinct, Stravinsky makes clear precisely how the development of his music was connected to his life and to the intellectual environment in which he found himself. But at the same time it demonstrates the composer's remarkably pragmatic psychology, which led him to consider the welfare of his art to be of paramount importance, before which everything else had to give way. Hence, for example, his questionable attitude toward Hitler and Mussolini, and his reputation as a touchy, unpredictable man as famous for his enmities as for his friendships. Stephen Walsh, long established as an expert on Stravinsky's music, has drawn upon a vast array of material, much of it unpublished or unavailable in English, to bring the man himself, in all his color and genius, to glowing life. Written with elegance and energy, comprehensive, balanced, and original, Stravinsky is essential reading for anyone interested in the adventure of art in our time. Praise from the British press for Stephen Walsh's The Music of Stravinsky \\"One of the finest general studies of the composer.\\" --Wilfrid Mellers, composer, Times Literary Supplement \\"The beautiful prose of The Music of Stravinsky is itself a fund of arresting images. For those who already love Stravinsky's music, Walsh's essays on each work will bring a smile of recognition and joy at new kernels of insight. For those unfamiliar with many of the works he discusses, Walsh's commentaries are likely to whet appetites for performances of the works.\\" --John Shepherd, Notes \\"This book sent me scurrying back to the scores and made me want to recommend it to other people. Above all, it is a good read.\\" --Anthony Pople, Music and Letters","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XlzrDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Revenge on Rairarubia","description":"Molly Doogan and her best friend, Netty Parmet, must once again return to Rairarubia, this time to rush back a mysterious giant bird egg before it hatches in Molly's room.

Thirty-nine Texas writers offered up a favorite concoction, and their reflections about the recipe's genesis and meaning give revealing glimpses of their personalities and writing styles. Not a traditional cookbook in the Betty Crocker sense, Stirring Prose is distinctively personal. Billy Porterfield reveals his fantasies about a voluptuous restaurant owner and a dream-enhanced recipe for game hen fricassee with a French New Guinea twist. Sunny Nash gives an enticing snapshot of her grandmother. Bigmama, and divulges the secret to beautiful skin with Bigmama's Mysterious Rose Water Splash.

Case by case histories of banned films punctuate a detailed account of the evolution of the Australian Film Classification system and the concurrent development of the Australian adult XXX industry, culminating in the establishment of the Australian Sex Party. Former SAR Research Fellow at Australia s National Film & Sound Archive Robert Cettl gained exclusive access to both the national collection and the highly restricted Australian adult industry archive, the Eros Collection, at the Flinders University of South Australia Library to piece together the complete history of film censorship in Australia. Progressing through individual banned and censored films  including works by such internationally renowned directors as Hitchcock, Whale, Bunuel, Forman, Godard, Oshima, Pasolini, Hopper, Lyne, Breillat, Noe, Brass, Bertolucci, Fellini, Ford, Clark, Despentes, Winterbottom, Von Trier  Cettl maps out the specification of  offensive  material in parallel to the emergence of Australia s adult XXX industry and the Christian morals-driven pressure groups that advocate tighter censorship restrictions. In a country that has the dubious honor of being the most censorial of Western democracies, film censorship is based on the principle of  offense to a reasonable adult , an undefined refrain that religious minorities have used to manipulate censorship decisions in their favor. The history of these groups and the political support for their right-wing Christian agenda  driven by what Australians term  Wowserism   makes Australian film censorship unique in its delineation of :the  aesthetics of offense  as grounds for the suppression of free dissemination, to the point of seeking mandatory ISP Internet filtering and Internet blacklisting of all material classified RC (or  refused classification ), much of which is available for dissemination throughout Europe and the USA, in violation of UN Human Rights Article 19. In this comprehensive study of the socio-political ideology surrounding the censorship of primarily sexually explicit material ( pornography ), Cettl delineates the aesthetic construction of  offense  as a transgressive genre and charts the morality-driven religiosity behind their construction as Other to a civilized society, questioning whether the categorization of such material as other makes of it legitimate discourse. With extensive case histories, never-before-published government censorship reports, press clippings and secret internal memos between some of Australia s most powerful and influential politicians, Offensive to a Reasonable Adult exposes the quagmire of Australian censorship law and the morals-cabal of  wowsers  that dominate the censorship agenda in the so-called  Clever Country .","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QPQAgMM79bcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paul Klee notebooks (Documents of modern art)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j3SOvgEACAAJ&dq=Paul+Klee+notebooks+(Documents+of+modern+art)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Beaulieu Encyclopedia of the Automobile: Coachbuilding","description":"First published in 2002.

Ellen McCarthy has explored the complete journey of our timeless quest for  The One,  the Soul Mate, the Real Thing. This indispensable collection of insights on dating, commitment, breakups, weddings, and marriage gives us a window into enduring romance: ? Go Online Already  It s a major time suck and a black hole of rejection and ambiguity and lies. But you know what? It also works.  ? Keep It Confidential  If you have to get something off your chest, pick someone whose wisdom you really trust, and who isn t likely to spread the gossip to all your mutual acquaintances.  ? Be Nice  Brewing the morning coffee, touching the small of your partner s back, filling their car with gas. These things add up to more relationship satisfaction than a fancy dinner on Valentine s Day ever could.  The Real Thing features many more nuggets of wisdom, valuable information from the latest studies on commitment, candid testimonials from a variety of couples, and the personal story of McCarthy s own search for  the keeper  which begins, ironically, with a breakup the very same day she started as the Post s full-time weddings reporter. Whether you re looking for love or looking to strengthen your relationship, this book is a wonderful and clear-eyed map to the human heart. Praise for The Real Thing  A wise and compassionate look at how we love, along with some gentle suggestions for how we could get a little better at it . . . McCarthy has done something rare: She has written an optimistic book about love that is clear-eyed and unsentimental.  The Washington Post  What a charming and captivating book this is! We never stop learning about love, and so many great lessons are within these pages.  Elizabeth Gilbert, author of Eat, Pray, Love  My readers often say to me,  If we lived next door to each other, we'd be best friends.  That is precisely what I wanted to say to smart, funny, self-effacing Ellen McCarthy after I finished reading The Real Thing. I loved every lesson laid out in a book that wouldn t dare to call itself a field guide to marriage but amounts to as much on every page. This is a deeply useful little book.  Kelly Corrigan, author of Glitter and Glue  Upbeat and sweet . . . This rich collection of stories charms and edifies, is filled with quotes from couples as well as experts in the field, and serves as not just stories to sigh over but lessons to apply.  Booklist (starred review)  A fun read full of wonderful stories . . . McCarthy delivers a welcome combination of cynicism and poignancy in this account, which reads with the ease and accessibility of a self-help book.  Library Journal  A comforting, realistic, and endearing portrait of modern relationships . . . This book will not only charm those in decades-old marriages, but also inspire those afraid love will never arrive for them.

Her work commanded admiration for her fluid and suggestive modeling, graceful lines, and sculptural form. In 1904 Bessie Potter Vonnoh won the gold medal for sculpture at the St. Louis World s Fair for bronzes of contemporary American women and children that delighted all who saw them. Although Vonnoh s work is represented today in museums throughout the United States, Bessie Potter Vonnoh: Sculptor of Women provides for the first time an intimate and engaging encounter with one of the most widely respected sculptors of her day. Julie Aronson explores how, by concentrating on sculpture for domestic settings that expertly combined naturalism with elegance, Vonnoh negotiated a male-dominated field to create a pathway to professional success and made high-quality sculpture accessible to a wider audience. In an essay that examines Vonnoh s relationship with her foundries and scrutinizes bronze castings, Janis Conner demystifies baffling issues of authenticity and quality in turn-of-the-century bronzes. This copiously illustrated book, indispensable for all sculpture enthusiasts, accompanies the first exhibition since 1930 dedicated to the art of Bessie Potter Vonnoh.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WQxH-SiOJooC&dq=Our+Bessie+(1897+According+to+Inscription+on+First+Page)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shelter","description":"Mickey Bolitar is forced to live with his Uncle Myron and switch high schools, where he finds both friends and enemies, but when his girlfriend vanishes, he follows her trail into an underworld that reveals she is not what she seems to be.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aJMsEAAAQBAJ&dq=Shelter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood Angels: Deus Sanguinius (Warhammer 40,000)","description":"Retreating following an ignominious defeat, the Space Marines are given reinforcements from a new army led by the legendary primarch, Sanguinius, a fierce warrior who has supposedly been dead for centuries.

John Shoptaw heightens those pleasures by discovering the inner and outer workings of this incomparable poet. In readings attuned to the textual, sexual, and historical specificities of Ashbery's poetic project, from Some Trees through the vast summation of Flow Chart, Shoptaw introduces readers to the poet's processes of production. The first reader with full access to Ashbery's manuscripts and source materials, he is able to reveal the poet at work. He shows us, for instance, how Ashbery built \\"Europe\\" and \\"The Skaters\\" upon children's books picked up at a Paris quai and how he drew on his own unpublished lyrics for the long dialogue \\"Fantasia on The Nut-Brown Maid.\\" Shoptaw argues that Ashbery's poems are less self-referential or nonrepresentational than misrepresentative: fractious assemblies of odd details, cryptic substitutions, and artful and artless discourses. He traces Ashbery's misrepresentative poetics to diverse sources--Walt Whitman, Raymond Roussel, W. H. Auden, Gertrude Stein, Elizabeth Bishop, Jackson Pollock, and Elliott Carter, among others. Ashbery's poetry, as Shoptaw demonstrates, is inevitably \\"homotextual\\" while refraining from taking homosexuality as a topic. Ashbery disorients his poems with unexpected silences, lapses or wrong turns in arguments, mock confessions, and sudden abstractions. As this book reveals, Ashbery's misrepresentations yield a richer and stranger representation of ordinary experience. Ashbery takes his paradoxical stand on the outside looking out of an American culture and history we recognize as our own.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Dj5aAAAAMAAJ&dq=On+the+Outside+Looking+Out:+John+Ashbery%27s+Poetry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mechwarrior: Dark Age #12: Hunters of the Deep (A BattleTech Novel)","description":"After his victory at New Aragon, Duke Aaron Sandoval has the embattled Republic in his debt.

A college track star and budding entomologist, Nnedi s lifelong battle with scoliosis was just a bump in her plan something a simple operation would easily correct. But when Nnedi wakes from the surgery to find she can t move her legs, her entire sense of self begins to waver. Confined to a hospital bed for months, unusual things begin to happen. Psychedelic bugs crawl her hospital walls; strange dreams visit her nightly. Nnedi begins to put these experiences into writing, conjuring up strange, fantastical stories. What Nnedi discovers during her confinement would prove to be the key to her life as a successful science fiction author: In science fiction, when something breaks, something greater often emerges from the cracks. In Broken Places & Outer Spaces, Nnedi takes the reader on a journey from her hospital bed deep into her memories, from her painful first experiences with racism as a child in Chicago to her powerful visits to her parents  hometown in Nigeria. From Frida Kahlo to Mary Shelly, she examines great artists and writers who have pushed through their limitations, using hardship to fuel their work.

In Cityscapes of New Orleans, Campanella a historical geographer and professor at Tulane University reveals the why behind the where, delving into the historical and cultural forces that have shaped the spaces of New Orleans for over three centuries. For Campanella, every bewildering street grid and linguistic quirk has a story to tell about the landscape of Louisiana and the geography of its bestknown city. Cityscapes of New Orleans starts with an examination of neighborhoods, from the origins of faubourgs and wards to the impact of the slave trade on patterns of residence. Campanella explains how fragments of New Orleans streets continue to elude Google Maps and why humble Creole cottages sit alongside massive Greek Revival mansions. He considers the roles of modern urban planning, environmentalism, and preservation, all of which continue to influence the layout of the city and its suburbs. In the book s final section, Campanella explores the impact of natural disasters as well-known as Hurricane Katrina and as unfamiliar as  Sauv  s Crevasse,  an 1849 levee break that flooded over two hundred city blocks. Cityscapes of New Orleans offers a wealth of perspectives for uninitiated visitors and transplanted citizens still confounded by terms like  neutral ground,  as well as native-born New Orleanians trying to understand the Canal Street Sinkhole.

This is the only book available that addresses the particular needs of anorexics with the techniques of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), a revolutionary new psychotherapy. The authors of this book are pioneering researchers in the field of ACT, with numerous research articles to their credit Despite ever-widening media attention and public awareness of the problem, American women continue to suffer from anorexia nervosa in greater numbers than ever before. This severe psychophysiological condition-characterized by an abnormal fear of becoming obese, a persistent unwillingness to eat, and severe compulsion to lose weight-is particularly difficult to treat, often because the victims are unwilling to seek help. The Anorexia Workbook demonstrates that efforts to control and stop anorexia may do more harm than good. Instead of focusing efforts on judging impulses associated with the disorder as 'bad' or 'negative,' this approach encourages sufferers to mindfully observe these feelings without reacting to them in a self-destructive way. Guided by this more compassionate, more receptive frame of mind, the book coaches you to employ various acceptance-based coping strategies. Structured in a logical, step-by-step progression of exercises, the workbook first focuses on providing you with a new understanding of anorexia and the ways you might have already tried to control the problem. Then the book progresses through techniques that teach how to use mindfulness to deal with out-of-control thoughts and feelings, how to identify choices that lead to better heath and quality of life, and how to redirect the energy formerly spent on weight loss into actions that will heal the body and mind. Although this book is written specifically as self-help for anorexia sufferers, it includes a clear and informative chapter on when you need to seek professional treatment as well as advice on what to look for in a therapist.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eYo9WLycgc8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Penguin Book of Curious and Interesting Mathematics (Penguin Mathematics)","description":"Provides information on numbers and what makes particular ones noteworthy","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kQRPkTkk_VIC&dq=The+Penguin+Book+of+Curious+and+Interesting+Mathematics+(Penguin+Mathematics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Doctor Diablo","description":"Doctor Diablo is a wealthy, arrogant, self-involved genius and San Franciscos greatest Master Criminal.

In this book, Money explores the history of gender differentiation and its impact on contemporary, postmodern social constructionist explanations of male and female. He argues that the nature vs nurture dichotomy should be abandoned in favour of a paradigm of nature/critical period/nurture. The book further discusses how some gender differences are phylogenetically shared by all people and others are ontologically unique to an individual.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pUXqDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Child life in colonial days,","description":"An intriguing look at every aspect of children's life in the new republic.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AJAAAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flight Plan to the Flight Deck: Strategies for a Pilot Career","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Word power made easy: The complete three-week vocabulary builder","description":"The most effective vocabulary builder in the English language provides a simple, step-by-step method that will increase your knowledge and mastery of written and spoken English.

Small had agreed to testify before the state legislature about gang violence inside Arizona State Prison and was murdered the day before his scheduled appearance. This murder proved the catalyst for an all-out war between the State of Arizona and the Aryan Brotherhood. Through five trials, Farmer claimed self-defense and the jurors acquitted all ten of his co-conspirators. Thornton Price, one of the defense attorneys, now tells how Farmer and Small became cannon fodder in this war to reclaim Arizona?s prisons from rival gangs. These gangs?the Aryan Brotherhood, the Mau Maus, and the Mexican Mafia?were suspected of committing more than a dozen murders over the previous two years, motivating politicians to crack down after the violence could no longer be ignored or contained. To reconstruct the case, Price reviewed 16,000 pages of court records and conducted interviews with key participants to piece together an insider?s account of the crime and the politics behind its investigation. Prison murders should be easy to solve, but investigators quickly learned that the convicts? code of silence makes these cases often impossible to win in court. Price focuses on the special problems posed by prison crime by getting inside the skins of men like murderer Terry \\"Crazy\\" Farmer and William \\"Red Dog\\" Howard, one of the Florence Eleven and a founder of the Aryan Brotherhood. He also presents the perspectives of state investigators and reveals how they calculated to pit black witnesses against white killers until one black would break the code of silence and provoke feuding within the Brotherhood. Murder Unpunished tells how society?s most outrageous criminals ran the prison through gang violence as outside the walls Arizona struggled to outgrow its Wild West past. Like few other books, it reveals how prisons incubate predatory criminals and gangs, and it exposes the unique difficulties of prosecuting prison crimes. It is a gripping account that cuts to the heart of our penal system and a cautionary tale for citizens who prefer to keep prisons out of sight, out of mind.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I9-_Q-tSFEcC&dq=Murder+Unpunished:+How+the+Aryan+Brotherhood+Murdered+Waymond+Small+and+Got+Away+with+It&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wombat divine","description":"Wombat auditions for the Nativity play, but has trouble finding the right part.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZPSStqfy8AAC&dq=Wombat+divine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sword of the White Rose","description":"Inheriting the lordship of the Ciorram Clan upon the death of his father, Dylan, Ciaran Matheson is warned by an old friend, the fairie Sinnan, that the planned Scottish uprising against the British is destined to fail and confronts a difficult--and dangerous--choice.

As the murder leads to more grisly slayings and the team of veteran Roman cops clash with the Americans, Nic is pulled into a harrowing search for the truth...a search that will take him into a shocking conspiracy  and a dark episode in a nation's long-forgotten past.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Da5SDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fundmentals of Pediatric Orthopedics","description":"Ideal for anyone involved in the care of children with musculoskeletal problems, this best-selling resource has been completely updated to be even more relevant to your everyday practice.

The technical protection systems are covered, of course. But 30 years of alpine climbing experience has convinced the authors that mastery - and safety - lie in the far more difficult task of knowing exactly which techniques to use, where and when. Therefore, they teach step-by-step decision-making skills, providing scenarios, checklists, and self-posed questions to inform the decision process. Alpine Climbing assumes some prior knowledge, primarily in rock climbing skills and techniques. Basic knots, belaying,rappelling, building rock anchors, leading, placing rock protection, and movement skills on rock: variations of these skills that are of particular value in the alpine environment are addressed in this book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i6H0ESHr3n8C&dq=Climbing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dishonourable Proposal","description":"Top fashion model Lena Lawrence offers herself as a dinner date at a charity auction.

NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY KANSAS CITY STAR AND BLOOMBERG Becket s life story has been often told but never so incisively reexamined and vividly rendered as it is in John Guy s hands. The son of middle-class Norman parents, Becket rose against all odds to become the second most powerful man in England. As King Henry II s chancellor, Becket charmed potentates and popes, tamed overmighty barons, and even personally led knights into battle. After his royal patron elevated him to archbishop of Canterbury in 1162, however, Becket clashed with the King. Forced to choose between fealty to the crown and the values of his faith, he repeatedly challenged Henry s authority to bring the church to heel. Drawing on the full panoply of medieval sources, Guy sheds new light on the relationship between the two men, separates truth from centuries of mythmaking, and casts doubt on the long-held assumption that the headstrong rivals were once close friends. He also provides the fullest accounting yet for Becket s seemingly radical transformation from worldly bureaucrat to devout man of God. Here is a Becket seldom glimpsed in any previous biography, a man of many facets and faces: the skilled warrior as comfortable unhorsing an opponent in single combat as he was negotiating terms of surrender; the canny diplomat  with the appetite of a wolf  who unexpectedly became the spiritual paragon of the English church; and the ascetic rebel who waged a high-stakes contest of wills with one of the most volcanic monarchs of the Middle Ages. Driven into exile, derided by his enemies as an ungrateful upstart, Becket returned to Canterbury in the unlikeliest guise of all: as an avenging angel of God, wielding his power of excommunication like a sword. It is this last apparition, the one for which history remembers him best, that will lead to his martyrdom at the hands of the king s minions a grisly episode that Guy recounts in chilling and dramatic detail. An uncommonly intimate portrait of one of the medieval world s most magnetic figures, Thomas Becket breathes new life into its subject cementing for all time his place as an enduring icon of resistance to the abuse of power.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ESc8jNHbMz4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Commentaries on the Laws of England","description":"Blackstone, Sir William [1723-1780].

After six Hollywood movies and twenty-five years of nonstop television presence, Star Trek is, indeed, a pervasive cultural phenomenon! This is the first critical, scholarly look at the mysteries, hidden meanings, and complex issues of the text known as Star Trek. Looking at the original Spock-Kirk Star Trek, the contributors ask and answer questions such as: What are the cultural conditions surrounding the homoerotic relationship between Kirk and Spock? How does the show depict gender relations while simultaneously recreating the cultural conditions under which women continue to experience sexual aggression and violence? They also explore Star Trek: The Next Generation, raising issues such as: Was Data a battlefield on which the struggle for human rights was waged? Did militarism and warring versions of masculinity intersect at Worf?Readers will discover the unique charges of cultural studies scholarship and how it enables us to designate a powerful pop-cultural phenomenon such as Star Trek into a legitimate site of study. The thirteen essayists address the very real and necessary topics of hegemony, utopias, militarism, colonialism, gender, violence, race, class, sexuality, and liminality, analyzing individual episodes and overarching themes of Star Trek and Star Trek: The Next Generation. Their insights on how Star Trek affects what we understand our culture to be, how it represents the social and political order, and how it reproduces pleasure and pain in its televisual texts, will fascinate scholars, students, and Trekkers alike.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BISFAAAAIAAJ&dq=Enterprise+Zones:+Critical+Positions+(Film+Studies+(Boulder,+Colo.).)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Carrie Underwood (Blue Banner Biographies)","description":"Highlights the life of the winner of the fourth \\"American Idol\\" singing competition and her struggle for success.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3eTWAAAACAAJ&dq=Carrie+Underwood+(Blue+Banner+Biographies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mechwarrior: Dark Age #11: Blood of the Isle (A BattleTech Novel)","description":"After his victory at New Aragon, Duke Aaron Sandoval has the embattled Republic in his debt.

The analysis covers a broad range of contexts including competition damages and the repayment of charges.The book offers a systematic examination of the key questions facing parties in a passing-on situation: When can downstream claimants bring an action? How can claimants demonstrate sufficient proximity to the original harmful act or unjustified transaction? Will a possibility of passing-on be relevant to the estimation of the award? These questions are assessed for actions against the EU, a Member State and private individuals.Key features of this book include:* specific EU law focus and guidance that will be relevant to lawyers throughout the EU* a multi-faceted analysis of the defence of passing-on and the position of potential claimants downstream in the supply chain* practical suggestions for consistent approaches to passing-on in EU law across existing and future contexts.This timely work will be an invaluable point of reference for practitioners working in damages and restitution law, but also in other fields of commercial law, including competition law and consumer law.

The book explores both the successes and the unresolved questions through feminist archival materials, published narratives of sexual violence, and mass media and internet sources.

IN LITERATURE 2013 The only novel from Alice Munro-award-winning author of The Love of a Good Woman--is an insightful, honest book, \\"autobiographical in form but not in fact,\\" that chronicles a young girl's growing up in rural Ontario in the 1940's. Del Jordan lives out at the end of the Flats Road on her father's fox farm, where her most frequent companions are an eccentric bachelor family friend and her rough younger brother. When she begins spending more time in town, she is surrounded by women-her mother, an agnostic, opinionted woman who sells encyclopedias to local farmers; her mother's boarder, the lusty Fern Dogherty; and her best friend, Naomi, with whom she shares the frustrations and unbridled glee of adolescence. Through these unwitting mentors and in her own encounters with sex, birth, and death, Del explores the dark and bright sides of womanhood. All along she remains a wise, witty observer and recorder of truths in small-town life. The result is a powerful, moving, and humorous demonstration of Alice Munro's unparalleled awareness of the lives of girls and women.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zoY_pMA6ea0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bringing the Heat","description":" An ambitious, remarkably frank  chronicle of the Philadelphia Eagles  bid for the NFL championship by the #1 New York Timesbestselling author (Kirkus Reviews). In 1992, the Philadelphia Eagles a team assembled in the image of their iconoclastic, controversial former head coach, Buddy Ryan were known for their ferocious defense led by Reggie White, Seth Joyner, and Andre Waters, and for the otherworldly talents of quarterback Randall Cunningham. Now was the time for the Eagles  campaign for the championship. But as the season progressed, it disintegrated into an ugly flurry of greed, racism, violence, personal and professional feuds, one tragic death, and a very wild face-off in the stands between a player s wife and mistress. By midseason, the sentiment of both fans and press was the same:  shut up and play.  Told through the personal stories of the teammates themselves, as well as the coaches, managers and owner, Bringing the Heat spares nothing and no one in  a phenomenal feat of reportage, perfect for football fans coast to coast  (H. G. Bissinger, author of Friday Night Lights).  Overflows with stories of pro football dreams, of bravery in the face of injury. Yet it also unflinchingly tells of the darker side of life in the NFL: uncontrollable egos, ruined families, marital infidelity.   The New York Times Book Review  There are now four mandatory books on football: Dan Jenkins s Semi-Tough; George Plimpton s Paper Lion; H. G. Bissinger s Friday Night Lights, and the hilarious, incorrigible son of them all, Mark Bowden s Bringing the Heat.

Moreover, most engineers are well versed in either traditional control or in fuzzy control-rarely both. Each has applications for which it is better suited, but without a good understanding of both, engineers cannot make a sound determination of which technique to use for a given situation. A First Course in Fuzzy and Neural Control is designed to build the foundation needed to make those decisions. It begins with an introduction to standard control theory, then makes a smooth transition to complex problems that require innovative fuzzy, neural, and fuzzy-neural techniques. For each method, the authors clearly answer the questions: What is this new control method? Why is it needed? How is it implemented? Real-world examples, exercises, and ideas for student projects reinforce the concepts presented. Developed from lecture notes for a highly successful course titled The Fundamentals of Soft Computing, the text is written in the same reader-friendly style as the authors' popular A First Course in Fuzzy Logic text. A First Course in Fuzzy and Neural Control requires only a basic background in mathematics and engineering and does not overwhelm students with unnecessary material but serves to motivate them toward more advanced studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fJ3qngEACAAJ&dq=A+First+Course+in+Fuzzy+and+Neural+Control&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Representative Men; Seven Lectures","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ayY5AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When the Cheering Stopped: The Last Years of Woodrow Wilson","description":"The poignant true story of an American president struck by tragedy at the height of his glory. This New York Times bestseller vividly chronicles the stunning decline in Woodrow Wilson s fortunes after World War I and draws back the curtain on one of the strangest episodes in the history of the American presidency. Author Gene Smith brilliantly captures the drama and excitement of Wilson s efforts at the Paris Peace Conference to forge a lasting concord between enemies, and his remarkable coast-to-coast tour to sway national opinion in favor of the League of Nations. During this grueling jaunt across 8,000 miles in less than a month, Wilson suffered a debilitating stroke that left him an invalid and a recluse, shrouding his final years in office in shadow and mystery. In graceful and dramatic prose, Smith portrays a White House mired in secrets, with a commander in chief kept behind closed doors, unseen by anyone except his doctor and his devoted second wife, Edith Galt Wilson, a woman of strong will with less than an elementary school education who, for all intents and purposes, led the government of the most powerful nation in the world for two years. When the Cheering Stopped is a gripping true story of duty, courage, and deceit, and an unforgettable portrait of a visionary leader whose valiant struggle and tragic fall changed the course of world history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Mbm_DAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The evolution of man scientifically disproved in 50 arguments","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BbwDMQAACAAJ&dq=The+evolution+of+man+scientifically+disproved+in+50+arguments&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Realm of Light (The Ruby Throne Trilogy, Book 3)","description":"In this stunning conclusion to the Ruby Throne trilogy, the death of Emperor Kostimon has unleashed the dark gods upon the kingdom of Imperia--and only the Lady Elandra and the warrior Caelan have the power to save their land and people.

Ice-T rose to fame in the late 1980s, earning acclaim for his music before going on to capture television audiences as Odafin  Fin  Tutuola in Law & Order: Special Victims Unit?. But it could have gone much differently. In this gripping and candid memoir, Ice-T and Spike, his former crime partner collaborating with New York Times bestselling author Douglas Century relate the shocking stories of their shared pasts, and how just a handful of decisions led to their incredibly different lives. Both grew up in violent, gang-controlled Los Angeles neighborhoods and worked together to orchestrate a series of jewelry heists in LA and across the US. But while Ice-T was discovered rapping in a club and got his first record deal, Spike was caught for a jewel robbery and did three years in prison. As his music career began to take off, Ice made the decision to leave the criminal life; Spike continued to plan increasingly ingenious and risky jewel heists. And in 1992, after one of Spike s robberies ended tragically, he was sentenced to thirty-five years to life. While he sat behind bars, he watched his former partner rise to fame in music, movies, and television. Harrowing, timely, and thoughtful, two men with two very different lives reveal how their paths might have very well been reversed if they made different choices.

As part of Seattle's Densho: Japanese American Legacy Project, the authors collected interviews and survey data from Japanese Americans now living in King County, Washington, who were imprisoned during World War II. Their clear-eyed, often poignant account presents the contemporary, post-redress perspectives of former incarcerees on their experiences and the consequences for their life course. Using descriptive material that personalizes and contextualizes the data, the authors show how prewar socioeconomic networks and the specific characteristics of the incarceration experience affected Japanese American readjustment in the postwar era. Topics explored include the effects of incarceration and resettlement on social relationships and community structure, educational and occupational trajectories, marriage and childbearing, and military service and draft resistance. The consequences of initial resettlement location and religious orientation are also examined.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_Be0iuNVd04C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"John Deere Tractor Data Book: Two-Cylinder Models Through 1960","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=54o0PcAwh9EC&dq=John+Deere+Tractor+Data+Book:+Two-Cylinder+Models+Through+1960&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What About Bill Gates?","description":"From the author of the #1 New York Times best-selling How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The COVID-19 pandemic isn t over, but even as governments around the world strive to put it behind us, they re also starting to talk about what happens next.

A thousand miles northwest of Lake Superior are great free rivers, lakes whose horizons disappear, countless unnamed waterways, and ridges and forested valleys still largely unknown.  Into this land of Crees, Chippewyans, Yellow Knives, and Dig Rib Indians had once come the voyageur, the Hudson Bay trader, and a succession of adventurers gentlemen and otherwise who used the mighty Churchill River as a major waterway from Hudson Bay to the Mackenzie.  It was the trail of these voyageurs we followed,  says the author,  a trail that led from the height of land where waters flow north to the Arctic and east to Hudson Bay, to Cumberland House five hundred miles away. Every portage, camp site, and rapids, every mile of this waterway of lakes and rivers was steeped in the drama of exploration and trade.   We traveled as the voyageurs did by canoe, paddled the same lakes, ran the same rapids, and packed over their ancient portages. We knew the winds and storms, saw the same sky lines, and felt the awe and wonderment that was theirs at the enormous expanses and grandeur of a land that was once as strange and challenging to them as to us.  Mr. Olson has illuminated his own cruise with quotations from journals and diaries of such men as George Simpson, David Thompson, Alexander Henry, and Alexander Mackenzie as well as a host of other explorers-traders whose voices speak from the old Moose Fort Journals of the Hudson s Bay Company. Mr. Olson serves as the Bourgeois of the party of six the boss who ran the trip, chose the routes, picked the camp sites. His companions and he relived for all readers of this book what life was then in the wilds of the Canadian Northwest. Mr. Olson combines his inimitable ability to evoke the beauties and wonders of the wilderness its animals, birds, and its very spirit with a dramatic talent for taking the reader along the route of the men who pioneered that wilderness. Francis Lee Jacques, whose genius to evoke the wilderness in pen and ink is unchallenged, has illuminated this book by his drawings, as he did The Singing Wilderness and Listening Point.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WnIMJOcbpwAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Emperor of Kings: A Novel (Napoleon series) (No. 3)","description":"The first of a quartet of novels chronicling Napoleon's life, The Song of Departure, takes us from his birth in Corsica in 1769, through marriage to Josephine Beauharnais, to the triumph of the Italian campaign, and the failure of the Egyptian, to end with the coup of 18 Brumaire 1799 and Bonaparte's election as Consul.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rWxDPgAACAAJ&dq=The+Emperor+of+Kings:+A+Novel+(Napoleon+series)+(No.+3)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Illustrated Guide to Everything Sold in Hardware Stores and Garden Centers","description":"How many types of screwdrivers are there?

He has a purpose, but no one can fathom it, for the bodies are discovered in different states. Clarice Starling, a young trainee at the FBI Academy, is surprised to be summoned by Jack Crawford, chief of the Bureau's Behavioral Science section. Her assignment: to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter--Hannibal the Cannibal--who is kept under close watch in the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Dr. Lecter is a former psychiatrist with a grisly history, unusual tastes, and an intense curiosity about the darker corners of the mind. His intimate understanding of the killer and of Clarice herself form the core of Thomas Harris' The Silence of the Lambs--and ingenious, masterfully written book and an unforgettable classic of suspense fiction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1d3XWXXxnEsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Introduction to Neural Networks","description":"Though mathematical ideas underpin the study of neural networks, the author presents the fundamentals without the full mathematical apparatus.

The first edition of this work was in 1971. In the intervening years a number of books and articles have appeared which deal directly, or indirectly, with the subject of poverty in the early modern period, and the bibliography, in consequence, has been almost doubled. Some additional material (numbered from 78 onwards) and changes in emphasis have been incorporated into the text, and the Norwich material, in particular, has been revised and extended in the light of the author s own more recent research.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=V80FBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elements of Operator Theory","description":"{\\\\it Elements of Operatory Theory} is aimed at graduate students as well as a new generation of mathematicians and scientists who need to apply operator theory to their field. Written in a user-friendly, motivating style, fundamental topics are presented in a systematic fashion, i.e., set theory, algebraic structures, topological structures, Banach spaces, Hilbert spaces, culminating with the Spectral Theorem, one of the landmarks in the theory of operators on Hilbert spaces. The exposition is concept-driven and as much as possible avoids the formula-computational approach. Key features of this largely self-contained work include: * required background material to each chapter * fully rigorous proofs, over 300 of them, are specially tailored to the presentation and some are new * more than 100 examples and, in several cases, interesting counterexamples that demonstrate the frontiers of an important theorem * over 300 problems, many with hints * both problems and examples underscore further auxiliary results and extensions of the main theory; in this non-traditional framework, the reader is challenged and has a chance to prove the principal theorems anew This work is an excellent text for the classroom as well as a self-study resource for researchers. Prerequisites include an introduction to analysis and to functions of a complex variable, which most first-year graduate students in mathematics, engineering, or another formal science have already acquired. Measure theory and integration theory are required only for the last section of the final chapter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0ijlBwAAQBAJ&dq=Elements+of+Operator+Theory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rapid Review Microbiology and Immunology","description":"Rev. ed. of: Microbiology and immunology / Ken S.

William Hope Hodgson was, like his contemporaries Algernon Blackwood and Arthur Machen, one of the most important, prolific, and influential fantasists of the early twentieth century. His dark and unsettling short stories and novels were shaped in large part by personal experience (a professional merchant mariner for much of his life, many of Hodgson s tales are set at sea), and his work evokes a disturbing sense of the amorphous and horrific unknown. While his nautical adventure fiction was very popular during his lifetime, the supernatural and cosmic horror he is most remembered for only became well known after his death, mainly due to the efforts of writers like H. P. Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith, who often praised his work and cited it as an influence on their own. By the later half of the twentieth century, it was only his weird fiction that remained in print, and his vast catalog of non-supernatural stories was extremely hard to find. Night Shade Books s five-volume series presents all of Hodgson s unique and timeless fiction. Each volume contains one of Hodgson's novels, along with a selection of thematically-linked short fiction, including a number of works reprinted for the first time since their original publication. The first of the five-volume set, The Boats of the \\"Glen Carrig\\" and Other Nautical Adventures, collects all of Hodgson s series nautical fiction, including the Sargasso Sea Story cycle. The Complete Fiction of William Hope Hodgson is published by Night Shade Books in the following volumes: The Boats of the  Glen Carrig  and Other Nautical Adventures The House on the Borderland and Other Mysterious Places The Ghost Pirates and Other Revenants of the Sea The Night Land and Other Romances The Dream of X and Other Fantastic Visions","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BPlZMQAACAAJ&dq=Boats+of+the+%22Glen+Carrig%22+and+Other+Nautical+Adventures+(The+Collected+Fiction+of+William+Hope+Hodgson,+Vol.+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pornograffitti: Extreme II","description":"(Guitar Recorded Versions).

In Red Land, Black Land, she transports us back thousands of years and immerses us in the sights, aromas, and sounds of day-to-day living in the legendary desert realm that was ancient Egypt. Who were these people whose civilization has inspired myriad films, books, artwork, myths, and dreams, and who built astonishing monuments that still stagger the imagination five thousand years later? What did average Egyptians eat, drink, wear, gossip about, and aspire to? What were their amusements, their beliefs, their attitudes concerning religion, childrearing, nudity, premarital sex? Mertz ushers us into their homes, workplaces, temples, and palaces to give us an intimate view of the everyday worlds of the royal and commoner alike. We observe priests and painters, scribes and pyramid builders, slaves, housewives, and queens and receive fascinating tips on how to perform tasks essential to ancient Egyptian living, from mummification to making papyrus. An eye-opening and endlessly entertaining companion volume to Temples, Tombs, and Hieroglyphs, Mertz's extraordinary history of ancient Egypt, Red Land, Black Land offers readers a brilliant display of rich description and fascinating edification.

After decades of confrontation with the West, Argentina has abandoned an intermediate-range ballistic missile project, left the nonaligned movement, thrown in with the United States in the Gulf War, reestablished friendly relations with Britain, and undertaken a course of unilateral disarmament. Escude argues that these changes reflect Argentina's recognition that citizens of poor and vulnerable nations are asked to pay the price of attempts to engage in power politics and that those attempts often endanger the nation's citizens and increase its subordination in world affairs. Moreover, he argues that mainstream international relations theory tends to obscure such processes by dealing with states as if they were individuals whose ultimate priority is \\"survival,\\" or political independence. The state-as-person fiction generalized in I-R discourse obscures the fact that in a democracy the citizens and not the state are paramount. Following this distinction to its logical consequences, Escude undertakes a thorough deconstruction of I-R theory from a \\"citizen-centric\\" perspective - the perspective, he argues, that has inspired the Menem government's dovish foreign policies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5PTGwAEACAAJ&dq=Foreign+Policy+Theory+in+Menem%27s+Argentina&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Close-Up","description":"Welcome to Burning Cove, California where 1930s Hollywood glamour conceals a ruthless killer  Vivian Brazier never thought life as an art photographer would include nightly wake-up calls to snap photos of grisly crime scenes or headshots for aspiring male actors.

The bestselling author of Paris 1919 offers a provocative view of war as an essential component of humanity. NAMED ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW AND THE EAST HAMPTON STAR  Margaret MacMillan has produced another seminal work. . . . She is right that we must, more than ever, think about war. And she has shown us how in this brilliant, elegantly written book.  H.R. McMaster, author of Dereliction of Duty and Battlegrounds: The Fight to Defend the Free World The instinct to fight may be innate in human nature, but war organized violence comes with organized society. War has shaped humanity s history, its social and political institutions, its values and ideas. Our very language, our public spaces, our private memories, and some of our greatest cultural treasures reflect the glory and the misery of war. War is an uncomfortable and challenging subject not least because it brings out both the vilest and the noblest aspects of humanity. Margaret MacMillan looks at the ways in which war has influenced human society and how, in turn, changes in political organization, technology, or ideologies have affected how and why we fight. War: How Conflict Shaped Us explores such much-debated and controversial questions as: When did war first start? Does human nature doom us to fight one another? Why has war been described as the most organized of all human activities? Why are warriors almost always men? Is war ever within our control? Drawing on lessons from wars throughout the past, from classical history to the present day, MacMillan reveals the many faces of war the way it has determined our past, our future, our views of the world, and our very conception of ourselves.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nDvGDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clinical Neuropsychology: A Pocket Handbook for Assessment","description":"This bestselling, comprehensive assessment guide has been thoroughly updated to reflect the latest changes in the rapidly maturing field of clinical neuropsychology.

The editors  introduction argues the virtues of using Pudd nhead Wilson as a teaching text, a case study in many of the issues presently occupying literary criticism: issues of history and the uses of history, of canon formation, of textual problematics, and finally of race, class, and gender. In a variety of ways the essays build arguments out of, not in spite of, the anomalies, inconsistencies, and dead ends in the text itself. Such wrinkles and gaps, the authors find, are the symptoms of an inconclusive, even evasive, but culturally illuminating struggle to confront and resolve difficult questions bearing on race and sex. Such fresh, intellectually enriching perspectives on the novel arise directly from the broad-based interdisciplinary foundations provided by the participating scholars. Drawing on a wide variety of critical methodologies, the essays place the novel in ways that illuminate the world in which it was produced and that further promise to stimulate further study.

As part of Seattle's Densho: Japanese American Legacy Project, the authors collected interviews and survey data from Japanese Americans now living in King County, Washington, who were imprisoned during World War II. Their clear-eyed, often poignant account presents the contemporary, post-redress perspectives of former incarcerees on their experiences and the consequences for their life course. Using descriptive material that personalizes and contextualizes the data, the authors show how prewar socioeconomic networks and the specific characteristics of the incarceration experience affected Japanese American readjustment in the postwar era. Topics explored include the effects of incarceration and resettlement on social relationships and community structure, educational and occupational trajectories, marriage and childbearing, and military service and draft resistance. The consequences of initial resettlement location and religious orientation are also examined.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_Be0iuNVd04C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Donde no hay doctor (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YuFNPgAACAAJ&dq=Donde+no+hay+doctor+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hands-On Electronics: A Practical Introduction to Analog and Digital Circuits","description":"Teaches analog and digital circuit theory by building working circuits.

But street addresses were not invented to help you find your way; they were created to find you. In many parts of the world, your address can reveal your race and class. In this wide-ranging and remarkable book, Deirdre Mask looks at the fate of streets named after Martin Luther King Jr., the wayfinding means of ancient Romans, and how Nazis haunt the streets of modern Germany. The flipside of having an address is not having one, and we also see what that means for millions of people today, including those who live in the slums of Kolkata and on the streets of London.

Landes examines the impact on women of the emergence of a new, bourgeois organization of public life in the eighteenth century. She focuses on France, contrasting the role and representation of women under the Old Regime with their status during and after the Revolution. Basing her work on a wide reading of current historical scholarship, Landes draws on the work of Habermas and his followers, as well as on recent theories of representation, to re-create public-sphere theory from a feminist point of view.Within the extremely personal and patriarchal political culture of Old Regime France, elite women wielded surprising influence and power, both in the court and in salons. Urban women of the artisanal class often worked side by side with men and participated in many public functions. But the Revolution, Landes asserts, relegated women to the home, and created a rigidly gendered, essentially male, bourgeois public sphere. The formal adoption of universal rights actually silenced public women by emphasizing bourgeois conceptions of domestic virtue.In the first part of this book, Landes links the change in women's roles to a shift in systems of cultural representation. Under the absolute monarchy of the Old Regime, political culture was represented by the personalized iconic imagery of the father/king. This imagery gave way in bourgeois thought to a more symbolic system of representation based on speech, writing, and the law. Landes traces this change through the art and writing of the period. Using the works of Rousseau and Montesquieu as examples of the passage to the bourgeois theory of the public sphere, she shows how such concepts as universal reason, law, and nature were rooted in an ideologically sanctioned order of gender difference and separate public and private spheres. In the second part of the book, Landes discusses the discourses on women's rights and on women in society authored by Condorcet, Wollstonecraft, Gouges, Tristan, and Comte within the context of these new definitions of the public sphere. Focusing on the period after the execution of the king, she asks who got to be included as the People when men and women demanded that liberal and republican principles be carried to their logical conclusion. She examines women's roles in the revolutionary process and relates the birth of modern feminism to the silencing of the politically influential women of the Old Regime court and salon and to women's expulsion from public participation during and after the Revolution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0yC12HrhHhIC&dq=Women+and+the+Public+Sphere+in+the+Age+of+the+French+Revolution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flower Power!","description":"Fifth-grade best friends Katie-Rose, Milla, Yasaman and Violet are determined to save a new student from Modessa's evil influence, but Katie-Rose is busy not flirting with Preston and all four are distracted by trying to organize Yasaman's sister's b","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uFxszQEACAAJ&dq=Flower+Power!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FLIGHT OF THE SWAN","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ea4KLgEACAAJ&dq=FLIGHT+OF+THE+SWAN&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Goodbye Ole Miss","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2RMNAAAACAAJ&dq=Goodbye+Ole+Miss&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Saint and Mr. Teal","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8rxFAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Saint+and+Mr.+Teal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mouse and His Child","description":"Acclaimed as one of the classics of 20th century children's literature, The Mouse and His Child is a moving story about two clockwork mice thrown on a scrap heap who then have to begin a dangerous quest for a place to belong.

Using feminist and postcolonial theory this book examines the impact of multiculturalism and globalization on embodiment and community whilst considering the ethical and political implication of its critique for post-colonial feminism. A diverse range of texts are analyzed which produce the figure of 'the stranger', showing that it has alternatively been expelled as the origin of danger - such as in neighbourhood watch, or celebrated as the origin of difference - as in multiculturalism. The author argues that both of these standpoints are problematic as they involve 'stranger fetishism'; they assume that the stranger 'has a life of its own'.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Af0mtGfAv_gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Softquad Hotmetal Pro 6.0 for Microsoft Windows","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IgLeOwAACAAJ&dq=Softquad+Hotmetal+Pro+6.0+for+Microsoft+Windows&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Samuel Johnson Encyclopedia","description":"A comprehensive and fully-indexed guide to Samuel Johnson, covering all aspects of his work, life, and personality.

This small exercise in fighting graffiti grew into the most vibrant public art project in the United States. Led by Golden and dozens of artists, neighborhood residents, and volunteers, the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program has adorned the city with over two thousand murals. In the process, this vibrant art, painted mostly on city walls, helped to change the look of the city, creating an enduring legacy in all of the neighborhoods in which the murals were added. In this lavishly illustrated chronicle of the Mural Arts Program, you will see the murals in all of their beauty and learn about their inspiring legacies in neighborhoods throughout the city. Go behind the scenes to find out how murals are made and why the process is as much an art of diplomacy and consensus building as paint and perspective. Discover through pictures and text how murals give communities a new way to define themselves, not in terms of the streets and intersections that border them, but in terms of the people who came together to create something of dramatic beauty.

Although some believe that young children are better off at home, experts argue that it does not matter where a child is, as long as they receive good quality stimulating care. This work is aimed at both providers of childcare services and those planning to use, or already using some form of childcare. Divided into three parts, topics covered include the different types of childcare service, the different needs of parents, children and childcare providers, choosing the best type of care for your child, and how the law tries to ensure that parents and children obtain good childcare. The second section describes 13 significant features of childcare that can help you to decide if a nursery or childminder is offering a good quality service. The third section discusses the practical problems of finding childcare, where to find good childminders and nurseries, how to choose a place that suits you and your child, and how to make the arrangment work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U8oDAAAACAAJ&dq=Choosing+Childcare:+A+Guide+for+Parents&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wine Country Quilts: A Bounty of Flavorful Projects for Any Palette","description":"The authors take readers on a tour of the winemaking and quiltmaking regions of America, featuring fifteen nature-inspired quilt projects that can be easily recreated at home.

We see the ugliest side of life, the pain that people go through for no reason. They didn't do anything. They didn't ask for it. Yet here they are, living their personal nightmares. We cannot take away their pain, or turn back time to undo the damage, but we can be the avengers. We can seek justice on their behalf.\\" So begins this riveting account by Westchester County District Attorney, Jeanine Pirro, as she takes us inside the violent world of modern crime fighting. Before Pirro was elected DA in 1993, the job was always considered a man's domain, demanding a macho toughness. Pirro can be as tough as any man, and yet she adds an important new dimension to the role. She believes that being tough on crime means much more than just filling the jails. She goes beyond her role to punish criminals, to be a passionate advocate for the victims of crime. In To Punish and Protect, Pirro brings readers face to face with the gruesome realities of her daily battles, and tells the true, heartbreaking stories of the victims - the slaughter of a young woman and her two children by a jealous, enraged boyfriend; a teenage girl forced to assume wifely duties after her father murdered her stepmother; a nine-year-old boy chained to a radiator in a dark room and nearly starved to death, as the rest of the family went about its business; a gentle, hardworking man shot fatally in a dispute over a parking place, because he was black; an eighty-year-old woman, savagely beaten by her son and left for two days on the cold floor of her apartment; a beautiful woman whose wealth and privilege could not prevent her murder at the hands of a violent husband; and a group of young girls lured into a sexual nightmare by a cunning predator posing as a trustworthy youth counselor. Pirro presents hard truths about the ways in which parents, communities, and the justice system share complicity in fostering an environment of danger to our children. She describes the dark world of Internet pedophiles and hate mongers, who are allowed to hide behind First Amendment protections to gain access to kids in their own bedrooms. She offers a harsh judgment on parents who fail to address the deadly consequences of teen drinking, and even host keg parties in their homes, while alcohol continues to take young lives and destroy families. Pirro delivers a bold indictment of the criminal justice system, and asks whether we as a nation are truly committed to justice. Increasingly, she warns, our laws, attitudes, and behaviors seem to be veering away from what we say is our moral core as a nation. We say that we exalt good and punish evil, yet we do the opposite. We turn criminals into celebrities, and view victims with suspicion. If we're going to make our communities safer and our society less violent, we need to do more than just pay lip service to our ideals. To Punish and Protect challenges us to have the will and the courage to wage war on the predators roaming our streets, and to avenge their victims.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HNGxCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Islamic Arts (Art & Ideas)","description":"Traces the development of Islamic art during three broad periods, and show how they reflect various aspects of Islamic culture","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HMrpAAAAMAAJ&dq=Islamic+Arts+(Art&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Divorce First Aid: How to Protect Yourself from Domestic Violence, Parental Kidnappings, Theft of Property & Other Domestic Emergencies","description":"Divorce first aid is an easy to read, practical book that dispenses common-sense advice for divorce situations.

Topics include: words, sentences and dictionaries; a word and its parts (roots and affixes); a word and its forms (inflection); a word and its relatives (derivation); compound words; word structure; productivity; and the historical sources of English word formation.

One by one he introduces, demonstrates and expounds the discoveries and inventions of his fertile, encyclopaedic mind. An African mud-sculpture representing a naked child, a road-mender's tool which, activated by the weather, creates a mosaic of human teeth, a vast aquarium in which human beings can breathe and in which a depilated cat is seen stimulating the partially decomposed head of Danton to fresh flights of oratory - by each item in Canterel's exhibition there hangs a tale, a tale such as only that amazing genius Roussel, one of the founding fathers of the modern novel, could tell. As Canterel's devices become more and more elaborate, the richness and brilliance of Roussel's stories grow to match them; the flow of his imagination becomes a flood, until the reader finds himself swept along in a torrent of mingled wonder and hilarity. Locus Solus, first published in 1914, is perhaps Roussel's most perfect masterpiece. Based, like the earlier Impressions of Africa, on uniquely eccentric principles of composition (which the interested reader will find outlined in Rayner Heppenstall's Raymond Roussel), this book invites the reader to enter a very special world of the imagination, a hauntingly unforgettable world which in its innocence, extravagance and deep reasonableness is unlike anything in the literature of the twentieth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bdnwAAAAMAAJ&dq=Locus+Solus+(French+Surrealism)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wickett's Remedy: A Novel","description":"The triumphant follow-up to the bestselling Bee Season, Wickett s Remedy is an epic but intimate novel about a young Irish-American woman facing down tragedy during the Great Flu epidemic of 1918. Wickett s Remedy leads us back to Boston in the early part of the 20th century and into the world of Lydia, an Irish-American shop girl yearning for a grander world than the cramped confines of South Boston. She seems to be well on her way to the life she has dreamed of when she marries Henry Wickett, a shy medical student and the scion of a Boston Brahmin family. Soon after their wedding, however, Henry shocks Lydia by quitting medical school and creating a mail-order patent medicine called Wickett s Remedy. And then just as the enterprise is getting off the ground, the Spanish Influenza epidemic of 1918 begins its deadly sweep across the world, drastically changing their lives. In a world turned almost unrecognizable by swift and sudden tragedy, Lydia finds herself working as a nurse in an experimental ward dedicated to understanding the raging epidemic   through the use of human subjects. Meanwhile, we follow the fate of Henry s beloved Wickett s Remedy as his one-time business partner steals the recipe and transforms it into QD Soda, a wildly popular soft drink. Based on years of research and evoking actual events, Wickett s Remedy perfectly captures the texture of the times and brings a colourful cast of characters vividly to life, including a sad and funny chorus of the dead. With wit and dexterity, Goldberg has fashioned a novel that is both charming and grand. Wickett s Remedy announces her arrival as a major novelist. South Boston belonged to Lydia as profoundly and wordlessly as her thimble finger. Her knowledge of its streets was more complete than any atlas, her mental maps reflecting changes that occurred from season to season, day to day, and hour to hour. Each time she left 28 D Street   one among a row of identical triple-decker houses, the tenements lining the street like so many stained teeth   her route reflected this internal almanac. . . . For ten years this was enough. Then in fifth grade, Lydia saw a city map and realized her entire world was a mitten dangling from Boston s sleeve. Across the bridge lay Washington Street   the longest street in all New England   which began like any other but then continued north, a single determined thread of cobblestone that wove itself through every town from Boston to Providence. Once Lydia saw Washington Street she knew she could not allow it to exist without her.  excerpt from Wickett's Remedy","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Jax_RvSmAmEC&dq=Wickett%27s+Remedy:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Past the Size of Dreaming (Red Heart of Memories)","description":"The continuing story of wandering witch Matilda and her friend Edmund describes the pair's return to the benevolently haunted house that Edmund grew up in, but when the house tells Matilda to seek out Edmund's childhood friends, she soon realizes that they must combine forces to battle a rising darkness.

There are few areas of modern life that are burdened by as much information and advice, often contradictory, as our diet and health: eat a lot of meat, eat no meat; whole-grains are healthy, whole-grains are a disaster; eat everything in moderation; eat only certain foods--and on and on. In 100 Million Years of Food biological anthropologist Stephen Le explains how cuisines of different cultures are a result of centuries of evolution, finely tuned to our biology and surroundings. Today many cultures have strayed from their ancestral diets, relying instead on mass-produced food often made with chemicals that may be contributing to a rise in so-called \\"Western diseases,\\" such as cancer, heart disease, and obesity. Travelling around the world to places as far-flung as Vietnam, Kenya, India, and the US, Stephen Le introduces us to people who are growing, cooking, and eating food using both traditional and modern methods, striving for a sustainable, healthy diet. In clear, compelling arguments based on scientific research, Le contends that our ancestral diets provide the best first line of defense in protecting our health and providing a balanced diet. Fast-food diets, as well as strict regimens like paleo or vegan, in effect highjack our biology and ignore the complex nature of our bodies. In 100 Million Years of Food Le takes us on a guided tour of evolution, demonstrating how our diets are the result of millions of years of history, and how we can return to a sustainable, healthier way of eating.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DPm5BwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"World Englishes: A Resource Book for Students (Routledge English Language Introductions)","description":"Assuming no prior knowledge, this book offers an accessible overview of English dialects, with activities, study questions, sample analyses, commentaries & key readings.

Pastors today can easily become preoccupied with the many pitfalls of modern culture, buying into the idea of image and straying from Jesus's call to shepherd leadership. Pastoral Ministry: How to Shepherd Biblically presents a practical pastoral theology aimed at showing pastors and pastors-in-training the vital role God's word plays in shaping the preparation and maintaining the priorities of pastoring. The authors examine the biblical teaching about the high and demanding call to ministry required of any spiritual shepherd. You'll learn how to pursue intentional growth through the stages of calling, training, and ministering to God's church along the way, uncovering answers to questions such as: How does the Bible establish a philosophy of pastoral ministry, and what is it? Who is personally qualified to be an undershepherd of God's flock? What are the biblical preparations required of shepherd leaders? What priority does God's word place on activities involved in pastoral ministry? United in affirming shepherd leadership as the biblical model for pastoral ministry, The Master's Seminary faculty contributes a treasury of expertise alongside insights from well-known Bible teacher John MacArthur. This book will inspire any pastor dedicated to serving God's church in the pattern of Jesus Christ.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FcULDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","description":"This carefully crafted ebook:  The Sea Wolf (Unabridged)  is formatted for your eReader with a functional and detailed table of contents.

Because these issues are central to human experience, southern history properly conceived is of more than regional interest. In A Sphinx on the American Land, Peter Kolchin explores three comparative frameworks for the study of the nineteenth-century South in an effort to nudge the subject away from provincialism and toward the kind of global concerns that are already transforming it into one of the most innovative fields of historical research. The volume opens with a comparison between the South and the North, or what Kolchin terms the  un-South.  This basic context, he explains, provides an essential backdrop for understanding the South; how one conceptualizes  southernness  has meaning only in terms of what it is not. Turning to the cohesion and variations among what he calls the  many Souths,  Kolchin reminds us that there has never been one South or archetypal southerner. Internal distinctions whether geographic, class, religious, or racial ultimately raise the question of whether one can properly speak of  the  South at all. Finally, Kolchin explores parallels between the South and regions outside the United States or  other Souths.  He considers a number of ways in which the South can be studied in a broad international setting, paying particular attention to the similarities and differences between the emancipation of southern slaves and Russian serfs. In an eloquent afterword, he ponders the nature and importance of comparative history.

Out near Hudson Heights, Longfellow Park - an area of wealth and position - is being torn apart to make way for the newly rich and ambitious who threaten to engulf the long-standing residents. The new century brings with it a new order. But they still have their traditions, these older families, still have their respectability, their position, their culture. The grander ones even have statues made in their image. Yet, like so many well-orchestrated worlds, their houses contain secrets, rooms, people that they would prefer the rest of the world not to dwell upon. In the Pinkerton household a nineteenth-century embarrassment remains. Alice Pinkerton. Alice Pinkerton is almost thirty-five, not mad exactly, but disturbed, foolish, not right in the head. She had a friend once, a black servant girl (regarded in itself as a harbinger of abnormality) but she disappeared one day, never to return. Alice is tolerated (more or less), free to wander about, free to accompany her family to tea parties and cultured soirees, free to be condescended to, to have looks exchanged over her, free to be treated like a simpleton. But the truth is, Alice's mind is razor sharp, honed by a restless imagination, years of reading, and a profound contempt for her surroundings. Like her namesake in Through the Looking-Glass, Alice Pinkerton too has a mirror through which to enter a different world, only for her the mirror is her books. Left alone to read, to think, she has devoured the world that brings her mind alive: Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Robert Louis Stevenson, Wilkie Collins, Edgar Allan Poe are her inspiration; Jane Eyre (and Bertha Rochester), Maggie Tulliver, Lady Macbeth her companions, sustaining and nourishing her lonely life. As she moves through the witless world of Longfellow Park, observing its prejudices, its shallow culture and its vanity, its hatred of truth, she transports those who belittle her into these books and into her own - secretly-written - books, where they can no longer hide behind their tea parties and their song recitals, but are forced to act out their true characters, and reveal their true natures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PhRoKQ5waE8C&dq=Pinkerton%27s+Sister&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Christian Doctrine (Cambridge Companions to Religion)","description":"What is Christian doctrine?

When he charged William ( Wild Bill ) Donovan, a successful Wall Street lawyer and Wilkie Republican, to head up the office, the die was set for some of the most fantastic and fascinating operations the U.S. government has ever conducted. Author Richard Harris Smith, himself an ex-CIA hand, documents the controversial agency from its conception as a spin-off of the Office of the Coordinator for Information to its demise under Harry Truman and reconfiguration as the CIA. During his tenure, Donovan oversaw a chaotic cast of some ten thousand agents drawn from the most conservative financial scions to the country s most idealistic New Deal true believers. Together they usurped the roles of government agencies both foreign and domestic, concocted unbelievably complicated conspiracies, and fought the good fight against the Axis powers of Germany and Japan. For example, when OSS operatives stole vital military codebooks from the Japanese embassy in Portugal, the operation was considered a success. But the success turned into a flop as the Japanese discovered what had happened, and hastily changed a code that had already been decrypted by the U.S. Navy. Colorful personalities and truly priceless anecdotes abound in what may arguably be called the most authoritative work on the subject.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=83aMqklUijYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Modern Witch's Guide To Magic And Spells: A Remarkable Collection of Over 100 Spells to Entice a Lover, Win Back One Who Strays, Protect Your ...

The Frank Tipler is just one of a thousand survey vessels sent out into the bubble of space surrounding Earth, seeking habitable worlds and signs of advanced life. Its crew has stumbled across artifacts left behind by a benevolent trader species, but the decision to study them is fraught with danger and uncertainty. The Tipler's crew consists of forty flawed electronic copies of human beings, some of them profoundly damaged and Earth stopped responding to signals over a century ago. Caught between madness and political machinations, Alander stands on the brink of what might be the greatest discovery humanity has ever made and a gift that humanity can t afford to accept.

Webb of NASA (New Series in NASA History)","description":"When President Kennedy issued his well-known challenge to reach the moon and return safely before the end of the 1960s, the immediate responsibility for undertaking the task fell to 54-year-old NASA director James E. Webb. Eight years later, when the Apollo 11 spacecraft splashed down safely in the Pacific and the screens in NASA's Mission Control at Houston flashed the words \\"Task Accomplished,\\" it was Webb who deserved much of the credit. In Powering Apollo, W. Henry Lambright explores Webb's leadership role in NASA's spectacular success--success that is rare in ambitious government policies and programs. A North Carolina native and Congressional staff member, Jim Webb had served in Congress, worked in the Truman administration, and risen to high office in the defense and energy industries by 1961 when Kennedy named him to head the new National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Examining Webb's role as both Washington insider and government program director, Lambright probes the skills and experience that equipped him to handle his enormous responsibilities. He also shows how Webb's performance reflected important changes in twentieth century public life, including the concentration of political power in Washington; expansion of the federal bureaucracy; the rise of big science; and visions of cooperation among government, industry, and higher education.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-jjbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Powering+Apollo:+James+E.+Webb+of+NASA+(New+Series+in+NASA+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crossroads for Chela","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JPYWAAAACAAJ&dq=Crossroads+for+Chela&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Concise History of the Russian Revolution","description":"Richard Pipes's authoritative history of the \\"violent and disruptive acts\\" that created the first modern totalitarian regime portrays the crisis at the heart of the tsarist empire.

He provides fresh accounts of the revolution's personalities and policies, crises, and cruelties, from the murder of the royal family through civil war, famine, and state terror. Brilliantly and persuasively, Pipes shows us why the resulting system owes less to the theories of Marx than it did to the character of Lenin and Russia's long authoritarian tradition.

In a new book that will put the gloom-and-doom industry out of business, the Cato Institute says more human progress has been achieved in the last 100 years than in all of the previous centuries combined. No matter what the variable -- life expectancy, wealth, leisure time, education, safety, gender and racial equality, freedom -- the world is a vastly better place today than it was a century ago, say co-authors Stephen Moore and the late Julian Simon in It's Getting Better all the Time: 100 Greatest Trends of the Last 100 Years. Of course, if things are so great, why do we hear so much bad news? False scares and junk science are partly to blame, but the media also play a role in shaping people's perceptions. In 1998, the authors point out, there was not a single commercial airline crash despite the hundreds of thousands of commercial flights and billions of air passenger-miles traveled. While there was no major news coverage of this amazing record, the media devoted weeks of coverage to the 1999 crash of an Egyptian airliner.

With that money, our hero can win back his girl and all will be right with the world-but if he and Eddie screw up, the consequences will be grave. Authors including Eric Garcia, C. J. Box, Barbara Seranella, David Corbett, Gregg Hurwitz, and Steve Hamilton, among others, have written imaginative, heartbreaking, funny, and bold stories based on this classic American story of hope and despair, each a surprisingly different experiment with character and plot. For as familiar as this story is, Springsteen's spare lyrics leave much unsaid. How these authors fill in the absences is what makes this collection, published a month before the thirtieth anniversary of the release of Springsteen's Born to Run, such an unusual treasure, proving that, just as with music, in literature no two performances are alike.

This time, he's prepared to rule the Camelot of a new millennium: New York City. Handsome, charismatic Arthur Penn is running for mayor on a platform of common sense, humor, and knightly virtues. His advisors include a gifted ten-year-old named Merlin; Percival, an immortal accountant; and Gwen, a lovely young woman with no end of problems. Their grassroots campaign steadily gains strength until scandal looms with the sudden emergence of Morgan Le Fay, Arthur's sorceress half-sister, and her son Mordred, the aspiring mayor's ambitious heir. Acclaimed by Kirkus Reviews as \\"steady fun\\" by \\"a darkly amusing fantasist,\\" this imaginative romp is the revised and expanded version of Peter David's first novel, Sir Apropos of Nothing, originally published in 1987 and now out of print. David is the author of more than fifty novels, many of which have appeared on The New York Times bestsellers list.

How do they resemble and how do they differ from Jews in other places and times? What have their relationships been to the cultures of their neighbors? To address these and similar questions, some of the finest scholars of our day have contributed their insights to Cultures of the Jews, a winner of the National Jewish Book Award upon its hardcover publication in 2002. Constructing their essays around specific cultural artifacts that were created in the period and locale under study, the contributors describe the cultural interactions among different Jewsfrom rabbis and scholars to non-elite groups, including womenas well as between Jews and the surrounding non-Jewish world. What they conclude is that although Jews have always had their own autonomous traditions, Jewish identity cannot be considered the fixed product of either ancient ethnic or religious origins. Rather, it has shifted and assumed new forms in response to the cultural environment in which the Jews have lived. Mediterranean Origins, the first volume in Cultures of the Jews, describes the concept of the  People  or  Nation  of Israel that emerges in the Hebrew Bible and the culture of the Israelites in relation to that of neighboring Canaanite groups. It also discusses Jewish cultures in Babylonia, in Palestine during the Greco-Roman and Byzantine periods, and in Arabia during the formative years of Islam.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WsasY4j3CEIC&dq=Judaism+from+Cyrus+to+Hadrian+(2+Volume+Set)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"EMOTIONALLY DURABLE DESIGN","description":"Emotionally Durable Design presents counterpoints to our  throwaway society  by developing powerful design tools, methods and frameworks that build resilience into relationships between people and things. The book takes us beyond the sustainable design field s established focus on energy and materials, to engage the underlying psychological phenomena that shape patterns of consumption and waste. In fluid and accessible writing, the author asks: why do we discard products that still work? He then moves forward to define strategies for the design of products that people want to keep for longer. Along the way we are introduced to over twenty examples of emotional durability in smart phones, shoes, chairs, clocks, teacups, toasters, boats and other material experiences. Emotionally Durable Design transcends the prevailing doom and gloom rhetoric of sustainability discourse, to pioneer a more hopeful, meaningful and resilient form of material culture. This second edition features pull-out quotes, illustrated product examples, a running glossary and comprehensive stand firsts; this book can be read cover to cover, or dipped in-and-out of. It is a daring call to arms for professional designers, educators, researchers and students from in a range of disciplines from product design to architecture; framing an alternative genre of design that reduces the consumption and waste of resources by increasing the durability of relationships between people and things.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xZMGCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Fiend","description":"After stealing the original manuscript of \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" from a stewardess' closet, Booker, a partially reformed kleptomaniac, hires private detective Paul McDonald to find its rightful owner","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eao_HAAACAAJ&dq=Huckleberry+Fiend&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bertrand Russell's Best: Silhouettes in Satire","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tbAYAAAAIAAJ&dq=Bertrand+Russell%27s+Best:+Silhouettes+in+Satire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"As the Rabbis Taught: Studies in the Aggados of the Talmud","description":"It is said that if halachah provides us with the \\"how\\" of Judaism, then aggadah provides us with the \\"why.\\" Ein Yaakov, compiled by Rabbi Yaakov Ibn Chaviv over a period of twenty years, and first published in 1516, is the classic compendium of talmudic aggados (both the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds) with a commentary that incorporates the ideas of the great Torah and Talmud commentators such as Rashi, Tosafos, Ramban, Rambam, the Ritva, the Gaon of Vilna, and also includes quotations from the commentaries of the Rishonim. Despite the fact that great personalities such as the Gaon of Vilna and Schneur Zalman of Liadi long considered the aggados to be a key in unlocking the secrets of the Torah, serious scholars continue to overlook these passages in the Talmud because of the difficulties they encounter with the language, style, or mode of presentation of the material.

While women have a great hunger for ritual to reflect the events in their lives, they often do not know how to begin. For many, the very thought of creating their own rituals is too intimidating, and instead wait for others to take the lead, or simply suppress their own needs, desires, and dreams. Consequently, many women lead lives that too often are physically, emotionally, and spiritually unfulfilled. Finally, comes an author who provides women with the tools to address and fulfill their own needs for meaning that is sourced from their own intuitive knowing. Emphasizing the feminist Dianic Wiccan tradition, Women's Rites, Women's Mysteries is an engaging, practical, magical, one-of-a-kind guide in the art of ritual making, that has become a classic for women interested in women's spirituality. Written for beginners and experienced ritualists, this is the go-to resource for both creating and facilitating transformative female-centered personal and group rituals. Unique to this book is its in-depth focus on female embodiment, ritual energetics, invocation, ritual evaluation, the ritual facilitator, the priestess path and much more. A variety of magical techniques with applications for ritual and spellcraft are woven throughout the book that enhance and deepen a woman's relationship with herself and the powers of nature. Together, with open minds and hearts, we can learn to shape chaos and human needs into works of great power and beauty.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sozOtQEACAAJ&dq=Women%27s+Rites&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Retrospection and introspection","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oyYMmAEACAAJ&dq=Retrospection+and+introspection&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Language universals,: With special reference to feature hierarchies, (Janua linguarum.

His wallet, with forty-six dollars inside, was left intact beside him. As murders go, it was senseless, motiveless, and as random as a blindly flung stone. The boy was white, privileged, and widely loved, a scholar and athlete, with a future that seemed assured. The boy accused in his killing, a sixteen-year-old gang member from the inner city, was an angry, desperate youth whose life careened almost daily--as ghetto lives often do--between the never-distant prospects of jail and death. Dead Opposite is the story of these two boys--and of the boys and men, fathers and mothers, sisters and brothers, and friends who peopled their lives. Geoffrey Douglas tells the story of hope and hopelessness, ignorance and rage; of waste and courage and loss. But above all, it is the story of the chasm that divides us one from the other: black from white; rich from poor; the suburbs of Chevy Chase, Maryland, from the squalor and despair of New Haven's meanest streets. You will see and hear both stories. And by the end, you not only will have touched the differences of race, wealth, education, and hope, but will have seen and heard also the commonness that links us all--the love of a parent, the dreams of a child--that joins us, one to the other, as the humans we finally, sometimes sadly, are.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5AhOAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prolegomena to the study of Greek religion (Meridian books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3hrKngEACAAJ&dq=Prolegomena+to+the+study+of+Greek+religion+(Meridian+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Double Endorsement","description":"This CDL practice test study guide contains information for the Double/Triple Trailers Endorsement.

What we as her audience take away from this remarkable drama is a keener sense that, while death is real and unavoidable, our lives are ours to cherish or throw away a lesson that can be both uplifting and redemptive. As the playwright herself puts it, \\"The play is not about doctors or even about cancer. It's about kindness, but it shows arrogance. It's about compassion, but it shows insensitivity.\\" In Wit, Edson delves into timeless questions with no final answers: How should we live our lives knowing that we will die? Is the way we live our lives and interact with others more important than what we achieve materially, professionally, or intellectually? How does language figure into our lives? Can science and art help us conquer death, or our fear of it? What will seem most important to each of us about life as that life comes to an end? The immediacy of the presentation, and the clarity and elegance of Edson's writing, make this sophisticated, multilayered play accessible to almost any interested reader. As the play begins, Vivian Bearing, a renowned professor of English who has spent years studying and teaching the intricate, difficult Holy Sonnets of the seventeenth-century poet John Donne, is diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer. Confident of her ability to stay in control of events, she brings to her illness the same intensely rational and painstakingly methodical approach that has guided her stellar academic career. But as her disease and its excruciatingly painful treatment inexorably progress, she begins to question the single-minded values and standards that have always directed her, finally coming to understand the aspects of life that make it truly worth living.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jbxZAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Informix Performance Tuning","description":"Practical coverage of the two most recent releases of the Informix database server, versions 8 and 7","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KK464o2jHJcC&dq=Informix+Performance+Tuning&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hawthorne;","description":"Originally published in 1879, Henry James's Hawthorne has been out of print for many years.

In this critique of one literary genius by another, James not only considers Hawthorne as a man and a writer, for whom he has a tender, if critical, regard, but he uses his subject as a vantage point from which to present his views on American culture. With his customary urbanity, James assesses the place of the writer in nineteenth-century America, and touches upon the antithetical values of the Old World and the New. Hawthorne's preoccupation with evil and guilt, his portentous imagination and his otherworldliness are brought out in the critique of his works, together with James's keen appreciation of Hawthorne's remarkable gifts.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0bwpAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tunguska Fireball","description":"On 30 June 1908 a mysterious fireball exploded in the Siberian sky and flattened 2,000 square kilometres of the remote Tunguska forest.

In a rapidly changing world, experience can be a curse. Careers stall, innovation stops, and strategies grow stale. Being new, na?ve, and even clueless can be an asset. For today s knowledge workers, constant learning is more valuable than mastery.

Now two individuals from opposite ends of settled space are on a collision course with the darkest of those secrets, even as the world threatens to explode around them. The year is 2322. Humanity has expanded into the stars, inhabiting over 100 worlds across a third of the galaxy. Though thriving as never before, they have discovered neither alien life nor the key to utopia. Earth struggles to retain authority over far-flung planets and free-wheeling corporations while an uneasy armistice with a breakaway federation hangs by a thread as the former rebels rise in wealth and power. Alexis Solovy is Earth Alliance royalty, her father a fallen war hero and her mother an influential military leader. But she seeks only the freedom of space and has made a fortune by reading the patterns in the chaos to discover the hidden wonders of the stars. Nothing about her latest objective suggests the secret it conceals will turn her life  not to mention the entire galaxy upside down. But a chance encounter with a mysterious spy leads to a discovery which will thrust Alex into the middle of a galactic power struggle and a sinister conspiracy, whether she likes it or not. When faced with its greatest challenge, will humanity rise to triumph or fall to ruin? Aurora Rising is an epic science fiction tale of galaxy-spanning adventure, of the thrill of discovery and the unquenchable desire to reach ever farther into the unknown. It's a tale of humanity at its best and worst, of love and loss, of fear and heroism. It's the story of a woman who sought the stars and found more than anyone imagined possible.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xYYkAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Producing Culture and Capital : Family Firms in Italy","description":"Producing Culture and Capital is a major theoretical contribution to the anthropological literature on capitalism, as well as a rich case study of kinship and gender relations in northern Italy. Drawing on ethnographic and archival research on thirty-eight firms in northern Italy's silk industry, Sylvia Yanagisako illuminates the cultural processes through which sentiments, desires, and commitments motivate and shape capitalist family firms. She shows how flexible specialization is produced through the cultural dynamics of capital accumulation, management succession, firm expansion and diversification, and the reproduction and division of firms. In doing so, Yanagisako addresses two gaps in Marx's and Weber's theories of capitalism: the absence of an adequate cultural theory of capitalist motivation and the absence of attention to kinship and gender. By demonstrating that kinship and gender are crucial in structuring capitalist action, this study reveals these two gaps to be different facets of the same omission. A process-oriented approach to class formation and class subjectivity enables the author to incorporate the material and ideological struggles within families into an analysis of class-making and self-making. Yanagisako concludes that both \\"provincial\\" and \\"global\\" capitalist orientations and strategies operate in an industry that has always been integrated into regional and international relations of production and distribution. Her approach to culture and capitalism as mutually constituted processes offers an alternative to both universal models of capitalism as a mode of production and essentialist models of distinctive \\"cultures of capitalism.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YW7dDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Innocent When You Dream: The Tom Waits Reader","description":"The first collection of writings about musician and actor Tom Waits--interviews, profiles, conversations, and more--spans the artist's 30-year career in music, film, and theater Foreword by Frank Black of The Pixies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9-pyQgAACAAJ&dq=Innocent+When+You+Dream:+The+Tom+Waits+Reader&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Man Without Mercy","description":" A story by USA Today bestselling author becomes a comic!

The Persian Boy centers on the most tempestuous years of Alexander the Great s life, as seen through the eyes of his lover and most faithful attendant, Bagoas. When Bagoas is very young, his father is murdered and he is sold as a slave to King Darius of Persia. Then, when Alexander conquers the land, he is given Bagoas as a gift, and the boy is besotted. This passion comes at a time when much is at stake Alexander has two wives, conflicts are ablaze, and plots on the Macedon king s life abound.

(Vol. 2 of a 2 vol. set)","description":"This four-volume collection of over 140 original chapters covers virtually everything of interest to demographers, sociologists, and others. Over 100 authors present population subjects in ways that provoke thinking and lead to the creation of new perspectives, not just facts and equations to be memorized. The articles follow a theory-methods-applications approach and so offer a kind of \\"one-stop shop\\" that is well suited for students and professors who need non-technical summaries, such as political scientists, public affairs specialists, and others. Unlike shorter handbooks, Demography: Analysis and Synthesis offers a long overdue, thorough treatment of the field. Choosing the analytical method that fits the data and the situation requires insights that the authors and editors of Demography: Analysis and Synthesis have explored and developed. This extended examination of demographic tools not only seeks to explain the analytical tools themselves, but also the relationships between general population dynamics and their natural, economic, social, political, and cultural environments. Limiting themselves to human populations only, the authors and editors cover subjects that range from the core building blocks of population change--fertility, mortality, and migration--to the consequences of demographic changes in the biological and health fields, population theories and doctrines, observation systems, and the teaching of demography. The international perspectives brought to these subjects is vital for those who want an unbiased, rounded overview of these complex, multifaceted subjects. Topics to be covered: * Population Dynamics and the Relationship Between Population Growth and Structure * The Determinants of Fertility * The Determinants of Mortality * The Determinants of Migration * Historical and Geographical Determinants of Population * The Effects of Population on Health, Economics, Culture, and the Environment * Population Policies * Data Collection Methods and Teaching about Population Studies * All chapters share a common format * Each chapter features several cross-references to other chapters * Tables, charts, and other non-text features are widespread * Each chapter contains at least 30 bibliographic citations","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7HgawSGNJ9AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mathematical methods in operations research","description":"The first graduate-level text devoted to the subject, this classic offers a concise history and overview of methods as well as an excellent exposition of the mathematical foundations underlying classical operations research procedures.

Like living organisms, companies are complex networks of interdependent systems-and unless managers recognize and swiftly implement the changes to those systems required by a sudden surge in demand, a booming business can easily go bust under the strain. Recent history abounds with examples of companies whose overnight success led to morning-after failure because their managers, like most managers, lacked the training or experience needed to manage explosive growth. Yet, surprisingly, until recently there have been few expert guides devoted exclusively to this crucial change management issue. Managing Explosive Corporate Growth is a practical guide to piloting your company through periods of explosive growth with minimum damage and maximum sustainable profits. Author Steven Bragg explores the reasons why companies succeed or fail to adapt to explosive growth. He identifies the warning signs of impending explosions or declines in sales volume and zeroes in on the key growth issues specific to each functional area of the company-including accounting, auditing, IT, customer service, distribution, engineering, finance, HR, manufacturing, and sales and marketing. He also presents clear-cut guidelines on how to balance the demands of all organizational areas while guaranteeing customer satisfaction. In addition to proven strategies for planning, financing, and managing explosive growth, he provides you with valuable explosive growth management tools, including checklists of key explosive growth indicators; metrics and reporting systems for controlling cash flow; multioption budgeting systems that address all growth levels; and reporting systems that help you monitor and control rapid expansion. Managing Explosive Corporate Growth is an indispensable working resource for corporate managers, internal auditors, and entrepreneurs. It will also be of considerable interest to institutional investors who would like to learn the latest techniques for tracking the performance of current or potential investments.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M21yQgAACAAJ&dq=Managing+Explosive+Corporate+Growth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Comet!

With Ina's advice, you're certain to have all your friends saying, \\"Wasn't that fun!\\" Ina has packed Barefoot Contessa Parties! with plans for pulling off parties like a pro, stories about her own parties, and tips on assembling food (rather than cooking everything) and organizing like a caterer.

Come summer, it's into the garden for a lunch with grilled lamb and pita sandwiches that guests assemble themselves. In the autumn, when it's not Thanksgiving, Ina roasts a fresh turkey, which her friends enjoy with popovers and a creamy spinach gratin. And on a snowy winter's day, everyone is invited for a lunch buffet with seafood chowder and butternut squash and apple soup. Ever since Ina published her first book, people write, e-mail, and stop her on the street to say how much they love the food. She's reached new heights here with recipes like sour cream coffee cake--the ultimate breakfast treat. Salads? The red lettuce, balsamic onions, and blue cheese; Chinese chicken salad; and panzanella may be the best you've ever tasted.

Turchin argues that the key to the formation of an empire is a society s capacity for collective action. He demonstrates that high levels of cooperation are found where people have to band together to fight off a common enemy, and that this kind of cooperation led to the formation of the Roman and Russian empires, and the United States. But as empires grow, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, conflict replaces cooperation, and dissolution inevitably follows. Eloquently argued and rich with historical examples, War and Peace and War offers a bold new theory about the course of world history with implications for nations today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Wjnii_d7UYEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To Have or to Hold","description":"To Have and to Hold (1899) is a novel by American author Mary Johnston.

Jocelyn hardly loves Ralph - indeed, she seems to abhor him. Carnal, Jocelyn's husband-to-be, eventually comes to Jamestown, unaware that Ralph Percy and Jocelyn Leigh are man and wife. Lord Carnal attempts to kidnap Jocelyn several times and eventually follows Ralph, Jocelyn, and their two companions - Jeremy Sparrow, the Separatist minister, and Diccon, Ralph's servant - as they escape from the King's orders to arrest Ralph and carry Jocelyn back to England. The boat they are in, however, crashes on a desert island, but they are accosted by pirates, who, after a short struggle, agree to take Ralph as their captain, after he pretends to be the pirate \\"Kirby\\". The pirates gleefully play on with Ralph's masquerade, until he refuses to allow them to rape and pillage those aboard Spanish ships. The play is up when the pirates see an English ship off the coast of Florida.

In 1804, shortly before the Caribbean island of Saint Domingue is renamed Haiti, a group of women gather to bury a stillborn baby. Led by a lesbian healer and midwife named Mer, the women s lamentations inadvertently release the dead infant s  unused vitality  to draw Ezili the Afro-Caribbean goddess of sexual desire and love into the physical world. As Ezili explores her newfound powers, she travels across time and space to inhabit the midwife s body as well as those of Jeanne, a mixed-race dancer and the mistress of Charles Baudelaire living in 1880s Paris, and Meritet, an enslaved Greek-Nubian prostitute in ancient Alexandria. Bound together by Ezili and  the salt road  of their sweat, blood, and tears, the three women struggle against a hostile world, unaware of the goddess s presence in their lives. Despite her magic, Mer suffers as a slave on a sugar plantation until Ezili plants the seeds of uprising in her mind. Jeanne slowly succumbs to the ravages of age and syphilis when her lover is unable to escape his mother s control. And Meritet, inspired by Ezili, flees her enslavement and makes a pilgrimage to Egypt, where she becomes known as Saint Mary.

Their arguments over the meaning of slavery and freedom were grounded in changing circumstances of labor and home life on both sides of the Mason-Dixon line. At the heart of these arguments lay the problem of defining which realms of self and social existence could be rendered market commodities and which could not. From Bondage to Contract reveals how the problem of distinguishing between what was saleable and what was not reflected the ideological and social changes wrought by the concurrence of abolition in the South and burgeoning industrial capitalism in the North.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XoMhJoxRkY0C&dq=From+Bondage+to+Contract:+Wage+Labor,+Marriage,+and+the+Market+in+the+Age+of+Slave+Emancipation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pigs at Christmas","description":"As Christmas approaches and panicking pigs prepare for their holiday festivities, one little pig wonders nervously if Santa will really deliver everything as promised.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WVEkAQAAMAAJ&dq=Pigs+at+Christmas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Destiny Restored","description":"A close conceptual analysis of Herman Bavinck s (1854-1921) four-volume Reformed Dogmatics, this book explores a long-neglected feature of his  organic  relationship between nature and grace, arguing that the motif is intelligible only in a uniquely Reformed covenant theology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SGWXRf_d4oMC&dq=Destiny+Restored&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Last Page","description":"Dark and rich, epic in scope, in The Last Page Anthony Huso has crafted a fantasy in the vein of China Mieville's Perdido Street Station and Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast, teeming with unthinkable horrors and stylish wonders. The city of Isca is set like a dark jewel in the crown of the Duchy of Stonehold. In this sprawling landscape, the monsters one sees are nothing compared to what's living in the city's sewers. Twenty-three-year-old Caliph Howl is Stonehold's reluctant High King. Thrust onto the throne, Caliph has inherited Stonehold's dirtiest court secrets. He also faces a brewing civil war that he is unprepared to fight. After months alone amid a swirl of gossip and political machinations, the sudden reappearance of his old lover, Sena, is a welcome bit of relief. But Sena has her own legacy to claim: she has been trained from birth by the Shradnae witchocracy adept in espionage and the art of magical equations writ in blood and she has been sent to spy on the High King. Yet there are magics that demand a higher price than blood. Sena secretly plots to unlock the Cisrym Ta, an arcane text whose pages contain the power to destroy worlds. The key to opening the book lies in Caliph's veins, forcing Sena to decide if her obsession for power is greater than her love for Caliph. Meanwhile, a fleet of airships creeps ever closer to Isca. As the final battle in a devastating civil war looms and the last page of the Cisrym Ta waits to be read, Caliph and Sena must face the deadly consequences of their decisions. And the blood of these conflicts will stain this and other worlds forever.

Voss reflects on the totality of his wartime experiences, from the origins of his reasons for enlisting in the Waffen-SS to his experiences in US captivity.

In terms of geographical coverage, Portland?s two Chinatowns (one an urban area of brick commercial structures, one a vegetable-gardening community of shanty dwellings) were the largest in all of North America. Marie Rose Wong chronicles the history of Portland?s Chinatowns from their early beginnings in the 1850s until the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act in the 1940s, drawing on exhaustive primary material from the National Archives, including more than six thousand individual immigration files, census manuscripts, letters, and newspaper accounts. She examines both the enforcement of Exclusion Laws in the United States and the means by which Chinese immigrants gained illegal entry into the country. The spatial and ethnic makeup of the combined \\"Old Chinatown\\" afforded much more contact and accommodation between Chinese and non-Chinese people than is usually assumed to have occurred in Portland, and than actually may have occurred elsewhere. Sweet Cakes, Long Journey explores the contributions that Oregon?s leaders and laws had on the development of Chinese American community life, and the role that the early Chinese immigrants played in determining their own community destiny and the development of their Chinatown in its urban form and vernacular architectural expression. Sweet Cakes, Long Journey is an original and notable addition to the history of Portland and to the field of Asian American studies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sDPlcc0r998C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Instant Trainer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sR-SswEACAAJ&dq=Instant+Trainer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Catching Dreams: My Life in the Negro Baseball Leagues (Sports and Entertainment)","description":"In a rare memoir about the Negro Leagues and its celebrated players, Frazier \\"Slow\\" Robinson offers an inspiring and often entertaining view of the black baseball diamond through a catcher's mask. In 1939, at the age of 29 after playing professional baseball for twelve years Frazier Robinson caught the legendary Satchel Paige in barnstorming games from New Orleans to Walla Walla. Robinson played several more seasons in the Negro Leagues before finishing his career in Canada. While his career was a solid one, it was less spectacular than that of his friend and Hall-of-Famer, Satchel Paige, and so more typical of the experience of most Negro Leaguers. Richly embroidered with the threads of black society and of life as a black athlete in a racially divided nation, Robinson recounts his long career with the skill and ease of a natural storyteller. He covers, in remarkable detail, the personal perspective of the men, the teams, and the times that shaped this uniquely American subculture. From playing catcher for obscure industrial teams to barnstorming with Satchel Paige, he chronologically traces his nationwide path through the 1920s, '30s, '40s, and early '50s. The Foreword by John \\"Buck\\" O'Neil and Introduction by Gerald Early place Robinson squarely in the world of sports, African American culture, and American history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ydTRTGftqLcC&dq=Catching+Dreams:+My+Life+in+the+Negro+Baseball+Leagues+(Sports+and+Entertainment)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cynewulf's Elene","description":"Hailed as Cynwulf's masterpiece, \\"Elene\\" is one of the earliest poems by him.

Deftly blending history with autobiography, action with analysis, and separating fact from fable, General Krulak touches the very essence of the Corps: what it means to be a Marine and the reason behind its consistently outstanding performance and reputation. Krulak also addresses the most basic but challenging question of all about the Corps: how does it manage to survive--even to flourish--despite overwhelming political odds and, as the general writes, \\"an extraordinary propensity for shooting itself in the foot?\\" To answer this question Krulak examines the foundation on which the Corps is built, a system of intense loyalty to God, to country, and to other Marines. He also takes a close look at Marines in war, offering challenging accounts of their experiences in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. In addition, he describes the Corps's relationship to other services, especially during the unification battles following World War II, and offers new insights into the decision-making process in times of crisis. First published in hardcover in 1984, this book has remained popular ever since with Marines of every rank.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vUHfDIcSNw8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The patchwork girl of Oz","description":"Delightful story of a patchwork doll brought to life, a magic spell, and more enchanting adventures in the Land of Oz. 130 black-and-white illustrations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z53DAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rohna Disaster","description":"\\"A gripping true-to-life account of a tragic incident in U.S. history that needs to be read by everyone.\\" Congressman Jack Metcalf, U.S. House of Representatives. THE DAY AFTER THANKSGIVING On November 26, 1943, one day after Thanksgiving and one day out to sea, one thousand, nine-hundred and eighty one young American soldiers were presented with the most challenging and terrifying experience of their lives. On that day, they became players in what was to become one of the greatest at-sea tragedies in United States history. More than half of them never survived to tell their story. On that day, two of the WWIIs least known but historic incidents occurred. The United States suffered its greatest loss of troops at-sea in its history when the HMT ROHNA a British transport was sunk by a guided missile launched from a German bomber over the Mediterranean Sea, off the coast of North Africa. The ship, with officers and crew of one hundred ninety five was transporting American troops and Red Cross workers to the China-Burma-India Theater of war One thousand and fifteen American troops, three Red Cross workers and one hundred and twenty ships officers and crewmen perished, a loss second only to that of the Arizona at Pearl Harbor. In addition to the record number of casualties that were incurred, the bombing itself was historic because it was the first ever, successful \\"hit\\" by a remote-controlled rocket-boosted bomb, launched in the air from a German bomber, on a merchant vessel chartered for military use in war time. This incident was, in effect, the dawning of the missile age. The ship, badly in disrepair, was part of Convoy KMF-26 en-route to Bombay, India with men and supplies needed for the little known China - Burma -India theater of WWII. It was a noteworthy historic event that received little notice and still has not been acknowledged by the United States government. Understandably, for security reasons, the War Department immediately suppressed news of this catastrophe. Compounding this tragedy, no details were ever provided to the grieving fathers and mothers. Parents went to their graves never to learn the fate of their sons. Families still do not know how their loved ones died and this disaster continues to remain virtually unknown to the public. Over eight hundred bodies were never recovered, and their remains are scattered over hundreds of miles at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea. THE ROHNA DISASTER (227P) describes that tragic, but little known incident at sea. Each chapter presents electrifying eyewitness accounts of the inhumane shipboard conditions, the actual bombing and sinking, and the struggles to survive and be rescued in heavy seas at night. Accounts of heroism and courage are woven through each chapter, and the anquish of families, as they waited fifty years in an emotional void, is poignantly told. THE ROHNA DISASTER is, in many respects, told by the people who played their different roles as survivors, rescuers and family members. Every survivor was willing, if not anxious, to share his experience, painful though it often was, some because they wanted to help the author in his search for information about his brother, most, because they felt very strongly that this story should be told and that the casualties should be given an honored place in American history. It is important that history be chronicled, and that this story, an important part of our history, be told, heard, taught and remembered. It is also important that those who played roles in this incredible drama, the survivors, rescuers and casualties, be given their due honor and recognition, and that the families of those who perished, who have a right to know what happened to their loved ones, be given an opportunity to learn that truth. This book was written for those reasons. \\"We are slowly losing a unique breed of people, the likes of which we will never s","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QXSMAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hope Against Hope (Harvill Press Editions)","description":"The story of the poet Osip Mandelstam, who suffered continuous persecution under Stalin, but whose wife constantly supported both him and his writings until he died in 1938.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mdHxTzO50u8C&dq=Hope+Against+Hope+(Harvill+Press+Editions)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tomb Raider, Vol. 1 : Saga of the Medusa Mask","description":"Presents the comic book adventures of explorer Lara Croft.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q9GB2JSD9cUC&dq=Tomb+Raider,+Vol.+1+:+Saga+of+the+Medusa+Mask&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kundalini: Energy of Awakening","description":"You have within you a latent energy waiting to transform your life.

Current solutions range from the legislative (the Children's Television Act of 1990) to the technological (the V-chip). Saturday Morning Censors examines the history of adults' attempts to safeguard children from the violence, sexism, racism, and commercialism on television since the 1950s. By focusing on what censorship and regulation are and how they work rather than on whether they should exist Heather Hendershot shows how adults use these processes to reinforce their own ideas about childhood innocence. Drawing on archival studio material, interviews with censors and animators, and social science research, Hendershot analyzes media activist strategies, sexism and racism at the level of cartoon manufacture, and the product-linked cartoons of the 1980s, such as Strawberry Shortcake and Transformers. But in order to more fully examine adult reception of children's TV, she also discusses  good  programs like Sesame Street and Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids. Providing valuable historical context for debates surrounding such current issues as the V-chip and the banning of Power Rangers toys in elementary schools, Saturday Morning Censors demonstrates how censorship can reveal more fears than it hides. Saturday Morning Censors will appeal to educators, parents, and media activists, as well as to those in cultural studies, television studies, gender studies, and American social history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b6Iqh5umo3sC&dq=Saturday+Morning+Censors:+Television+Regulation+before+the+V-Chip+(Console-ing+Passions)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mommy Magic : 450 Ways to Nurture Your Child","description":"When a child is born, God sprinkles a little magic into the heart of the mother..\\".Mommy Magic\\" celebrates the sheer essence of motherhood!

Is it the wave of the future or a passing fancy? Who are the leaders and what are they saying? The time has come for a mature assessment. D. A. Carson not only gives those who may be unfamiliar with it a perceptive introduction to the emerging church movement, but also includes a skillful assessment of its theological views. Carson addresses some troubling weaknesses of the movement frankly and thoughtfully, while at the same time recognizing that it has important things to say to the rest of Christianity. The author strives to provide a perspective that is both honest and fair. Anyone interested in the future of the church in a rapidly changing world will find this an informative and stimulating read.

After more than fifty years of marketing theory and practice, marketing planning still remains one of the great, unconquered challenges. This challenge continues to grow as the environments in which companies operate become increasingly hostile, abrasive and dynamic. There is a growing body of evidence to show that the difference between an organization's efficiency and effectiveness (or, in planning terms, the difference between tactics and strategy) is becoming more and more important. Today, successful chief executives and management teams are grasping the absolute necessity of understanding where their companies should be going, with this direction properly articulated in plans that identify and develop those things that make a company significantly and profitably different over time. It is not difficult to spot those organizations that have not adopted this strategic planning orientation. They reorganize with regular monotony, and more and more such firms are being taken over by more enterprising ones that have learned to drive using the strategic planning approach. Such marketing planning will never be easy. Indeed, it grows more difficult by the day.

Among his many publications, the book that best summarizes his teachings on holiness is A Plain Account of Christian Perfection, as believed and taught by the Reverend Mr. John Wesley, from the year 1725 to the year 1777. For many years this timeless classic has been reproduced in various formats. Now, for the first time, John Wesley's 'A Plain Account of Christian Perfection' is being offered in a definitive Annotated Edition by Mark K. Olson. This edition is volume one in a projected three volume series. The Annotated Edition offers the following:   The entire text has been divided into chapters and verses for detailed study and cross-referencing.   The introduction examines in detail when and why Wesley wrote A Plain Account.   The verse by verse commentary discusses the history and background behind the text, offering unsurpassed explanation of Wesley's doctrine of perfect love.   Five end notes address Wesley's early doctrinal development, the impact of Aldersgate on his perfection doctrine, many testimonies of attaining perfection, and other relevant material from early Methodism.   Over 150 quotations from Wesley's sermons, writings, and letters offer unlimited clarification to his views on perfection.   The insights of many Wesley scholars are included: Albert Outler, Randy Maddox, Kenneth Collins, William Greathouse, Thomas Oden, Harold Lindstrom, Stephen Gunter, H. Ray Dunning, Theodore Runyon, plus many others.   A timeline details every event in Wesley's lifetime corresponding to A Plain Account.   Several exhaustive indexes are included: scripture, annotation, subject, author, Wesley quotations, and two synonym indexes from Wesley's Journal and A Plain Account.   The Essential Reading Section further empowers the study of Wesley's theology of perfection. Included are: o Twenty key sermons, along with their dates and locations in Wesley's Works (both the Jackson and Bicentennial editions).   Wesley's most important writings on perfection, listing their date and location in his Works.   250 letters relevant to his theology of perfection. The index includes their date and location in Wesley's Works, with a brief description of their contents. Two additional volumes are planned in the series. John Wesley's Theology of Perfection will offer specialized studies for those wanting to dig deeper into Wesley's theology of perfection. The third volume, John Wesley's Doctrine of Christian Perfection, will present in systematic format every facet of Wesley's views on perfection. The projected release for both volumes is 2006 and 2007. Together, these three volumes will present one of the most thorough and exhaustive studies ever done on Wesley's most beloved, yet, most controversial doctrine.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=24_rAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great taste-low fat: Over 200 delicious recipes under 400 calories","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ymcoAQAACAAJ&dq=Great+taste-low+fat:+Over+200+delicious+recipes+under+400+calories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"TEST METHODS FOR EXPLOSIVES","description":"It seems that there is no book that treats the measurement of the physical pa rameters of explosives as its only subject, although limited information is avail able in a number of books. Therefore, I have tried to bridge this gap in the lit erature with this book.

Accordingly, a large number of different experimental methods exist, as well as various testing appa ratuses and procedures. On the other hand, great progress has been made recently in the study of detonation phenomena. New measuring techniques can assess extremely short processes to below nanoseconds scale. They make it possible to determine im portant parameters in detonation physics. I have made a great attempt to cover the available literature data on the subject. Because it would be a highly demanding task to include in a single volume all the methods that are in use by various testing agencies, I have tried to give primarily the principles for determination of individual physical pa rameters of explosives by different measuring methods as well as data treatment procedures.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6IHTBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reporting Clear?

But Malcolm X, the most famous minister in the Nation of Islam-a sect many white Americans deemed a hate cult-saw the potential in Clay, not just for boxing greatness, but as a means of spreading the Nation's message. The two became fast friends, keeping their interactions secret from the press for fear of jeopardizing Clay's career. Clay began living a double life-a patriotic \\"good Negro\\" in public, and a radical reformer behind the scenes. Soon, however, their friendship would sour, with disastrous and far-reaching consequences. Based on previously untapped sources, from Malcolm's personal papers to FBI records, Blood Brothers is the first book to offer an in-depth portrait of this complex bond. Acclaimed historians Randy Roberts and Johnny Smith reconstruct the worlds that shaped Malcolm and Clay, from the boxing arenas and mosques, to postwar New York and civil rights-era Miami. In an impressively detailed account, they reveal how Malcolm molded Cassius Clay into Muhammad Ali, helping him become an international symbol of black pride and black independence. Yet when Malcolm was barred from the Nation for criticizing the philandering of its leader, Elijah Muhammad, Ali turned his back on Malcolm-a choice that tragically contributed to the latter's assassination in February 1965. Malcolm's death marked the end of a critical phase of the civil rights movement, but the legacy of his friendship with Ali has endured. We inhabit a new era where the roles of entertainer and activist, of sports and politics, are more entwined than ever before. Blood Brothers is the story of how Ali redefined what it means to be a black athlete in America-after Malcolm first enlightened him. An extraordinary narrative of love and deep affection, as well as deceit, betrayal, and violence, this story is a window into the public and private lives of two of our greatest national icons, and the tumultuous period in American history that they helped to shape.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-ISPDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Under the Duvet : Shoes, Reviews, Having the Blues, Builders, Babies, Families and Other Calamities","description":"From the acclaimed bestselling author of Sushi for Beginners and Angels comes a collection of personal essays on shopping, writing, moviemaking, motherhood and all the assorted calamities involved in being a savvy woman in the new millennium.

It deconstructs the spiral of acceleration in which technological shifts concerning global markets and enterprises produce a dynamic of unbridled disruption, concentration and erosion of human and natural resources. The book analyzes how, in the face of this dynamic, once successful business models increasingly lead to existential jeopardy.The book embeds its argument in the impact of technological change on strategy in general. It subsequently analyzes the degree of rationality in the strategy building process to juxtapose revenue and responsibility as the fundamental principles of diverging strategic concepts. In its central chapters the book explores the benefits of consciousness-driven business models and value-added strategies for the awareness markets of the future and their impact on team excellence and resource handling. It develops an understanding of how corporations can function as ecosystems  fostering the growth and development of the resources they operate on, rather than being based on their exploitation. Understanding this structure of viable future business models is the overall theme of this pioneering book.  This book endeavors to set out yet another paradigm for a viable economics, the paradigm of ethicology. It seeks to replace the concepts of competition, scarcity and growth with strategies and business models based on resource creation, added values cycles, enrichment and symbiosis in line with the awareness economy it describes.

During the height of the Cold War, between 1965 and 1968, Robert Aumann, Michael Maschler, and Richard Stearns collaborated on research on the dynamics of arms control negotiations that has since become foundational to work on repeated games. These five seminal papers are collected here for the first time, with the addition of \\"postscripts\\" describing many of the developments since the papers were written. The basic model studied throughout the book is one in which players ignorant about the game being played must learn what they can from the actions of the others. The original work, done under contract to the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, was intended to tackle the gradual disarmament problem, in which neither player knew what his own payoff would be for any given agreement, because of uncertainty about the other side's arsenal and weapons production technology. But the research soon became much more generalized, covering information concealment and revelation, signaling and learning, and related ideas in any repeated competitive situation. The first four chapters of the book treat the competitive zero-sum side of the theory of repeated games. Chapter five takes up cooperative phenomena where one player may want to signal information to another. An extensive bibliography covers all items mentioned in the main text, in the postscripts, and in the introduction. The bibliography also includes a compilation of published papers and books that refer to the original reports.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bLlNEAAAQBAJ&dq=Repeated+Games+with+Incomplete+Information&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Body Knows Diet","description":"Are you a food addict?

An historical novel of the highest quality.\\" Iain Pears Rich in sensuous detail, this first novel brilliantly captures the political and social upheavals of the waning Ottoman Empire. The naked body of a young Englishwoman washes up in Istanbul wearing a pendant inscribed with the seal of the deposed sultan. The death resembles the murder by strangulation of another English governess, a crime that was never solved. Kamil Pasha, a magistrate in the new secular courts, sets out to find the killer, but his dispassionate belief in science and modernity is shaken by betrayal and widening danger. In a lush, mystical voice, a young Muslim woman, Jaanan, recounts her own relationships with one of the dead women and her suspected killer. Were these political murders involving the palace or crimes of personal passion? An absorbing tale that transports the reader to nineteenth-century Turkey, this novel is also a lyrical meditation on the contradictory desires of the human soul. Reading group guide included.

Although the ideals embodied in religion and philosophy are considered to be humanity's prime \\"civilising\\" force, religions that preach love have been used to justify bloody massacres, and utopian ideals have fomented intolerance and persecution of those who were perceived as obstacles to the realisation of an ideal society. John Mohawk, a distinguished Native American historian, examines this paradox and traces the role of utopian thinking as the rationale for religious wars, subjugation of indigenous peoples, genocide, enslavement, plunder, economic domination, and campaigns of world conquest from the time of the ancient Greeks. Mohawk examines the hidden dynamic within utopian thinking and the danger it poses when it is adopted by powerful groups who use it to serve their own interests. He points out that the danger lies not in the utopian ideal itself but in the parallel assumption that its followers are in possession of the only \\"truth\\" and are therefore justified in forcing their \\"better way of life\\" on other cultures or nations for the ultimate good of humanity. In a gripping historical narrative, Mohawk traces the impact of utopian thinking on the rise of Western culture in ancient Greece and Rome, the emergence of the Christian empire, and the holy wars of the Middle Ages. Showing how this mindset has shaped Western development, he makes it clear that the utopian legacy still influences contemporary social and political movements at home and abroad. Our greatest challenge is to find ways to defuse its harmful effects on cultures different from our own, while preserving our aspirations and personal ideals. Mohawk argues that only a pluralistic outlook can truly support peace and understanding among the peoples of the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RZWFAAAAMAAJ&dq=Utopian+Legacies:+A+History+of+Conquest+and+Oppression+in+the+Western+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Education: Opposing Viewpoints","description":"Provides a collection of essays that cover varying viewpoints on the subject of education in the United States, including such topics as tuition vouchers, character education, and standardized testing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=amPuAAAAMAAJ&dq=Education:+Opposing+Viewpoints&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Breed of the Informed, Proactive Consumer : The Prosumer","description":"Top PR Practitioners Reveal the Secrets of Successful Public Relations.
