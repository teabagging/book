It's over 700 pages and is the projected first book of a trilogy but the book is complete in itself. This book has really fascinating and detailed settings, intricate and complex plotting and an unusual and compelling heroine. It's dark and very intense, sensual and exotic, unpredictable and exciting and yet also romantic and totally involving. I'm thinking that readers of Anne Bishop may like this book. The heroine's homeland, Terre D'Ange, is being beseiged by a number of internal and external political threats. The heroine, both a court spy and a courtesan, is instrumental in courteracting the numerous threats to her homeland. She's tough and intelligent. She's also unapologetically sensual with a sadomasochistic streak, which may not appeal to all readers and although I had some initial misgivings, this didn't bother me in the end, because it's part and parcel of who the character is and where's she's coming from. None of the sex and violence of the book is gratuitous - it's just part and only part of the story. If you like adventure, love, political machinations, heroism and treachery, I think you'll find KUSHIEL'S DART highly compulsive and completely absorbing reading."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Unlike some, I wasn't put off by the flowery prose -- I thought it was beautiful -- and the slow beginning didn't bother me, either. I actually enjoy books that allow you to immerse yourself in them slowly instead of being hit in the face with action on the first page involving people I don't know or care about. The worldbuilding here is lovely, complex, and believable. You can see where the author got her inspiration, but she gives everything its own unique twist. My main reason for giving the book four stars instead of five is that, by the end of the novel, I had gotten frustrated with Phaedre for several reasons. For one thing, she became (to me, at least) more and more Mary Sue-like...she seems to be able to vanquish every situation she's put in, even it means using a talent or skill we haven't really even heard of before. Also, I got annoyed by her apparent weakness with regard to the main villain of the story. If Phaedre is so smart and talented, why can't she show a little more backbone in those situations?Even though I enjoyed many aspects of the book, my frustration with the main character meant that I knew I wouldn't go on to read any more of the books in this series. It's too bad, because I did think the writing was beautiful, but life is too short to read (very) long books that I know are just going to end up pushing the wrong buttons. I'm sure other people will have a very different response to this book, but that's how I felt about it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Nothing but praise for this masterpiece of psychological realism, with its dancing plot and convincing pantheon.The heroine grows from a child tossed around by fortune into an agent of fate, while saving a country from treason and invasion. Chance turns into destiny as the background of her tutor unfolds. When she applies her skills of stealth and seduction, she enters a court of intrigue and violence.We are stimulated by a constant supply of surprises and fresh characters.Jacquline Carey's fantasy world is rich and detailed. She never abuses the genre's license to break the laws of physics; the magic in this story never touches the decisive plot points. No convenient dues-ex-machina super-powers, but clairvoyance-type skills to enhance foreshadowing.The rest of the \`magic' is interwoven with the pantheon. The world in this story resembles our own in the time of Renaissance, with the best of paganism added. These people have no shame of love and pleasure, and their gods keep a close watch and light touch on their history.I'm guessing the fantasy ingredient is only used to free the characters from the boring bits of actual history. The stripping of puritan values enables characters to pursue high and low passion unhindered. The first half of the story is a chess-like game, played by courtiers who are of the Balthasar Castiglione type on the outside, and Machiavellian at heart.Just before the civilized big-city dynamic begins to wear out, the sophistication is balanced by icy peaks under a blue sky and barbarians with simpler drives.Whatever the drives of the characters, no one escapes the consequences of breaching humanist ethics. The heroine is an instrument of the angel that punishes the sinners, and they all get their due in this story, as a side-effect of destiny, with their honor and free will intact.The flavor of the story hints at modern science and philosophy. Carey sees how psychology is grounded in biology. The beauty of people is fostered by rearing pressures; she knows good breeding makes good character. The open elitism and aristocracy is grounded on materialism, and the semi-pagan gods are the biological ancestors of the main characters. Likely these hints are not accidental. Blessed Elua, the principal god in this story, was born out of Mother Earth, when the blood of \\"Yeshua\\" dripped from the cross and mixed with the tears of \\"Mary Magdelene\\"."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"When my friend pushed me to read these books I thought to myself 'another porny book? Do I really need to?' I had picked up the books, or seen them around, but never purchased them. However once I got around to it, I was glad I had. This book is fabulous. Looking at the map it didn't take me long to realize Carey had based her fantasy world off of the real one, adding touches of realism to her story that are always enjoyable. Phedre is a believable and likable character, starting off stubborn and more than a little self centered and evolving from there. It's one of those stories where you hate the bad guy, and love the good guy, but you're not really sure who is on what side until the very end. (And even then, there is a twist.)At the end I found myself falling in love with all of these characters (and buying the next two books)."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I have never read such a beautiful piece of work. I recommend it for anyone who loves beauty, intrigue, love of fantasy...I can't explain it...I am in love! I love the next book as well, but I am still waiting on the last book because I am poor! I need it in paperback!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I have read hundreds of fantasy novels...Kushiels Dart springs to the top. Elegant, finely crafted, unique and beautifully written. Rarely is the fantasy genre presented with such a gift. And it's a first book. I am blown away and very eager for her sophomore debut."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"&quot;Kushiel's Dart&quot; has some intriguing ideas, but unfortunately, most of these are contained in the first three chapters. What follows is a tired rehash of Harlequin Romance plot conventions with the occasional fantasy twist.As far as Romance heroines go, Phaedre no Delaunay isn't a bad one. She's smart, strong-willed, stunningly beautiful (of course), nauseatingly talented, and apparently dynamite in bed.This comes in handy, given the amount of political crises threatening her country. In the world of &quot;Kushiel's Dart&quot; there isn't a crisis too big that can't be solved by Phaedre hopping into bed with someone. And if simple sex doesn't suffice, well, she sings. Phaedre, you see, has a very impressive set of vocal cords. With sex and song, she accomplishes what highly trained diplomats cannot. Dump her in Afghanistan and she'd soon sort those pesky Taliban out.The plot of &quot;Kushiel's Dart&quot; not only strains credulity, it takes it out into the street and shoots it. Don't get me wrong. The characters, while stereotyped, are likable enough, and the plot moves fairly quickly. The sex, while kinky by your average Harlequin Romance standards, is well-written and fairly soft-core. If you're looking for a nice, predictable romance with fantasy trappings, this is the book for you. If, on the other hand, you're looking for genuine political intrigue in an original fantasy setting, I suggest you check out Guy Gavriel Kay's &quot;Sailing to Sarantium.&quot;Carey writes well, and her work contains flashes of brilliance. The author herself seems to be having fun when she's being original (the Kushiel's Boy's rhyme comes to mind) which gives me hope that in her next book she'll dump the cliched plotlines in favor of a more original story. In the meantime, if you're looking for a rainy day Romance read, you won't go wrong with &quot;Kushiel's Dart.&quot;"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"After reading all the great reviews, I paid for the hardcover expecting a great fantasy read. However, I was disappointed overall. While I admire many of the descriptives - the author has crafted some beautiful passages, I think this book is very similar to Richard Adams' Maia. It is difficult to read Kushel's Dart and not compare it to Maia. Unfortunately, it doesn't measure up to Maia in the comparison. What I look for in a good fantasy read is a believable fantasy world. I don't think the fantasy holds up."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Very disappointed...got it from the book bin at the local thrift store. I thought to myself, why would anyone give away such a seemingly good book. But I now see why.......very wordy. Author obviously was never taught that less is often more. Though the story had lots of potential, I couldn't force myself past chapter 6. I kept hoping it would get better and it didn't."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I have heard of this series of books for years and never read it until I went into a book store to pre order a book and never one to walk out of a book store empty handed came out with this book, figuring it was time to give it a try. I wish I hadn't waited so long, there are few books that I absolutely love this one joins that short list. I could not put this book down and for those like me who held off because of the fact Phedre enjoys being bound and tortured during sex a genre of books I don't enjoy reading. Well skim them if you must its easy enough because thankfully they are not so bad the detail isn't there she fades in and out on the sex scenes so they have no meat to them this is not an erotica book. So trust me don't skim them because in doing so you lose out on an important part of Phedre personality and the strength of her character. But if you must you must, I understand this kind of stuff isn't for everyone, me included but you'll love this book trust me."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I don't give out five stars lightly, but I really enjoyed this book and I'm glad I have two sequels to read. This way I won't miss Phedre. I'll see her in the next book.One thing I liked almost immediately is that some of the main characters die. It seems odd to say, but think about it. Who dies in Lord of the Rings? Against all odds, nearly every major character survives. You have no guarantees here. Your favorite character may be killed. So you have an appropriate sense of danger and uncertainty.It reminds me of the game Dungeons and Dragons, in which your personal character could well be killed, and if he or she is ... then sayonara, make another one, that one is kaput, and it gives more meaning to the game.The book's hero is the most unlikely one I've ever come across. It's rare enough that the hero is a woman, but this one is a prostitute, and if that isn't enough of a surprise for you, she is an intensely masochistic one.Your first reaction may be similar to mine. Madonna performed a song about spankings and had a major hit with it, so a little masochism is mainstream, and what is so special about Phedre's masochism? It's an accepted form of foreplay these days.But in Phedre's case, the intensity of pain that pleases her is far beyond Madonna. No, you probably have never met an \\"anguisette\\" like Phedre.Now that we are given an extremely erotic leading character, a second surprise is that the story is not porn. It is about war and politics, about love and loyalty, with just a bit of sex thrown in. It's not a sex book masquerading as sci fi fantasy.I think my biggest complaint with the writing is that some of the characters don't stand out for me. There are a lot of somewhat royal characters, or \\"peers\\", and I sometimes have trouble attaching an individual character to them. Who was Barquiel again? What did he do?There is a pretty picture of our darling and heroic Phedre on the paperback cover, and there is a list of the main characters in the front, as Tolstoy includes in War and Peace. What I really would have appreciated is a drawing of many of the main characters, so I could attach a face, a uniform, something, to each of these people, instead of just a name, because there are really a lot of names to keep track of.In this Republican era of ours, nobody is going to turn this into a movie, or a trilogy of movies. That's our loss. I'd love to see the movie.One of the things I like best about this book is its free attitude towards sexuality. Bisexuality is the norm, and isn't even frowned upon. Good. Although I'm not gay, some of my friends are, and they are as good as anyone else. I like the respect that their lifestyle is given in this book. Nothing to be ashamed of. If you disagree, you are an ignorant bigot, and that's that. It's not an issue to debate. It's a right vs. wrong issue, as direct as two plus two.The Nazis would have a hard time with this book, because their favorite victims, Jews, gypsies, and homosexuals, are all treated with kindness by the author. But this book is much too Francophile. The French, here called D'Angelines, are really just too smug about their good looks. They are so superior. Come to think of it, that's a weakness of the book.We even have a French version of a Shaolin monk as one of the stars of the story. In the Shaolin tradition of the fighting monk, we have Joscelin, the samurai superstar with swordplay, the Musashi of France, practicing his katas every morning and nearly unbeatable against multiple opponents.The author had to wrestle with the problem of what a \\"happy ending\\" would be for our darling Phedre. Should she get married to her true love? But she is so promiscuous, so masochistic, and her true love is not the Marquis de Sade. She'd be bored and frustrated with him, no?Well, I'll start on the next book and see what happens to my Phedre. See you soon, honey."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I cannot remember the last time a book grabbed me so hard and so fast I read the entire 600+ pages in two days. I then read the next two books over the course of the rest of the week. What a treat! The writing is more than capable, the premise well set, the plot well thought out and not contrived at all, and the characters developed so well you feel you know them personally. This may well be the best first book I've ever read. As such, it's so much better than most author's any number book, you should read this just for the sheer pleasure. Do yourself a favor, though, and don't read the jacket. It does not do the book justice and will only mislead you into thinking the book is as tawdry as the jacket. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"To be brief, if you want fantasy without the fluff, Martin and Carey are where it's at. \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" is rife with intrigue, sexuality, battles that have a point(not just filler), and characters you come to care about.It is pleasantly long, with the only slow period in the beginning.Fill the long wait until \\"Feast of Crows\\" with Carey and her marvelous heroine, Phedre."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"After reading the summary of this book I thought I was really in for a treat, but I think the author made the mistake of taking her story a bit too seriously. I got so tired of stumbling upon more and more bits of history with names that didn't matter and events that played no part in the story. With such potential for action and danger she treated it like a history lesson with characters who fit into stock molds rather than having distinct personalities. I think the editor is at fault mainly-- he or she should have realized the potential the actual plot had and told the author to rewrite it in a different style, because it might have turned out something really great. At it is now, though, it's far too wordy and serious. Even the darkest and most dangerous stories need a hint of humor. Get rid of all the flowery descriptions, the boring history lessons, and add a little dirt into the mix. Everything and everyone was too perfect to make me think that this world could be real. I couldn't even finish it, even after getting to what is supposed to be the \\"exciting\\" part. I just didn't care to know what came next."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I have been looking for quite a while to find another series to keep me going while waiting for the next work by George RR Martin. Even Martin's 4th Book, didn't live up to expectation and I am still waiting. I tried Weeks, Ruckley, Williams, Marco and nothing has lived up to Martin, again not even Martin. Weeks almost pulled it off.I really enjoyed the first 600 pages of Kushiel's Dart, unfortunately it really lost my interest in the remaining 300 pages. Some people have been critical of the books beginning saying it took too long to get started. I liked the slow beginning and enjoyed the back stories...infact to me the best stuff in Martin's works are the back stories.There has been a lot of attention drawn to the sex in the book. I found it tastefully written and not nearly as graphic as in some other books. Even Martin's sex scenes I felt were more rauchy than this book, the sex in this book was not over the top or shocking and handled quite nicely.The author can write and the world she created is interesting, but for whatever reason, it lost me around page 300.I will wait a while before I try some of the sequals, I hear they are good, but I am a bit Kushieled out."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"In Terre d'Ange, physical perfection means freedom and anything less denotes some form of bondage. Phedre no Delaunay is born with a red speck on her left eye, which means a life of slavery. Because of he &quot;scarlet letter&quot; on her eye, as a child, she is sold to eventually work as a servant of Naamah, providing pleasures to the free people of Terre d'Ange.However, unlike the rest of the free masses, noble freethinker Anafiel Delaunay, upon seeing the red spot, feels Phedre's mar is not a flaw. He believes it represents a greater perfection. He buys Phedre's marque and begins to educate her for more than the art of pleasure. She begins to spy for him, but soon becomes embroiled in a dastardly plot to dethrone the King, in which she struggles to warn His Highness before doomsday arrives.KUSHIEL'S DART is a powerful, extraordinary exotic political fantasy that never slows down yet fully develops the key cast and the culture. The epic fantasy story line is loaded with action that flows due to the characters seeming genuine while providing a deep look into a different culture and way of life. No one will believe that this is Jacqueline Carey's debut because her first published novel has to have come from someone with at least a five-book resume.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I found this book incredibly annoying. It was recommended to me by several friends and I ploughed through it in hope the story would improve. It never did.First, the author's style is excessively verbose. Throughout the book, you'll find phrases like \\"I measured my length upon the ground.\\" What is wrong with saying, \\"I fell\\"? Another aspect of the author's style is to overly-beautify *everything*. Nothing is *ever* dirty, or ugly, or rotten, or bad.Second, the only character with some depth, personality, and motive to him died less than a third of the way into the book. I almost gave up on the book there. I should have; it would have been a better ending.Third, as if the main character was not enough of a perfect doll-puppet, the author chose to pair her up with a perfectly devoted ideal and idealistic warrior-paladin.For me, this book offered disappointments at every turn."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"\\"Kushiel's Dart\\" is a book that exists primarily for the kinky sex scenes. To their credit, the folks at Tor never tried to pretend otherwise; more than can be said for certain other alleged fantasy novels I can name. Phedre is chosen by the God Kushiel to \\"experience pain and pleasure as one\\", the back cover tells us, and indeed the first four-hundred pages is a profusion of beating, cutting, bondage, and humiliation. Your appreciation of those scenes will depend on whether such kinkiness does it for you. For me the answer is mostly no.On the plus side, Carey puts the greatest amount of effort into that part of the book. The writing is indeed lavish, descriptions are thorough and extravagant. For those who like an intense and very detailed picture of clothing, locations, and personal appearance, this book is tough to beat. The careful attention to details succeeds most noticably in the large number of minor characters: poets, fortune-tellers, guards, and others all stand out from the crowd.The books starts to go off the rails shortway before the halfway point, and just keeps getting worse until the end. The story diverges to the wilds northern Europe, where the barbaric Skaldi are plotting an invasion of Terre d'Agne, Phedre's homeland. The plot becomes a mess of narrow escapes, last-minute rescues, idiotic blunders by the bad guys, and repetitive emotional blather from the good guys. It's bad enough rehashing the idea that one man can single-handedly wipe out whole platoons of well-trained bad guys while barely suffering a scratch. It's worse when Phedre has to spend several pages cowering in fear and anticipating her own doom and then bowing in awe at Joscelin's skills every time it happens. Wrose still are the parting scenes. Whenever characters separate, they first spend half a chapter weeping on each other's shoulders and trying to avoid the inevitable. This book is sprawling enough that it probably contains twenty parting scenes."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Having purchased this book on the basis of the reviews I read ,I'm sorry to say I just could not stay with it , I would strongly recommend anyone thinking of buying this to read a few sample pages before purchase , the names given to the kingdoms,the countries , and the characters made it impossible for me to follow , I can only presume its a slow burner , I could find no empathy with any of the characters , no sense of a plot developing , and by the time I had read about 30% no interest in turning the next page ."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This story, a dark beautiful tale about a girl.

Carey adds too many political people with complicated histories and backgrounds for one to even follow it. I found myself constantly forgetting who was who and what they did 5oo years ago with this person who was the son of this person who did whatever. On top of that the main character, however likable, is a prostitute that does some pretty graphic things just to please her patrons, all in the service of her \\"godess\\". In the end she sells herself for for money towards her freedom. It doesn't exactly send the best message out to young women. After the first book I was so overwhelmed with the amount of rather pointless information that I couldn't bring myself to finsish the series. However, for people who have the patience to remember overwhelming detail and believe prostitution in the name of an idol is fine, this book is great."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"**I intend to warn readers that if you find sexual abuse disturbing, there are several scenes described in this book that will be very off-putting.**Since the book was presented as the tale of someone who actually finds pain pleasurable, I began reading it tentatively at the bequest of a good friend of mine who really enjoyed the story, and gave me her copy to peruse. Halfway through, I seriously regretted ever opening this book. I finished it anyway, not sure if I will read any more of them. I enjoy the eloquent writing style, but find it hard to reconcile with the macabre nature of the story itself.That aside, the one and only issue I find with this book, is that Carey is inconsistent with the psychological profile and development of her main character, who supposedly loves feeling pain(--only not really).Now, keep in mind that although very, very rare, there is actual recognized medical condition(s) that cause people to either feel no pain, or to associate pain with pleasure... But from a psychological point (as in, NOT having a medically-defined origination in an abnormal nervous system, but instead a purely mental reaction), there are only unhealthy methods of associating pain with pleasure, not the least of which is the direct result of prolonged neglect and abuse.Carey at first seems to be presenting her \\"anguissette\\" as the former, a rare person who has NOT been conditioned to associate pain with pleasure, but who does so naturally, automatically. This would have been truly interesting.However. As her character shows more and more of her inner thoughts and reactions to the sadistic sex she is subjected to in the book, it becomes blatantly obvious that it is the latter, and isn't a genuine anguissette at all, but a victim of unfortunate chance and circumstance, who is trying to cope the only way she knows how.Carey's heroine has masochistic tendencies which are the direct result of a childhood of emotional traumas: Abandonment; being sold into slavery at the age of six; the consequent sexual conditioning of being raised by others who are indentured consorts; combined with a deep inner sense of inadequacy. Her low self-esteem is directly due to her one physical flaw: A red splotch in her left eye, marking her as less beautiful than all of her physically flawless peers, and which she is told as a child is the mark of the God Kushiel, who has chosen to doom her to a life of pain and suffering.It reads like a classic case study of a self-destructive, objectified, abused adolescent in foster care. Add in the fact that she is being trained as a spy, so that she will allow herself to be abused and debased in order to gather information for her \\"owner\\" and... its just so icky.Since her only alternative is being kicked out and living on the streets, or worse, it seems to be a situation of obvious coercion, which would be considered criminal by today's standards.Frankly, I love erotica, but I have no desire to read about the sexual exploitation and abuse of anyone, least of all a young girl who has been sold into sexual slavery long before she would have had the psychological maturity to decide if this was the life she actually wanted for herself. (As if \\"slaves\\" have any choice? Seriously.)This is no elegant portrayal of Courtesans or self-possessed Companions, but rather a tale of a young girl being pimped out to a rival gang of politicians, along with her foster-brother, by their \\"protective\\" foster-father. She supposedly can choose to decline any of the \\"patrons\\" her master chooses for her, but is NOT allowed to choose any sexual partners for herself. Yes, Freud would have a field day.Given Carey's actual degree in psychology, it is hard to determine if she is trying to make a convoluted, cynical point regarding the hidden dangers in these practices, or if she is actually exploring her own dark fantasies, or something else entirely. Either way, to anyone with any degree of empathy, it is a very disturbing situation being described, sometimes in great detail.Additionally, Carey mentions the children being raised/fostered in the Mandrake and Valerian pleasure houses--dedicated to Sadism and Masochism respectively--they are catatonic, fear-ridden, and broken. These are young children, we're talking preschool & kindergarten aged. Carey is careful to say that the pleasure houses don't actually use them, since they do not start sex-training until the ripe old age of 10, and each house wants to secure a high Virgin Price at the age of 16, but whatever these young children are witnessing, Carey is clever enough to suggest.Again, very disturbing.There is something quite unenlightened in this Utopian fantasy world.\\"Love As Thou Wilt\\" would be fine and perfect, if it were mutual, and if that was really what was taking place, but it isn't. Raising and training someone from childhood to be a sexual plaything, to \\"Be Used As They Wilt\\" is VERY different than embracing sexuality from a healthy, albeit adventurous, place. Pointedly, rape by its very definition is NOT mutual. And a child is incapable of making that kind of choice, without being manipulated and exploited, which is exactly what happens in this story, again and again.If the main character was truly an anguissette, she would enjoy every minute of what is done to her, including being sold into slavery a second time and raped by her new owner--instead of the shame, humiliation, guilt, and hatred which she experiences in these situations. These are normal feelings under such circumstances; there is nothing unusual, nothing defining of an anguissette herein. A healthy masochist is pretty hard to find, but they do exist. I would presume that is what Carey was \\"trying\\" to portray... It really seems to me that Carey just doesn't quite understand this type of person--and projects these negative emotions into a character she has no idea how to authentically express on paper. So instead of depicting someone who enjoys rough sex, she is only describing a young girl who is forcing herself to deal with circumstances beyond her own control, and resenting it.I am no prude, and would have found it interesting to explore this sexually open society right alongside Carey, if she had managed to actually present such a thing.But this book was ridiculously inept at portraying healthy sexual proclivity, no matter how \\"alternative\\" its style. Instead, it presents a cornucopia of human sexual failings, combined with yet another system of dogma excusing them and trying to justify them, without actually doing them any justice.Utterly disappointing, and left me feeling like I had just witnessed crimes, not mutual acts of sexual fulfillment."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Someone wrote:\\"I have to admit that I could not understand why she was throwing herself into bed with almost every male -and quite many female- characters she comes across in the story... as far as she is concerned, she is doing some service to the world. If that is service, all [hookers] are semi-goddesses... She may be enjoying pain with pleasure but human beings still have the ability to show some pride, too, and reject some of the offers thrown their way. Apparently Carey wants us to believe that the sexual pull and need is so strong that it is excusable to make yourself a public toy.\\"This is completely untrue. First of all, Phedre is extremely selective about who she is with. This is emphasized over and over in the book, and I don't understand how you could have read it and missed that. I also find it ironic that you say that if her acts are truely good in this world, then \\"all [hookers] are semi-godesses.\\" In the world of Terre D'Ange, they ARE. This is not historically unprecedented either. In many cultures, women have prostituted themselves as an act of holiness.

Each of these has her charms as a writer, and brings a distinct voice and style to the table.Amazon recommended this book for me, and I almost didn't buy it, based on the blurb. If I hadn't gone on and read the reviews, I would have passed it up. I don't always agree with the common wisdom of Amazon's fan reviews; I quite liked Hamilton's \\"Incubus Dreams,\\" which it seems most of her hardcore Anita Blake fans loathed, but then, I think I'm giving her credit for a complexity that others don't. The reviews for \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" were conflicted, with some loving it and some hating it, so I decided to take the risk and decide for myself.I was flabbergasted by this book. Carey writes with a confidence and clarity scarcely credible in a debut novel. It took me a while to make the connection, but it finally dawned on me that Phedre's voice harks back to Pip, the narrator of Dickens' \\"Great Expectations.\\" Her tale is at turns epic, pathetic, heroic, erotic, but always narrated with sadness, frankness, and detachment, as if over a great span of years. The detail of the narration is consistent with the character; she was trained in the art of observation and information-gathering, in the making of connections and the discernment of patterns in political intrigue, and the clarity with which she recalls the events in her life inevitably manifests itself in the rich descriptions some critical reviewers have labeled verbose. Far from it, in my opinion. Rather, the descriptions are vivid and evocative, the characters limned with subtle judgment and the events often with heartbreaking honesty.Phedre is one of those protagonists one might dismiss or disrespect out of real world distaste. After all, most of us are not comfortable with the kinkier aspects of human sexuality, particularly with the taboo of true masochism. Phedre's world, however, not only condones her proclivities, but elevates them as noble and exalts them as divine. \\"Not all that yields is weak,\\" she reminds us. Phedre plays a complex game of political and sexual intrigue, at first as a pupil of her string-pulling master Delaunay, and then as a master herself. The sexual encounters are pervasive, but not overbearing. Although capable of more \\"vanilla\\" affection and pleasure, Phedre must also satisfy her god-driven need to be dominated and abused, during which her release is far more intense and profound as compared to more mundane couplings.One of the earlier reviews complained that there wasn't enough sex, and that the torture scenes were not explicit enough. Other reviewers claim that the subject matter is merely tawdry. I believe both sides are rather missing the point. More explicit tales of sexual sadism and masochism are readily available for download on the internet, without the burden of a masterfully told story. There are other well-crafted romantic fantasy epics out there that don't ask us to reserve judgment based on personal choices of sexual morality and taste. The sex scenes here are quite specific enough to show us the depth of Phedre's need to be hurt, the extent of the physical damage to which she is driven to subject herself, and the sincerity with which she believes that her pursuits not only fulfill her personal sexuality, but also glorify her patron dieties. One other criticism I've seen is that the sex scenes are merely a device Carey uses to add information to the plot. This I find to be a nonsensical criticism. As a courtesan, sexual assignations are by definition one way in which Phedre collects information, and if Carey did not use them as a means to advance the plot, they would be merely licentious. As it is, each scene reveals something about Phedre and her patron, as well as advancing the plot by revealing some new strand of the political web.In addition to a remarkable heroine in Phedre, \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" gives us one of the most intriguing villains I've run across in a lifetime of reading sci-fi and fantasy. Melisande Shahrizai is the treacherous, traitorous noble whom Phedre loves, hates, fears, and desires, all at once. The first half of the book builds a steady anticipation of their inevitable sexual encounter, and the rest of the story is driven by the fallout from it. Though Phedre hates her, Melisande is the only person ever to take her to her limits physically. Though they are fated to be deadly opponents in the politics of nations, Phedre knows that Melisande's death would result in the loss of her truest soulmate and deepest sexual fulfillment.This is strong praise from one not generally inclined to give it. I recommend this book to all who are not offended by the sexuality of its main character."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"As many reviewers have remarked, the last three hundred pages are so painful to get through. Absolutely painful,mind numbing rubbish. Watch as our perfect heroine saves the world and displays an array of talents and skills a super hero in a comic book universe wouldn't even have ! This is too bad because for the first part of the book we see Phedre develop in her training, master some of her demons, and show just how fallible she is as a human. Her interaction with Joscelin I really enjoyed. Out of all the characters I enjoyed Joscelin the most actually. The sexual content of this book is mentioned by many who have read the book. It's there in varying degrees, especially in the first part of the book. The author did a good job of making such scenes interesting, though erotic is not the word I would use to describe them. Apparently many people would. I finished this book out of determination and not much else, and I have no intention of reading the rest of the series. Where the sterling reviews come from I can't say. Though Phedre starts off as a unique and interesting character, by the end of the book she is similar to so many others: perfect, beautiful and destined for both glory and self sacrifice."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is one of the more difficult reviews I've ever tried to write. Reading Kushiel's Dart I found myself torn over how I felt about the book. The reviews here are mostly highly complementary and praised Jacqueline Carey for the artistry of her writing. And yet, I feel obligated to rate this story at 2 stars.To be honest, if the claims of the positive reviews had been a little less overblown I might be inclined to have pushed this up to 3 stars. The story is not horrible, and I was more disappointed than upset, but the flaws are obvious and definitely impacted my enjoyment.The book does have good points. While I disagree with the \\"intricately plotted\\" claim, it does have a solid plot thread carried through the entire story and the story is coherent around the single plot thread. The character development Is limited, but solid and as many positive reviewers point out Jacqueline Carey is very skilled at painting with words. Her descriptions of a fanciful land of beautiful people who are commanded to \\"Love as you will\\" are stirring.Unfortunately, many of the virtues became vices when taken too far, and that happened here.Intricately plotted is one of the common comments, but the basic plot is not very intricate. The story plays out as a tale of national politics and the succession to the throne of a country. I found the rest of the plot neither intricate, nor unusual. I've read many mysteries that were far more confusing and clouded. Here everyone's motives are rather transparent, even the one villainess that Jacqueline Carey clearly sees as the Moriarty of the tale. And while there are a number of factions, none plays a true doublecross. Each moment of the plot occurs in sequence with almost no simultaneous actions. After reading stories like George R.R Martin's epic, the plotting here is actually rather pedestrian.The character development is one of the largest drawbacks. Each character is lovingly described by Jacqueline and I'm sure that many readers will say that they \\"loved\\" one or more characters. The problem is that after one clear description almost none of the characters change. Even Phedre remains much the same at the end of the book as she was in the beginning, and she grows the most. Many of the other characters are introduced once and then barely seen again.My biggest complaint has to be the same flowery and vivid descriptions that many reviewers loved. They did help bring parts of the story to life, but they also slowed the story down. The whole first third of the story is backstory. When the first major plot twist finally occurs it not only isn't a surprise, but its almost a welcome relief from the chapters of descriptions of Phedre's service to her master. Not that the later chapters necessarily change much. I could use a simpler description of how Phedre solves many of her problems, but it would be perhaps a bit unfair to future readers. It was less imaginative than I would have expected and after a while definitely more than a bit repetitive.In the end I did not dislike the book, but after having my expectations raised so high by other reviewers I was extremely disappointed. The feeling I got was that this book receives its reviews partly because it was rather unique. Before this book was written, few authors tried to write a romantic tale of political intrigue in a world where prostitution is a religious event and have the heroine be not only a pseudo-priestess, but the chosen of the demigod of masochists. Its definitely a titillating idea and had to influence many of the reviewers.I will not tell anyone not to read this book. In fact, if you took the time to read to the end of this review, I'd say that you probably will enjoy reading the book. It's not a bad book, just a bit overhyped. The flaws are there, but so are the virtues that brought many to give the story five stars. I just will not add this book to my collection, nor do I expect to go out of my way to read it again. It is what it is, a decently written first novel that managed to find a spot in literature that was rarely used, and it struck a chord with the reading audience.I do suggest that people checking this review note that over time Jacqueline Carey's stories have been seeing their ratings slide. Her third trilogy in this universe has more than a few fans saying that they are dropping her as a favorite author. I actually came to start reading her work her through her third tiloguy and the overall quality of the writing is higher in those later books. However, by that time many reviewers are complaining about the same issues I see in Kushiel's Dart. The scanty plots and overwritten descriptions were always there, but many reviewers did not notice until they started the third trilogy. Sad, because Jacqueline is a very talented writer, she just needs to put a bit more time into building the plot before publishing."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I bought this book on a whim. I have seen it for years at the library, and finally bought it when I was in need for some summer entertainment. I was excited to find the first installment in a series that spent time on developing complex story lines, deep characters, awesome sex scenes and heart pounding adventure.A few words of warning:1. Complex story line: It is a bit difficult to get pass the first 50 or 100 pages, as the fantasy world is so complex. Carey weaves this story to contain political and religious intrigue in a fantasy world where is can be a bit confusing at first. If you are not an avid fantasy reader, and thus are not used to being thrust into a completely different world, this book might be a bit difficult2. Sex: The sex is great! However, Phadre is a courtesan, so don't be shocked by all the people she sleeps with. Also, the whole concept is she feels pleasure and pain simultaneously. Therefore, there is some hard core S and M stuff. The important thing to remember is that SHE LIKES IT. Some reviewers were disgusted with this concept, but it is further developed in later books in the series to show that there is a deeper meaning to this.3. Adventure: A lot happens, and rather quickly. For the first 250 to 300 pages, the scene is set up. We learn about the world Phadre lives in, her courtesan work, and her learning to be a spy. Then suddenly, she is thrust into a twisting and turning adventure. This is a book for readers who are in for a long, but worth while book.Yet with all this, I LOVED IT! I highly recommend it to any fantasy reader, romance reader or all around hard core reader (who is excited by 1000 page books)."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Beware readers the plot in this one is quite complicated and because of this there is a large cast of characters whom we are required to get to know. Some will be quite overwhelmed in the first few hundred pages, I nearly packed it in frustratedly near to 100 pages after being introduced to seemingly endless names of the lords, ducs, kings, queens and massive families of the books world. You will probably need to glance over the extensive character listing at the start of the book several dozen times. Thankfully by the end you will find you can recite the character listing by heart and you can read through without interruption.So do not under any circumstances stop in the first quarter of the book and make sure you are well rested cause the book doesnt just slide into the story once the vast character list is introduced it will explode. Its fast paced till the end, no time is ever wasted on the unnesesary, if Phedre needs to move through a country it is done in a page or two, no frivilaties on what she wore each day or how many rabbits she saw.Phedre is a prostitute (glorified in this world thanks to there religion) and an anguissette, someone who gets pleasure from pain, Phedre is the only one there is so its very rare. She is taken in and is trained to be a spy, shes given knowlegde aplenty and taught how to use it to listen, learn, think and manipulate. With her formidable array of talents she plays a large part when her country reaches the brink of war and its leaders are to busy stabbing each others backs to stop it.The sex is mostly of the violent persuasion but it very tastefully done and not once was it without reason. It tapers off greatly in the second half when the action picks up so even if you find it offensive not much detail is given after the first few scenes so be strong and endure.Also I woudnt say this was the first part of a trilogy cause the story does end the next book would be more like a sequel, though it doesnt really matter if you finish this book you will read the next most happily.4 stars for the first half, 100 stars for the rest so an easy 5 stars for a brilliant read."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"It is difficult to classify this book. It borrows tools from many genres (Romance, Mystery, Historical Fiction, to name a few) while being true to them all. The main character is a \\"legal courtesan.\\" I agree with the previous reviewer that I thought this would be an endless tale of sexcapades. There was great sex, but also a rich tale of mystery and tragedy. Characters were fleshed out, even secondary characters. This entire trilogy was deeply satisfying, and I am delighted there will be a second trilogy about Phedre's \\"son.\\""},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is not my first book by Carey. I read Banewreaker and Godslayer first and I must admit that I liked those better. They are, however, very different so there's no point in trying to compare them.For one thing, it is really beautifully written. I can easily say that Carey can create believable characters and at least she offers some surprises so we don't find ourselves in the midst of a cliche. The setting is remarkably well painted - though I must say that the dozens of names and characters flying towards the reader is more than a little confusing. I understand that she meant to write intrigue, but one can write about deception and throne games without staging hundreds of actors - see George Martin's Fire and Ice series, for instance.Now to the part I didn't like - I agree with those who said that Phedre was too 'perfect' and that she solves almost every problem she comes across by sleeping with someone and endowing her 'gift'. Sure, she has a few flaws, but even those are easily forgiveable and more cute than despising. She comes across so self-sacrificing and incapable of jealousy or greed that it's hard to feel symphathy for her suffering. Not to mention that there isn't much of that, anyway. Undergoing torture and hardship is not much suffering, in my book. Going through some personal dilemna would be far more convincing, I think.I have to admit that I could not understand why she was throwing herself into bed with almost every male -and quite many female- characters she comes across in the story. Sure, Carey strives to make it look like its for the best and a good reason and all that, but I think she fails badly in that. Especially once Phedre begins to have some emotions for another, I think it's rather unbecoming that she can still go around giving herself so freely and not feeling at least a little bit abashed at the whole act. As far as she is concerned, she is doing some service to the world. If that is service, all whores are semi-goddesses. I understand that Phedre's culture encourages this and that she is brought up to do it. But as I have said, this action is plausible before she loses her heart. After that it seems like a far less graceful act to me. She may be enjoying pain with pleasure but human beings still have the ability to show some pride, too, and reject some of the offers thrown their way. Apparently Carey wants us to believe that the sexual pull and need is so strong that it is excusable to make yourself a public toy.In short, although the whole story is based on revering the act of casual sex, I still found Carey's excuses simply that - excuses to introduce eroticism into a book. If Phedre had been more selective and if she had undergone some mental or spiritual change in the course of the book due to her actions, I would have thought different. But a woman who solves problems in this way and this way alone is not much interesting to me. That might symbolize a sort of strength to some people, but I like women who deal with matters outside the bedchamber. That is not to say that she doesn't show wit and courage - she does. But those acts hardly lead to anything unless they are sealed with an arduous endeavour.It is not a bad read at all. I think one could enjoy it if one can cast aside some female pride and the belief that there is more to the world than just sex. If you can't -and Carey couldn't persuade me to- than you're looking at an impressive novel with a weak base."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"There are few things in the world better than a book with teeth. I read it first with Anne Bishop and her Black Jewels trilogy, which can't even compare with this. Kushiel's Dart is a reading pleasure that is most aptly described as decadent, alluring, and intriguing. It's like that chocolate mousse cake that gives you shivers just thinking about it.Carey holds nothing back in this, a tale about a courtesan whose greatest pleasure is pain. But Phedre is more than a courtesan; she's a spy, a tool, and a weapon of a god.The author does an amazing job of presenting the character. Phedre's life, from a very young age, is generally centered around specific things, like servitude, her education, or her assignations. For a character who is tightly controlled by those around her and given little space to develop as a person, she has a lot of depth. Aside from being at constant odds with her own masochistic nature, Phedre also struggles daily, in very human ways, with her various relationships. Through her eyes you see just how thin the lines between love and hate, and friend and lover, really are.And you DO see the story through Phedre's eyes. Very few authors write in first person--mainly because most can't. It's often difficult to keep your character from meandering aimlessly in their own head, when you write in first person. Phedre does a little of this, but Carey keeps it mostly in hand. The world narrows down to Phedre's point of view, so we see only what she sees, and we learn of the things happening elsewhere in the world only if she does. This narrowing of vision may cause some to feel like conflicts are resolved too easily, but generally it is simply that our heroine is not the driving force behind all resolutions.Aside from writing well in first person, Carey pulls off another writing style that, quite frankly, is impressive. It's what I like to call PWS (Pretty Word Syndrome). It's amazing the amount of books that are considered wonderful simply because the author writes like an overly flowery thesaurus. Pretty words do NOT a good book make. More often than not, I find such flowery language annoying to the point of potential book throwing.Carey pulls it off with astounding finesse. Somehow she manages to be consistent with her language and yet not overbearing. I can't put my finger on what, percisely, makes it work--perhaps the D'Angeline society itself--but it does work.The world is fascinating, too. It's a sort of mythological alternate history in some ways. The mythology itself feels sort of Greek, such as the story of the creation of Elua, patron god of Phedre's home country. But it is different enough from the mythology we know to keep the world from feeling like a simple slightly altered copy. Plus, since it unravels outward from Phedre's vision, you see it as she sees it.One thing I must say, though, and this is no reflection on Ms. Carey: TOR needs to stop being such cheap b-----ds. They need to stop using cheap ink that comes off all over my fingers. They need to construct their books better so the things don't practically come apart in my hands. And they HAVE to be more considerate of their authors and start getting them REAL editors. Carey holds her own very well, proving that she has great talent. But did an editor go through this book? I have my doubts. Never mind other examples of atrocious editing jobs I've seen out of TOR books...there were simply some mistakes in this book that NEVER should have been. Things a three-year-old wouldn't miss. TOR, just because you have a monopoly on bestselling fantasy authors doesn't give you the right to be lazy and cheap!Even if the masochistic angle appeals to you not at all, you might want to give this a shot. It's an oasis in the middle of the desert, compared to the many, many books about stupid farm boys, magic swords, and wise old wizards. Three cheers for books that bite!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The lead character in this epic novel uses the above line to describe her own lot in life. Phedre is an apparently cursed orphan who is adopted by a mysterious nobleman and trained to be an erotic spy, gleaning empire-shaking intelligence as she services the wealthy and powerful of a renaissance kingdom. Jacqueline Carey has created a rather imaginative setting for this epic - a medieval Europe enveloped in an alternate history in which the far-flung cultural influence is Celtic and Gothic rather than Roman, while Christianity has followed a different course and developed into a set of sensual and erotic oath-making. Phedre is a very impressively well-drawn heroine, and Carey obviously put a lot of work into the creation of this deep and complex character. Phedre's two closest companions are equally interesting - the valiant but confused bodyguard Joscelin, and the mischievous but perceptive gypsy traveler Hyacinthe.Sadly, the fascinating backdrop and intriguing lead characters are often lost under wave upon wave of unnecessarily complex writing. The story is centered in a France-like kingdom full of unbelievably beautiful noblemen and duchesses, surrounded by realms of crude barbarians, all of which are predictable fantasy stereotypes. Political shenanigans are enacted by far too many minor characters who blend together into sameness. As the story (very) slowly unfolds, Phedre works her way through repetitive palace intrigues and political treachery, while later she embarks on an adventure through a never-ending succession of exotic locations and strange foreign peoples. This is all mostly much ado about nothing, and only illustrates an author's exercises in impressively intricate writing, but without much reward to the reader as the plotline is stretched out to interminable lengths. The valiant war of freedom at the height of the novel offers much page-turning action, only to devolve into even more unnecessary palace intrigue at the close.This is a highly intriguing novel that is fascinating at the surface, though with far too much detail that adds little to the overall plot and theme. Also watch out for the graphic descriptions of Phedre's assignations on the job, if you don't happen to be turned on by large amounts of masochism and bondage. But this epic is still recommended because of the great lead character of Phedre, who is surely a heroine complex enough to inspire many large literary epics."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I realize that I just finished a review for this book, but after reading some other reviews, I wanted to add another thought.Jacquline Carey is a new writer on the level of Guy Gavriel Kay. I am highly surprised that anyone would compare her to Martin or Jordan--neither of them could approach the quality and complexity that infused Kushiels Dart. I have read widely in both the science fiction and fantasy genres, and only Tolkien and Kay have displayed the talent and lushness of description possessed by Carey.While Martin certainly has talent, don't try to compare him with Carey--there is no comparison. Don't get me started on Jordan. Besides, a real Jordan fan probably wouldn't like this book anyway."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The first half of this book is dry, lots of mapping out the geography, family lines, who's who, history, and introductions. It gets textbooky at times, but if you can stick with it, you find yourself definitely immersed and knowledgeable of the setting. Which makes the story all the richer when real plot twisting events start taking place.There is some serious storytelling going on here, and I found that once I got past the first 200 or so pages, I couldn't put it down. The next two books manage to get even better. The characters are very well fleshed out, and I found myself loving Phadr&eacute;, her experiences, antics, highs lows, and everything in between.I'm not a real fan of the fantasy genre, but this does not dissapoint. Multilayered, complex fantasy for adults."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Confession time: I am leery of fantasy that deals with the erotic, mostly because I got burned to a crisp by Laurell K. Hamillton's badly pornographic dreck. Thus, I've been skirting around this one for a long time, but finally took a bold step and read it...I was not pleased with what I read: No, I am blown away by it! The writing is lush and evocative, reminiscent of Tanith Lee but less meandering, the characters well-drawn and very human. In the hands of a less capable writer, they could easily collapse into cliches -- I shudder at the things the under-aged and less-creative fankiddy fanfiction writers could twist Phedre no Delaunay and her companions into (perhaps Ms. Carey's ban on fanfiction based on her work is for our protection as much as the protection of her intellectual property), bur Jacqueline Carey masterfully keeps their personalities and voices consistent. The sexual content is always handled delicately and deftly, even in the more cringe-inducing moments, never devolving into cheap pornography, but always remaining elegant and erotic.I'll admit that, aside from Tolkien, I'm not a big fan of epic fantasy, but Ms. Carey manages to break out of the too-often copied Tolkien tropes and breathe new life into a genre in need of it. Her world-building is excellent and makes you wish you could live in a place like Terre D'Ange, that our world really had a parellell twin just like it. The mythos of Elua, the angelic offspring of Yeshua and Mary Magdelen, at first glance might seem yet another spin on the already beat-to-death Dan Brown cliches, but she manages to make something lovely and breath-taking from it. This book is a joy and a delight, and for all its length, you catch yourself wishing it wouldn't end -- which leads you to reach for the follow-up volumes."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"this book about about a girl who was born with the mark of a god on her and the story basically follows her life and the trouble she faces because of this mark.the girl is intelligent and she uses her intellect as her weapon. i'd classify this series as an adventure, but phedre doesn't 'fight'. in fact when she's in physical trouble someone has to go save her and she can't really help herself, but that's not to say that she's a wilting heroine. she earns her own respect by acting on her own and overcomes situations by using her brain. quite the odd heroine by the norm's standards.the author's pretty good with words and has done a bit of research (winning combination). many things in the novel have a real world reference.it's adventurous, erotic and suspenseful, and i'd say one of those stories you'd call epic. it's around 900 pages, but you'll get through it and be grateful you went through the trek. when i first bought this book i delayed reading it. i didn't think it'd be that good and it was close to 900 pages, but i finally bit the bullet and got into it, and i don't regret readng a single page! this is a book that should be experienced!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I hated this book. I wanted to forget I ever read it as soon as it was over, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. (Though probably not as bad as some of the tastes Phedre's had in hers.)This book was recommended to me from several sources and I finally gave in and bought it. My mistake. The characters are flat and mostly uninteresting. No one in this book has any flaws, not even the villains. Drustan was the only character with any kind of physical imperfection, but guess what? Having a club foot no way impeded his ability to walk, run, ride, fight, or even dance. He seemed like a desperate attempt by the author to show some kind of range and she failed miserably.Everyone is beautiful, because \\"they're descended from angels\\" and while that is an interesting plot point in theory, it was executed terribly. The author's writing style is overly flowery and pretentious. It seemed at times as though she was just grinding the readers nose into her book going \\"look at all the big words I know!\\" The beginning of the book was the most annoying for me, because she was constantly alluding to things that would happen... eventually. I don't need to hear about things that may happen some point in the future, that's why I'm reading the book. To find out what happens next.Her fascination with Melisande seemed contrived and didn't fit with the setting. If everyone around Phedre is beautiful, including herself, then why did she swoon every time this one woman walked in the room? It seems to me like a gaping plothole that the author covered with the same curtain Sirius Black fell through.What I found funny is that towards the end I got the feeling that even the author was bored with her book. The book is about a courtesan, and yet she didn't bother with the effort of describing any of her liasons after the first two or three. The people that aren't interested in the erotic part of the book have already been scared away and the people that are will be disappointed by the second half. If you're going to write an erotic dark fantasy novel, at least commit to it. Don't cop out halfway through.In the end, my biggest problem was Phedre herself. I didn't get any sense that she evolved throughout the book. She was the same obnoxious, shallow whore that she was in the beginning of the book. Her only character flaw is that she likes sex too much? That's her character flaw? That's what is supposed to make me care about what happens to her, the thing that makes her human? Sorry, not buying it. Also, that whole episode on the Master of the Straits' island? Where she felt the need to rub in how terribly beautiful she was, when compared to those poor plain peasant girls?Nice that you're so pretty. Too bad you are also shallow and useless. Like this book."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book is probably nothing like what you expect. Certainly, I avoided it for years because I didn't want to read some bad BDSM fantasy romance novel tripe. The thing is, that's not, despite any plot summary anyone could possible give you, what this book is -- at all. It's about spies and elitism and a really fascinating spiritual mythology. Sure the main character can be a bit of a Mary Sue since she's the best at everything ever and even has weird eyes, but at the end of the day the main character here works because she has a sense of humor about herself and the book manages to work because it takes its narrative entirely seriously. Weird thing. Often surprisingly moving. Not as smutty or as silly as you think."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"It took a while for me to be able to keep all of the characters straight, but around 1/2-3/4 of the way through the book, everyone was FINALLY becoming familar enough to me that I could really get into it.

DUNE is my favorite book, and so naturally I sigh whenever I see the comparison. But this book is the first I've read that deserves it. No, it isn't as good. But the world it creates is convincing, and it does tangled politics almost as well as DUNE does, though the human element is lacking somewhat, because there are too many characters.Many things are striking about this first novel by Jacqueline Carey. The first is the sex, which is everywhere and explicit. I didn't find it offensive, but some might. It's certainly different than any other fantasy novel I've read.The world the author created is my favorite part. This is an alternate-history Europe, but much of what we recognise as our world can be found. My favorite creation are the Yeshuites, who resemble the Jews of our world, with the obvious difference that they follow Yeshu ben Yosef. The authors use of languages is excellent, and I like that she invents words. She does this rarely. More often, she just uses words that not everyone knows.My only complaint is with some of the writing. This is a first novel, and for all its intricate, well-laid plotting, there are some gaps in the style, where the book is too wordy, and the love story at the end does seem to come out of nowhere. Two people end up together because, I guess, they're what's left.But this book is good despite these quibbles, and I look forward to reading the sequel. Check it out at your local library if you're a fan of fantasy, adventure, or alternate-history."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"\\"Kushiel's Dart\\" details court politics and barbarian customs before rambling through an unrealistic conclusion.The orphaned heroine Phedre is raised as an indentured courtesan. Carey's social structure for this organized prostitution feels completely natural. Early chapters drag with exposition, but they reveal the depth in Terre D'Ange, Carey's alternate-history Renaissance France. The backstory also establishes Angeline theology, a strong element throughout the novel.Phedre glides through the opulent society as a courtesan and spy. This section of the novel flourishes in Phedre's relationships. She learns from Delaunay and Cecile, she shares with Alcuin, and her service begins. Carey shows high society clothing and behavior in vivid detail. A jarring shift yanks Phedre into the second section, an exile among barbarian tribes. She uses her courtesan skills to survive and to uncover a scheme for the throne.The third section of the novel turns Phedre into a royal agent. Here, \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" stumbles. Phedre seducing barbarian chieftains and a provincial lord feels completely appropriate. Phedre convincing two foreign monarchs to launch an invasion, devising the plan that stops a rebel army, and infiltrating siege lines feels ridiculous. Carey's realism and detail also falter. The sea god feels inconsistent in such a realistic fantasy novel. Sailors fight land combat for no apparent reason other than to name a military unit \\"Phedre's Boys.\\" The Angeline name for Greek fire is just translated French.Carey's narrative is dense. Antiquated words and verbose phrasing set the Renaissance mood, but they also impede the flow. Some paragraphs contain only one huge sentence of independent clauses linked by semicolons. At approximately 300,000 words, the novel runs extremely long.Despite these flaws, \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" is the most rich and original fantasy since George R. R. Martin. Carey's alternate-history Renaissance France and her realistic characters are a welcome departure from stock medieval settings and epic quests."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I finally read this book when a friend recommended it to me, and I was amazed. For a first novel, Kushiel's Dart is epic, thrilling and cunningly plotted, not to mention well-crafted. Some of the scenes were agonizing in their intensity, and it was great fun following along to see who was plotting with who to do what. Although the book does have some shortcomings, they are eclipsed by a magnificent overall story by a gifted storyteller. I will wait, though, to read the next installment, as I am so used to living in this fantasy world I need some time to get used to living in the real one for awhile."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Just finished this book and though it's been a while since I've read fantasy, (though this is borderline fantasy), it reminded me how much fun this genre can be.I must admit that when I started it, I felt a little intimidated when I discovered the pages and pages of character profiles. LOTS of characters. But, you end up grateful for all those profiles and really get to care about most of them.The plot is very intricate and unpredictable. I loved it!At the beginning, there is a sharp learning curve to absorb all the history and politics but it's well worth it. Oh yeah...and the S&amp;M element is interesting, too!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I read this book about a year ago, and didn't really like it afterwards. I picked it up again when several people recommended this book. I gave it another try and found again that this book is lacking.I picked this book because I was intrigued by the BDSM theme of the book. I am very much interested in Alternative lifestyle books especially in the realm of Sci-Fi/Fantasy.I stand by my first impression. My first impression was that Jacqueline Carey liked the idea of having her main character like BDSM but she never gave the reader BDSM. It was more like a tease fade to black. We are told that Phedre like pain with her sex but every time that the book comes close to showing a BDSM it falls short-it paints a negative view about those who likes BDSM with the only one that is not painted as \\"evil\\" is Phedre herself because she wasn't raised \\"in\\" the proper school and wasn't taught anything about her unique gift from her god. So we get an typical romance heroine who likes a little pain with her straight up sex.The plot was typical and boring. A young girl forced into a life of prostitution because her mother was one before her. She is \\"rescued\\" by a good man who raises her in order to use her. She then sets down the road of court intrigue which is a typical of many books in this genre.As far as the sex, it's fluff, it's nothing to do with the BDSM culture. Not that I expect Jacqueline Cary to use crude language but the language in the book is very archaic and a bit out of place. She uses Phallic for a male sexual organ. And she use similar jargon to describe the sexual act it's self. It comes out flat and disjointed.I expected to pick this book up and have a world where BDSM was an acceptable way of life, or a lifestyle choice, but Jacqueline Carey painted a very misguiding, un-research, incoherent, and silly picture of people who live in this type of lifestyle.Carey villains seemed a little to contrived, to formulated and too stereotypical Machiavellian. (and too easily defeated and defeated in a stereotypical bland way) and not in a good way. The enemy in the book is clearly marked in the beginning of the book, and gets the to break Phedre - but again it's the stereotypical and a little boring.I would defiantly check this book out in the library, before you buy any books in this series. I bought the whole series because of the recommendation that I received. Don't take my word-I am just venting an alternate view of the book. Judge for yourselves."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"....if you are not one of them, however, may I recommend something else? ANTHING else, in fact?There is something unduly sad about reading an author who might be a talented wordsmith if not for the fact that this is one long playout of her warped sexual fantasies. I don't demean or condemn this kind of literature; certainly it has its place among people who get off on scenes of cutting and abuse, rape and torture. How lovely. The involvement of children is quite disturbing to me personally, but again, I guess if you're into erotica, you will love this book. I just expect a little more high fantasy and less sexual leather fantasy from Tor. Perhaps they should rename the publishing house TORE."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This review is for the price of the Kindle version.I've read this book. I've read the sequels. I enjoy this author and her characters.I bought a Kindle to hold a number of books in one area without taking up the space that even one paperback does (I'm in the Navy; I don't have room to take too many books on deployment) AND because in my mind, ebooks should be cheaper than physical because there are less producing costs.So why on earth is the Kindle price for these books the same as a paperback? What is the point of buying a $150 electronic storage for books that don't have any further content than the words on the screen, to pay a price for a physical copy that takes up more storage and can be lent/resold/given away, etc? Wouldn't publishers make more money by supplying more ebooks and cheaper costs since it's harder to transfer those files than a physical book?"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"For how popular this novel and it's sucessors are, I find it hard to believe that all the people seeming to be reading are really understanding it. To put it simply, this book is more difficult to read than Guy Gavriel Kay, and that's saying something. The intricate language and complicated situations would normally be fascinating to me, but in this instance, the author comes across as not sounding intelligent, but trying to sound impressive. I thought the purpose of writing a novel was to entertain your readers, not confuse them and to try and sound smart at their expense. Right now I'm not trying to represent those of lesser intelligence, because seriously, this book is very hard to read. I found myself zoning out as I tried to stay focused. Also, though someone thinking about buying this book probably would have already figured this fact out from reviews, this book basically deals with a woman whose occupation is prostitution, and in the fantasy world in whcih she lives, it isn't a career that was frowned upon. Another thing to be wary of- if the very erotic bothers you, skip this book. The author really gets into the varied S&M forms of sex in Kushiel's Dart. The biggest problem I had is that it seems to be the norm that with these complex stories, many extraneous characters and events are introduced into the plot- and then never have any significance later on. Well, why is that? To add more color to the story? It's just exasperating. I've spoken with several of my friends to whom I've passed my copy of Kushiel's Dart along to, and when I mention the length and difficulty of reading the language, there is the common reaction of looking embarrassed, and then saying something like, \\"Well, yeah, it was hard to read... but everyone says it was so good!\\" Well, the storyline was definately interesting, and the fact that the author could write an entirely fictional story with governmental intrigue and the like is most impressive. I'm not adverse to books that are of complicated material- I think it adds spice to overused cliches of storylines. However, I was suprised that no one else mentioned in their reviews how hard this book was to read."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I did not like it. I rarley put down a book yet I did not make it past page 75. This is not a fantasy book it is about S&amp;M and politics . I was looking forward to reading a good fantasy book and instead got S&amp;M."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Bad book- too much annoying go-at-it sex and violence, not enough of a real plotline to keep me interested, and how can any of you justify reading this book in public? It'll scare people. All three in the series have a chunky shirtless woman on the cover."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"A racing novel by Jacqueline Carey, 'Kushiel's Dart' is the first in a thrilling trilogy. The heroin, Phe'dre no Delauny, is a sexual masochist, one struck by Kushiel's dart. In her world, politics and religion are two high ranking things.I thoroughly enjoyed this book because of the exquisite writing; deep, intricate plot, and lovely characters."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This was a very good book and definately different. By the time I was done reading this one, it felt like I had read 3 book's worth of information, as this one is very involved and will take you through many different tales. The descriptions were very good, and even if you're a bit shy reading about an anguisette, the writing is fabulously done and the visions are created with great care. I am anxiously awaiting the 2nd book!!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Kushiel's Dart is intriguing. The characters and society are richly layered and compelling. The addition of the pain/pleasure aspect to Phaedre's personality as well as her position in society made for an intriguing main character. During the second half--the book begins to drag and become increasingly repetetive, but it picks back up once Phadre and Jocelyn begin their quest to clear their names. There are elements of cheesy romance novel and fantasy interwoven in what is truly an elaborate and fascinating novel."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"A story well told, wrought with intrigue, betrayal, passion and lust. Don't be daunted by the length of the book. It may take a wee bit to get a feel for who's who, but well worth it. Highly recommended, particularly for those who thrive on the sci fi/fantasy genre."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I was very surprised on how much I enjoyed this book. It held much old mythology and interplayed it with a twist. I found this book to be written for those with intelligence and imagination. For a book whose main character is a religious prostitute the is sex without the book being about sex more the politic and dynamics of the world this character finds herself. I am working on the next novel Kushiels Choosen and it is as intriguing at the first."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is a fascinating portrait of a young woman coming into her strength. From humble beginnings, Phedre no Delaunay is transformed by the meeting of outside forces with her own personal choices into one who is only reluctantly aware of the power she wields over others. The book is a political journey more than a physical one, which probably earned it the comparison to Dune. The Hero's Tale is here, though it lacks Dune's wanderings into areas of contemporary concern. We learn much about Terre D'Ange and its sea of characters, but outside the tale itself, there is little. Alas, this lack is aggravated by the Europe-ish world, with nary an attempt to make it someplace truly unique. That and the overwrought language made for frustrating reading at times. Overall, however, I found I was caught up in the inevitability of events enough that Phedre's journey and her progression of relationships was surprisingly believable.I would recommend this title as a study of personal transformation more than as an adventure novel. While exciting things happen, the pace is never breathless, and one feels (too much) as if it's all in the past anyway, and by the very fact that Phedre is narrating the book, we know she'll never die no matter how close she describes herself having come to it. I will read the following installments with interest."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I have to admit I was skeptical when it was compared to Dune. But it does not disappoint. Plan ahead to have plenty of spare time to read, because Carey has created a page turner."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"What a phenominaly different read. It was a chance buy that really paid off; and though it took me a little while to get into it, I was well and truely rewarded. I have never read a book where the development of the character(s) was the plot in and of itself; leading to an enchanting book and memorable personalities. I have also never been so challenged linguistically during a reading. It's been a long time since I had to pull out a dictionary to look up a word here and there. I can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I really liked this book, but some people may be put off by the S&amp;M scenes. The heroine is an indentured prostitute who enjoys pain mixed with sex, but who is also trained as a spy. The descriptions of her encounters with her &quot;patrons&quot; are a little graphic, but you can always skim over them. It is definitely not your ordinary alternate history story line, which makes it a fresh and intriguing read."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book was FANTASTIC! I could not put it down. Jaquiline Carey refines the art of vastly intricate plotlines made famous by Robert Jordan, and combines it with intrigue, romance, magic, and paints it against a race to stop a war and unite two great lands. Each thread of the story ties in delicately and exquisitely into the larger tapestry, without overly confusing the reader. The first person narrative offers an incredibly unique perspective, and it flows seamlessly throughout the entire book. The heroine Phedre is superbly written, following her life through from birth to about age 20. Her profession as a god-marked dominatrix dream colours the book with sensual and erotic interludes that are neither trashy nor vauge. There is mystery, intruige, pleasure, passion, pain, and a SUPERB love story running underneath it all. I'm drooling in anticipation for the companion to this enthralling novel. You won't be able to put it down. Kudos and standing ovations to Carey; she will be one the giants."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I have read a lot of fantasy and a lot of political intrigue, however, I have always shied away from the romance/sex genre. For some reason I decided to try this book, and I am so glad I did. If the description of masochistic sex doesn't offend you, then I highly recommend this book. I will not go into great detail, but I felt the book was superbly written, and exciting to read. (I have to admit, I did get lost a few times, it is very complex.)"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I absolutely fell i love with this book. From the day i bought it until i turned the last page i could not put it down. It is so nice to see a fantasy writer, writing political intruige at such a mature level. Kushiels Dart is also many other things; a coming of age story, a love story, a war story, historical fiction, and an interesting look at human sexuality.

We do have very similar tastes both in movies and books, so I thought: &quot;What the hell! If it has intrigue, alternate history, low - key fantasy feel *and* lesbian love scenes, it MUST be good! Right?&quot;Wrong. Even with all of this, I found the novel terrible. It drags for two or three hundred pages before the actual plot takes place. During that time, main character - a courtesaine named Phedre de Delauney - beside describing her childhood in Terre D'Ange, rambles on and on about how infinitely beautiful, refined and talented she and other people of her country are. By the 250th page I was practically shouting: &quot;I get it! You're the best damn looking people in the world! Could you now *please* get on with the plot?!&quot;Except that, when the plot starts, infinite perfection of the main characters prevents it from actually becoming interesting. I always enjoy reading about the characters with flaws which, faced with great obstacles, still somehow win the day. Of course, I allways know that the Heroes will win at the end but it's suspense that counts.Not in &quot;Kushiel's Dart&quot; it doesn't! Author is so in love with Phedre and her bodyguard Jocelyn, that she makes them almost laughably perfect. Phedre is so beautiful that she can make practically anyone do anything she wants, especially if that person - be it male or female, it doesn't matter - sleeps with her. As they usually do. On the other hand, Joscelyn is such a great fighter that he single - handedly and unarmed almost beats a dozen opponents in hand - to - hand combat. I mean, talk about overblown characters! The only part in which there is actuall supsnese is where they get sent to barbaric tribes in Germania and have to escape and find their way home.As for society and people of Terre D' Ange, they sound like something out of teenage girl's dreams: country filled with infinitely glamorous, talented and subtle men and women who like to talk about their feelings, cry when faced with great art and indiscriminately make love to each other. Their beauty is a result of them being the descendants of Blessed Elua (son of Jesus in this world) and his twelve angel companions who came to Terre D'Ange about thousand years ago.As for the sex part, it all comes down from the Elua's only command: &quot;Love as Thou Willst.&quot; What that means in the novel is that the author can happilly describe beautiful people having beautiful sex and still claim that it servers the plot or to establish the feel of that country's culture. No ugly people or ugly sex in this novel, kids! We wouldn't like something like reality to spoil our little fantasy, now would we? Of course, there is some S&M; sex, but it is usually described in very... mellow way and Phedre does seem to like it, so there you go.What we basically have here is a novel about very subtle people that still fails to be subtle itself: main characters are perfect in every aspect while main adversary is evil for pure evilness' sake. It is also a novel about infinitely sexually liberal society that still fails to be sexually liberal: it only describes the forms of sex the average reader would actually appreciate. The worst things are lesbian sex (Oh, the humanity!) and aforementioned mellow S&M;."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I'm still trying to get through it. I want to love it.

Her books immerse you and keep your firmly entrenched within her surreal but realistic and delicious worlds regardless of where or what your body and grey matter are currently invovled in and when the book is done it is like it must be for an addict to go into painful withdrawls.

The protagonist is a child who is trained in her youth to become a courtesan and who ultimately rises in ranks to become personal friend and protector of the queen. FANTASTICALLY WRITTEN! If you love fantasy fiction and have an open mind, you will find it difficult to put this book down."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is a great book. To be honest the first thing that attracted me to it was the length. I'm one of those readers that like really big books, I don't know maybe it's because I like the most bang for my buck, maybe it's because I just like the metaphorical weight in my hands, whatever the reason, I tore through this book in three days. It's one of those books that you just can't put down. I don't think I understood what that meant until I read this novel. And let me say this, the villain in this book is one of the best antagonists I have encountered in a long, long, time. She will truly send shivers down your spine. The prose is truly lush and decadent, and within the setup of this world, that really works. This novel really does have something for everyone, and while the political rigmarole can at times be hard to follow, that by no means deters the book from the larger course of telling its story. Reader beware! You will become invested into these characters and you will lose days of your life to this book. Don't say I didn't warn you."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is the kind of fantasy I like, with tons of intrigue and behind-the-scenes machinations. Swords & quests & dragons & elves don't interest me nearly as much.It's been in my TBR pile for a very long while. Partly because it's a big fat doorstop of a book, and partly because of all the raves surrounding it. Since mostly everyone focused on the erotic aspects, I was expecting something like LKH's Anita-Does-Everyone books.It wasn't. At all.The heroine is a born masochist (which is what \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" refers to--she was born with a red speck in her eye, the sign of someone for whom pain = pleasure), and a trained spy.I docked it a half star because the story meandered around for the first quarter of the book (and at 900+ pages, a quarter is a lot) before it settled down into something coherent, and several times I was tempted to put it down.Books like this are a major reason why I don't quit reading if I don't like a book at first. I'm hoping that now that the character's introduced, and Carey has some more experience, the sequel won't have the same problem."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Wow. I think I'm in love. Phedre no Delaunay may be the most unique and interesting heroine ever written. Masochist, bisexual, prostitute, spy, prisoner, ambassador... she is all of these and more.Phedre's world shares our own history right up until the death of Jesus, when Jesus's blood, mingled with the tears of Mary Magdalene and the soil of Mother Earth, gives birth to a new savior, Elua. Together with his seven chosen angelic companions (including Naamah, who prostitutes herself to save him, and Kushiel, a former punisher of sinners) found the kingdom of Terre d'Ange, mingling their immortal blood with humans according to Elua's decree: \\"Love as thou wilt.\\" A beautiful philosophy, and one that creates a land where sexuality in all its forms is holy, natural, and accepted. I found the d'Angeline religion fascinating, and a lovely backdrop for Phedre, who serves Naamah but has been chosen by Kushiel to find pleasure in pain. The first \\"anguissette\\" in three generations, she finds herself first a pawn and then a player in a deadly game of court intrigue.The book is almost divided in half. The first, \\"pawn\\" half, focuses more on Phedre's education, both sensual and intellectual. Her teacher, Anafiel Delaunay, uses her as a spy, for reasons he won't entirely reveal to her. There are some graphically erotic scenes with Phedre's patrons, and whispers and intimations of plots and intrigues both past and present.By the second half, Phedre is on her own, and must use what she's learned as she is cast out of home and country, first as a prisoner to the barbaric Skaldi (Norseman/Viking/Goth counterparts), then as an ambassador to the Albans and Cruithne (Celtic counterparts). This is where her personality finally takes shape, and although, as she laments, Kushiel's Dart never stops pricking, she uses her bedroom skills shrewdly and for a greater purpose.Erotic, imaginative, lushly beautiful, intelligent... all these things and more describe both Phedre and this book. The villainess is seductive, the good guys are all too human, and everyone in between has their own motivations. With both a rousing climax (no pun intended) and enough strings left tantalizingly loose to make you eager for the sequel, it balances perfectly the edge between \\"good enough on its own\\" and \\"set-up for the rest of the series\\". Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"In some ways, this is an inventive book. Carey envisions a society that far from denigrating the business of sex-for-hire, instead details one that embraces it; where there are thirteen Houses as an established part of the society, each of which specializes in a different area of sexual gratification, and trains their candidates from a very early age in all the arts of love, entertainment, and impeccable personal service.She places this inventiveness against an alternate history background of Europe, which seems to have as its major demarcation point from our own history the defeat of the Roman forces by a united force of Picts. Within this history, the field of countries and societies she paints is a very standard semi-fuedal middlle-ages level of technology and monarchies, complete with all the standard court intrigues associated with that era. This is probably the main point of failure of this book, as to present the intrigue, she parades a host of characters to the reader's eyes early in the book - far too many of them, with few early clues as to which of these characters are important and which are mere spear-carriers. There is nothing new in this intrigue; it's still the age-old story of individuals grasping for the power of a crown by any means possible. What is new is her use of Phedre, a lady marked from birth as belonging to the House of Kushiel, which specializes in the S&M; brand of sex, as a fantasy incarnation of Mata Hari, using her training and own sexual inclinations as the lever to pry important information about all the various plots from her clients.Phedre, from whose viewpoint the story is told, is a well drawn character. Also competently drawn are those who are closest to her, Delaunay, her patron and owner; Alcuin, her male counterpart; Joscelin, her ascetic martial-arts trained protector; and Hyacinthe, her gypsy-like friend. Unfortunately, the rest of the characters are only sketchily drawn, leaving me with little insight into the motivations of those grasping for power. Melisande, as the chief web-master of all the convoluted plotting, cries out for a far deeper characterization than what is shown, and if she had been so drawn, I think this would have been a much better book.The true fantasy elements of this book are few and don't really play a part in the story until almost 700 pages in; those looking for elves, dragons, and goblins need not bother with this book. Those looking for some titillation may also be disappointed, as Carey's description of Phedre's various sexual encounters are only mildly graphic and have far more emphasis on the use of pain than many people may be comfortable with.I found the prose style to be somewhat artificial, an attempt perhaps to re-create the lushness and verbosity of some eighteenth-century romances. It is this style, more than anything else, which leads to the 900 page length of this book. Far too often, Phedre would state \\"I don't really remember what else happened that night\\" and then proceed to give three paragraphs of description of those happenings. A more direct style would have probably reduced it to 600 pages, made it easier to follow, and held my interest better.An interesting idea, a personable main character that I could empathize with, but a story and setting that are just too commonplace, told with too many words to make this a gripping read.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is the best fantasy book I've read in a long time, hands down -- although calling it a fantasy is a bit of a stretch at times. There's very little magic involved and it reads more as an alternate history. So, it kept my attention with a strong narrative and highly interesting characters.The main character, Phedre, who tells the story, is a complex character not always happy (but quite often so) with her lot in life, that of a courtesan who enjoys sex no matter what the circumstances, including extreme pain. Once this &quot;gift&quot; is recognized as a young girl, she's raised to take advantage of it to get information out of high-ranking officials, while enjoying herself in the process.The story winds into many places, eventually taking her all over the known world. But the journey doesn't detract from the story, but rather adds facets to Phedre's personality, also enabling her to make many friends and enemies who enrich the story.I'm sure this story isn't for everyone. The sex is explicit and often violent. While it's more character-driven than plot-driven, there's a definite goal and resolution to the story. I'm very much looking forward to future books from this author and I want to thank her for writing a book I'm not going to have to wait for a year or more for a resolution to."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Ok, yes, I am one of those people who raves madly about this book. However, I would also like to put out a call to all of those who hated it merely for its emphasis on sexuality. The blurb on the book states that Phedre's sexuality is tightly wound up in pain, and yet many readers seem surprised when they learn this to be true! However, just because the sexuality of this world often drives the plot in directions which are \\"not for the faint of heart\\" (I quote the reviews INSIDE the book itself) does not mean that there is nothing behind the S&M; scenes. In fact, Phedre is a cunningly wrought heroine who faces her world with dignity, even when she falls into the depths of utter depression at her failures. And she does fail sometimes, which is part of what makes her so endearing.And yes, this is a feminist novel. Just because many women do not feel inclined to practice BDSM does not mean that such women are not out there. The point of feminism is to teach the world that women can be whatever they feel like being. Feminism is NOT telling women how they should act in order to best represent themselves to men. In fact, that dose of individuality which Phedre enjoys could be said to be a lesson to ALL people, regardless of sex or sexuality.\\"Kushiel's Dart\\" is not for everyone. It is at times explicit in its sex scenes. However, it is just as explicit in its heart-wrenching emotions and its gut-wrenching hardships. Carey knows how to bring you into a story and make you care about characters which may be entirely alien to you. SHE never confuses an open mind with an open mouth."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I absolutely love this book and the books after it. I think they're beautifully and eloquently written, and I personally found them easy to read. If you're used to books written on a 6th grade reading level, then no, this book isn't for you. Where some authors use a paragraph or more to describe a physical setting, Carey conveys emotions, sights, smells, etc in a sentence or two. I just really admire her style of writing and how well it complements her story. I feel it's also a well balanced novel. Phedre, the main character, is a highly trained courtesan with a proclivity for pain, but also a keen intelligence geared towards spying for her master and teacher. Some erotic scenes are described in detail, but if you're looking for a trashy novel, this isn't it. Although Phedre is a prostitute, her life evolves around much more than sex, and intrigues are complex and very widespread, requiring her talents outside the bedroom as often as inside."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book has so many different levels that I sometimes felt almost dizzy. On one hand it is a sensual tale set in a place and time where beauty and sensuality is everything and the only rule is \\"Love as thou will\\". The sensuality and freedom that this land offers is heady reading and enjoyable in it's own right. But on top of that the story becomes one of political intrigue, royal secrets and ploys. This adds to the book's excitement and keeps the pages flying late into the night. Then suddenly there is an added bonus of a darn good adventure story, where the sensualist heroine and her moral bound companion must survive through slavery and a wildrness journey of adversity and hardship. AND THEN...the story turns again, now becoming a tale of war and leadership and politics. Yes, it's a dizzying ride, but well worth it for the unique and unforgettable characters and master crafted story telling.Overall, the story for me was one of power. The power exchanges between the BDSM-driven heroine and her patrons, the unifying and sometimes merciless power of leaders, the struggle for power from those who crave it. The book is a beautiful description of protagonists who at first seem to lack power (by circumstance or by choice), but manage to rise well above themselves and become forces to be reckoned with. It kept me reading way after my bedtime and has stayed with me long after I turned the last page.Certainly one that I will re-read in years to come."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Not an easy trilogy to describe. It certainly is not like anything else out there. There maybe comparisons, but nothing is quite like Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel trilogy.The words sexy and intelligent come to mind. Elegant. Beautiful, dangerous. Fancy, but also real, because all characters have the capacity to grow beyond the rigidity of their beliefs.Phedre is a woman marked by the gods with a red speck of color in one eye. She is beautiful beyond compare, but the mark is considered a curse upon its barer. It is called Kushiel's Dart. Phedre is the first to be thus afflicted in many generations and, because she is, she is shunned, sold into servitude and raised with the awareness of being marred beyond repair. Until, that is, her path crosses with a person who recognizes the mark and sees Phedre's potential.So what is Kushiel's Dart? It gives one the ability to find physical, sexual pleasure in pain - both physical and emotional. It sets Phedre well apart and gives her a unique place in a society that embraces sexuality, ornamented with religion, ritual, education, art, wealth and status. The society of Terre d'Ange is exquisite, refined - both original and believable.Anafiel Delauney is the man who raises Phedre from indenture. He is an incomparably interesting, complex character. Delauney is a nobleman, but not in favor with the royal court for certain indiscretions in his past. He has an interesting amount of influence over the goings on of the society, yet you are forever wondering why and how. A part of the how is Phedre. Aside from continuing their education in all matters sexual, Delauney trains Phedre and Alcuin, a young man of his household, to be elegant, cultured, intelligent and irresistible spies.There is so much delicious intrigue in this work, so much fun, so much playacting and indulging one's impulses... and so much real danger, real loss, real love. The characters are so well defined, their voices so very distinct. Phedre, Delauney, Alcuin, Joscelin - Phedre's reluctant protector, Hyacinthe - her best and oldest friend, Cecilie - Phedre and Alcuin's teacher in the arts of... Well. There is much, here - too much to tell.The books - all three of them - are lovely. They have complexity, beauty, depth. Carey has that rare gift of being able to fully allow for her readers' intelligence as well as that of her characters. Another rarity - the series begins on a phenomenal note and gets much, much better. Savor it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I first saw this book as I stood in line at the local (bookstore) and the cover immediately caught my eye. Having an interest in architechture, any book with columns on the cover automatically interest me and the striking figure of the nude woman with a beautiful tattoo didn't hurt the appeal either. But the blurb on the inside cover about Phedre, a courtesan with a heart of gold had me rolling my eyes thinking it was another book selling sex rather than substance.So imagine my surprise when I finally picked up the book six months later and discovered that the plot and characters drove the book not kinky sex. Phedre was born with a red speck in her left eye. This made unsuitable to be an adept of the Night Court, which is comprised of thirteen houses of prostitution each catering to a special taste. In the alternate history of this world, the citizens of Terre d'Ange believe in an offshot of chirstianity that worships Elua the child that sprung from mother earth when Mary Magdalene's tears mixed with Christ's blood. Elua preached free love and with the eight angles that were his followers he settled in the country of Terre d'Ange, our present day France.Phedre grows up being the outsider in the Night Court until one day a nobleman named Delaunay recognizes the red speck as Kushiel's dart, a sign that she has been chosen by Kushiel, the angle that inflicts pain on sinners. As such Phedre derives pleasure from pain. Delaunay buys Phedre and trains her to be a spy while making her the most expensive courtesan in history. In her dealing with her clients she learns a secret that threatens her country and before she could inform the King she was kidnapped and sold into slavery in Skaldia. The rest of story deals with her journey back to Terre d'Ange and her role in saving her country. Along the way she relies on the help of her bodyguard a Cassiline priest-warrior, a gypsy like Tsingani, and warriors from Alba (England) and Eire (Ireland).The atmosphere of the court is suitably Machiavellian, the villian and villianess multidimensional, and the customs rich and complex. I could wish the author go a bit lighter on the foreshadowing, since it gives away a lot of surprising turns in the story. Phedre is an intriguing heroine that defies classification. Her story is poigant without being mushy.It is her interesting tastes in sex that provide the book with its graphic moments. There are s&m; scenes that might offend some people, but they are well done and not overly graphic.The book is great as a stand alone but the author has plans for a trilogy. The second book Kushiel's Chosen will be out in Apirl 2002 and she is doing research on Egypt for the third book. I know I'll be waiting eagerly for the second installment."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Jacqueline Carey has an outstanding fiction debut in 'Kushiel's Dart'. Her plot is fascinating and keeps the reader involved at all times. Her characters are real and believable with a depth that's not often seen in fantasy novels.Her world is a fascinating one. At first it appears to be a world where sensuality rules all. Youngsters are trained in sensual arts to the exclusion of much else (except for the protagonist). Such a striking contrast to our world! Yet as the novel progresses the main character, Phedre, is reviled by many for being a whore. The two views are so different that I found it difficult to believe in Carey's fictional society. But that was a minor quibble and certainly did not detract from my overall enjoyment of the novel.Another thing I noticed while reading the book was its familiarity. At various times 'Kushiel's Dart' read like novels by Lynn Flewelling, George R.R. Martin, Bernard Cornwell, &amp; Anne Bishop. When Phedre lives among the barbarians it read much like Bernard Cornwell's Warlord Chronicles. When Phedre was dabbling in political intrigue it reminded me of George R.R. Martin's epic 'Fire and Ice' series. Delauney's tutelage of Phedre was very similar to Flewelling's 'Nightrunner' books.Taken as a whole this is a successful novel. There are no flat moments. As I mentioned earlier, both the plot and characters are fascinating and believable. Most refreshingly, this is a stand-alone novel. There are hints of a future novel, but this is unlike the dozens of interminable never-ending series. This will most assuredly be one of the best fantasy debuts of 2001. Recommended."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"_Kushiel's Dart_ is a very long novel set in an Alternate History/Fantasy version of France. The divergence happens when Jesus (Yeshua) has a child by Mary Magdalene. This child, Elua, believes that the supreme command is to \\"Love as thou wilt\\". Elua and his seven companions, who are held to be angels, wander the Earth, finally settling in Terre D'Ange (France). Carey does a good job of presenting D'Angeline beliefs as real beliefs, while leaving open the likelihood that they are semi-mythological. (E.g., Elua's companions are believed to be angels, but, one might assume, they were actually just humans he recruited.) D'Angelines hold themselves to be preternaturally beautiful -- because they are descended from Elua and from angels.The narrator and heroine is Phedre no Delaunay. She is fostered to Cereus House, one of the Thirteen Houses (a tradition D'Angeline high class brothel), but she is imperfect: the red mark in her eye makes her unacceptable to Cereus for their service. But as she comes of age, she is bought by a nobleman, Anafiel Delaunay, who recognizes that the red mark means she is an anguisette -- a natural masochist, and as such potentially a fabulously valuable prostitute for people of certain tastes. Under Delaunay, she learns a number of languages, and various other useful talents. It becomes clear that Delaunay, for mysterious reasons, wants her to be a spy on people in the highest circles of government. These reasons are surely related to Delaunay's friendship with the late son of the aging King, and to his enmity with this late Prince's also dead wife.The story develops from there, at great length. Phedre becomes famous in her profession, and learns many secrets for Delaunay, some quite tragic. Eventually she is driven to slavery in Skaldia (Germany) where she learns of a terrible plot against the rightful rulers of Terre D'Ange. With her faithful companion, a super swordsman vowed to celibacy, she journeys across much of Europe, trying to find a way to stop the Skaldian threat.The story is pretty enjoyable, and reads quite quickly for such a long book. Carey's prose is rather good, a bit ornate and mannered, but that is in keeping, I suppose, with the image of the people of Terre D'Ange. A number of the fantastical elements, such as the Master of the Straits, who keeps ships from passing between Terre D'Ange and Alba (i.e. Great Britain), are rather nicely imagined. The main fault is that about halfway through the book much of the tension leaches out. It becomes clear that Phedre and her companion Joscelin are superhuman and unkillable, and that really there is no way to stop them. Carey does a lot of things well -- she uses Phedre's submission quite effectively in creating a fairly unconventional heroine. But while for a while, pretty much through her time with the Skaldians, we really fear for her, and we feel that she is being heroically abused and that she is in real danger. After that, the novel moves into an extended sort of \\"Triumphal March\\". It's not that Phedre doesn't get abused some more, and it's not even that she won't suffer some real emotional loss. But the shape of the ending becomes very clear, and there really isn't any believable opposition to her achieving that ending. To complain just a bit more, I felt that the deep mysteries that Carey plants at the beginning were resolved too simply -- that is, Delaunay's secrets were actually kind of trivial, and the political intrigue wasn't quite twisty enough. I also felt that the blatant setup of a sequel, just before the end, weakened the book. The characters and setting nicely support this one long book -- I don't think they will support two more books of the same length."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"There really is no way to describe how brilliant this story is in a single sitting, but I can say this: Jacqueline Carey is an absolute genius.I won't sit here and try to describe the extent of the story to its fullest, but it is one of the most intricate tales of espionage and conspiracy I've ever read, especially while so controlled from the point of view of a single character, Phedre no Deluanay.The greatest part about this story is that she takes the first person narrative to a whole new level. She gives Phedre very prominant graces and abysmal flaws to her personality that not only define her as a character, not only define her as a person, but hook you with an emotional attachment and response to her that you scarcely find in any literature. She is beautiful, sharp, quick-witted, and intelligent, and that leaves you feeling proud of her growth as a person. But at the same time, she's haughty, self-centered, self-absorbed, selfish, and a repugnant elitist, and it leaves you wanting to pull her from the book and scream at her, telling her to get over herself, lol.And even with all of the deeply plotted conspiracy and trees of acquaintence and nemesis, even with Phedre's overwhelmingly powerful presence as a character and as a narrator, each individual supporting role is given enough attention to detail as to be convinving and intriguing, each in their own right.The story moves you to the point where you can't put it down, to the point where you actually feel that a 912 page book is actually too short, and rejoice that it continues the legacy in a series of sequels. Even things that might have once gotten a different reaction from you take charge in a new way when told in this story. Normally, homosexual scenes make me uncomfortable, but they were classy, moving, appropriate, and captivating to the point where even I could celebrate their meaning and impact in this context.To put it simply, this is a must read. Carey's genius actually rivals if not dwarfs the great Lord of the Rings fantasy epic, and that's a bold statement, but I stand behind it. READ THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I was leery of this book at first, but I was soon surprised. Not only is Carey's novel imaginative and fresh additional to a sometimes forumlaic genre, but it's also well plotted with excellent characterization. This book is low fantasy but epic, set in a world resembling Renassaince Europe. The heroine is a courtesean and spy and the novel follows her growth from an abandoned child to a highly prized lady of the night to an ambassador for the queen.I wouldn't recommend this book to people who are squeamish about sex; the main character is a prostitute after all, and she had an affinity for pain. The sex scenes are well-written and erotic though, and they avoid romance novel cliches. The novel also contains several homosexual characters (in Carey's world homosexuality is not frowned upon), which might bother some readers also. I would also tell impaitent readers to leave it on the shelf; the plot is excellent but takes time to develop and the main character's development is subtle enough to seem slow in places.Overall I would highly recommend this book to any lover of fantasy, historical or speculative fiction. It's engrossing enough to keep you up all night."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Let me first say that \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" is my favorite book ever. When I first saw this on my recommendations, I wrote it off as another generic fantasy novella, and thought more of it. Thank heavens I had better sense while browsing around a bookstore one day and decided to buy it.Phedre no Delaunay, the book's heroine, is wonderful. She avoids falling into the trap of being a flat, paper character thanks to Carey's magnificent writing style. Although she may look perfect-gorgeous, intelligent, submissive and persevering-Phedre also has all-too-human flaws. Readers will find themselves loving her because of these flaws, rather than in spite of them.The plot is nothing short of an epic. With an alternative religion, a reworked globe, and a unique society, Carey weaves a spellbinding world of intrigue and lust. Trained as a spy, Phedre wins her patrons' hearts, and with it, their secrets. With one patron in particular, she got more than she bargained for.Betrayed into slavery, her adopted family brutally slain, Phedre is desperate. Using her wiles and cunning intelligence, she learns of a diabolical plot to invade her homeland, the country she loves more than life itself. With her companion at her side, she battles her way through blizzards and mountains, intrigue and treachery, to try to save the only home she's ever known.With \\"Kushiel's Dart,\\" Carey takes up a very ambitious role for a green writer. She more than exceeds expectations. This book is one meant to be read over and over, as it never gets old. Long after you've finished the book, you will find yourself imagining the characters playing out scenes in your head. And that is truly a sign of a magnificent book."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Simply a wonderful, refreshing read. It took patience to stick with at first since the world of politics is always an entangled one but, it is so important to understanding the intricacies of the plot. It was worth my hanging in as it all comes so much easier as the book propels forward. When I was finished...I simply had to get the others in the series. The characters are uncomplicated and Ms. Carey's weaving of imagery provides a seventh sense of \\"being there\\" element. Phedre is a conceptionally original heroine, she is so unique in this genre and Ms. Carey's ability to write her in the first person is wholly and completely entertaining. The sexual aspect of the story was stirring as it gave a respectful recognition to those amongst us who are more unconventional in our practices. While I tend to be a Science Fiction reader and not a Fantasy reader I can't say enough about this book or this series other than you simply have to read it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This series is by far the best that I've read. I've read several reviews that feel the books are confusing and that the authur is trying to sound smart. I highly disagree. I found that the Kushiel books are very well thought out. They contain a mixture of romance, adventure, political intrigue, humanity and humility that I have found in very few books. I enjoyed the fantasy world that in many was parrelled our own histroy. I found the \\"s&m\\" type sexual scenes were provocative and added to the characters strength. I hope that Carey will give us more books of this caliber and soon! I encourage that those that are interensted in fantasy, romance, and/or historical fiction read these books."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I read a lot of science fiction and fantasy, I bought this becaue I had read it had an interesting view of sex and gender. It does, in spades, but more I liked it for its religion and caste system, it's politics. It's rare in speculative fiction, especially in fantasy for religion to play such an important part. But Phedre is a Servant of Naamah and Joscelin is a Cassaline Brother, both are serving gods with their oaths as best they can. It is a fascinating world Carey has written and I recommend it wholeheartedly.Love as thou wilt."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is the first of three volumes (so far) in what has to be the most unconventional fantasy series I've ever read. Unconventional because the heroine, Phedre no Delaunay, is everything you'd expect in a series of this kind - she's beautiful, smart, and intuitive. And she also happens to be a courtesan, trained in both gathering intelligence and in the darker side of giving pleasure. To put it bluntly, she's a high-priced S&amp;M call girl who's also something of a spy.Rather an unusual combination and occupation, but Carey makes Phedre, her world and fellow travellers, and her story entirely believable. She describes Phedre, her companion Joscelin, and all the other characters of her world in great detail without going overboard - and the story she has to tell is just as detailed and believable.What makes this even more incredible is that despite the fact that this is a fantasy, Carey tells her story with a bare minimum of magic. There are only two characters in the story who display any magical talent - Hyacinthe, Phedre's friend from childhood who's clairvoyant (what Carey's characters refer to as the dromonde); and the Master of the Straits - an 800-year-old victim of a mysterious curse who magically controls a vital waterway and whose permission must be obtained to cross it.The history and geography Carey gives for her world is close to our own. She gives her countries different names, and parallels the story of Jesus up to a point - but she then takes a left turn and provides her own mythology, which she makes frequent use of as background to her tale.It took me two weeks to finish this book. Part of the reason was that it's long - just over 900 pages. But most of it is due to the excellent way Carey writes and tells Phedre's story. I hope the other two volumes of this series are just as good."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Kushiel's Dart began with difficult imagery, but after the second chapter it became a real page turner. I find myself agreeing with some of the other reviewers about its flaws, but if one isn't particularly judgemental about the character's sexual preferences the story stands well on its own.It is true that the story is told from Phedre's point of view in such a manner that one can only discover the plot in written word, regardless of how obvious events may be, when the main character herself finds them. Sadly, it's my opinion that this is a limitation of the first-person point of view, not the author's plot design. Generally the story was creative enough that I did not correctly second-guess every turn of event, and I doubt most people would either.This book, however, was written for a certain type of person. It relies heavily on the worship of forms (Socrates and his belief in a universal beautiful, etc), the idea that the reader hungers to read of a people who are \\"perfect\\". In this manner, I found the book to be more high fantasy than most of the reading I've gotten my hands on in the past five years or so. Though this appreciation extends to S&M;, which I'm sure causes a great deal of the core revulsion in several readers who cannot fit such things into their value systems as \\"beautiful\\", it isn't particularly offensive to the person without prejudice to those types of sexuality. Kushiel's Dart smoothes over literal events in the bedroom and betrays less than 99% of the romance novels I've read.There are always people who walk into reading a book of this nature with previous feeling that the values presented are fundamentally wrong. For this reason, though the book rates high for an overall read, I would caution anyone who actively disapproves of or dislikes S&M;."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I read this book after noticing the second in the series, which has a very sexy cover (Kushiel's Chosen), and wondering what IT was about. I'm not a big fan of \\"fantasy\\" novels, but I enjoyed this one. And I kept trying to figure out which real medieval countries and nationalities and people the fantasy ones corresponded with. The story had enough romance, court and political intrigue, and adventure to keep me turning pages long into the night several times. Phaedre is a unique and engaging heroine, although her perfection and zeal was a little hard to swallow sometimes. The author includes an exhausive list of characters and their relationships, and I think it would have been helpful if she had given a little more background on the \\"religious\\" characters and their traits. If you enjoyed the \\"Outlander\\" series by Diana Gabaldon, you'll probably enjoy this book. I can't wait to read \\"Kushiel's Chosen\\"!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The rave on the back cover from Publisher's Weekly compares Kushiel's Dart to \\"Gone With The Wind,\\" while the synopsis immeadiately below compares it with Frank Herbert's \\"Dune!\\" Right then, I knew I had to read it. However, it reminded me more of Mary Gentle's \\"Rats and Gargoyles\\" - a Rennaisance world at once our own and at the same time, clearly not, whose diseased beauty is rotten to the core with human bondage, hedonistic religions, and depraved nobles playing games with human lives. All the more unfortunate since it's a world you don't want to leave once you're there.Carey depicts a kingdom which the locals believed to have been founded by a group of wandering angels who left heaven to protect and serve Elua - a divine outcast searching for his place in the universe. One of these angels -Kushiel- specialized in pain and punishment and every now and then, he will mark a mortal from birth to be his chosen. Such a person is cursed to a lifetime of masochism. Phedre is the latest such individual, and is raised to live a double life as both an expensive prostitute and a master spy. While she enjoys her work, her strange gift and the truly disturbing people who covet her for it quickly catapult her into a series of earth-shaking events and conspiracies which threaten to change the face of the entire world.This is a character driven story and I admire Carey for depicting her eccentric - and often very ugly - characters as completely human. Despite all the kinky sex, murderous betrayals, and courtly intrigue, no one is ever really a shining saint or a cacklin, black-hearted villain. Love or hate the characters she introduces, you understand them and they are all the more beautiful (or frightening) for it.Another thing which kept my attention was Carey's cunning use of foreshadowing. Phedre's first-person narrative is frequently peppered with allusions to peoples' fates along the lines of: \\"He was so happy that day. If he'd known what it meant, he wouldn't have been. But that was later.\\" These warnings come frequently enough to keep suspense piqued, but just seldom enough that whenever the hinted-at event finally does come, the reader is still stunned to see it happen.All in all, this is an amazing and engrossing debut which I could not put down. Anyone expecting nine-hundred pages of steamy, explicit erotica will be disappointed, but less truly is more in Carey's writing, and the sparesness with which Phedre recounts the frequent trysts makes them all the more unsettling. It's not a book for everyone, but neither is it so offensive that I'd tell anyone not to read it. Such is Carey's skill that I found myself judging the characters by their cultural standards of morality, not my own. No easy task for a writer by any means. Definately a worthy read, and likely a re-read as well."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"What I didn't like:It was sooo long! I'm normally okay with this, but there are so many names to keep track of and so much action that takes place...I almost feel as if I read three books within the space of one. Then, to top it all off, the ending makes it obvious that there is more story to tell. I knew this beforehand, but after going through so much with Phedre I just felt too exhausted to embark on the next novel!What I looooved (which is pretty much everything else):-The world-building....wow. Seriously you guys, the world building is absolutely top-notch in Kushiel's Dart! I was completely immersed in this strange Europe-like polytheistic world with its various dens of iniquity.-Also, the characters were just so fully-fleshed and amazing! I loved Phedre, Hyacinthe, Delaunay, Alcuin, Joscelin (he's my fave), and pretty much every single character she produced - they were all so real.-Armchair reading (fantasy-style)! You travel to so many lands, meet so many different people/entities, and witness such daring feats...that before you know it, you've chewed off all of your fingernails!-Lastly, it was such an emotional roller-coaster - you never stop being interested. It is such a multifaceted story: friendships, families, romance, betrayal, survival, and above all - hope!What might bother others but didn't bother me:Um, the world in which Phedre exists is one where there is a very casual attitude towards sex and Phedre herself is a courtesan with special tastes. The god Kushiel (her patron god) is the god of pain...so, uh, to sum it up she's into S&M.; For some folks this is an automatic turn-off, but hear me out! While the book does let you know about episodes of er, pain and pleasure...it doesn't go into detail. There are no explicit sex scenes - just a slight description of events without going into too much detail. I thought it was tastefully done, considering the taboo subject matter.So, there ya go folks! I really really recommend this to fantasy fans and to those who love strong female protagonists."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is a great book, and an amazing read.The sheer amount of sex in the book can distract from the story for some people (although it didn't really bother me). Also the book starts off rather slowly, and you have to work to get into it. However, once you get going you don't want to stop. Fantastic plot twists, beautiful prose, deep, intriguing characters, and many interesting settings. Not for people that don't like flowery, wordy writing.One of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The Good: Deep and heavy characters, excellent adventure through a memorable world, sex scenes that actually make sense and are part of the story, lots of detail to keep you wrapped in the world and makes you remember weeks after readingThe Bad: Heavy in politics, tests your patience until the story picks up, a few unbelievable partsBeing a successful author these days is hard because of the sea of wannabe authors, has been, and have-nots, but the few that stick out do so for a reason and Jacqueline Carey does with this erotic book of adventure and gripping characters. The story has a huge back story and is all about politics, religion, and it just goes on and on and would take me forever to explain it all. The synapse is that the main character, Phedre, is pricked with Kushiel's Dart and she is his chosen scion and has a red mote in her eye. Her parents sell her to one of the Thirteen Houses of Naamah and she becomes a high-end courtesan who learns this skill at age 10. Yes, this book isn't for the light-hearted and really challenges your moral views. However, the book is very tasteful and she uses her skills in the art of love-making in the book.She gets her marque bought by a man named Anafiel no Dalaunay and his pupil Alciun to use her love-making skills to get information out of lords and kinds. There's a lot more to this and Phedre's character as well as all the others are very strong, but the book itself is an epic on its own and you go through 20 years of her life. The book is heavy in politics and there are a ton of weird almost unpronounceable names and she throws them at you in just a few chapters and I felt this was the weak part of the book. Too many politics at once which makes it hard to keep track of everyone, which name rules what land etc. The politics are deep and eventually come out in the end and untangle, but 900 pages of trying to figure it out is a chore. The book has some bad pacing and doesn't get truly exciting until past chapter 40.This books tests your patience, but if you wait you will be rewarded with amazing and lovable characters that you really get to care for and admire. I can name a whole list of names, but you have to really read the book to know what I am talking about. Not since Lord of the Rings and The Night Angel Trilogy have I read such amazing characters. There's a lot packed into this one book, with a sad and amazing journey that her and Joscelin (her Cassiline brotherhood bodyguard). They go through so much horrible stuff that it really hits you hard. My only gripe about the characters is that Phedre seems to get through the most inhumane things without much of a scratch and makes her seem a little unrealistic. If you can look past this the characters are something you will remember and think about weeks after finishing the book.The world is made up kind of like Lord of the Rings, and she explains the entire epic journey very well, but the best part of the book is the last third because that's when the politics die down and the two go on this impossible journey to save the realm from the Skaldic barbarians slaughtering everyone. Not often is a book to big and full of too much content to explain it all because there is an unreal amount of detail in the book. Day by day events, and she rarely skips these so the whole book flows and feel like an amazing tale.If you have the patience to stomach the heavy politics and tons of detail leading up to the epic adventure then I promise you this will be one of the best books you will ever read. The book does have some graphic sex scenes, but Carey writes them in taste and makes it very erotic and steamy, but they are spared and the scenes are actually part of the whole story and not just there to get guys to read it. There are a few unbelievable parts when she starts introducing myth and fantasy because this book seems very realistic until those points. Other than that this is probably one of the best books of the new generation and shouldn't be missed."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I picked this book up on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. The relationships that I built in this book spin into an amazing tale of trust, friendship and raw love. Once you read this book you will be hooked!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I love this book! I've already finished reading the second in the series, and am waiting on the third as a Christmas gift. I highly recommend it to fans of the genre or author."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is one of my favorite books. It manages to create a completly believable world & a very engaging heroine.It also is very erotic with a S&M flavor to it. For me this was a plus but sensitive readers beware."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Phedre has been marked since birth by a scarlet spot in her eye. At first viewed as a terrible flaw, an more observant and educated man, Delauney, sees it for what it really is. Phedre has been struck by Kushiel's dart, and is bound to feel pleasure and pain as one. He takes her into his household to raise and train. But she is not trained in the typical way. She is taught to use her wits and her wiles to get others to reveal their deepest secrets. But Delauney's game is far more dangerous than any of them imagine. When everything backfired, Phedre finds herself left with no one but her bodyguard, Brother Joscelin, and fighting for not only their lives, but the freedom of the kingdom.A very political book, full of court intrigue and plans. With an aging king and an unmarried female heir, no one is quite sure what will happen when the king dies. Several try to fight for the throne, but are defeated. But the biggest threat is one unseen to anyone. A threat that is revealed layer by layer as the Phedre's story unfolds.I loved everything about this book. The characters, the places, the events all seem to come to life. The variety of scenery and people is just amazing. The story is full of so many people and places, but it moves at a pace that allows you to learn each one's part in the story before moving on, yet never seems to slow to a point that events become dull or repetitive. My only complaint, and its importance can be debated, is that the reader is not given a log of detail on their deities at first. The deities play a major part in how and why people act the way they do. A great read for those that enjoy epic series. I have book two up to read soon.4.5/5"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I've have become recent fan of Jacqueline Carey, this book is great for all sorts of types of reader, great combination, of romance, sci-fi, adventure, and some very nice steamy sex... Never has a book offer so much varity in one book. Jacqueline use of detail is amazing.."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I love this character. She is smart and wiley. She manages to come from a very low place to a very high place without walking on any good guys. However, she stomps the bad guys as she makes her way higher and higher in society. This is a character I would find myself wondering about as I drove home from work and then had to remind myself she did not exist. Too bad. The next two books in the series get better and better. Hard to put down. The 4th centers on another character and I enjoyed it but preferred the first three. I am going on to the 5th, however."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I started reading this series a few years ago and have become hooked on Jacqueline Carey, she is a true writer who understands how to capture the imagination. What I love most about the series is that it's realistic in the sense that the characters have flaws and not everyone gets what they want making the reader appreciate the difficulty of Phedre's life while finding the beauty in what she makes of it. Also after reading these books I noticed that I hold every other book to these and I have yet to find another writer who can compare and another story that can move me and stay in my heart like this one."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book is an amazingly different take on the Fantasy genre. It's richly detailed, erotic without being pornographic, and just plain too-good-to-put-down. Set in an alternate land similar to Europe, where the only divine precept is \\"love as thou wilt\\", the heroine is beautiful, strong, sensual, and clever.There is treachery, intrigue, love and war, and high adventure through barbaric lands. In fact, there is so much to this novel, it's hard to believe it all gets packed into one book. And then the best part is, there are two more novels after this one (five if you count the second trilogy.....)"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I'm going to start by saying that pain ain't my thing. This means that the central premise for much of the sex in Kushiel's Dart isn't going to connect with me. Fortunately, there's more to this novel than just sadomasochism, though that seems to be what a lot of people want to dwell on when they talk about it. It's also got a lot of complex political maneuvering, and some good characters. I particularly liked old Delaunay, even though he has some really twisted morals; maybe that's what made him so interesting.The writing is good, in sharp contrast to the other and earlier famous fantasy series about sadomasochism, theGorseries. But ultimately, the end of Kushiel's Dart just takes too long to happen. For all practical purposes, the story is over after the battle at Troyes-Le-Mont, but it just keeps going and going after this. I suspect this is because fantasy novels today are expected to be super-long, and because Carey wanted to set up her sequels. Unfortunately, it undermines this book, and when I looked at the sequels, I wasn't impressed, so I have to say the effort wasn't worthwhile."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I had seen this book in the Science Fiction section of the bookstores for several years and always passed it by. I think I picked it up a few times because the cover reminded me of the Marion Zimmer Bradley Mists of Avalon cover, but then I'd read the description on the back of the book always thought, \\"No, doesn't sound very interesting at all.\\" Huge mistake!I finally bought Kushiel's Dart this past fall after several people recommended it. This book does start a bit slow. There are a lot of pages dedicating to establishing the world that Carey created. It's slow, but still quite entertaining. A slow book to me is one that I don't feel the need to stay up way too late to finish just \\"one more chapter.\\" Once I got about a third of the way through, I couldn't put the book down.The world Carey has created is complex but believable. Her characters grow and mature during the course of the book. And, like one of my other favorite authors, George RR Martin, Carey does not shy away from killing off main characters. A good realistic touch to her novel that I really enjoyed was that not all the important people make it through battles. I've read some other books recently that want to make the reader believe that if you're important, you will survive any battle.I couldn't recommend this book and the rest of the books in this series more!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Words cannot describe how amazing this novel is. Here heraldic courtly splendor and Machiavellian politics that would do credit to Frank Herbert are set in a richly-envisioned alternate Medieval-type world. And did I mention sex? The graphically erotic and sexual scenes are handled with sheer craft and skill--neither over-lurid nor insipid. Phedre is a phenomenal heroine, remarkably accessible and fully realized. The host of supporting and secondary characters are equally well-drawn.This is an absolutely gorgeous novel with something to offer everyone. I have often remarked that if I had to be marooned on a desert isle with only ONE BOOK, I would choose this one. Whether you're a fantasy zealot-aficionado like me or a more casual reader, read it!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I love this whole series! Phaedra is one of the best fictional heroines ever created in this novel that is fantasy fiction erotica action adventure romance. Set in an alternative Medieval/ Early Renaissance Europe, Phaedra is a well trained prostitute in a society where the religious dictate is \\"Love as thou wilt\\" and the servants of Naamah are elevated and respected members of society. Not only is Phaedra well schooled in the arts of love and servitude, but she has been also been trained as a spy by her patron & mentor. Both of these skills will serve draw her into the web of intrigue that has been brewing among the Peers of the Realm when all hell breaks loose.Oh!and did I meantion that Phaedra's special gift, one direct from the gods, is that she finds sexual pleasure in pain, and that she is uniquely capable of withstanding much suffering? This series is definitely erotic though not pornographic by my standards. It is delicious fun.The world Carey creates is well though out and peopled with believable three dimensional characters and their stories are rich and engaging. She weaves a tapestry with these characters' stories that I found exciting, intellectually stimulating and of surprising complexity and subtlety. I have gone back to the Kushiel Series more than once for a little guilt free pleasure and escape."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"It's such a treat to find a book with so much woven together, and done well. While it's not in our universe, it is in a parallel one that mirrors our own in a beautiful fashion.I found the story just a bit difficult to get into -- the first 50 pages or so were good, but not completely absorbing. Then, suddenly, I found that all I wanted to do was read this book and find out what happened now. The twists and turns were such that you just HAD to know!! I didn't want to work, didn't want to sleep, and discovered that long stop lights and heavy traffic were a good thing. (CAUTION: I do not recommend that.)It's also one of those that has such an after-glow about it that it's difficult to go on to the next book.Highly engaging, but be prepared to lose some sleep over this."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is the first of three large volumes telling story of Phedre ne Delauney, a courtesan, sexual masochist, and spy living in the fictional kingdom of Terre de Ange which, in Carey's imaginary setting, can be considered roughly equivalent to France. It's an amazing story, as are the sequals. Although I haven't yet finished the final volume, I already feel fairly safe in making a flat statement: this is the best fantasy trilogy I have ever read, including Tolkien.Carey has set her story in a setting fairly close to France at roughly the time of the troubador era of the early Renaissance. But she has varied the historical setting to suit her needs; countries have been renamed and the equivalents for Germany and Great Britain are still barbaric lands from the Roman era rather than the Middle Ages. In Carey's Europa, Christ's successors never preached the Gospel to gentiles; as a result Europa remained a pagan culture and the only people to accept Christianity were the Jews. (The 'Yeshuite' minority is only vaguely mentioned in this book but plays a major role in the sequels.)The story isn't quite a fantasy in the traditional sense; there are no wizards, orcs, or dragons. Rather than a traditional fantasy, you might think of it as alternate history, with a few fantasy elements. There is one character of mysterious origins who has magical control over what we know as the British Channel, and with that control has reduced contact between the islands and the continent to a minimal level. This is crucial to the plot, since Phedre eventually needs to undertake a mission to Alba (Britain) and will have to meet the price he requires for her party's passage. There are some characters with limited ability to see the future, and the heroine is given one special ability: she can recover quite rapidly from injuries, a useful talent given her profession and tastes.Phedre has been marked by Kushiel, the deity who in Terre de Ange theology punishes souls in Purgatory until they are sufficiently cleansed to move into paradise. Her mark, a mote in one eye, means that she experiences pain as pleasure. The significance of the mark is first noticed by Anafiel Delauney, a poet and nobleman with a mysterious background who purchases Phedre and trains her, along with Alcuin, an attractive albino boy, in languages, spying, and sexual artistry. Shortly after Phedre begins her career as an expensive courtesan hired out to court figures, Delauney and Alcuin are murdered. Phedre and her priest bodyguard Joscelyn are sold into slavery in Skaldia (Germany), launching a series of perilous adventures in which Phedre and Joscelyn struggle both to survive and to thwart a planned invasion of Terre de Ange.Such journeys and adventures can be found in many similar books; what sets Carey above the rest is her complex characters, interesting historical/cultural background, and skillful writing. Major and minor characters are consistently interesting and believable. The story gets off to a rather slow start while Carey fills in the background and describes Phedre's childhood, but the quality of the writing makes this section as enjoyable as the later action passages.The many references to prostitution, homosexuality, and sadism make the book inappropriate for some readers. But the content isn't as shocking as it could easily be under the circumstances; Carey uses elegant and delicate language to describe the extremely indelicate acts of Phedre's clients. The book is intensely erotic but not pornographic."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I just finished this book and have to write a review!! I must say that this was easily one of the best books I have read in years.First I must say that this is not a book for the prudish or squeamish. There is some very strong sexual content and violence, however, it is all very integral to the plot.The story is seen totally through the eyes of Phedre, a courtesan and spy raised in the Night Courts of the kingdom of Terre D'Ange, a land founded by fallen angels. In this land, the supreme command of their God is \\"Love as Thou Wilt\\", and there are 13 houses of courtesans, each with a different attitude towards sex, from Joy to elegance to mysticism, and, yes, even S&M;, who support this commandment. Phedre is marked by Kushiel's dart as an anguisette, one who takes pleasure from pain. She is indentured in the service of Anafiel no'Delauny who protects her and teaches her how to use her intelligence and bedskills to extract information from his enemies. Intrigue and treachery are everywhere and Phedre finds herself in the thick of it, when she and Delauney are betrayed by one close to them. Her travels take her from her homeland to the harsh Skaldi northlands to the isles of Alba and back to her beloved Terre D'Ange, accompanied by an ever increasing number of faithful followers, as she races against time to save the land she loves from treacherous betrayers.This book is beautifully written, the intrigues are direly clever, and Phedre, for all her strange quirks, is a joy to read about. I recommend this book highly!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Unlike some others, I didn't find this book to be particularly sexy. Yes, the main heroine Phedre was born to seek pleasure in pain and yes, there are a handful of scenes of her enjoying pain with her sex. But it's not like this is a Laurell K Hamilton Anita sex-fest. Sex is secondary to the story, although perhaps primary in the main characters motivations and character.This is actually a story of war. And it takes a very very long time to get moving. We start at Phedre's (I was pronouncing her name \\"Fee-dray\\" in my head until at about page 600 I was informed it was prounounced \\"Fay-dra\\"...bit late with that information) childhood and are taken on a very long journey with intrigue and spies etc, eventually leading to the actual war scenes.When I think of this book I think \\"grey, with slashes of red\\". And by grey I mean the book is subdued, controlled, gloomy, with words and feelings unspoken, and grief unexplored. The slashes of red are the rare moments when we get some actual emotion, something real and not hidden.If you're all about searching out the hidden gems in books, and you don't mind large patches of lengthy and overly-detailed story telling, then this is the book for you.For myself, I don't think I'll bother with the sequels. While I am mildly curious about Phedre and Joscelin's relationship, I am not prepared to put myself through 2 more almost 1000 page over complicated and heavily detailed epics to find out.However, I applaud Carey for choosing in Phedre a character that is unique and interesting and quite unlike any other heroine I've ever encountered in a book."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"It begins in Kushiel's Dart with Phedre, an orphan cast out by her parents because of a peculiar flaw that later became her salvation. Carey's voice is deliberate and seductive as she begins her narration. Ruled by two demi-gods, Naamah, the goddess of sensual love whose creed is love as thou wilt and Kushiel, one of the seven angels of punishment, whose mark, a blood red mote, she bears in her left eye, she is plucked from the erotic Night Court by nobleman Anafiel Delauney at the age of ten. Delauney recognizes her for who she is - an anguissete, born with the ability to transcend pain and transform it into intense pleasure. Under his wing she enters a period of rigorous training in the courtly arts of history, politics and language as well as in the erotic pleasures of the bedroom. Acting as Delauney's pawn in a desperate mission known only to himself, she contracts her body to some of the most malicious noble folk, listening carefully as they spill their darkest secrets in the throes of passion. What she learns casts her into a role of an unlikely yet very intelligent spy who eventually plays part in saving her beloved country's besiegement by a woman she cannot resist, the bewitching Melisande Shahrizai, with whom she shares a carnal bond so intense it threatens to enslave her.Jacqueline Carey spins an astonishing legacy that is worthy of being compared to some of the greatest political fantasy works with her Kushiel trilogy. Winner of the 2002 Locus Award for Best First Novel, Kushiel's Dart begins the journey of Phedre no Delaunaey in a country that is reminiscent of Renaissance-era Europe. Phedre, with all her vulnerability and cunning, proves to be a likable heroine, sharing rank with powerful women such as Morgan Le Fay from Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Mists of Avalon, Margaret Mitchell's Scarlett O'Hara from Gone With the Wind and Ayla of Jean M. Auel's Earth's Children series. She is both selfish and selfless, going to great lengths to save Terre d'Ange from collapse while bringing inspiration as well as pain and grief to those around her as a result of her actions. Throughout the story she struggles with her passions, caught in between her loyalty to those who love her and with the demands of cruel Kushiel. In the end, her biggest trial comes with Joscelin, her Perfect Companion, with whom she finds the true meaning of love, sacrifice and devotion.With Phedre, she takes us into depths of a very erotic world few of us see but some of us know - that of the mingling of physical pain with sensual pleasure. While some readers may not wish to venture the depths she goes to describe Phedre's sexual trysts, it is done in a way that is both tasteful and mesmerizing almost to the point of engulfing the reader in rapture. Very few writers have been able to capture this quality of erotica in their writing in such a way that avoids lewdness. Carey gives Phedre very human characteristics in a fantastical world that is disturbingly familiar. Terre d'Ange reminds us of a world long past, where sensual pleasure is reveled in as a fine art and prostitution is a respected and coveted profession.At nearly 700 pages each, Kushiel's Dart and Kushiel's Chosen are certainly worthy of the effort it takes patching together the immense political network Carey has created as well as the many adventures Phedre embarks upon. Romantics will enjoy the pursuit of true love she weaves into the story as well as the shocking betrayals that seem to come from every angle. Sword and sorcerer fans will fall in love with Joscelin, the Cassiel swordsman/priest sworn to protect and serve Phedre at any cost. At the end of each novel Carey is careful to throw around a few loose strands to leave the reader craving for more, which makes Carey's third installment, Kushiel's Avatar, scheduled for an early 2003 publication date, a deliciously anticipated promise.Jacqueline Carey is a delightful newcomer in the fantasy/science fiction scene and has marked a place for herself up there with Ursula K. LeGuin and Marion Zimmer Bradley."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"In a land called Terre D'Ange, a flawed child named Phedre is born: flawed by a mote of scarlet in her left eye. She is sold into bondage to the Night Court, first to Cereus House and then to a man named Anafiel Delaunay. Anafiel recognizes Phedre for what she is, an anguissette, one who feels pain as pleasure.Anafiel raises Phedre, not simply training her to become a courtesan, but providing her with a high education and instructing her in the finer arts of espionage. Once coming of age, Phedre enters the Courts with eagerness and elegance. But before she can earn her \\"Bond Marque\\" to free her from servitude, her stylish lifestyle is disrupted by intrigues, which cause the deaths of two very dear to her, and threaten the entire land of Terre D'Ange.It is almost impossible to fully review this book, so richly woven with love, intrigues, lavishness, hardships, and magic, all told in first person by Phedre. The prose is elegant without being pretentious. The colorful characters from royalty to barbarians are full-fleshed and never flat. The plot twists but never dries.Phedre's friend Hyacinthe, her \\"brother\\" Alcuin, her guardian Joscelin from the Cassiline Brotherhood, Queen Ysandre, and Phedre's enemy Melisande Shahrizai breathe life into Phedre's lengthy tale of her efforts to save Terre D'Ange. No shrinking violet is Phedre; she is one of the strongest and most intelligent heroines you will ever encounter in a modern fantasy, a stunning and gentle beauty with a core of steel. Indeed, her determination and willingness to survive, to do whatever is necessary to save her beloved land, is more than simply fascinating: it is riveting.Do not make the mistake of passing off this novel (and the sequels) as fluffy erotica or \\"chick fantasy\\". This lush tale is filled to the brim with action and intrigue; you will not be able to put it down until the end. Best have the sequels handy also; you won't want to let go of Phedre's tale even at the last page. While this first in the trilogy stands alone, enough ties are left for interest in the second book, Kushiel's Chosen.'Kushiel's Dart' is an outstanding piece of fantasy fiction. I cannot recommend it highly enough. If possible, I would give it ten stars. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I ordered based on the www.amazon.com reviews but I was somewhat disappointed. I found it style of \\"olde-Englishe\\" to be unnecessary and a little pretentious. Too many names and references were introduced too soon and too briefly to keep them straight, despite the characters guide in the front of the book. I didn't ever feel very attached to the main character and, consequently, didn't really care what happened to her. It was readable but it was also put-down-able and certainly didn't keep me up at night wanting to read more. And for those of you wondering, the sado-masochistic sex is very secondary, not too graphic and rather off-putting unless you're into pain. All in all it was vaguely entertaining but I won't buy the next one. The fantasy part was too close to reality for me - next time I'll just read a history book."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book was pretty good! I found the story line interesting and I'm glad I purchased the book. The back cover sounded a bit more erotic than the book was in actuality, but the story was well written and complex. Once I got into it (it took me a couple of chapters), I had trouble putting it down. Its a thick book and I managed to get through it in a few days. Another thing I will mention is that its not a romantic \\"feel good\\" book... just as bad things happen to good people in real life, Kushiel's Dart runs the gamut of positive and negative emotions... its very telling that I was pulled into the story so much that I was disappointed when negative things happened to the characters (Sorry, can't be specific or I'll ruin the plot)."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I picked up this book to read while on a long flight (my husband always brings several books,and only started to read it out of absolute boredom.

Martin, but I have to say that I rank this series right up there with these authors. This story is very complex----I found myself having to reread sections to understand, only to later see the big picture and think to myself &quot;Wow&quot;. I am eagerly awaiting the third book of this series with great impatience!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I loved this book. I really did. When I was about halfway finished, I ordered the hardcover copy, and the second book in the series -- it was just that good. I finally finished Kushiel's Dart tonight, and felt inclined to write about it.This is not your typical fantasy. While there definitely are fantastic elements, there is no superhuman sorcery, no elves and goblins. Most of the fantasy in the book is reimagined history -- and that part is superbly done. It takes place in a Europe (Europa) of probably the 1000's, with France (Terre d'Ange) being the most sophisticated country, more Renaissance-like than medieval. Much of the rest of the world, however, is delightfully primitive. Christianity is not dominate -- in fact, only a few Jew-like Christians are around in this world, although it is generally accepted by the French (D'Angelines) that there was a Jesus. England (Alba, which is definitely a well-researched name) is Pictish, and Germany is inhabited by barbarian Norsemen. The names for everything are perfect -- Hellas (Hellenism is the age of Alexander the Great) for Greece, Tiberium for Rome, Aragonia (think Ferdinand of Aragon) for Spain. It feels like she put a lot of thought into designing her world.The plot, too, is excellent. The main character is not your typical fantasy \\"chick\\" -- she doesn't fight, magically or physically, and some things about her are almost repulsive. Pricked by Kushiel's Dart, she feels pain as sexual pleasure -- and, thus, becomes very useful as a bed-partner to those with sadistic tastes. Still, I liked her quite a bit, and found her a very believable heroine. She saves her homeland -- through the use of her sexual skills, her beauty, and her wits.Plenty of people have criticized this book for being \\"porn\\". It really isn't pornographic at all. There are vivid sex scenes, but they aren't disgusting or pornographic. I wouldn't recommend this book to a 12-year-old fantasy fan, but I wouldn't warn anyone away from it due to the explicitness of the sex scenes.And the writing! The writing was just beautiful. Poetic, surpassing even the beauty of Tolkien. The heroine lives in a land of beauty and elegance, where every D'Angeline is descended from angels, and has their beauty. It follows that the language would be beautiful as well.An excellent book. Ten stars out of ten. Recommended without reservation."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is not your fluff romance twisting a world for it's own games. Here we find a world similar to our own Europe set in a golden age of indulgence, political intrigue, and desire.I'm going to safely assume that you can read the back of the book and the few look inside pages, so I won't presume to fill you with plot information as already done.What I will tell you is this is not for the faint of heart - when they discuss the pain & pleasure are felt as one, you will read of acts of pain to incite pleasure. You will read of a brutal murder or two. Don't pick this up if you're squemish.But, if you enjoy books with as much action as romance, a storyline including a love unable to be shared, ones that twist the world we know to fit their designs, and you want a well wrapped tale, by all means, pick it up."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I didn't realize this was the first in a series (of 3) when I bought it, but I will certainly read all of them. Carey's world is that of Europe, physically, but not any recognizable historical Europe. The main character is basically a glorified high class hooker with a sadomasochistic thirst, who partially graduates to playing political games. While the story is often erotic, it isn't usually graphic. Also, though it is a fantasy novel, there isn't too much fantastical about it. Only one event in the whole novel really stands out as being not possible in our reality. There are sword fights, but no dragons. Prognosticators, but no sorcery. All human characters."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I was starved for a good book this summer and when I picked up this book the only thing I had liked was the half rose drawing on the front. Then I read the book and I couldn't put it down! It was so great that I would stay up until 4 in the morning to read it! Some may comment on the references to prostitution, but if you look at the character you'll almost forget about it. Phedre seemed so much like a real person, that the fact she was a prostitute hardly mattered. The thing that most caught my attention was the creative way that the author combined christanity and paganism. It was a very new and very thought provoking way to make a new religon. Not only Phedre caught my attention, but numerous others. I was so drawn into the story that in some occasions I almost cried. I am not one to cry at a book and when I come close I KNOW that the book is good. So if you want something new, exciting, and original GET THIS BOOK!..."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"When I first read this book I enjoyed it, but now I've just finished it for the second time, and I'm ashamed I only enjoyed it before. This is a magnificent story, and Phedre is simply an awesome character."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is a great book. The first hundred pages or so are a little dry with the background infromation and everything and the characters but after that it picks up... and it flies. For such a long book it keeps you sucked in which is an accomplishment for having 901 pages. The plot never thins throughout it and it keeps an interesting array of characters to oppose the antagonist. The characters are almost real people. They're not flat like some novels, but they give them an insight to their thoughts and the way they think. However, younger readers nowadays faint at the thought of reading a book that big. They flipp. People complain about how much sex it has in it, which really isnt' that much compared to everyday life. Sex is a part of life and in our world it is everywhere. This book isn't immoral at all. If you don't like risky novels, too many characters, or deep writing, I wouldn't suggest this book. But i will say you don't know what you're missing. It is beautiful written with deep thoughts and an excellent vocab along with many complex characters. It is an accomplishment for Carey. If you want a good story, not a ideal-world fantasy or a \\"everything is nice and smells like roses\\", or ideal-society but one that has plots, strength, love, fueds, and a little action this is an excellent book. I eagerly look forward to Choosen and the third."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I ran across this book at the library one day while browsing the sci-fi/fantasy section and checked it out on a whim. I had no inkling of what I was getting into. That was a few months ago; I've since bought it and read it twice more, along with the sequels, and I'm now reading the series for the fourth time thanks to the recent release of the fifth book (\\"Kushiel's Justice\\").This is one of those rare books that causes me to miss my bus stop even on re-reads. The world Carey has imagined is just fascinating, and I couldn't help but love the characters who populate it. I suppose you could call this book a romance or a fantasy, but it's so much more than the labels suggest. It's got all of the above and more: sex (duh, the main character is a courtesan), intrigue, adventure, friendship, politics, culture clashes, battles, religion ... I still struggle to describe it, and usually just give up trying and insist that people read it so they can see for themselves.I'm not really a big fan of the \\"romance\\" or \\"fantasy\\" genres in general -- or any genre, now that I think of it. I am a fan of creative stories with interesting, believable characters and gripping plots, whether they are set in 14th-century alternate-universe France (which this one might be?) or World War II England or 40th century Mars.I can't say enough good things about this series. Give it a try. You will almost certainly be glad you did."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Capivating from the first page !!! a real page turner, this is actually the second time I have read this book and the second reading, dare I saw, was better than the first."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Karen's mother sent me the first book in this series for my birthday one summer, with a note that said that she knew I liked fantasy novels and series, and that perhaps this new book by a friend of hers might be to my taste. Little did she know to how much of my tasteit would be! An alternative, Renaissance-esque world where the lead character, Phedre, is sold into servitude to a local temple only to become her country's lead \\"anguissette,\\" a high priestess of pain. I really enjoyed the first book in the series, enough to pick up the others, and while the adventuress masochist-turned-international spy tends to get into more trouble than any one woman should,the writing is solid and Carey's attention to the details that make her world so real are worth it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"There's not much more to say, that the other over 200 reviews have not already said, but I just wanted to add my 5 stars, because this is a great, great, great book. If you love historical, romantic or dark fantasy you'll love this book, it also has lots of intrigue, drama and war. Its an epic book of an epic series that I think is great for women. Finally a well written book for us, that doesn't get boring after the first chapter, with this book you cant put it down, you even dream about it. I could go on for ever, but I said there wasn't much more to add, hehe. Pick it up, you wont be sorry."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Serving over here in Kuwait I purchased this novel last year and only just read it.

I am eagerly anticipating the next novels which I plan to purchase ASAP."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I wasn't really expecting to like this book after I had heard a couple of bad reviews. Once I got into it though, I really enjoyed it.The characters were well thought out, and nothing in the book fell flat.The only thing I didn't care for in this book was all the S&amp;M. I could have done without that, but I think it did add to the character of Phedre. Without that element the whole book would have to have been changed.I would recommend this book to people who like involved fantasy--it's similar in feel to George R.R. Martin's, A Game of Thrones."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I bought this book when the second book in the series caught my eye. And how could it not? The artwork on the cover is fantastic. The book itself is well written, without any detectable grammar or spelling errors. The author's style is good and it was very easy to connect to the characters and fall in love with them. The book is a little fuzzy near the end about what happens to the main character and her guardian, but other than that it was wonderful. If you like cunning and book full of plots and counterplots, then you should like this."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"An awesome book. Excellently written with incredibly human characters in an alternate history. I was drawn into the story from the beginning. Some scenes are very graphic and the book is not for children.

It was very bold and may put some people off, but you need to look beyond the society and actually &quot;see&quot; the characters. I was brought through every emotion..a definite must for any true reader's library."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Unlike most everyone else I know who read it, I neither loved nor hated Kushiel's Dart. I did hate the writing style, and was amused to see a blurb from Robert Jordan on the cover, as I hate his writing style for the very same reasons: too much description, too many of the same phrases repeated over and over again (\\"You really are one, aren't you?\\" she asked as she tugged on her braids), and general logorrhea. But like with Jordan's books, I liked bits of the story enough to keep reading until the end, although I'm not sure I want to read the sequel. Partly because reading this one exhausted me and I'm not ready for another 500-page story told in 900+ pages, and partly because I personally would prefer it if the story ended where this book ended, and didn't go on to the places it will inevitably have to go in the sequels. Maybe if Phedre's kink were my kink I'd appreciate it, but it's not (not to anywhere near that extent, anyway), and anyway I prefer love over kink, and that's not the direction the sequels are going to go. So, no more Kushiel for me, and I hesitate to recommend it to anyone but those of the anguisette persuasion, about whom romantic books are rarely written, although fans of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander similarly too-long and violently erotic series will probably enjoy it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"There are books that are erotic. There are books that are intricately and cleverly plotted. They are generally not the same books. But it is not just that Kushiel's Dart is both engaging and erotic. What makes this book stand out is that its erotic elements are not a diversionary sidebar that could easily excised. On the contrary, the erotic elements of the book are integral to the plot and development of the story. Bravissimo! I've yet to find anything else quite like it--highly recommended."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is an incredible book! When I was thinking about purchasing it a friend of mine said, \\"I heard that it's a bondage book. Why would you want to read that?\\" What a silly question!

It's also a fantastic love story, and the sex scenes don't suck either."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Carey's Kushiel's Dart creates a brilliant alternate history as it presents fully three-dimensional characters caught in the tide of destiny.Phedre is raised as a courtesan, trained as a spy, and born to a \\"gift\\" from the god Kushiel--the gift of finding pleasure in pain.

I couldn't not put the book down by choice. I enjoyed every moment and loved the great detail. I tell all my friends that they should at least try to read this book. It is a little bit of everything. Mystery, spies, Love, and a little bit of royal politics as well."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"A spine tingling, toe curling, heart racing, tear jerking, novel that keeps you up way past bedtime just to find out what happens next and why. This story runs the gamut of emotions, and makes you feel each and every one with it's intense descriptions of people, places, events, and actions. Definately not intended for the close minded individual. If you think you're open minded, this book could make you rethink just how accepting you are to alternate lifestyles. Leave your inhibitions at the cash register if you take this book home. If you open the cover, you bettter have opened your mind beforehand."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book was disappointing.1) Didn't live up to its interesting premise.While Carey's idea of a masochistic courtesan (or bluntly, prostitute), using her \\"extreme\\" charms to lure her victims into revealing her political secrets is interesting, it simply isn't treated well. Either Phedre has some kind of brain-washing pheromone or all the people in the novel who fall under her spell (which would be more or less everyone she meets) are simply... idiots. Grarrr. See beautiful woman. Beat/flay/whip/whatever beautiful woman. Get off. Do everything she wants.Additionally, despite the accoutrements of torture, whipping, flechettes, tying this and tying that, none of Phedre's patrons come across as actually having a great time in the process.Especially compared to Storm Constantine's Calanthe from her Wraethu ?sp? series - Carey's characters are simply depthless projections who fall flat. (Constantine's not for everyone, but even those who dislike her will probably find her far superior to Carey.)2) No engaging charactersI read this book from start to finish hoping that it would get better - simply because a good friend liked it. Not only did it not get better, there was simply, at the end of the book, no one I gave a fig about. Yes, I was happy on finishing this book - overwhelming relief at being done with it!3) Incredibly bland treatment of BDSMCarey's BDSM scenes are so bland that they might as well not be sex. The language is stilted, unevocative and undescriptive all at the same time.For lyrically erotic renditions, there's Tanith Lee's style, for graphically erotic treatments, there's Anne Rice (whom I dislike for other reasons, but at least she can write erotica that fulfills its purpose), for sex (and BDSM, no less) less engaging than doing the dishes, there's Carey.To be honest, you can find better sex in text-based online communities than anything Carey wrote in this book.4) Waste of Nephilim research / references.This one is a pet peeve with me. I've quite an interest in the Watchers/Nephilim, and to see Carey use what is obviously a fairly detailed knowledge of the associated mythology and boil it simply down to 'sex is good and we're the most beautiful people ever to exist because we're descended from angels' breaks my heart. Particularly because it's rarer to use Nephilim references than it is to use the others she did. Irish, Norse, etc.Jim Butcher's fallen angel, Lasciel, in his Dresden Files series, is in ONE SENTENCE, more convincing, more interesting and more real than any single person OR god in Carey's novel when she (Butcher's Lasciel) says to the protagonist whom she's arguably trying to possess (in the demonic sense), (bear with me, it's a paraphrase) 'So you find the idea of being subject to someone's objectives and desires, completely different from your own, of being without free will - repulsive? Believe me, there are none who know this more keenly than the Fallen.'This is not a one track mind sex-puppet of a god/angel talking... But sadly there's not even one line like it in Carey's novel....I could go on and on but - suffice to say this book was a waste of time for me, and I won't be reading the sequels."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Moves slower than molasses! I read a short story by Jacquiline Carey and loved it, but it just doesn't translate into a full length novel. Ms. Carey is constantly hinting at what's to come, but never seems to get to the point, and I feel no empathy whatsoever for any of the characters. I feel like I've been reading this story for months, but am only 30% done on my Kindle - yikes! Unfortunately, this will be a book I'll finish when I have nothing else to read."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Pros: Some great characters. Adventure written by a woman. You get a certain excitement with a soft touch that most male writers don't really possess. Its kinda of like reading a pre-raphaelite.Cons: You could have lost about a quarter of this book, tightened up the plot and made it really good. What started out as a minor distraction got really annoying. If you called the people by what they were vikings, French, Italian, Irish, Romans, Greeks it would have been not so distracting. I found myself distracted trying to figure out which group was which, what point in history she was trying to mimic. It would have been better if Carey kept me on the plot. Carey's constant changing of tenses is annoying, but not distracting. She needs to learn to monitor her tenses. When you're in the past stay there, don't shift to future tense when you're trying to do foreshadowing. Also, I'm really tired of the word alacrity.Other: The main characters proclivity for BDSM for pay is probably disturbing for many (if not most) readers. I found the political intrigue interesting, but tiresome at times. Look, I'm a guy....if you get tired enough of it, just smack it with a sword."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Kushiel's Dart was quite a surprise to me. I was expectiing a lusty novel with little story line to support the book and came to read it only because of a friend. I will say now I will read more referrals in the future and leave my skepticism at the cover of the book.Kushiel's Dart is a well written political erotic fantasy told through the eyes of a female protagonist named Phedre(Faydra). It is vast in scope and can be overwhelming in the earlier chapters, but keep turning the pages because what unfolds is well worth wading through the confusion.Phedre's life is described from child to adult living in the land of Terra D'Ange and through this progression we as readers are rewarded at seeing the changes the lead of this book undergoes.As a child she is sold to a wealthy intellectual that basically makes her go to school each day and learn large array of languages, lineages and history to equip her for the remainder of the book.As Phedre matures to early womanhood the skills of her mark \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" and the knowledge she has learned as a child are woven together to make a very efficient interrogator to the assignations she works with. Through this comes confusion which can dissuade the reader, because her guardian Delanuay lets her know nothing of what the knowledge she extracts means. Soon the plot changes to a faster pace as the royal houses start having turmoil and Phedre becomes free from her bond to Delanuay.Through the turmoil of the royal houses Phedra soon finds herself in the Skaldic barbarian lands which is a well described harsh arctic climate with brute barbaric tribes that reside their. Phedre soon uncovers a plot against the throne of her homeland and escapes to warn her beloved country.The plot is described to the queen of Terra D'Ange and Phedre soon is off to sea sailing to get help from the Draiday. I won't ruin the ending but know it is very climatic.Carey has a winner with this book engrossing the reader for a huge 900 page book. The lead is fantastic, I particularly like the fact it is a female, so many times I read books with women described as weak and helpless leaving the men to be the heroes. Phedre also has an outstanding support of characters that surround her and the reader is able to know each of them personally through Carey's brilliant characterization. I could not put this book down, in fact I would escape to lunch from work just to take time to squeeze in a few more chapters of this incredible book. I highly recommend this book it has something for everyone, even those that normally don't pick up this type book will enjoy Carey's debut."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Phedre no Delaunay is sold into indentured servitude as a child, her bond purchased by Anafiel Delauney (aka The Whoremaster of Spies), who recognises that the spot of blood in her eye marks her as one who is pricked by Kushiel's Dart (she experiences pain and pleasure as one - a masochist). She's trained as a courtesan, but is also taught how to observe and analyse what she sees - the tools of a spy. As Phedre's homeland of Terre d'Ange is drawn ever closer to conflict through treachery and betrayal, it will be up to Phedre to use all of the talents at her disposal to save what she holds dear.For me this book has one of the worst beginnings I have ever read. The first time I read it I think it took me over thirty starts before I managed to get past the first page. If you can bear with it this is a story that is well worth reading. I have pin-pointed the spot where I was drawn into the story - page 11 where Phedre finally stops talking about herself. And by page 343 I am totally absorbed in the cruelty and beauty of Terre d'Ange, just in time for Jacqueline Carey to rip my heart out via my throat - metaphorically speaking.I guess my main problem with the book is that I don't particularly like Phedre as a character. She has a severe case of Buffyitis only instead of 'I'm the slayer', it's 'I'm the anguisette'. Get over yourself already!If you haven't read the book you may want to know that most of the love scenes are of a sado-masochistic nature, so if that's not your sort of thing perhaps you should give this one a miss. Though in my opinion these scenes are beautifully written and necessary to the plot.This book has taught me that you don't need to love the protagonist in order to fall in love with the world she inhabits and the story she tells. Jacqueline Carey's worldbuilding is immaculate. Not only does she bring the myths, culture and beauty of Terre d'Ange to life. She takes us to the wild northern lands of Skaldia with a struggle for survival, and over the sea to the barbarian land of Alba and the battle for a stolen throne. This is an epic tale.More than anything it is the characters surrounding Phedre who fascinate me - Alcuin, Delaunay, Joscelin, Melisande and Hyacinthe - and the history of the land that she is witness to and part of. Jacqueline Carey draws us into this world and makes it real, her storytelling has a depth and lushness that pulls you in (if you can just get past those first few pages).Also available Kushiel's Chosen (book 2) and Kushiel's Avatar (book 3)"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Phedre no Delaunay is the unlucky daughter of a highborn courtesan and a minor nobleman who married in the face of community opposition. Phedre has been cursed with Kushiel's Dart, a scarlet mote in her left eye which marks her as a follower of Kushiel, a god whose worship involves pain. She is an anguisette, born to find sexual release in pain. Sold by her mother to an esteemed house of prostitution, Phedre's contract is purchased by Anafiel Delaunay, a mysterious aristocrat who will find a use for Phedre's talents. Pledged to protect the child heir to the throne of Terre D'Ange, Delaunay needs a courtesan he can groom as a spy. Phedre's unique predelictions provide her entre into the bedrooms of the most powerful men and women in the country. But when Delaunay's dangerous game of intrigue goes wrong, Phedre is betrayed into slavery in the distant land of the Skaldi, a primitive but war like country whose ambitious leader seeks to expand his empire. Accompanied only by a reluctant young warrior-priest who disapproves of Phedre's profession, Phedre is at the mercy of Waldemar Selig, the clever Skaldi king who has forged secret alliances with Terre D \`Ange traitors. It is up to Phedre and Joscelin to warn the young Queen Isandre and save Terre D'Ange from invasion. Carey has crafted an exquisite novel that elevates political intrigue to a work of art. Phedre is a fascinating heroine whose penchant for pain is so delicately depicted that the reader can understand her torment. Although the erotic scenes comprise only a small portion of this epic fantasy, their influence permeates the novel with a sensuality that provides an intriguing undertone. This is a magnificent first novel and only the beginning of a series that will fascinate and intrigue readers for years."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This story is an amazingly rich and layered fantasy that will completely suck you in if you give it half a chance.From reading all three of the Kushiel's novels thus far, I can tell that Ms. Carey has done her research about ancient places, languages, myths, and religions to weave her stories into something that feels real even as you are swept away in the fantasy of it all. You are able to see the world that was, yet imagine a world that might have been all at the same time.These are NOT kids books. They have sexual themes that definitly make them grown-up reading and make it necessary to be able to put personal preferences aside and simply go along with the story, but nothing about those situations feel gratuitous or simply placed there for shock value; they actually help propel the story.All in all, I love the Kushiel's stories and am anxiously looking forward to the next books. If you love history and love fantasy, I think you will also find this series facinating."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I probably own over 200 sci-fi/fantasy novels, and have read at least twice that. Carey's trilogy is easily one of the most politically intricate; Kushiel's Dart sports characters that are almost tangible with very human flaws and strengths set in a background with enough similarities to real settings for the reader to feel like he knows the world. While I'm not a fan for Phedre's particular sexual quirks, they did not in any way detract from the book and actually helped her character's developement. Her courage as a writer is to be admired as well; her writing style and level inevitably eliminated a great deal of her potential audience, and it's nice to see that there are still a couple of authors out there that have enough self-respect and respect for their audience to not hold back. Outstanding. Buy."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The world she creates is very detailed and sensual.

These are just some of the elements you will find contained within Kushiel's Dart. I picked this novel up on a whim, as I am forever in search of good fantasy fiction, especially those with strong flawed female heroines.Phedre is a magnificant heroine. She is flawed, tormented by her God's mark to forver receive pleasure from pain, and yet seeking to do good. Her mentor, who bought her when she was but a girl uses her for her special gift and makes her a spy. Phedre and the other characters in this novel are as three dimensional and complex as the novel itself.Jacqueline Carey takes the story of Jesus Christ and transforms it into the story of Emanuel and his followers. The people that inhabit Phedre's world are descendant from Angels, and these Angels play a heavy hand in their life and culture. Phedre herself has been pierced by Kushiel, a mark visible to all because of the red mote in her left eye.Phedre's journey is only beginning in this novel that is full of court intrigue, deception, and betrayal. But even within these cruel elements there is love and tenderness, for sometimes even Phedre herself must use deception and betray those she cares for in order to what must be done.This novel is not for the faint of heart, as it is 800 plus pages. Length alone is not the only challenge this book presents, but the sheer complexity of the story requires excellent attention to detail. For those of you in the market for good fantasy fiction and enjoy reading the time will fly by, too quickly. I finished this novel in a one day power session, it took me a few hours, but it was well worth it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"My boyfriend brought this book home, and I groaned when I saw the cover. I was quick to dismiss this as a silly romance novel. However, out of mild curiosity, I picked the book up, and quickly found myself sucked into it. My assumption was completely wrong.Carey writes wonderfully, spinning a tale of intrigue, politics, and betrayal. Her characters are also extremely well-developed. The book is fast paced, and truly a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This well-written novel portrays an early Renaissance world, with a Europe similar but very distinct based upon alternate developments of gods and empires. But the tale is captivating, covering the childhood, education and early career of Phedre do Delauney. No ordinary heroine this, an anquisette, who derives pleasure from love and pain both. In the hands of most writers, this could break down into hokum and bad plot lines. But Ms. Carey delivers a tour-de-force that makes the heroine engaging and eminently believable. The repartes and sardonic humour between Phedre and Joselyn, her bodyguard, about her 'little thing,' add spice and humour to a rousing adventure story. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Up front let me say the first 100 or so pages are a tough read. Lots of history and unusual names to learn. BUT, after that... WOW! This is a fantastic book, that is very difficult to put down. The tale told in this book is enough in itself, I could have been happy with just the one book. But to know that I have two more to look forward too... I'm very excited. Once you start reading this book, don't let anything put you off. It may be a little disturbing to some early on, but once Phedre leaves her homeland for the first time the whole story changes and into a much higher gear.Can I give it more than 5 stars?To Mrs. Carey - thankyou for this wonderful book, I look forward to purchasing more from you in the future."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The first almost third of the book was VERY slow, though neccessary to get everything established. If you make it past this point you won't be sorry, for the book (and its sequels) is fast paced from there on out. I usually don't read fantasy but I really liked this book because enough of it was believable and it wasn't too campy or wacky. Not only is Carey a great writer, but her plotline had EVERYTHING in it. Romance, action, adventure, suspense, with some sex thrown in. A lot of these reviews mention the scenes of masochistic sex Phedre (Fay-dra) actually takes pleasure in as maybe being too graphic for some readers to enjoy. In my opinion they weren't all that bad, and lacked the usual corny and pointlessness most sex scenes in books have. I recommend this book and the two that follow! Phedre is such an amazing female, not only is she horrendously clever, but she's like Houdini the way she manages to get herself out of impossible situations. I don't know who would be fitting to be cast as her in a movie, but Orlando Bloom would be the perfect Joscelin (even though this would be like resurrecting Legolas) and I thought of Rena Soufer whenever Melisande appeared."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"When I bought this book, I was a little wary of it being part of a trilogy. I wanted a self-contained novel. Nicely, Kushiel's Dart stands on its own.Phedre no Delaunay is an anguisette, a spy and a scholar. There is subtle magic on Phedre's world. She makes her way through life with stubborn determination, using whatever fate throws in her path. She is like a much darker &quot;Mistress of the Empire&quot;, the saga from Feist and Wurt.I was engrossed in the story. This is a page-turner. However, some of the scenes it describes are intended for mature audiences.I really enjoyed the characters, and now I am getting the next two books in the series."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I personally liked this book. It is the first book I've read containing dark subjects like S&amp;M. However, it is essential to the story. I found the world very interesting. The fact that the world resembles Europe was interesting, and her twist on world history was fasinating. It makes it easier to understand the characters when one can relate them to actual people, something I find laking in most fantasy books.However, it can get a little sappy sometimes, almost to the point of wanting to toss my cookies.It's got, war, intrigue, magic, and romance. A dark fantasy worth losing a little sleep over. If your not frighteed by the darker elements (I've read worse) and are a little on a romantic side. This book is for you."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I loved this book, although I think I ended up liked Joscelin more than Phedre. I don't find the S&amp;M off putting at all, but then I write things that are much more descriptive than the things in this book. There were some great battle scenes and dramatic moments, and I felt a touch of true fear for some of the characters a time or two. I couldn't put this book down. Here's hoping certain things work out in the end!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Carey glosses over some of the more difficult parts of the book (i.e. battles or combat of any kind for that matter) which is interesting given a storyline that revolves in large part around war. I also got tired of thinking- hmmm it's a good thing this (insert evil characters name here) is totally undone by their lust for Phedre or she might not get out of this one. That happened over and over again, which leads me to the second thing that bugged me. Over the course of the novel Phedre somehow manages to screw virtually every character of any importance inside the storyline with the exception of those unfortunate enough to die early on. Does it ever even explain how she keeps from getting pregnant? Or how she keeps from catching a single disease? I also disliked the enormous lack of detail in parts of the novel where Carey was hurrying things to get to the next major event, usually Phedre having sexual relations or being physically abused with/by one of the other main characters. Anyways... As many of the other reviewers have pointed out the novel has quite a few strong suites as well. The storyline is original if predictable and Carey is obviously a talented writer. I wish Tor Books agreed with me that 90%Romance-10%Fantasy is not a Fantasy-Romance novel. It's a Romance with a few fantasy elements thrown in."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Great epic fantasy is successful when it takes you to places you have never entered before.Authors like George Martin,China Mieville, Robin Hobb, Steven Erikson and Goodkind are examples now add Jacqueline Carey name to this esteem list. &quot;When Love cast me out,it was Cruelty who took pity upon me.&quot; These words help start up this dark erotic epic fantasy that will take you to the kingdom of Terre d'Ange, a country born of angels where prostitution is a holy act and court intrigue is most lethal.You will see this through the eyes of unforgettable heroine,Phedre who is sold to the engimatic Delaunay to be trained as a courtesan and schooled in foreign languages and is to become Delaunay's spy.She will learn her nation's darkest secrets and deadiliest conspiracies.Phedre's adventures will take her to the beds of her country's most powerful men, to be sold to slavery to a barbarian king and savior of her homeland from a brutal invasion!

She is so beautiful that mortals look upon her countenance with envy, so sexually desirable that every King, Queen, and noble would step over Helen of Troy for a chance with her, so scholarly that she knows more languages and poetry than the actual scholars of the realm, so clever that she never reads another person incorrectly, so physically fit that she can scale buildings and cross countries on foot, so stealthy that she is never noticed when she doesn't want to be, and so hardcore that she need never use her safe word.It is a recommended buy if:- You are looking for a feel good read with BDSM overtones. It might be a nice gift for the sub who has been having a bad week.- You are interested in roleplaying (online or *cough* not) from the thirteen special pleasure houses introduced in this book.- You enjoy the flowery beauty of \\"le France\\".I don't recommend this book if:- You want at least one of over 900 mass market pages to be thought provoking.- Verbose, flowery language with inconsistent narrative tone makes you queasy. (Present, past, and future do not mean much in this narration, and the snarky asides do not help in this matter.)"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I saw this on the shelf at an out of the way bookstore and thought, \\"Now that might be interesting.\\" But I wasn't expecting it to be enthralling. The story is wonderful and exciting. Phedre isn't exactly what a person would normal think of as a heroine but she fills the role beautifully. Phedre is a anguisette, meaning that she is person born to bear pain as pleasure. We get to watch this person grow from a small child to a highly paid courtesan, to a comtess. We also get to watch personal struggles between her and loved ones. Add a wild goose chase and a plot against the throne and we have a thrilling read! Don't be fooled by the nay-sayers that have posted reviews. They must not have been reading properly. One such review stated that Phedre's arch enemy revealed a secret to her in the afterglow of sex. This isn't true at all. They weren't arch enemies and he only named his benefactor. The people that didn't take the time to get the facts straight aren't going to like the book. It does require some amount of creative thinking to make sense."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"In response to P. Robinson's (\\"Relic113\\") review: first of all, etiology refers to the origins of diseases. The word you want is etymology, and I challenge you to list one word Carey uses in Kushiel's Dart that is not based on an actual word from a living or dead language. Yes, the character's name is Phedre no Delaunay - Phedre of the House of Delaunay. Not a big mystery there. Also, none of the sex scenes in the book are anywhere near eight pages long - most of them are a page or two at the most.Perhaps we didn't read the same book. Or maybe, if polysyllabic words like \\"anguisette\\" and \\"languisement\\" are confusing to you, I can recommend an excellent book that one of your peers introduced me to - \\"My Pet Goat.\\";-)"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I have not read anything remotely like this, before--except, perhaps, \\"Mia,\\" many years ago, which has a similar feel, to some degree. However, \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" is so much more EPIC than anything I have read other than Sword & Sorcery type fiction novels.... It seems to be it's own genre.I have been trying to think of how to review this book, and other people have certainly listed the over-all scenario, religious feel, etc.--however, something I noticed, immediately, is that \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" would probably be much more appealing to Thelemites, than Christians. There is certainly a pseudo- Christian (Gnostic Christian) feel to certain religions depicted in the book. Yet, the \\"Love as thou wilt\\" attitude and admonishment speaks of Thelema (Aliester Crowley often used the catch phrase: \\"Do What Thout Wilt Shall Be The Whole of The Law: Love is The Law, Love Under Will\\"). In fact, I felt many scenes of the story depicted a very Thelemic religious context.Regardless, aside from all the pantheons, religions and such, the story is engrossing in its depiction of a young, unwanted little girl rising through the social system and being singled-out by a very brilliant man who teaches her the inticacies of society and intrigue, as she is also learning about the delicacies and torment of the flesh.This lady struggles to rise from the level of slavery, yet craves being a slave, longing for the master's whip. She is caught-up in a world of seeming chaos, that is actually orchestrated by the whims of Nobility. There are many seeming contradictions and plot twists, many names to keep track of, and a few Conundrums waiting to be solved.This book captivated me through many flights and airport waiting areas--it was difficult to put-down and I recall staying in many nights, reading in hotel rooms, instead of going out in a new city. The story pulled me in and I was thankful that sequels are available. I did not want the story to end.This is the only \\"epic fantasy\\" novel (other than \\"Mia\\") I have ever read that did not have the usual Tolkienesque or Terry Brooks style characters. However, there are some surprises, which I will not ruin."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"How can a person's mind and soul be so thoroughly drained and depleted while concurrently being replenished to the point of overflow? Thank you, Ms. Carey for providing this reader with the answer to that question. In this compelling epic, the author draws upon many classical literary traditions and introduces the reading world to her own intriguing concepts and artful methods, the combination of which, leaves the reader begging for more. The language used to bind it together and to set the tempo is one of Carey's greatest strengths. It is as rich and eloquent as it is intelligent and playful. And if the author's command of language is powerful in its own right, then her intimacy with the subtle ways in which it can be used to send the reader on his own journey within the story is a gift as rare as Phedre's scarlet birthmark. With &quot;Kushiel's Dart,&quot; Jacqueline Carey drives toward the very nature of divinity and humanity, her story a celebration of the countless ways in which the two inter-relate. Carey's gift to the reader is not only that of a well-crafted tale. She uses the story to let the reader experience for himself the magnitude of mortality and immortality. Carey draws a map to the place where Art and Beauty are housed, then she leaves the reader with the key to the front door to come inside and explore; to &quot;Love as thou wilt.&quot;"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book reads as if it was written by an inexperienced college girl who is majoring in French and watched \\"The Story of O\\" too many times.To start with it's very annoying when fantasy writers are too lazy to create a fantasy world that suits their story. So they just take the map of Europe, muddle up the names of things and write as if they are writing alternative history (which they aren't).Beautiful, boring and smug people engaging in lots of silly mock-sophisticated sex and boring political intrigue.

I realize that most people don't have as much difficulty with this as I do, which is why I gave two stars instead of one, but I can't help that it colored my opinion. I had an impossible time following who was backstabbing who, which made me concentrate on faults that I normally would have let slide. The sex scenes are boring, the characters are cookie-cutter, and the author rambles on and on and on. It gets some points for having a *slightly* more original setting than many other fantasy series, and for not using magic as a trump card in every scene, but that's about it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I picked up Kushiel's Dart in the bookstore one day and flipped it open to a sex scene that made me . . . decide not to buy it. A few months later I learned that the book won the Locus Award for Best First Novel. That got my attention. So I got Kushiel's Dart (at my library) and was very pleasantly surprised. Not by the BDSM scenes (if you don't know what BDSM is, ask someone to spank you), but by the excellent writing style -- it is much superior to a lot of what I pick up in the fantasy aisle. What a pleasure to read! No clunky phrasing or bad mechanics. No fluff. She doesn't tell me what I'm supposed to be thinking and she doesn't over-explain. It was extremely well-written, especially for a first novel. The first few paragraphs had me hooked:\\"Lest anyone should suppose that I am a cuckoo's child, got on the wrong side of the blanket by lusty peasant stock and sold into indenture in a shortfallen season, I may say that I am House-born and reared in the Night Court proper, for all the good it did me. It is hard for me to resent my parents, although I envy them their navet&eacute;. No one even told them, when I was born, that they gifted me with an ill-luck name. Ph&egrave;dre, they called me, neither one knowing that it is a Hellene name, and cursed.When I was born, I daresay they still had reason for hope. My eyes, scarce open, were yet of indeterminate color, and the appearance of a newborn babe is a fluid thing, changing from week to week. Blonde wisps may give way to curls of jet, the pallor of birth deepen to a richness like amber, and so on. But when my series of amniotic sea-changes were done, the thing was obvious. I was flawed.\\"BRAVO! Beautiful! As you see, Ms. Carey writes in the first person, and it was mostly effective here. However, occasionally I felt as though I didn't understand Ph&eacute;dre as well as I understood some of the other characters -- maybe I just couldn't relate. But I fell in love with Joscelin (she did a great job with him), and she's got some very appealing villains, too (I love very appealing villians -- is that so wrong?). Her plots move along at just the right pace for me. Her world is complex, but not as highly textured as Kate Elliott's, which is so complex that it moves (as my grandmother, who's from Alabama, says) like molasses in January.Besides the BDSM and bisexuality, Ph&eacute;dre's religious beliefs may be an obstacle for some readers. As a Christian, I would rather read about completely made up gods and religions (since we're in a fantasy world, right?) than bastardized (literally) Christianity. Her version made me uncomfortable. But, I'm willing to overlook that because her characters are so compelling and the writing is so beautiful."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Based on the ravishing reciews, I thought I was reading the new Great American Novel.Uh, no.It's certainly readable writing, and if you can stomach the sex, and the fact that the author uses S&amp;M as her gimmick, than this book will probably fascinate you. It's a little like watching a train wreck at first; the first few instances can be seen as daring. After a while it gets old.Outside the sex there's little to recommend this book. I found the god imagery unimaginative and the character development lacking.I also want to know why Tor is marketing this as a debut, making everyone say, &quot;WOW! What a wonderful first book!&quot; when it's NOT."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I find all the slathering of praise on this book to be silly. Certainly the author is literate, but the prose is one big self-gratification that I prefer not to participate in. I am not offended by the sex itself--even though all the bodice-ripper descriptions of &quot;hard veined phalluses&quot; hardly impress to the level I expected after a gushing Kirkus review. It is the persepctive that is bothersome. Perhaps few other readers don't take offense at the sort of content that abounds in this tasteless book, but if you put golden wrapping on manure, it's still manure; you can foist it off on a lot more people, however."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is one of those fantasy novels where the first 10 pages are nothing but a list of characters that seems to go on forever. This is also one of the few fantasy novels where you actually need to look at that list in order to understand anything that's going on for the first 300 pages of the book. I found myself either falling asleep in mid-sentence, or putting the book down because it gave me a headache. Summarized, the first 300 pages of the book are the worst, then it picks up and actually gets interesting for about 200-400 pages, and then it gets incredibly practical and even more boring than the first 300 pages. I will grant that it has excellent use of vocabulary which gives it the perfect disguise for how much it really sucks. The characters names are also almost impossible to sound out. Some sound exotic, the others are just jumbled up letters. I will not torture myself any further by reading the rest of this series yet to come, and I recommend that noone else torture themselves with it either."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I picked up this book because the characters and plot sounded incredibly interesting, and because I had been recommended it since I like Anne Bishop's work.This piece of trash is nothing like Ms. Bishop's work, which was intelligently plotted and complex, a fascinating read. I'm a very competent reader, hardly ever bogged down in a book. However, that's exactly what this book reminds me of-a bog you keep drowning in. It took me over an hour to finish the first chapter, and that's saying something. There's a saying, \\"Don't use a million dollar word where a one dollar word will do.\\" Ms. Carey uses trillion dollar words where fifty cent ones will do. The book is needlessly complex, a futile attempt at creating a richly detailed world, that in the end, simply bores the reader. I gave up on this book about 200 pages in. I kept pushing, hoping the writing would clear up eventually, but alas, it did not. I fail to understand how Ms. Carey managed to cram so much into this book, yet felt the need for TWO sequels. It makes my head hurt. I bow down to those who were able to finish all three, you truly are more patient than I am. I hope Ms. Carey's writing matures, she has a lot of promise. At this point however, her writing is painfully sophomoric.If you're looking for something with an intruiging cast of characters, a quick-paced AND detailed plot, with a hint of dark sexuality, PLEASE do not waste your time with this book.

Every sentence rings of foolish bombast, the characters have no emotional appeal, and I felt so manipulated I had to throw the book across the room. I have tried to pick up the book again, being a third of the way through, but it repels me again and again. I am no literary snob, I read science fiction and some fantasy all the time, and I am no literary lightweight, enjoying Henry James as much as the next guy, but this piece of marketing mush failed to appeal at any level. The book reads like it was started on an alt.sex newsgroup."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"First of all, this is really not a 'fantasy' book as there is very little magic or fantastic creatures. If you are looking for these, skip this book.Secondly, there are only two aspects of which this book is about: The bondage-sex that the main character Phedre is addicted to, and political intrigue.As to the first aspect, the bondage, you may like it or hate it. You may like it because S&M; is rarely done in a mainstream fantasy book, or you may hate it because Phedre is a kind of prostitute who gets turned on by anyone and everyone who slaps her around physically.As to the political intrigue, you may like it if you crave for the Robert Jordan style (past the 6th book of his series) where there are a whole lot of characters each with a whole lot of motives. You may hate it if you hate this writing style because there's way too many characters with different and confusing names, titles, or nicknames who all act melodramatically at every political event that much of the time the reader may not even understand, because it's so confusing in the first place.Personally, I hated the book in both cases. There were so many characters with so many confusing names that I felt I had to take notes just to keep track of the motives of everyone involved. And since there are so many characters involved they all became so shallow that it's difficult for me to care one way or another for any of them. The only way you can give this book 5 stars is if you understood exactly what was going on and who was doing what. And if you could do that on your first casual reading of the book, you are a lot more patient and more intelligent than I."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I am always suspicious of books with a billion 5 star reviews that are heavily on the text by authors who have never reviewed anything but that one book. It makes me wonder if the author, and/or his/her friends and writing them all. I suspect this may be the case here.This is not a bad book. It's ok. The sex is overdone as a gimmick, when it could have been handled as a theme, if that's what the author really wanted, without being so gross. Subtley handled sometimes, but gratuitous in many cases. It's not the sex that left me unimpressed. It was the author's reach exceding her grasp. The &quot;dramatis personae&quot; at the beginning of the book, as if we cannot possibly keep track of the characters as we read, made me irritated to begin with. After that, I found glancing characterization of that cast of thousands, not really making most of them necessary to the story.Finally, I agree with the reviewer who pointed out the tendency to promote &quot;debuts&quot; so that it can make reviewers like Storm Constantine say &quot;wow, amazing for a first book.&quot; Unless there's another Jacqueline Carey, this is NOT a first book. I hate being manipulated like this."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book was one of the greatest disappointments of the year for me. I had read good things about it and bookreaders I respect had recommended it to me. Unfortunately this book is plagued with \\"made up word syndrome\\" where about a third of the nouns are words that have no etymology in this universe. This is further compounded by the use of ridiculous names such as the hero \\"Phedre no Delaunay\\". Yes this is the heroine's name -very annoying to be sure.Now that my personal gripe has been dealt with I should say that the outlined premise of the book is unique... a concubine uses her special \\"ability\\" to withstand pain and other deviant acts inflicted on her from her \\"johns during sexual encounters. She has \\"Kushiels Dart - a fleck in her eye that is symbolic of this unique trait allowing her to turn pain into pleasure. She uses this method to get close to politicians to gather secrets and the game begins. Unfortunately this tuned into one of those 800+ page books that you just keep reading because at some point it must get good -It didn't. I don't use this phrase very often -but this was clearly a \\"chick book\\". And no, that has nothing to do with the fact the lead character is female. (Steal the Dragon and Game of Thrones both have female leads and they are outstanding) No, I call this a \\"chick book because it seemed to read as a soft-core porn/romance novel. I enjoy reading about sex as much as the next guy, but there is no need for an eight page sex scene in a fantasy novel. Make it two pages and get on with the espionage. The weak writing and the made up words and dreadful sex scenes made this book a chore to finish. I am not impressed that there is a sequel for this and I (unlike Phedre) take no pleasure in needless pain, and will not be reading the next book.As For Mr.B.J Wilson: (A reviewer of all of 3 whole books - all by himself too!)This book was terrible - run from it as if it were the Plague!!This book is in fact a microcosm of etiology - I stand by my original assessment-but do thank you for the correction. Yes, etiology is the study of the history of germs and plagues... This book is what is wrong with reading lately. Someone published a book - a book filled with so much nonsense and in this sense it is like a single germ, floating throughout space.But then it spreads. People that don't know about books and fantasy advocate on the germs behalf, many of them becoming like rats; carriers of the germs... More people contract the germs and it kills both time and brain cells...then the book gets popular to epidemic proportions and soon, some people even begin to say its \\"good\\" - just like they used to say smoking was good for you - after all, that phlegm that you are coughing up is really just \\"badness\\" being expelled from your body...That is what happened with this book, my fine readers. It was a terrible thing to begin with and only got worse with time. Like other strains of disease - it has spawned new strains of sickness - coming in the form of bad sequels.So, Mr. Wilson, you may like this sickeningly poor book, or you may just like germs - I hear Etiologists do quite well...As for myself, I guess my immune system was to strong to be infected with this drivel...Relic113"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I bought this book after having read some of the review on Amazon. It looked promising, but in the end I was disappointed. This book is rather standard fare when it comes to fantasy. It is overly lengthy and kind of tedious with a straight forward political intrigue and political back stabbing that does not require too much imagination. The positive points are the religions of the book which are images of real ones only with intriguing twists. There are not much in terms of fantasy elements (magic, creatures, etc...), this is more political based, which is not what I was personally looking for. Also the characters are very archetypal (ex: the casselin brother Jocelin is a young man twisted by his desire for honour and duty versus his impulses, the inexperienced and young, yet strong and intelligent queen, the wicked yet desirable and beautiful villainess). By archetypal I mean already seen before and not that fresh and interesting. Why can't there be fresh characters that don't always remind me of books or myths that I have already read in the past?Aside from that I can say that this is a typical \\"girl porn\\" book. It will definitely appeal to women reader much more than to male readers. There is also a lot of gay sex involved (I will never understand why women writers are so fond of gay sex?), which I find kind of annoying. If anything this book has confirmed for me the George R.R. Martin is a genius in terms of Fantasy literature that has no equal.Conclusion: If you are a guy then steer clear of this \\"girl porn\\". If you are a women then you will probably enjoy this."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I picked this book up because of its huge sales and reader reviews and thought it was the next big thing after Martin. Boy was i wrong.One of the main characters early in this brick sized novel is a homosexual who uses his two teenage 'prostitutes' to gather inside information for him. Plus since he is gay he has exquisite taste, is beautiful, and writes poetry. What gay guy doesnt?And the main heroine, if she can be called that, is so 'cursed' that she even gains pleasure from skin seared by a hot poker and rape. Hmm, what a bunch of likeable characters.And whats behind these two role model characters? A plot to overthrow the throne with political intrigue, backstabbing, and deceit. The only thing is, 700 pages in, we are given no reason at all to care for the Queen on the throne or the land she rules. Who is this Queen in danger? Why is she in danger? What is her favorite color?The reader is given no reason to like the Queen and her people but we know that our main character must go on a dangerous mission to try and save her throne. Hmm.Maybe the plot comes together in the later books and explains a bit more but if i dont care about the 'good guys' and the throne after 900+ pages then something is wrong. And am i the only one who thought that the Skaldi 'barbarians' were the most realistic people in the book? Those 'barbarians' seemed a lot less savage then those nympho freak nobles.Its sad that a book like this, and Anita Blake and Goodkind, get huge sales because sex sells. Literature and plot take a back seat because half naked covers and kinky S&M; sell. So while this book had a few things i enjoyed, like Guy and Jocelin, i cannot recommend it in the least."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The story is set in a kind of alternate Europe, primarily in an alter-France called Terre d'Ange. In this world, Christianity never got much of a foothold, because in this world God had a red-headed stepchild, so to speak. Basically, everything's the same as in our world until the crucifixion of Christ (called Yeshua in this world). At that point, Mary Magdalene wept at the cross's feet, and her tears mingled with the blood of Yeshua and produced a kind of angel/god creature called Elua. Some considered Elua an abomination or a mistake, but thirteen angels decided to follow him, reckoning that he was a child of God whether God chose to acknowledge him or not (and God didn't). Also following Elua was a woman named Naamah, a whore who decided to protect and care for this innocent creature by selling herself for his needs---to buy food, to bargain for his life, etc. Elua wandered for a long time and then found the land of Terre d'Ange, where the people there welcomed him, and he and his angels settled down there.Now all the people of Terre d'Ange are known throughout the world for their beauty and grace, since they're all the descendants of angels. And because of Naamah's sacrifices, a sort of &quot;blessed whore&quot; belief has perpetuated itself into the Court of Night-Blooming Flowers---thirteen whorehouse-temples whose prostitutes are all sworn to the service of Naamah (who has the status of the Virgin Mary in this land) in various ways. Some houses specialize in fair, delicate types who blush and faint; others specialize in clownish types who make their patrons laugh; still others specialize in darker arts.Into this mix is born Phedre, a child who's rejected from the house she's born into (the fair-fainting house) primarily because she has a &quot;flaw&quot;---a tiny blood-spot in one eye. In Terre d'Ange, this is called &quot;Kushiel's Dart,&quot; and it's the marker of one chosen by the cruelest of Elua's Angels, the one who administered punishments to sinners. It marks Phedre as an &quot;anguissette&quot;---a masochist.Phedre is sold to a man deeply involved in the politics of Terre d'Ange. He understands immediately what her potential is, so he tutors her in languages, histories, all sorts of things, while she grows up and awaits her debut to the service of Naamah. Once she starts her work---making assignations with the wealthy and powerful of Terre d'Ange society (who seem to consist of an awful lot of sadists) and spying on them---she becomes embroiled in the politics of the land. These politics lead her into an extremely complex and unbelievable series of events, taking her into alternate versions of the Nordic lands, Scotland and Ireland, gypsy country, and beyond. Ultimately she is the only person who can save Terre d'Ange from a terrible invasion---and she goes about it in her own unique style.What I love about this book is its protagonist. Phedre is witty, sensual, cultured, and haughty, and although she enjoys being bound and tortured during sex, she's by no means a subservient character. Indeed, that's a theme of the novel, repeated several times--- &quot;That which yields is not necessarily weak.&quot; She may play the servant at times, but she's always looking out for her own interests, and those of the people she loves. She can be downright ruthless, frankly, and she manages to bring about the downfall of a number of powerful people.I also love the sensuality of this book. This is a world where all of the whores have spent years studying the erotic arts; they even have a textbook whose title translates, in the faux-French of this world, to &quot;Three Million Joys&quot;. And Phedre knows every technique in that book. =P Phedre's assignations are described in delicate but powerful detail---not crude or extensive, but clear enough that the reader sees both how much pleasure she gets from the act, and how she wraps her patrons around her little finger in the process. It's not always pleasant, and those who are repelled by sado-masochism or bondage might find some scenes disturbing. There are also some scenes when Phedre is forced into unwilling slavery to a Nordic lord, and is raped (although because of what she is, she enjoys even this---and hates herself for it). But overall there's more than enough good sex to make up for the not-so-good. Including several female/female scenes; Phedre has no preferences, and her greatest lover/adversary happens to be a woman. (That's another thing I like---there are very few weak women in this novel.)Aside from the lack of m/m stuff, the only other thing I could possibly call a flaw is the absolute complexity of this novel. And I'll qualify that by saying it's not really a flaw; I just prefer not to have to *study* when I read a novel for fun. There are dozens of characters in the book, all from different houses of nobility and different bloodlines of angels and different duchies and so forth, and even quite a few from different countries. And all of them are interwoven in a tapestry of intrigue so deep I almost got lost in it. We discover the threads of this tapestry as Phedre does, and we understand the whole of it only when Phedre comprehends, so for at least half the novel all these characters and all these events are a confusing jumble. Several times I was forced to look at the glossary of characters, thoughtfully placed at the front of the book rather than the back---it's a necessity. However... when the tapestry begins to come together, it does so masterfully, and I realized at that point that all of the layers of detail were absolutely necessary. This is a completely realistic conspiracy, and by the end it's completely realistic that a masochist-spy-prostitute would be the one to foil it.A definite recommend. =)"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"...and it was a shame that a book with so much potential should leave me exhausted from laboring through the last 300 pages instead of rushing out to buy Kushiel #2.The story is built around the intruiging concept of an alternate renaissance world (with a religion that coincidentally dovetails with themes from Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code)--and is the only fantasy novel I've read with a map of Europe in the front. Although the names of countries and cities have been changed, they all still had historical roots (in OUR world!) and can be deciphered by any reader with a slight classical background. Kudos to Carey for the obviously extensive research she conducted to give her setting authenticity.The main character Phedre of Terre D'Ange (Land of Angels...aka France) is bought and raised by an erudite nobleman with a hidden agenda of espionage. He has Phedre trained as a courtesan, but in this alternate world the &quot;arts of the bedroom&quot; are related to religious zeal--and the detailed cultural picture of Terre d'Ange painted by the author had me believing it, too. In her acceptable role in society as courtesan, Phedre aids her master by collecting information from her various high-brow clients. Treason and political intrigue gradually sift to the surface...and suddenly Phedre's world is turned upside-down.This is where the book gets very good. I loved watching Phedre and her uptight body-guard named Josslin come to terms with Barbaric Skaldi tribes. And with eachother. Here the characters were at their fullest and held my concert. But what goes up must come down, as the saying goes. Once this major plot point is resolved, the rest of the story drags on, a 300 page anticlimax. The emotion I had felt as the story unfolded suddenly faded.One aspect of the book that jarred me was that for the most part, the story is rooted in the realism of alternate history. For more than 600 pages, the laws of physics etc. are obeyed. Then towards the end several undeniably *magical* occurances were so out of place that I could no longer suspend my belief, and my faith in this beautiful alternate world sprung a leak.It also got annoying the way the author repeated herself, describing the same thing over and over (300+ pages could have been omitted!) Yes, I know that kneeling &quot;abeyante&quot; was the first thing Phedre learned at the Night Court...I don't need to be told every single time she kneels (and she sure kneels a lot)!To sum it up, Kushiels Dart had all the political intrigue, spies and plots I had hoped for, but for all the plot complexities and researched background, didn't have the depth and belivability I'd hoped for."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"If you'd like to skip the review, just know that I recommend this book, ardently. I won't summarize, but here are a few of my first impressions:Yes, it is fantasy, and no, there is no magic. Mostly, anyway.Carey takes a hundred or so pages to set everything into motion. Generally it's a letdown when authors invest so much time on the setting, as most of them don't efficiently use the information set forth there later on (rather, they are just warming up to their own story). You will see Carey, by contrast, relying heavily upon this information all throughout the series. Don't doze through the beginning--though to be realistic, it's hardly trudging reading. I was very entertained.The fighting scenes are incredible. ...The best, I think, out of all fantasy I have read thus far (including such big names as Modesitt Jr., Jordan, Brooks, Williams, Martin)--and I am not saying this out of the bias one incurs by freshly completing a novel. I will enjoy Carey's fighting scenes until I find an author who is better at writing them.As for Carey's writing style: It's very concentrated. She wastes no words whatsoever (unlike, i.e., Robert Jordan). Oh, you'll see Carey have Phedre--the main character--ramble occasionally, but it's evident that this is intended to color her personality and is not due to lacking on Carey's part.This brings me to Phedre. Wow. Suffice it to say that Carey has shown me that I do indeed have an imagination. On a sidenote, I am especially impressed with Carey's understanding of mens' misunderstanding of women. I am male, for the record.As for the other characters... I have truly connected with them. Upon completing this book, I have felt the hallmark sadness we all feel when abandoning characters we have grown attached to. I usually don't feel this. For comparison's sake, I have not felt this attachment with characters in Jordan's or Brooks' books--since ALL of Jordan's characters become permanently annoying at some point, and Brooks' characters are saturated in cliche. With Modesitt Jr., I have felt the attachment fairly so, and Williams and Martin, very much so. I think I am most attached to Carey's characters, though.I notice that, like Martin, Carey is not afraid to kill her characters. Fantasy authors generally don't like to do that, both because of time invested and, more importantly, because the prophetic nature of typical fantasy allows for (requires, even?) all the Good characters to go through hell and come back alive. Carey not only kills important characters ruthlessly, but makes excellent use of their deaths when she does. Everything changes once a character dies--and change, of course, is good. And even then, after all the major change is through with, you will see dead characters having an impact on the story at hand.Perhaps the best thing about Kushiel's Dart is its emotional intensity. True to its theme, when the book is not climaxing, it's sinking--always, always there is the undertone of intermingled pleasure and sorrow. I really, really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I am not going to write a plot summary as many readers havedone so already.Why is it a must read? It passed my midnight test - which means that I could not put it down at midnight even though I had to get up early next day. Few books did that for me. Another test it passed - 'common sense' test. That is, if you buy into the writers' premise, settings and characters, do they behave in the manner consistent with the author's world.Pros - Intricate plot, interesting fully fleshed out characters, wonderful flowing language.Cons - Very few and minor. Some unnecessary repetitions.Another that has been brought up, is that some characters are too perfect, or at least better than the rest in some important attribute. Joscelin is the best fighter, Skaldi king is a head taller than everybody is and the smartest one around; Delaunay is best poet and I am not going to even bring up Alcuin, he isso annoying in his perfection.I want to address some reviews that gave this book a low rating.1. People who complain that names are too complicated: you want everyone to be named John Smith? (Or Rand, Mat and Lan?)The setting is alternate France, guess what, they have French names!2. 'Book is too long' - no, it is not. It has something for everyone - love scenes are as important as battles and battles are as important as journeys. All serve a purpose, and the bookwould suffer if you cut any of them out.3. Flowery language - did you read Lord of the Rings? If not, what are you doing reading fantasy?4. The sexual (submissive and homoerotic among others) context - I laughed when I read that one guy, a high schooler, no less, found it boring. To him I say - wait a few years.I also feel some reviewers missed what I consider an absolute main theme of the book: triumph of the heroine over her nature. It is easy for a Conan-type to confront his enemies - it is much harder, if one look at your adversary buckles your knees and melts your heart. Yet, the heroine perseveresand triumphs (and if you think I gave away a major part of thestory - with books two and three to follow, do you think heroinewould die at the end of this one?)In conclusion: Is this the best fantasy/sci fi book I ever read? No.I would put at least Tolkien 'LoTR', George Martins' Song of Ice and Fire, Herberts' 'Dune' and first three of Jordan'sbooks on a level above.However, 'Kushiel's Dart' stands proudly on the next level."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I was asked by Tor to review this book a couple of months ago - now I regret that I took so long to pick it up!&quot;Kushiel's Dart&quot; is a stunning book - the fact that it is a debut novel makes it even the more remarkable. It is anything but your run of the mill fantasy - it is sophisticated, daring, 'take it to the edge' fantasy ... that is, it is one of the best fantasy books you'll find on the shelves this year ... it is one of the best _books_ you'll find on the shelves this year.This has to be a must-read. I loved reading it - I regret not writing it! But wait, there's going to be two more books! Can it get any better?The buzz from inside publishing circles is that this is going to become one of the genre's classics. I commend Tor for picking it up (and then for being wise enough not to cut the guts out of it in editing to suit the faint-hearted), and I commend Jacqueline for writing it. I hope it goes all the way for you, Jacqueline!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I must admit that I didn't start off as a believer. I was browsing in my local bookstore when I happened across this title, and the blurb at the back of the book is a big repelling factor. It makes it sound like it's going to be mostly painful (both for the character involved and the reader to \`view) sex.When I stumbled across the title in my local library therefore, I was predisposed to hate it, so it turned out a surprise when I actually really enjoyed it!All the previous reviews have explained the plot out several times previously, so I won't waste any reader's time regurgitating it in my review.Sure there's a lot of painful sex, but it's done in a strangely tasteful way and it all adds in meaningful ways to the plot, unlike other fantasy authors who simply use it as an obligatory scene to spice up a dull area in the book. The blend of mythic traditions (Norse, Pictish, Celtic) had the potential to turn very, very nasty, but Carey handled them with care and respect, and they've rewarded her by blending seamlessly into the storyline. Some of her new elements, such as the novel \`night court' sub-society, I predict are soon going to be picked up and reused by other authors as being far too good to leave well enough alone.The wanderings of the central character are compelling, the detail is believable, and the writing itself is polished and fluid. If you liked \`Daughter of the Forest' then this is the next book on your reading list."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Four stars may be an ooch on the generous side, but since it's Ms. Carey's first novel, and since about halfway through it got to the point where I couldn't put it down, I don't feel too badly about rounding up the score. Although this novel does fall into the \\"fantasy\\" genre, it's a rather aypical example, with the first half especially almost having a romance novel type of atmosphere. For the most part the mix works, and despite its flaws, this is still an entertaining read.My biggest complaints about the novel are pretty much par for the course for a new author. This one does start out very, very, slowly, and it was an effort at points to muscle my way through the descriptions of the 'night court' and a lot of Phedre's early years. There's a fine line to be walked between adequate history, building characters with depth, layering suspense, and boring the reader, and while the author is MOSTLY successful, this one does start a bit slow for my taste. Secondly, she does use a lot of repetitive language that becomes trying after the first few usages... as another reviewer noted, repeatedly saying \\"If I only knew then...\\" hurts rather than helps the sense of foreshadowing.On to the positives.... and there are many. The second half of the book really, really rolls. What starts out as a rather tedious exercise in court/palace intrigue turns into a fast paced fantasy adventure, almost at the turn of a few pages, and from that point on I simply couldn't put it down. I like the fact that none of the \\"heroes\\" are singularly overwhelming/powerful, and that everything doesn't end up working out perfectly... i.e. victory has a cost. This novel does have more of a flowery/prose feel to the writing, and contains more sexual content than what I normally read, but I can't list these as weaknesses to the novel, as it's clearly what the author intended. Fortunately, those aspects don't take away from the overall plotline, but be forewarned, as they may make this book unacceptable to some readers.Overall... this is a better than decent fantasy novel, pseudo-set in Renaissance europe. Bear with the mythology the writer creates, and it's very easy to become engrossed in the plot. Since this is only the author's first novel, I have hopes that she can clean up some of the imperfections in her future efforts, and am looking forward to picking up volume 2 to see what happens next."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The Dowayne of the Cereus House first called her \\"a whore's unwanted get\\" when she was just a babe. Phedre grew up in the night court, surrounded by the ways of the courtesans, but because of a flaw in her left eye she knew her future would not be among them. It wasn't until a nobleman out of favor with the court identified her as one blessed by the hand of Kushiel that she began to find who, and what, she really was.After her marque is purchased by Anafiel Delaunay she begins to understand that there are plots everywhere to be unearthed. He teaches her to observe and to detect what lies underneath, as well as the arts of the night court, especially that of Phedre's lord Kushiel, who teaches his own to experience pleasure commingled with pain. With her true gift she uncovers a plot to dethrone the current monarchy of Terre D'Ange, a plot put into action by a peer of the realm and the only patron that Phedre has ever truly desired.Phedre must be gotten rid of, for she is the only one who can prove of the horrible deceptions leading up to the demise of the kingdom. And with the aid of a stoic clerk of the Cassiline brotherhood she must find her way back to her home to prove not only the underlying plot, but that she is not a murderess as well. And she must do it in time to stop an impending war with the neighboring nations.I thouroughly enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the others in the series. Some might find it a touch long in some areas, but I found nothing that detracted from the basic story of a young woman who must prove herself against all odds and finds love in the strangest of circumstances. I encourage anyone who enjoys intrigue, mystery, romance, action, fantasy, humor, and one of the greatest villainess of all time to read this book. My only gripe was that two of my favorite characters fell to bad circumstances (one was killed early in the book and one fell under a yeshuite curse in the end of the book) but these elements added to my interest rather than subtracted. Read this book, you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I will admit it, I was getting bored with fantasy. It just seems that recently, things have been getting too predictable to care about. Then I picked up Kushiel's Dart. I can't begin to tell you what a breath of fresh air this was, and how relieved I was to find an author worth looking up on the internet....I will say that this is not a book for children. Age limits are irrelevent seeing as how every person is different, so just make sure that your child is ready for the content of this book.Phedre is right up there with Lessa and Rowan as far as my favorite heroines go. She is amazingly deep and introspective without being sappy. Her trials and tribulations don't just make her grow as a person like so many others in fantasy, they add layers of personality, both good and bad, that you don't find very often in contemporary fantasy. For character development, scene setting, politcal intrigue and above all, exquisite culture building, I recommend this book to everyone who wants something different, or just to anyone with an open mind!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"When I finished Kushiel's Dart, I found myself annoyed at the prospect of reading the sequels. I probably won't. Ultimately I just didn't care about the main character Phedre. And even the idea of following her through two more lengthy sequels is just tiresome.While reading, I was particularly bothered by a couple of things. Off the bat, the \\"prose\\" that many readers have been enamored by put me off. The story being told in first person, the \\"beautiful\\" writing style makes Phedre come off sounding like somebody's arrogant grandmother. And although I never really hated her, I never really liked her or cared what happened to her. At one point Phedre experiences a very big personal loss and becomes a helpless victim, and it just didn't bother me.Now, there are two kinds of people who complain about the SM and sex in the story. Some people were offended by it (too much, too explicit), and others felt disappointed by it (semi-graphic descriptions disappear a third of the way into the story, and Carey tries to describe all of her explicit sex scenes \\"tastefully\\"). It seems that Carey was trying to drive a fine line between too much and too little in the sex department. So, she gives a glimpse of what some of Phedre's sexual encounters are like, and then it's like \\"now, that you know more or less what it's like, we don't have to talk about it any more.\\" And it's understandable that Carey didn't want to over-emphasize sex in the book, didn't want it to come off as straight-up pornographic, but the fact that many of the greater plot complications are more or less resolved with Phedre's sexual encounters makes that seem somewhat hypocritical. And that's one of the other things that really bugged me. No matter how bad it got for her, Phedre always happened to be in exactly the right place at exactly the right time in exactly the right capacity (usually as the result of a sexual encounter) to ultimately save the day. So, you'll see a lot of complaints in the critical reviews about how Phedre is an annoying Mary-Sue character with little to no significant faults. She's too perfect to be likeable or even believable. She faces no really hard choices, just rides along with the Plot and experiences very little discernible growth.Didn't have a problem with all the \\"made-up world\\" words. Didn't have a problem with the \\"alternate Europe\\" universe or the Nephilim-based theology with the \\"god\\" Elua being born from the blood of Jesus on the cross and the Magadalene's tears in the earth. Though the sex-based theology did strike me as pretty shallow.Didn't buy how the antagonist Melisande was supposed to be so much more beautiful than the already superlatively beautiful Phedre and the other D'Angeline people--the most beautiful race on the planet. Didn't buy how Melisande supposedly made Phedre's knees weak, etc. Just wasn't convincing.Well, there are a number of other nitpick things I could say, but there are at least 60 other 1, 2, or 3 star ratings for you to temper the glowing praise with. So, have at it!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Kushiel's Dart is actually an intense, intricate novel that has a potentially good storyline. The cast of characters are enjoyable, except for the patrons of Terre d' Ange who kept me wondering how Phedre could think their nation blessed. There were some gruesome, overblown details and scenes that are, in my opinion, humiliating and repulsive. Although, it just may be the author's way of portraying D'Angelline society and religious ethics/morals.Phedre's character in the beginning of the novel is a little too bold and sometimes, eager. I think being a young female myself, I really couldn't understand the foundation of Phedre's logic. However, her ability to spy, analyze, and translate added purpose and depth to her character. Towards the end of the novel, Phedre's character becomes more likable as she demonstrates her loyalty and love to her country by sacrificing everything she is. Beneath her anguisette exterior beats the heart of a courageous loyalist whose judgment/actions are questionable when it concerns Melisande Shahrizai (whom I absolutely hate). I kept feeling sorry for Hyacinthe and Joscelin especially; they always become entangled in Phedre's life-threatening schemes.I cannot help but feel sorry for Joscelin whose Caselline moral of \\"Protecting and Serving\\" only brings him heartache and danger. His character is extremely loyal making him at times, too deserving of Phedre. However, his Caselline vows make their whole relationship more complicated than ever.Overall, Kushiel's Dart is an interesting novel, but the sexual encounters/scenes and the heroine's cursedness of enjoying/wanting all that her profession entails, overshadows the plotline. I would not recommend this novel to judgmental or conservative readers because some parts may be hard to stomach."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"&quot;Kushiel's Dart&quot; is an epic fantasy saga set in a world similar to Earth, during a period that resembles our early Renaissance. Author Jacqueline Carey weaves an intricate tale, a tapestry of adventure, political intrigue, love, friendship, trust and betrayal. She creates an enormous and varied cast of characters, as well as a variety of religions which motivate them - one resembling Christianity, another, a form of Judaism, and others where gods and demigods are worshipped, similar to those of ancient Greece and Rome. A most unique and unusual young women, who helps make history, narrates this story of a world in upheaval.The main setting, Terre D'Ange, is a land of extraordinary beauty and grace, where it is said that the inhabitants, Angelines, are part angel and part mortal. Phedre no Delauney was sold into the service of Naamah, the honored profession of the courtesan, as a young child. She was a beautiful girl who will grow to be a magnificent woman - not unusual amongst those who are part angel. However, she was kissed by the god. There is a tiny crimson mote in the white of her left eye, (Kushiel's Dart), marking her as an &quot;anguisette,&quot; one of Kushiel's Chosen. A true &quot;anguisette&quot; is extremely rare. Perhaps one is born every 4 or 5 generations. Anguisettes find pleasure in pain. She says of her fate, &quot;When Love cast me out, it was Cruelty who took pity on me.&quot;Phedre was bought by a wealthy peer of the realm, Anafiel Delauney, master spy and beloved of a King. When she was ten years-old he began to train her. She was to become the most famous courtesan in the realm. Prostitution is legal in Terre D'Ange and there is much cachet in belonging to an excellent house and/or in receiving exceptional schooling in the arts of love, letters and conversation. Delauney took her schooling one step further and taught her to gather and interpret intelligence.A young queen is about to be crowned but there are others who vie for the throne. Delauney is sworn to protect the young princess and insure her reign. Thus Phedre is pledged to do the same. As she entertains and serves her patrons, Phedre learns dangerous information - secrets and lies - that set the wheels of adventure rolling. Her world is turned upside down, as friends turn foe and masters becomes pawns. All are somehow involved in plots and subplots, pieces of a large puzzle which she must solve to save her future queen.I really enjoyed &quot;Kushiel's Dart,&quot; the first book in Jacqueline Carey's trilogy. This is probably the only one of the three novels that can stand alone. The ending is a satisfying one, although it leaves more than enough loopholes to make one want to read more. There are some major flaws here also. The novel is much too long. There is a huge cast of characters and I had difficulties remembering many of them, although there is a key which is helpful. The dialogue is too flowery at times. But the principal characters are fabulous. They are very well developed, exciting, diverse - just plain fascinating. And their adventures, intrigues and battles are breathtaking. This epic adventure, part erotic odyssey, part chronicle of a land and its people will Wow you! Highly recommended!JANA"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"What an epic adventure! This book starts out slow and I was tempted to stop reading it often during the first 300 pages.It is a hard book to read. There is a six page Dramatis Personae that lists the major characters and it can be very confusing at times. The second half is easier as less characters are introduced and the action kicks in big time.The author sets up an alternative historical France that she calls Terre D'Ange, the Land of Angels, at around the time 800CE. There is a whole alternate theology based on the son of Jesus (Yeshua in the book) and the Magdalene.The book reminds me of The Hobbit in the sense of it being an epic adventure through many lands and past many challenges, but the hero is a woman and a masochistic prostitute at that. The book is more sensual than explicit with a free love theology as a theme. However, the emphasis is on the machinations of courtly politics and war.Once the action starts, it is hard to put down."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"..and that's no exaggeration.Frankly, I don't understand why some people think that Carey is attempting to sound over-intelligent at her reader's expense. Sometimes, Phedre's diction is a little archaic, that's all: it doesn't impede understanding, and it adds to the atmosphere over all.This is a wonderful book, a rich tapestry of a fantasy novel, with a multitude of multifaceted and diverse characters, each one with their own views, motives and beliefs. Carey does an excellent job of blending the real world into the fantastical in her books, making countries that are remarkably like ours ((and sometomes even using their names.. ie Venice as La Serinissima.... which is really another name for Venice, you know?))The book begins the story of Phedre, (...)cast off in a Court of courtesains, unfit to serve, due to a single flaw -- a red mote in her left eye. It's not until she is adopted by the powerful Anafiel Delaunay that her true worth is revealed. An 'anguissette', bearer of pleasure through pain, the fist in hundreds of years, with stuning beauty and the capacity to look, learn and remember. She is cast into the net of political intregue, seeking out answers through her unique talents. Answers to age old feuds, and traitorous plots. It will lead her farther than she could have ever imagined....Carey creates very realistic and deep characters, that you'll begin to empathise with as they endure hardships, and come out more experienced. My personal favourite is Joscelin, but every character plays a vital part to the story : the mischivious Hyacinthe, the beautiful and cunning Melisande, the clever and noble Delaunay, the kind Alcuin, the willful Phedre and the exasperated Casseline priest (...)>The best part? it's only the beginning...."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Well, the sex is definitely the gimmick in this book. The main character has been marked by an angel (per the theology as described in the story), which makes her an *anguisette*, or female masochist. I didn't find the sex or the concepts especially offensive, but I also didn't find them wildly original. It's reasonably standard S&amp;M stuff. When Phedre's emotions get involved, as with her bete noire Melisande, things become somewhat more engaging.The world in which this story is set is a pastiche of early-medieval Europe. It's reasonably well done, but could have been much better developed. I found the concept of the physically beautiful, genetically &quot;pure&quot; d'Angelines boring and verging on offensive. The theology which allows d'Angeline culture to embrace sex in multiple forms seems a bit scantily founded. Personally, I would rather read a book set either in medieval Europe as it was, or in a world of original fantasy.The editing is appalling, with &quot;mendicant&quot; consistently misspelled and &quot;brethren&quot; treated as a singular noun. And I'm not sure if comments on cover art really belong here, but the woman pictured on the cover of the hardback edition is strangely proportioned indeed -- look at the length of her upper arms.Having said that, I found this novel essentially fun and readable. The characters are appealing enough to keep the pages turning, and the political twists and turns, while not very well developed, keep things moving outside the bedroom. Occasionally lush imagery isn't anything Tanith Lee hasn't done better, but lifts the text above the mundane level."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The most controversial aspect of this novel, and what will most likely determine whether somebody enjoys it, is the main character's sexuality. The red mote in her eye, Kushiel's Dart, marks her in her people's mythos as a born masochist. Sold into indentured servitude at a young age, she grows up to become a beautiful spy-courtesan whose kinkiness gives her access to the top political figures of the country.The concept may sound somewhat tawdry, but Carey takes the story very seriously and the heroine, Phedre, turns out to be a very believable character. For that matter, all the other characters are credible as well, from the warrior-monk Joscelin who provides a foil for Phedre to her mentor Delaunay and her friend Hyacinthe.Where the novel falls short is its plot and the depth of the writing. The character conflicts that develop between Phedre and the others are a little predictable and mechanical. The epic part of the epic fantasy is fine stuff, but Phedre often seems too removed from it. Carey obviously wrestled with the problem of how to involve Phedre more directly in the plot, given that she is eternally a noncombatant. (To her credit, the author does not make Phedre a credible warrioress in addition to her other talents.) An expected confrontation between the heroine and her nemesis never occurs, too transparently postponed until a sequel. Put simply, Phedre's life doesn't seem in very much danger most of the time.This seems a bit odd, given Phedre's nature. Even the sex / s&m; scenes seem a bit uninvolved; though Carey seems always conscious of Phedre's masochism, she doesn't delve very much into it. Honestly, she could have told exactly the same story but just making Phedre really good in bed. In this sense, the s&m; elements seem a bit artificial.The bottom line is that Jacqueline Carey has some strong characters and an effective setting (a reimagined Europe with just a hint of the fantastic), as well as the willingness to tell a serious story with a controversial edge to it. However, it seems that I will have to wait at least until the second novel to see what she can do with these elements."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is a very interesting book, and it has a lot of things to love within it, but as a whole package it wasn't amazing for me. This is a very unique book, where the sole viewpoint character is a woman that really has no power other than her sexuality and her brain. Phedre is essentially a high class prostitute/sex-slave who has been trained in espionage, and uses her training and her innate ability as Kushiel's Dart, where any pain or abuse she suffers results in exquisite pleasure. This results in many sex scenes in the book that would probably rival the mundane (I assume) BDSM scenes in the 50 Shades of Grey books. This book really serves as a coming of age story (especially the first half) along with a court drama, a fantasy adventure story, and a bit of a war story at the end. The book is very long, and with the strong differences between the first and second half of the book it could have definitely been two books. What is great though, is that while this is the start of a longer series, the story is very self contained. There is a bit of goofiness in the end which I'm sure will lay the ground work for the sequel, but the story of this book is finished at the end, and I really have no need to read the next book except just to continue another part of Phedre's story.The world building in this book is pretty interesting, it is a second world, but it has a decent amount in common with our world's history. The origin story of the people and city mainly featured in this book, is essentially what could have happened in our world after Jesus was killed if God actually existed. It really plays out the same, where a the son of god was born and went through life performing miracles, until he was crucified and stabbed with a spear. However, when the blood of the son of God touched the ground, Mother Earth accepted it and gave birth to Elua, the grandson of God. Then essentially (I'm paraphrasing from memory of course) Elua traveled the world looking for a place for him and his people, along the way fallen angels left God and became Elua's companions. On their travels one of the female angels slept with kings and even people on the roadside to help their company survive another day, this provides the impetus of the very different sexual world Phedre is born into. There's also some interesting stuff where I think the god figure Elua had a male lover, and consequentially there no one really seems to be hung up about sexual preferences in their part of the world. So in this world, there really isn't any magic, but some of the people apparently are touched by God (or the fallen angels that are essentially worshiped as gods in their culture). There are also other powers in the world, but to talk to much about it might be a bit spoilerish. There are many different cultures, and many of them take a part in the story, but probably the biggest are essentially the barbarians, where the many tribes are brought together by an intelligent barbarian, and they pose a huge threat to civilization.The writing in this book is both a big selling point, but also my biggest problem with the book. I'm generally a fan of a single first person viewpoint for the whole book, and in Kushiel's Dart is does really make it unique, but it's odd. Phedre is so powerless, that it always feels like the action is going on around her (and consequentially around the viewpoint of the reader) instead of her being a part of it. Maybe I'm just too much of a heroic fantasy character fan, but I multiple times wished that I could have instead seen through the eyes of the other characters at certain parts of the book. This is made even worse with the occasional very odd narration performed by a future version of Phedre. It only seems to come into play in the most important moments, and every time it really broke me out of the story. From the frequent usages of \\"later I would look back at this point and regret so-and-so\\" to a complete detachment from the present when most of the main characters from the first book are killed off completely randomly (this scene should have been really powerful, but because of its delivery all I felt was annoyance), to all of the huge important battles later in the book being described from what the narrator learned after the fact. Because of this, I found it difficult to get into the book, and it took me a bit longer to get through than a book usually does. The main story itself in the book is relatively basic though very epic, but it is very well done, and there are a lot of interesting scenes and side-stories.In the end, I did enjoy the book, and I would recommend it if you aren't faint at heart. I'll probably pick up the second book of the series at some point, but I'm not in a hurry. I have a feeling that people who read this book could come out with wildly different opinions, for me I just found it to be a good book, but nothing absolutely amazing."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"restored my faith in authors, this book is so interesting that you can not put it down until it is done."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"So I purchased this audio book because my whole family loves this series. I wanted this as a gift for my mom, unfortunately, it is an mp3 audio book and my mom's car (2005) does not play these. I will be able to put them on her mp3 player, but I am rather annoyed that it was not a regular CD especially when the seller had no where on their description that it was not regular audio cds. Fantastic book though!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is a wonderful and provacative series. You will get swept up by the characters and plots. Not for kids."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"All I can say is that this is an awesome book though not for the squeamish or faint of heart. The series is definitely a fresh view in the fantasy universe with by far the most unique protagonist I have thus far met (and I read a lot). Additionally as the series continues it has some of the most unique religious structures I have read about."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"As a debut novel, this one is in a class of its own. Jacqueline Carey starts an epic series with this amazingly addictive, sensual, dramatic story that will keep the reader turning pages, staying up later than planned, and rushing to the store to buy the next book in the series. A word to the wise: buy the first 3 books (1. Kushiel's Dart, 2. Kushiel's Chosen, 3. Kushiel's Avatar) together so you don't get antsy waiting for the next book to come out. I don't like Sci-Fi/Fantasy, but I'm totally in love with Jacqueline Carey's work!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is for the audiobook version.I thoroughly enjoyed the book but I was extremely annoyed by the narrator, Anne Flosnik. She supposedly has 250 audio books to her credit. I thought her accent was a bit strong and had a hard time understanding what she said at times, replaying the section to get a grasp. Her amused voices come out pompous instead. I don't understand how the Skaldi (not sure how it's spelled) have a Count Dracula-like accent even when they're speaking their own language, what's up with that?"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"There is so much I could say about this book, but it would be impossible to explain it with complete accuracy. It's fantasy, intrigue, and romance. It's dark and gritty. It's unexpectedly entertaining.First of all, this book is long. The plot elements are too many to summerize, so I'll just gloss over the main points. The setting is a sort of alternate reality historical Europe--most specifically Terre-D'Ange (France). It's told first person from the point of view of Phedre, a young girl who was given into servitude as a child. She grows up being trained as a courtesan and a spy--to pleasure men and women and to observe and interpret the things she sees. Phedre is unique in that she has the ability to yeild to pain, taking pleasure in the process. As a result of this calling she is thrown into a world of intricate political intrigue, tumultuous romance, violence, and war. She is joined by a varied cast of secondary characters and villians, too many to list or describe.There are a lot of great things about this book, and I believe it would appeal to a wide audience. Phedre is a unique character who stands out both by the standards of modern culture and withing her own world. As a result, I found her likeable and for the most part relateable. The setting and culture created is extremely detailed and entertaing--from the political and social hierarchies, to the legends and religions, to the customs and languages. It takes some concentration to keep everything straight. Which is why I must warn- this isn't exactly light reading. Not only is the plot complex and full of politics, mysteries, and secret plots, but much of the content is vaguely disturbing. But if you put the time and thought into it, you will almost certainly find something appealing.The parts that appealed to me specifically were the relationships. Phedre meets and interacts with quite a variety of characters. There is Hyacynthe, a gypsy boy she meets as a child. Joscelin, Phedre's protector who lives by strict priestly vows which are strongly tried by his growing love for her. I could go on, but the point is that there is every character type imagineable and there's quiete a bit of developement for each of them.I had some issues with this book, and the top one is length. I like my books long, yes, but I hate filler. Was there much of it? No. But enough that I had moments of boredom, or later when I thought back on a chapter I realized it could have been cut to no ill effect. In fact I feel there were a few characters that could have been cut out as unnecessary to the plot. The language is very flowery, which is mostly a plus, but at times it detracts from the narrative--sometimes simpler would be better.Overall, this is very impressive fantasy. I encourage readers to try it and draw their own conclusions--most fantasy fans should find something positive."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The first book in the series is amazing. I was hesitant at first due to the lack of magic, however Carey weaves a powerful and moving story. ALL the following novels I would rate a 5 the reason the first I have given 4 is the first chunk of the book with all the French style names makes it hard to follow. Once you understand who is who and the groundwork is laid the story takes off. Very mature, I loved it and strongly suggest you try it"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Excellent story, believable and realistic characters. Carey really carves out a reputation for being a good writer with this novel."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"In this alternate fantasy universe we are immersed in a political system that challenges societal views of prostitution, bdsm, and religion. It's a deep dark read that takes you on an epic journey through an alternate Europe (though it's not obvious that this is Europe). Each character works their way into your heart and changes your perspective slowly and carefully. If you want to believe that sensuality should be revered instead of treated like a dirty little secret... If you want to read something that challenges you to combine sensuality and intelligence, subtlety and intrigue, submission and victory ... this whole series is for you. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I'm a fan of the Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind. My cousin suggested this book to me a few years back. This is my second time reading it, and it's even better. It's full of political intrigue and sensuality. You'll definitely enjoy this one!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I really enjoyed this book. At times, it was a bit hard to keep track of who's who, and who was a friend or not. But overall, a good book. Definetly worth the time.Edited to add: I figured i'd add more detail.Phedre is a child of the Night Court, born to courtasan mother and trader father. Sadly(or not?) she's born with a scarlet mote in one of her eyes. Flawed, she cannot be a part of the world her mother was trained to, and had hoped to train her too.She's left by her mother and her life is uncertain. Until the day she discoovers for herself the full force and meaning of her flaw. Or is she flawed? Turns out, the fleck in her eye means Phedre is a rarity, something not seen for years.She has been struck by Kushiel's dart. She is an anguissette,someone who is doomed to find pleasure in pain. The only one to really see what she is, is a man named Anafil Delauney. He takes her in at age 10, and trains her alongside his other pupil, Alcuin.This is a novel of power, pain,misery and self discovery for Phedre. She goes from a pampered Servant of Naamah, to the bed slave of a Skaldi warrior, and everything in between. She is betrayed, and loses some dear to her.A great start to a series."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I will keep this review short and simple, as others have writen enough to let you know what the storie line is. THIS BOOK IS INCREADABLE, it will keep your interest from cover to cover, and the second book in the series is, if possable, even better! I can hardly wait for the next book to come out!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Even before I started reading the book, I was extremely concerned about the level of sexual encounters involving pain. I'm not a prudish person, and I quite enjoy a well-written sex scene, but throw in any kind of pain, and you lost me. Even so, I was constantly encouraged by friends who have read \\"Kushiel's Dart\\", to put my concerns aside and give the novel a try.As it turns out: I couldn't handle it. Every time Phedre was whipped, slapped, burned with a hot poker, pinched, hit, tortured, had her hair pulled, etc, I winced and read faster, willing it to end. It didn't matter to me how much Phedre enjoyed it... the only thing I noticed is how much these situations bothered me. Even this I could have handled, if I had found any of the characters enjoyable in the least. I didn't.I found I could have cared less about the political/courtly intrigue, an aspect of fantasy novels that I normally enjoy greatly. I got 200 pages into the book, and I couldn't find one character I liked. I didn't like Phedre. I couldn't relate to her. Worse, I couldn't understand her motivations - what drove her, what made her the way she was. Maybe all that will be explained in more detail later in the book, but I won't be finding out. I didn't like any of her friends, or influences. I hated Alcuin. He seemed a weak character - one who wasn't developed well enough for me. Delaunay seemed cold, and I also found it hard to understand his motives (again, I assume this will be explained later also). I had no feelings one way or another for the Prince, or Melisande, or any of Phedre's patrons.In short... there was nothing to keep me reading through the torturous sex scenes. This is the first book I tossed, unfinished, in a very long time. I'm normally very stubborn, and I like to finish what I start; but I just couldn't see myself reading another 700 pages of \\"Kushiel's Dart\\"."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Subterfuge and sex.The main focus of this book is a young woman who is trained as a courtesan, but has a minor biological flaw. It turns out that this is important, and a rare sign of her being a supernaturally excellent example of a sadomasochistic sexual servant.Being really good as this also brings her to the attention of spymasters, given that sex and spying go rather well together.Reasonable book, but too long and hence gets tedious for me."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I saw this book on the shelves of various bookstores, picked it up and read the back, then put it back down. Something about it turned me off. Then I bought it on a whim and I was pleasantly surprised. The book was fantastic! The sex parts did not bother me at all, they fit the book very well and were not overly graphic. Also the twist on the European culture added a special something for me. Whenever she would introduce a new culture I would think of which European nation it emulated and follow on the strangely familiar map. All in all this was one of the better books I have read, realistic characters, villians who are not completely evil and heores who are not completely pure (that is obvious). As for Phedre, I set myself up to not like her and found myself falling in love with her instead. Well written and I cannot wait for the next rumored trilogy, Imriel."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Jacqueline Carey is an excellent writer that captures yourattention in the first few pages. Phedre no Delaunay,the lead female, is a powerful and seductive person who hasvery much intelligence with politics as she does in the bed chamber.

This is the most thorough made up history for a fantasy book I've ever read,besides Tolkien. At first it was slow going but then the action picked up. I love this book. It was full of richly written characters and locations that were described like a traveler's log. I want to go to Terre d'ange, I'm pretty sure it exists, I mean nobody writes that much detail about a made-up place right? Wrong, Ms. Carey you are a truly gifted and imaginative writer and I highly recommend this book to any fantasy reader. Phedre' is a strong and sexy woman, with a powerful capacity for both pleasure and pain. A little racy for some tho'. But I AM buying the next two in the series, Kushiel's Chosen and Kushiel's Avatar. Loved It!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"A friend recommended the books to me. We both love SF and Fantasy and I found this book definitely great from a storytelling perspective. It reads as a fairy tale and yet manages to maintain a link with reality. The idea of using an alternative history by changing a few events about 2,000 years ago is certainly interesting and a lot of the subplots are well done. The growing up of Phedre over the three books is good.Some people found that the book is over the top is using poetic descriptions and difficult words. The latter I found not at all true and the former I actually found a positive feature. It helps to \\"see\\" the book, but then again I love 19th century literature as well and that is full of these types of things.As for the people that found the names hard. They are not. Most of them are French(ish) with a contineous disrespect for French grammar rules. I do admit having a book literacy exceeding SF/Fantasy and speaking more than one language does help.You may say why then the 3 stars if you did like it? Well for two reasons.I found the Melisande character as the really bad girl very very weak. The so-called attraction between her and Phedre is under whelming. This important plot that goes on for three books is just not believable. But my main criticism lies in the fact that I found the descriptors used for the various people in Europe extremely condescending to the point of insulting. The Germanic tribes are barbarians as are the people living in the low lands. The people on what we know as the British and Irish isles are considered to be warmongering brutes with a very new age slant on the druidic and Celtic cultures. The face paintings described are worse than any Pict ever wore. The Greek are described mainly as day dreamers who live by what their oracles are stating Only the French are worth anything. Don't get me wrong I love France and the French but they are described as if they are the only people in this alternative Europe that have developed a more enlightened society. Certainly the first book as a result gave me a very nasty aftertaste in my mouth."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The first of a trilogy about a young and uniquely gifted heroine whose innocence is shattered by intrigue and murder. Phedre is a thoroughly engaging heroine on an epic journey rife with intrigue, betrayal, violence, sexual and erotic encounters and, of course, love. Written in beautiful prose, and set on a grand landscape of Renaissance Europe, Carey's series is an exotic tapestry of sensual images that will linger like a rich coffee brewed to perfection. This is not a typical coming-of-age series and definitely adult reading.Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel's Legacy by Tor Books consists of three rather large books: Kushiel's Dart (a hefty 910 pages); Kushiel's Chosen; and Kushiel's Avatar, with a fourth and fifth in the saga, based on another character (Kushiel's Scion and Kushiel's Judgement). Kushiel's Legacy is definitely an epic fantasy. But, thankfully for me, it couldn't be further from its stereotype. Epic, yes--in size, scope and granduer. Fantastic, also, in its brilliant imagination and masterful delivery. But it is so much more. According to T.M. Wagner (SF Reviews.net), Carey \\"eschews the mythic aspirations of traditional high fantasy...[and] has created one VLFN that stands above the bloated pack\\", taking \\"Fantasy into shadowy, exotic corners it rarely dares to tread\\" (Storm Constantine). William Thompson (Revolution SF) found this \\"seductive novel...exceptionally well-written, intricately plotted and [displayed] a grasp of language and storytelling rare in fantasy fiction.\\" To be sure, several readers of traditional fantasy complained that the language was \\"too flowery\\" and the books too long and overfull with detail and characters. This is precisely why I liked it. It reads like classic literary fiction. But it isn't!Chapter One of Kushiel's Dart, the first of Carey's three books focussing on Ph&egrave;dre, begins with Ph&egrave;dre engaging us with a conversational narrative that seamlessly and instantly lures us into her fascinating world. And lured I was; by the end of the first page I learned that her parents gave her a name that was cursed and that Ph&egrave;dre, herself, was flawed: by a scarlet mote, a pinprick of blood emblazened in her left eye--which is enough in this land of aesthetics obsessed with beauty to mark her as blemished. She only later learns the significance of the mark; it is Kushiel's Dart, left by a god who has chosen her to forever experience pain and pleasure as one. Thus begins our relationship with an \`imperfect' girl who was eventually outcast and sold by her mother--as \\"a whore's unwanted get\\"--into indentured servitude in a House of the Night Court (a bordelo). It was the tag line of the first chapter that convinced me that a stirring tale of breathtaking intensity and shocking beauty was unfolding before me:\\"When Love cast me out, it was Cruelty who took pity upon me.\\"Kushiel's Legacy is set in an alternate quasi-medieval Europe, Africa and Asia of Carey's imagination. For instance, there is Aragonia, Caerdiccia Unitas, and Skaldia, loosely representing Spain, Italy and Germany, respectively. And there is Terre d'Ange (land of angels), Ph&egrave;dre's homeland, a place of unsurpassing beauty and grace, and whose beautiful race, created from angels and men, lived by one simple rule: Love as thou wilt. The D'Angelines were descended from the Blessed Elua, an interesting, rather warped, vision of the traditional Christ figure, and his angel companions who abandoned Heaven to follow him as he walked among mortals. Among Elua's companions is the angel, Naamah, who willingly prostituted herself in service to Elua; Cassiel, who abjured mortal love for the love of the divine; and, of course, the mighty Kushiel, of rod and weal, the just Punisher of God, whose blow of pain was the touch of love. Those \\"kissed\\" by Kushiel receive both pleasure and cleansing through the infliction of pain.Early on in Kushiel's Dart, Ph&egrave;dre's bond is purchased by Anafiel Delaunay, an arcane nobleman with a secret past, who recognizes who and what she is--an anguissette, one who can experience pain as pleasure. While his motives elude her, Delaunay tutors Ph&egrave;dre as a spy and rents her out to influential members of the decadent aristocracy to learn their secrets. When one of Delaunay's games gets the better of him, he is murdered and young Ph&egrave;dre is cast on a path of intrigue and treachery that she, as Kushiel's Chosen-Avatar, is singularly able to endure. Thus, she sets off on her hero's journey--aflame with betrayal, sacrifice, scintilating desires, and conspiracy. She encounters a rich and diverse cast of cunning poets, heroic traitors and a truly Machiavellian and seductive villainess. And to balance this is her loyal Cassiline bodyguard, Joscelin, her \\"Perfect Companion\\", who eventually becomes the compass of her heart.True to her heroic stature, Ph&egrave;dre harbours, in both her words (it is she telling us the story) and her mien, no bitterness or resentment for the cruelty and hardship destiny has dealt her. And she does more than simply endure it; she answers the hero's call to play out her role as Kushiel's Chosen. Ph&egrave;dre is a singularly appealing and complex hero because she is non-judgemental, ethical and honourable yet incredibly vulnerable, reckless and stubborn at times. She poses a panoply of opposites. She is, after all, an anguissette: her pain is her pleasure; her yielding is her strength, her wanton behaviour her salvation, her servitude her victory; and her love her courage. Ph&egrave;dre is \\"an unflinching yet poignantly vulnerable heroine\\" (Booklist), whose selfless yielding will conquer the strongest and most depraved of foes. \\"Not all that yields is weak,\\" Hyacinthe, her best friend, tells her. To yield is Kushiel's precept and the moniker of the House of Valerian, dedicated to the just Punisher. And yield, Ph&egrave;dre must--and does; until it becomes her strength and her legacy just as love and honour become her driving force.One is reminded of Christian parallels of yielding, tolerance and sacrifice in the acts of Jesus and his disciples. Ph&egrave;dre walks a balanced moral path, following the precepts of her D'Angeline angels--Kushiel's justice; Naamah's passion, Cassiel's loyalty, and, of course, Elua's love--toward redemption for more than just herself. Carey's exotic blending of Christianity and paganism, daringly poses the question of \\"the sacred potential inherent in every sexual encounter.\\" (Booklist). Wholly embracing her gods, and at great cost to herself, Ph&egrave;dre gives herself away--sexually, and more--in Kushiel's Avatar to rescue an innocent boy and ultimately to save her friend, Hyacinthe, from a wrathful god.\\"Mortals conquer and slay; gods rise and fall. The games we play out on the board of earth echo across the vault of heaven.\\" (Kushiel's Chosen)Some readers have complained, nonetheless, at the inapropriateness of a prostitute as heroine. But, like many heroes with humble often dubious beginnings, Ph&egrave;dre is one chosen by a god, who provides her with the opportunity to demonstrate that her heart and soul are far from base:\\"We pay for sins we do not remember, and seek to do a will we can scarce fathom. That is what is is, to be a god's chosen.\\" (Kushiel's Avatar)Yet for all that, this tale is not for the squeamish or the judgemental. As Kirkus Reviews contends, Kusiel's Legacy is \\"superbly detailed, fascinatingly textured and sometimes unbearably intense,\\" punctuated with highly erotic and, at times, disturbing sexual episodes. The hero is a masochist, \\"whose disturbing sexuality drives the story... [which is as]...delicious as it is unsettling\\" (Emma Bull). T.M Wagner (of SF Reviews.net) sums it up eloquently: Kushiel's Legacy \\"is the real thing, a distaff examination of sex and power, unflinchingly forthright.\\" And, he adds, \\"on no account is it recommended for faint hearts or weak stomachs.\\" Indeed, I was equally spellbound and greatly disturbed by Ph&egrave;dre's last great tryst with evil's desire in a place of true madness where souls are currency (Kushiel's Avatar). Her experience in Darsanga to rescue young Imriel, Melisande's son, will endure in my memory for a long time: the terrible things Ph&egrave;dre endured; the devine way she prevailed. She overcame it all because of the divine love that shone brightly inside her (her name means \\"bright\\" in Greek). It empowered her to shine hope to the hopeless. But the experience left her shattered, in pieces. Make me whole, she later prayed in the Temple of Isis, make us all whole.Kushiel's Legacy is not a romance, although it is a great love story. It is a complex saga, woven with layer upon layer of threads revealed through a metaphoric tapestry, often counterpoint with contradiction and turbulent conflict of morality and values. This journey of self-discovery by a young child journeying into womanhood explores some of the deepest and most cherished virtues of humanity, by courageously dismantling \\"standard notions of...morality\\" (Locus). Virtues like honour and loyalty. Family. And love. Love, in all its aspects:Innocent love--a trusting love for a mother in the act of abandonment: ...She will sell me to this cruel old woman, I thought, and experienced a thrill of terror...My mother stood with my hand in hers and gazed down at my upturned face. It is my last memory of her, those great, dark, lambent eyes searching, searching my own, coming at last to rest upon the left. Through our joined hands, I felt the shudder she repressed.(Kushiel's Dart)Dangerous love--a curious love of forbidden flesh: \\"Ph&egrave;dre.\\" My name only; Melisande spoke it as if to place a finger on my soul, soft and commanding...held me captive and trembling before her...\\"Why do you struggle against your own desire?\\" Melisande lowered her head and kissed me. The shock of it went through me like a spear; I think I gasped...I swayed, dissolving under lips and tongue...my bones... molten fire, my flesh shaping itself to the form of her desire...(Kushiel's Chosen)Cruel love--a sacrificial, yielding love for one's enemy: The Mahrkagir...reached out to touch my cheek and his hand was cold, so cold...I felt his touch like fire, setting me ablaze between my thighs...I shut my teeth on a moan...A strange rill of energy surged between us. I tasted fear and desire, his mad smile, and lost myself in his dilated eyes. His hand trailed down my throat, cupping one breast...pinching my erect nipple as hard as he could. A bolt of pain shot through me and I stifled a moan. \\"Ill thoughts, ill words, ill deeds.\\" He smiled tenderly at me, maintaining a pincerlike grip...\\"Your gods have chosen you for defilement. Is that not so?\\" I closed my eyes. \\"Yes.\\" (Kushiel's Avatar)Tender love--a healing and exalting love for one's true beloved: That kiss, I cannot describe. It was like a poem, a prayer, a homecoming unlooked-for. It was like dungeon walls crumbling to reveal a glimpse of sky. It shook me to the very roots of my soul. All I could do was cling to him and gasp...And that is where time itself seemed to stretch and flow...and everything done by the Mahrkagir was undone, every cruelty, every iron thrust--undone, undone, undone, every kiss, every lick, every stroke, imprinting love upon my flesh, until I shuddered and knotted both hands in Joscelin's hair, calling his name out loud, and my climax followed with the inevitability of the spring-fed waters tumbling over the rocks. (Kushiel's Avatar)Divine love--a selfless compassionate love greater than oneself: It burned in me like strong wine, like the first taste of joie I had known as a child, like Melisande's touch...If I had not brought Imri out of the darkness of Darsanga , this brightness would never come to pass. Truly love was a wondrous force, now that I perceived the complexities of its workings...Joscelin...Every line, every plane of him was writ in an alphabet of flesh and bone, spelling out love. How had I never seen it? And Imriel...a tangled knot of fear and need, achingly vulnerable. It made my heart ache to look upon him. (Kushiel's Avatar)More than anything else, Carey's epic tale is a poem dedicated to love; exalting love in all its facets, from selfless yielding and sacrifice to the harsh lusty desires of a cruel heart. From the last line of Chapter 1 in the first book to the last line of the last book--Jacqueline Carey demonstrates that her Kushiel's Legacy is devoted to the power of love; how love can sustain us, how it shapes our lives, can move an empire, and empower us in our own singular heroic acts.Love as thou wilt."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I hesitated reading Kushiel's Dart for a number of years for that most superficial of reasons: the cover art. Kushiel's Dart looked like little more than a romance novel wrapped in the swaddling of fantasy. This novel, however, has received a fair amount of critical acclaim and good buzz has popped up in some of the online venues I keep an eye on. So, it is with a mild amount of trepidation which I opened the cover.The story begins early on in the life of Phedre, a young girl who would soon to be given over to the care of the Night Court, a group of professional courtesans. After spending several years trained at the Night Court she is adopted, or better yet, purchased by a man named Delaunay. Delaunay purchased Phedre's \\"marque\\", that which Phedre will need to earn back before she has her complete freedom again. She is not a slave, but she is owned. Delaunay has grander plans than just using Phedre as a source of income. Phedre is to be trained to look, listen, and think, to work as something of a spy for Delaunay has she goes on her assignations with the elite of Terre d'Ange.The first hundred pages or so cover Phedre's training, her friendship with a gypsy boy named Hyacinthe, and her training by Delaunay. Jacqueline Carey is setting the stage for what is to come and to prepare Phedre and the reader for the rest of the novel. It would be very easy, however, to close the book any time during the first hundred pages in frustration because while there is quite a bit going on, there is the feeling that nothing actually happened.The second hundred pages or so solve this problem as Phedre is permitted to start earning her marquee back and starts working as a courtesan for Delaunay. These second hundred pages can veer, at times, to soft core pornography. There is a good deal of sex, and because of the nature of Phedre's gift (she is an anguissette, touched by the god Kushiel, which is of a benefit to her \\"work\\" and allows her pleasure in pain), the sex is frequently violent. Carey toes a very fine line in showing the reader the nature of Phedre's work without going into too explicit detail. There are several instances, though, where Carey shows us more than the others so we better know just how violent and sexual things are for Phedre and just how much pleasure she gets from the pain.This is only the beginning of the story, though. There are still five hundred more pages of \\"action\\" and plot. When the intrigue which Delauney has introduced Phedre to but never quite gave her all of the details about comes full circle to threaten Delaunay and Phedre's life, Phedre must choose survival over pride and expedience over her own desires and wishes. Phedre must use all of the skills at her disposal, intellectual and physical, to survive and protect Terre d'Ange from treachery internal and threats external.Kushiel's Dart was a pleasant surprise. The first person narration from Phedre was very effective as Carey perfectly captures the voice of the character and when Phedre declines to graphically explain certain events it does not harm the story, but rather gives the story shading and perspective from the narrating character. Carey is, perhaps, a bit long winded and spends a bit too much time having Phedre dealing with whatever her current situation is. It is all appropriate for the story, but Kushiel's Dart is also a 700 page doorstop of a novel and there is some fat in the novel which could well have been trimmed. In particular, the first two hundred pages had extraneous text, though Carey does a very good job in making reference later to what seemed at first to be padding. This is to say that while Kushiel's Dart is very much on the wordy side, Jacqueline Carey makes even unimportant events early on become important later in the novel. Because of this, it is difficult to say exactly what should have been trimmed, but 700 pages is still a bit much to ask for from the reader for a first novel.With all of that said, Carey does an excellent job making Phedre a believable character and the political intrigue and motivations credible. Phedre's world feels like a place that could possibly exist. As the novel progresses, Phedre still uses the physical tools she has at her disposal (her body), but Carey no longer goes into great detail in what goes on between the sheets. This is to Carey's and the novel's benefit because had the sex not taken a back seat later in the novel Kushiel's Dart would have been little more than a soft core novel with some fantasy elements (i.e. more suited to be shelved in the romance section than fantasy).Kushiel's Dart far exceeded my expectations and while I feel no inclination to rush out and find a copy of the next book, Kushiel's Chosen (another 700 page doorstop), I did enjoy the time spent in Terre d'Ange and will likely return for another visit to the intrigue of Phedre's world.- Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Wow, after getting through the first pages, of difficult names and titles, you just cant stop! It has been a long time that I have read a book this good!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"this was a wonderful book. It enters into the Kushiels Legacy trilogy with Ph&egrave;dre n&oacute; Delauney as a child, and her beginnings of being sold by her parents. She begins her friendship with Hyacinthe, and starts her journey as Naamah's Servant as well as Kushiel's chosen. It is an amazing story that you won't be able to put down, and I would recommend buying the entire trilogy together so you can read them all together!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book was a great read in a literary world of crud. I had recently gone back to reading the classics due to the complete lack of imagination and originality in most of the books out. This book creates a whole new world with different ideas and expressions of those ideas. Yes, the politics are a bit daunting and seem unimportant at first but with the following books they prove their relevance and are an integral part with in the story. Not as complex as a Robert Jordan novel but quite involving."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Perhaps it is because of the origins of the d'Angelines [from Mary Magdeleine's tears and the blood of Christ] that I started out finding this book offensive. But after reading through it, I decided it is really because it is CHEAP. And there is no reason for it to be.Jacqueline Carey is certainly literate enough to craft a good sentence, and perhaps even build a decent story, though the world she draws is pretty on the surface but lacking depth, like her characters. She could have done this with a lot more class, however, if she had not relied on the gimmicky sex. Yes, those who wish for more BDSM will thrill to it. Good for them. They are the same ones who swear Terry Goodkind is the world's greatest author, but they only read him for the jollies the sex and gore give them too.I can't really see there being much of a call for this sort of story past the trilogy. I hope it stops there, because I for one am really disturbed at what passes for epic fantasy these days. The fact that the reviewers all fell over themselves, without noting that the characters are cardboard and the world makes little sense, proves to me that you can fool a lot of people by appealing to the lowest common denominator, even when you don't have to."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I kept seeing this book everywhere I went, it was always in the shelves of recommended/popular books so I figured I'd give it a try. I was terribly disappointed. While the story itself is entertaining and the world and culture Carey creates is fairly imaginative and beautiful, the language and narration describing it was bland. I kept reading solely to find out how the story would turn out. The narration felt distant and I had a really hard time caring about the characters. And for being a story about a courtesan in a society that is so open about sex, never was there a mention of birth control. We could have had a little more realism with a contraceptive ritual that would have fit in perfectly. But no, it's just a sex laden fairy tale."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I, like a few others out there in the mass of reviewers, just don't get the hype. This book wants to be everything - romance, erotica, fantasy, S&M;, action, battle, history - but it fails on all accounts because it's stretched too thin.The sex/S&M; - for a character who's some rare masochist, there's very little in the way of actual sex scenes. One page of a setting, then the \\"red haze\\" comes over her vision and *poof* next thing you know, it's the next morning. BORING. If you're going to make such a big deal of her sexual aspect, at least show it. Sheesh. I can't imagine how anyone couldn't get past those parts since they're so few and very easily skimmed over.The names/terms/made-up words - UGH. Did they need to make everything sound the same? Or give every single character like a half-dozen different names, titles, nick-names, etc.? And was it really needed to spell everything just slightly wrong? Does that make it different? Or special? It made things annoying and was impossible to keep up with many times.The politics - So. Very. Dull. There was no motivation to care what was going on politically. The (ever confusing and renamed) people involved all seemed thrown into way overdramatic directions or had no depth at all. You really just didn't care. And for the love of all that's sacred, just how many times can you hear \\"We're d'Ange\\" as an explanation or reasoning that didn't make sense and was utterly haughty and annoying?The length - it just went on and on and on and on and on and on... it's not enough that there's like fifty different locations in the book, each one just goes on forever. Too much happens. Too many things try to be incorporated.In all, I found it inspid. I really don't get the appeal. It was boring; slow; the author made up words as she went along (without bothering to inform you of them); used too many characters with too many different (but similar) names in too many different locations. You couldn't care about the characters; didn't feel for them so you didn't care what happened. I finished it only because I can't *not* but ugh, this book was the closest I've ever come to just abandoning a book.It's not any of the things it wants to be. It's a jumbled, obnoxious and yet boring mess. Give it a pass."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I love books... old, new, classic, modern... rare to find a written word not worth reading..Until now. Too many words describing nothing. The plots seems like it was thought of over a 12pk and as a way to link bad sex scenes.This is the unfortunate product that publishers are schlepping at us because we want sex and and something to make us feel like our own lives arn't that bad. The ONLY thing that is good about this compared to everything else coming from the fantasy genre is that is DOES NOT have vampires in it.There are some great historical novels out there that are worth every penny. Stick to those and save yourself from tedium."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is quite possibly the worst book I have read in sometime. I quit around page 200, and I commend those that went further.Disguising itself as an erotica book, but failing in every possible way in that aspect? Check. Bland, boring, grating prose? Check. Laughable dreary Mary-Sue of a main character? Check. Raping a major religion because author lacked any creativity? Check! I could go on, but you get the point.This book is bad Alternate Universe Biblical fanfic. I thought, in the beginning it might get better, but it actually got more boring, more repetitive and just downright annoying for me to give it any of my attention any longer. I think I need to read some Nabokov to cleanse my brain."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book was lauded by the critics. There is some truth to the good reviews. Ms. Carey has an amazing talent for prose that reads more beautiful than poetry. Her fantasy world is intriguing and the characters are fairly well-developed. So why do I only give it 3 stars? Honestly, I was deeply disturbed by the sado-masochistic sex. Normally, I am not squeamish. I read horror and dark fantasy frequently, and considered myself fairly hardened towards graphic, violent sex. Not so. The sex scenes in this book got increasingly disturbing to me, so that I was skipping the sex entirely (which led me to miss major parts of the plot). Maybe I wouldn't have been as bothered if the BDSM scenes were limited-- but Phedre is a courtesan and therefore the whips, chains, razors, etc. are pretty much every page. Also, as much as I liked Phedre, I found it hard to respect her because she craves all of this pain-- she is a slave to her desire for it. I read one review that claimed this as a \\"feminist\\" novel, but I don't think a woman who longs for pain in sex is a good feminist role model. Most women don't have these intense yearnings, and it's not good for men to think that they do it. So this is just a warning to stand beside all of the praise for this book: it is CERTAINLY not for everyone. I see that there is a sequel now; I wouldn't read it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I am an avid reader, most especially of fantasy, and I've slogged through quite a lot of it. So when I say I didn't reach the end of this book it's no mean feat for me.I should have known to beware of a book described as \\"sensual\\" and \\"erotic\\". Other reviewers may have appreciated the sex scenes, but to me they appear more as a shock element, and most of the details are NOT indispensable to the series. Likewise, the so-called attraction between Melisand and Ph&egrave;dre seems to exist for the sole purpose of being shocking. Ph&egrave;dre comes across as a wet pillock whose sole goal is hopping into bed with as many people as possible. Kushiel's dart was a tricky premise from the start, but the author went over the top here.Aside from the sex, most of the \\"skewed\\" Renaissance world went over my head. For one thing, it seems like only the French have achieved civilization (and what civilization: every character in the book keeps saying how unforgettable it is, how beautiful everything is, until I grew sick of it). As a Frenchwoman, I rather hope amorous games are not the only things we are remembered for (I shouldn't complain, since the Brits got the worst of the trade, being depicted as savages). And the rest of the world seems to be stuck in the Dark Ages (while \\"France\\" has attained Renaissance level: how likely is that?). It's as if Ms. Carey stuck together everything she could take from history, and did a very bad job of it.For another thing, was it really necessary to compare Delaunay to Antinous? The moment this was said, any suspense as to the relationship between Delaunay and the dead prince vanished (yes, there are some cultured people out there, and they're rolling their eyes at the massacre). I'm not going to spoil things here, but Antinous was a real, historical figure from Roman times known for one thing only...I stopped midway through, and believe me, I don't regret it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I'm sorry, but I just don't understand all the praise. I read constantly. I can usually complete a book within three to four days regardless of the size, and I've been known to go on all night read-a-thons (to my husbands aggrivation). Yet, I could not continue to force myself to finish this book even after an entire week of trying to get through the dull, unorignial pages. Out of 925 pages I only made it to 112. I even tried scanning ahead (looking for some sort of action or interest). Needless to say, I found none."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Well, several problems. The first has to do with the length. Look, I read fantasy all the time, it is almost all I read any more. I am used to three-volume novels which are sometimes overwritten because heaven forbid that you wind up with a two-volume series. Even the first volume of this book was badly overwritten. I know the author is aiming to have a complex political aspect in her series, but I don't think the plot was complicated enough to go into such an awful awful enormous amount of detail. I mean, the way some people go on and on, just to have a lot to say and look important... anyway, hopefully my point is made.Second, this erotic series was not terribly erotic. Sorry. It's not that I'm turned off by writings on masochism. As long as I'm sold on an idea, I can accept pretty much anything. But I wasn't. Anyway, either you accept the main character as a beautiful, erotic, exotic, sensual character or you don't, and I didn't. However, I got told about eighty-five hundred times in every book how exotic, sensual, and irresistable she was, and if you don't believe me, just ask the main character, since the whole thing is written in first person.I had a problem with the love story. It is very evident by the way Pherdre describes herself and her relationships that she could have been very happy with almost any of the men in the book. She just happened to be a masochist who ends up with a masochist, and the two spend the almost the entire three thousand pages making each other unhappy. Call me a hopeless romantic, but I like reading about deathless love in these fantasy novels. I was a little creeped out that the two lovers seemed to end up together simply because he was always around. That's a little to real for me. I like fantasy.Last, I had a problem with the religious aspects in the book. I am not a staunch Christian, and I can accept newly-created religions that support a book plot, but frankly Ms. Carey's rewriting Christianity to be offensive, and I would strongly suggest any Christian readers to avoid this book. I know a nice Christian woman who is a fellow fantasy lover, but she couldn't make it through Anne Bishop's Jewel series, and I would never dream of recommending this book to her, or to anyone of even passing faith.I have never ranted on about a series for this length of time. However, I was mad because the book is well-written enough that I felt I had to wade through to the end, without ever feeling fully engaged by it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I just love this series! It's beautifully written, imaginatively conceived and also just great fun! It also is one of the rare type that gets better as it goes along. It's hard to categorize for me--I usually read UF, and this has somewhat more of a romance angle. but there's so much more to it than that, that I still think a UF genre classification would make more sense. Anyway, readers of romance or fantasy should be very happy with the whole series!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I really liked this book. At times it was a bit slow but overall it was very good. It was easy to put yourself in Phedre's shoes and relate to her relationship with Joscelin. I would recommend this to anyone, especially if you love romance, action, and drama."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is a well written series, with Kushiel's Dart being the first book. This book sets the stage for an intricately connected, beautiful world, with very intriguing characters that will keep you on the edge of you sofa! Jacqueline Cary did an amazing job! It is one of my all time favorite books, with its only rival being other books in this series!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I loved it. This book was easily the most erotic I have ever read, uncomfortably so. I actually put it down twice but picked it up again both times, and once I surrendered to the content, I couldn't put it down. Surrender is the constant theme through the trilogy -- that which surrenders is not always weak. I am glad that my mind has been broadened and I recommend this book to all who are intrigued by the theme and are not generally turned off by reading explicit sexual encounters."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I passed this book up for at least a year in the bookstore, but always kept coming back. Boy am I glad I finally bought it. The story and writing have made this one of the best books that I have read. I have re-read it 3 or 4 times since and am always satisfied. Although I continued on with the series, this is the best book of the bunch and can stand on its own any day of the week."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"It may take a little while to get used to the idea of an alternate European world, but Jacqueline Carey pulls it off like magic. You are drawn into Phedre's life within the first few chapters (as would be anyone with a remote interest in sex), yet to say the novel is the story of a courtesan or prostitute would be folly. Carey makes the sexual encounters in this book more than sensual encounters, and you realize there is so much more to lovemaking than the raw passion we normally experience. Or at least there is for D'Angelines.Political intrigue runs rampant through this romantic fantasy set in a historical world that almost mirrors our own. Her writing is on par with that of Goodkind and McCaffrey and her imagery in character description is phenomenal. I cannot recommend this book enough; though I can strongly tell you that if you do not start off with this first in Carey's Kushiel's Saga, you will not comprehend intricacies of the other volumes."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Did I mention that I love the Kushiel series? Everything about this series of books is well-done--characters, dialog, the world, the alternate reality/history. It's very unique. I think that most people who don't like this series have trouble with the idea of a masochist as a protagonist. Yep, that's dark and twisted. I think it's treated very tastefully in this series though. I think the other thing folks might have problems with is that these books are very sexy. I wouldn't recommend this series to just anyone, but to those who are OK with the two caveats I just mentioned, you'll love this series. It's one of the best fantasy series I've ever read."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I started with the 4th one on accident. I loved it so much that I started again with the 1st one. This book was a page turner, it went everywhere with me. Phedre is an unforgettable character that will stay with me forever. I completely fell in love woth Joselin. 'He has replaced my first and only character love Haplo\\" With deep undertones of religion and heavy with politics, there is not much magic. Heroic tales almost out of history, and sex scenes to get the brain thinking;) I absolutely love the way Jaqueline Carey writes. She is very talented, she gets right to the point. These books will always stay in my \\"private collection\\" Its the kind that you want to read slower to make them last longer, and faster to find out what happens. All in all, a fantastic read!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"As a life long voracious reader I can say with authority that you don't come across a writer of Ms. Carey's caliber very often. Her writing is as rich, ornate, and evocative as the Renaissance itself. The world she creates is fascinating and the characters unforgettable. She is truly a gifted storyteller in the truest sense. Even more impressive is her virtuoso use of the English language. Her writing is as beautiful as Shakespeares and her tales every bit as layered and involved with intrigue, suspense, and larger than life characters.So many characters it is difficult to keep track of them but I became so attached that I wept with the first loss of Guy and more with each loss after. I'm glad she gave us a cast of characters at the beginning, I referred to it frequently. It thrills me to know that I have five more books after this one to enjoy the life of Phedre no' Delaunay. I mean to savor them like the rare jewels they are."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Just finished this and as there are many other reviewers I won't go over old ground. Just to note that this is a profoundly well crafted story with interesting and richly painted characters. This is a BIG story, which covers alot of ground as you would expect of an epic. If you like \\"world building\\" stories, like those of Frank Herbert (the ORIGINAL Dune works, not the more recent ones), Larry Niven, Nicola Griffith (Ammonite, great book), Tolkien or even Michael Moorcock, you should read this. Carey has built a very interesting world, borrowing somewhat from European and Judeo-Christian history and myth. Just enough for the reader to have a sense of vague, curious familiarity but not too much. To enjoy this book note that you have to be willing to suspend Western (esp American) values regarding sexuality and male primacy. It's not too much to ask though, and in return Carey will reward you with a deeply, thoroughly enjoyable story of love, intrigue, war and redemption.Cheers,Eric"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The setting isn't anything new: it's almost, but not quite, medieval Europe, and that's been done, and done well (Think Guy Gavriel Kay.) The plot isn't anything new, either: political intrigue, beautiful women, plots to topple thrones, a nation on the brink of war, unlikely heros and impossible quests.What IS new is the focus. Phedre no Delaunay is a child abandoned by her parents, sold into identured servitude at the age of four to one of the houses of the Night Court, an influential network of high-priced and highly trained courtesans. She is trained well, but she cannot fit in because she is marked with a scalet spot in her left eye -- the mark of the Devil, some say. But her luck changes when a nobleman who deals in information recognizes the spot as a sign of the god Kushiel, and buys her marque, taking her into his household and teaching her to listen, observe, and connect. Her special gift, she soons learns, is also her special curse, for Kushiel's dart marks her forever as one who will experience pain and pleasure together.From here, I cannot reveal the plot, but suffice it to say that Phedre is now a courtesan who listens, and who thinks, making her a dangerous political weapon. Her adventures are always interesting, and once you get past the first third or so of the book, it's impossible to put down. Reading toward the end is like running a race: you pull faster and faster, desperate to get there, but equally desperate that it not end. Trust me, it's that good.Carey deftly mixes sex and politics in a way it's not quite been done before, especially with regards to Phedre's particular sexual preferences, and her writing is lovely. She picks up Judeo-Christian mythology, but elaborates upon it for the divine underpinnings of the story, and what she comes up with is quite fantastic: among other things, a fallen angel from the line of \\"Yeshua ben Yosef\\" who wandered the countryside bidding his followers to \\"love as thou wilt.\\"Buy this one in hardback; you're going to read it more than once. It leaves you with a flavor at once harsh and lush, of ripe fruit, steel, and salt...or tears."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Jacqueline Carey manages to create a new and refreshing work in the sci-fi/fantasy realm. Taking world history and showing reader's a different path from the point of Christ's crucifixion onward. With that concept, she has created a world that is both familiar and new to us and a culture that is as exotic as it is erotic.Carey manages to create a heroine that is intelligent and sexy. Her characterization is well developed and her plot line is engaging and draws the reader into the political intrigues. At times, your head swims with the politics and people of the novel, but that's not a criticism. I took this novel to be an interpretation of the Renaissance/Elizabethan era, and the politics for the era are dead on.The action in this novel, once it starts, is almost non-stop.One criticism I have against the novel is if this is a society and culture that espouses the concepts of free-love (love as thou wilt), where men and women are not judged for being sexually involved with another person of the same sex, then why are there no same-sex marriages? Why are men still viewed as the dominant sex. Why are Cassilines only men and women are subservient, yet Namaah is held with such reverence and prostitution is seen as holy because of Elua (a child of Mother Earth, Christ and Mary Magdalene) and Namaah (Elua's provider through prostitution). Despite its sexual liberty, this culture is very heterocentric and still focuses on the concepts primogeniture and male dominance, which don't make coincide with the establishment of the culture and history of the novel.Another small issue is the repetitive voicing of the future. Phedre often remarks about \\"not knowing then what she knows now\\" which I found distracting to the current action. Another repetitive description the author uses is the term \\"beautiful.\\" The characters all seemed to look the same...\\"beautiful.\\" I wanted more than that. I felt like Carey drew these characters from a magazine, and Carey used the term so much that it became shallow instead of rare and precious or well-founded. What makes a person beautiful? What makes a person ugly? We don't really find out.Nevertheless, this novel is amazing and excellent in its style. it takes only a few pages to grasp the author's vivid use of language that captivates and entralls the reader. I highly recommend it...it is full of depth and intrigue, and despite a highly sexual theme that is ongoing, this novel is successful in not becoming pornographic, but remains tasteful and important to the story."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"For a first novel, Carey gives us a very, very good epic fantasy that build on the tradition recently set by Martin, Jordan and Goodkind but adds her original (and decidedly kinky) twist.I have a fondess for writers who not only develop a complicated world populated by well-developed characters but who also pay attention to the minutia of politics and political motivation. Carey, while not in the same league as George R.R. Martin (yet), does a wonderful job of creating the above and tells a highly entertaining story concerning the transition of monarchs in a world clearly based on middle-ages Europe with much of the action taking place in what would be France.So what makes this so different, you ask. Carey's main character is not only a spy, but a female spy. Not only is she a female spy, but she's also a courtesan in a time when this is an honored profession. Finally, not only is the main character a female spy and courtesan, she also may be the only sexual masochist in the country. Now that's what I call a bit of a twist. There is plenty of explicit sexual material throughout this book. Although all of it is very tastefully written, there is a lot of it and quite a bit of descriptive BD/SM stuff too. If you have problems with this, are a younger reader or the parent of a younger reader, you may wish to take a pass on this one.So why only 4 stars for this book? Carey does a great job of story telling with little or no magic involved (pretty rare for epic fantasy) for the first 3/4 of the book. Inexplicably (and somewhat ham-handedly), she throws in a couple of events that are wholly magical in nature and the novel dives into a cliche for a bit. For this, it loses a star.I heartily recommend this book for the mature reader."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Words cannot describe how truly wonderful this book really was. I have read many books, close to 1,500 if I've kept my tally correct, and not a one, in a long time has affected me quite like Kushiel's Dart did.Every page turned I closed my eyes in anticipation for what was to come, I wept and laughed and got angry with the characters, my two most favorite being Phedre and Joscelin.Being a writer myself, I go through tough times of writer's block or just plain feelings of failure. After reading Kushiel's Dart, the debut high fantasy novel written by a woman, I could only find myself spurred onward to succeed. Superb writing, excellent characters, unbelievable plot.The beginning had me reading with anticipation, the end left me in tears. Thankfully the sequel is my next conquest, but I fear I will go crazy waiting for the finale.If 100 stars could be given, this novel would get them."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Very Good. I was quite shocked, at first. A young girl with a bit of red pigment in her eye enjoying flagellation? And commonly accepting money for it? It was completely out of place with most of what I've read. But Phedre's story was enrapturing. These bizarre attitudes only augmented my fascination with her character. The Political jargon caught my head in a whirl. Sometimes I found the thought process lacking, and sometimes the dialog seemed shallow, but more often than not I could feel, see, and react to a changing character struggling toward a goal and achieving heroic stations through her own credit.The alternate religion and development of Europe really makes the reader attentive to the details. Words spelled slightly different, customs altered minutley, and language hints created a parrallel but diverse world. Phedre is caught unawares, blessed and burdened with education, she tests her devotions, her loyalties, and her heart on an explosive adventure. And the shocks along the way will only make your heart beat faster."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Normally, fantasy novels aren't necessarily my cup of tea. I like a dose of reality in my books. But &quot;Kushiel's Dart&quot; just barely fits into the category 'fantasy.' It could be more accurately descirbed as reimagined history! There are elements in this story borrowed from everything from ancient Rome to the Bible! Carey weaves an extremely realistic world, Terre d'Ange, with beautiful, passionate characters to go along with it.Phedre no Delaunay, our heroine and narrator throughout the tale, is born into bondage the likes of which will make more conservative readers blush. And when she is bought by her master Anafiel Delaunay at the tender age of ten, her training in the delicate arts of love and espionage begin. Delaunay works to make her his eyes and ears in a world full of scandal, and when Phedre discovers a plot to destroy her world as she knows it, all her skills are put to the test as she becomes the sole person with enough knowledge at her fingertips to save a nation.This steamy tale of love, magic, and betrayal, first in a series of three, will have you hooked in no time, and the cliffhanger ending will leave you begging for more!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I began this novel hesitantly, uncertain what to expect. I was wholly surprised -- and thrilled -- by this unique re-imagining and re-creating of &quot;real&quot; history and the fantasy genre. Probably not for everyone, but if you've an open mind and are willing to invest in a vivid heroine, there's a chance you'll be pleasantly shocked at your own eagerness to delve into the darker passions and mysteries life has to offer -- at least vicariously!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"&quot;Kushiel's Dart&quot; is exotically sublime, breathtaking in its beauty and scope.

If you love reading and loved Fifty Shades then try Kushiel's Dart on for size - i'll bet you won't be dissapointed!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Kushiel's Dart is the debut novel of Jacqueline Carey, and the first book of the Kushiel's Legacy series.Ph&egrave;dre has been raised in the Night Court since being sold to them as a small child. She is marked with a small red mote in her eye - an imperfection that seems to render her too imperfect to be a Servant of Naamah until the wily noble Anafiel Delauney adopts her because he has recognised her for what she is - a god-touched anguisette, destined to take true pleasure in pain. Under his tutelage, she learns the art of spying and political intrigue as well as the arts of the bedchamber, and realises too late what a deadly game she's playing. I won't go into much more detail for fear of spoilers, but schemes and plots abound, and Ph&egrave;dre gets to see a lot of the world.Most fantasy books are set in imaginary worlds, but Kushiel's Dart is set in an alternative history Europe what seems to be the Renaissance era. Elua, the son of Jesus's blood and Mary Magdalene's tears, settled in Terre D'Ange (present-day France) with his angel Companions. This changed the course of history in Europe, and although we see some familiarity in the naming of countries, most of it is pretty unfamiliar. The world of Kushiel's Dart is touched by gods and angels, and there is subtle magic related to their gods in every culture.This book is not for the prudish - the country of Terre D'Ange has only one religious commandment: Love as thou wilt. All forms of loving are sacred, and the Night Court is the most honoured of all. Marriage happens, but people are expected to follow their own desires, regardless of gender, number or manner. Our protagonist Ph&egrave;dre is a courtesan that specialises in receiving pain, and Carey explores every facet of this in full detail. Ordinarily, I don't really care for sex in books, but it is so unabashed and straightforward and well-written that I actually enjoyed it.Overall, I really enjoyed this book - the plot, the characters and the world. Every character was complex, every relationship layered, every motivation deeper than suspected. Ph&egrave;dre was the tinest bit annoying towards the end, but the ending was pretty terrific, and I couldn't wait to read Kushiel's Chosen."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I went in expecting a bondage romance novel, I ended up with a highly addictive plot. If court intrigue is your thing don't hesitate to pick up this book."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"An excellent read, be prepared for all 9 books in this series though once you start you wont stop! Kindle version does have some *typos* but nothing to bad."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting when I started reading Kushiel's Dart. I definitely wasn't prepared for the intensity or the burning desire to keep reading.Let me start by saying I read this on the kindle and so had no real idea of how long it was. But the book just kept on going and going, and I never wanted to put it down. The characters draw you in, flaws and all, whether you like them or not. The machinations of the characters are only surpassed by those of the author, who dots the beginning with gems of information which come relevant at the end, just like the glittering world of the characters who gather scraps of information for a web of politics and intrigue which only at the end seem to straighten themselves out. And of course I didn't realize it was a series until the very end where I was left with another breathtaking cliff-hanger.The plot goes a little like this: Abandoned child raised to be a courtesan is taken into the household of a kind and Machiavellian poet-scholar and trained to be a tool in his political arsenal. And she's a masochist. The tale starts in a city and spreads to encompass foreign lands and a little bit of strange magic. It's not always a comfortable story, but it's one of those epic tales which spans genres and reader bases.The only thing I didn't like was how self-referential the narrator is about her own story. \\"If I had known then what I know now,\\" \\"I had no idea how important this piece of information would later be,\\" \\"I ignored this other thing with the naivet&eacute; of a child\\" and similar phrases litter the first half of a book like road bumps in a residential area. The author might have been trying to direct the reader to pay attention to side plot so it would not have to be regurgitated at a later time, but I found it clunky.Some novels are like cinnamon rolls, fluffy tarts, or little bon bons of brief enjoyment and entertainment. This story is a rich stew which will sit in your stomach and stay with you for a while after you put it down."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I rarely give up on books. I made it through 652 pages before I finally called it quits. Something about the universe just didn't gel with me, I just couldn't care about the intrigue between houses or any of the characters who were still alive at that point. Maybe I shouldn't have read it so soon after Game of Thrones, who knows? But it's not for me."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"From the very first pages I was completely drawn into the world that Ms. Carey creates in Kushiel's Dart. Yes, some might say it gets off to a slow start, but the writing is so beautiful and the mythology and sense of place she creates are so wonderful that I barely noticed. This book was a real page-turner for me -- I just had to know what happens next! I could see why some people might be a little turned off by the BDSM elements in this book, but they weren't there for titillation but as an integral part of the lead character's personality. I'd give it six stars if I could."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"A little too long generally, the beginning is too dense especially with regard to the world building in the beginning. But after the beginning and aside from the length, I loved this book. It is beautifully written, the main character is inspiring, the side characters are fun to read about, the romance is very sweet, the world created is enormous and creative. I love how the author pushes beyond what is comfortable for many people in terms of relationships and sexuality. Unlike other reviews I have read, I disagree that this involves children employed in sex labor or child abuse. I understand where their percetpion comes from and respect it, I just disagree."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"At first, I thought I'd never be able to get into Kushiel's Dart. There were far too many characters, strange geographical names and areas, and exotic social castes to follow. But I immediately fell in love with the heroine, Phedre, and eventually was grateful I stuck with this book.Once I started to become familiar with the intriguing new world Carey had created, I was consumed by it. Phedre, along with the massive cast of secondary characters, is vividly portrayed, pouring from the intoxicating words like a real-life person. I laughed, cried and suffered with her through all the events in her life, whether they were great or small.The plot is full of political intrigue, at once both intimate and grand, sweeping across countries and seas and leading to a deadly war in which Phedre finds herself caught in the thick of it. Carey portrays it all with a lyrical, mesmerizing voice. Even violent, savage acts are written with beautiful luxuriance, making the heart ache fiercely.Throughout this sweeping saga, Phedre deals with many hardships, dedicating and sacrificing herself all in the name of her love for her Gods and her country. And this, I think, is the greatest part of the book. Phedre is a strong, brave heroine whose tenacity astounds me at its greatest heights. I can't wait to read the rest of the series and see what adventures Phedre will encounter next."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I have to say I had really low expectations going into this book. I bought it to read to my wife, who has a vision disability, but loves the fantasy genre, and there is very little serious romantic fantasy out there, even less available on audiotape. I reluctantly chose this one, figuring I'd suffer through it for her entertainment. From the premise of the book, described on the back cover, I expected it to be a practically endless sequence of raunchy sadomasochistic sexual encounters weakly tied together by a paper-thin plot. Can you blame me? Here's what it says of the main character: \\"chosen [by some divine power] to forever experience pleasure and pain as one.... trained equally in the courtly arts and the talents of the bed-chamber...\\" How could that possibly have prepared me for the depth and skill of storytelling I was in for by reading this book?We hear the story as told by Ph&egrave;dre, who bears the mark of \\"Kushiel's Dart,\\" as the scarlet mote in her eye is referred to. This first volume in the trilogy starts with her humble beginnings as the \\"unwanted get\\" of a woman of little social consequence, her indenture into the Court of Night-Blooming Flowers, and her rise into the highest social circles of the city. That's merely the first act. The trilogy is set in an alternate history of Europe, where the principal difference seems to be that in this novel, the French may actually be justified in their claim to divinity. The story's main location is geographically analogous to our world's France, but in Ph&egrave;dre's world, it is called Terre D'Ange (Land of Angels), because the inhabitants (D'Angelines) are descended from divine beings who left the holy land over a thousand years previously. The religion is explained early on in the story, and is close to, but not quite, real-world Christianity. The story takes place some time in the late middle ages or the early Renaissance. Carey uses real-world societies from various time periods to model her world upon. The names of the nations are changed to older, variations on, or more obscure references to those regions they describe. Spain is Aragonia, for example, England is Alba, and so on.The stage thus set, Carey proceeds to weave an intricate story of politics, love, betrayal, and adventure. One of the strongest points to recommend this story is the cast of characters. The many political figures who take a role in the story are all well-developed characters, each illustrated in great detail in the story, each with their own multifaceted personalities, desires, merits, flaws, and distinctive habits. There are erotic episodes, as the summary implies, but they are woven into the story so seamlessly, and in fact essential to the plot, so that to dismiss this book as merely common erotica is selling it far too short. To begin with the concept of a main character whose uniqueness is based in the erotic, and to build such a full and complicated story, Carey shows a skill with the written word rarely seen in fantasy today, and in fact in most genres of literature.No work of fiction is perfect. This book was not without its flaws or idiosyncrasies. Many of the reviews here complain about the overly flowery speech, indicating that the telling detracts from the tale. It depends a bit on personal taste, but I didn't think that the narration style was too far over the top, and it was entirely consistent. What did become tiresome in this first volume is that the \\"voice\\" of the narration is as if these events happened long ago in Ph&egrave;dre's life, and she is telling this as if looking back through the years. The consequence of this motif is that the first 400 pages are rife with this one clich&eacute; that began to get frustratingly repetitive. She is constantly saying something to the effect of, \\"...if only I had known then what I know now...\\" It did lend a foreshadowing of tragedy to the telling, but was used much too often. Fortunately she lays off that clich&eacute; about halfway through the book, and while it does rear its head occasionally after that, it is nowhere near as pervasive.So much happens in this one book that it would use more words than I'm allotted to describe all the various plots, subplots, and cliffhangers and give my opinion of each. We are treated to vibrant descriptions of many of the locales of Ph&egrave;dre's world, traveling through D'Angeline cities, barbarian villages, rough wilderness, high seas, and palace halls. Ph&egrave;dre finds and loses friends along the way and each one she comes to know, we know through her. Her enemies, as well, we come to know, and find that they are not the typical cardboard cutout villains that one typically finds in tales of love and magic. These villains have motivations that one could even sympathize with under the right conditions, and this use of moral shades of gray heightens the complexity of the work as a whole. The 900 pages pass in the blink of an eye, and I couldn't tell you the number of times I finished reading a chapter aloud, and my wife and I looked at each other and could say nothing more than \\"Wow.\\"One of the writer blurbs on one volume of this series says that the trilogy has \\"something for everyone,\\" and I think that's the best description I've heard yet. Complicated political plots within plots, a multilayered back story that could support a novel or two of its own, fantastic swordfights, massive army battles, erotic sex scenes, fascinating personal relationships... I could go on. I consider this book one of the nicest surprises I've had in a while, in that it was a totally unexpected enjoyment. After reading the entire trilogy aloud to my wife, we look forward to anything else Jacqueline Carey publishes in the future."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is a first-time novel by Jacqueline Carey, and honestly---it's books like this that restore my faith in the publishing industry. =P I have read novels by long-time writers which were nowhere near as richly detailed, powerfully written, or just plain interesting. Now I know that publishers aren't just looking for the next Robert Jordan or Mercedes Lackey. They *do* actually care about quality.Anyway, enough babbling. The story is set in a kind of alternate Europe, primarily in a pseudo-France called Terre d'Ange. In this world, Judeo-Christianity never got much of a foothold, because in this world God had a red-headed stepchild, so to speak. Basically, everything's the same as in our world until the crucifixion of Christ. At that point, Mary Magdalene wept at the cross's feet, and her tears mingled with the blood and produced a kind of angel/god creature called Elua. Some considered Elua an abomination or a mistake, but thirteen angels decided to follow him, reckoning that he was a child of God whether God chose to acknowledge him or not (and God didn't). Also following Elua was a woman named Naamah, a whore who decided to protect and care for this innocent creature by selling herself for his needs---to buy food, to bargain for his life, etc. Elua wandered for a long time and eventually found the land of Terre d'Ange, where the people welcomed him, and he and his angels settled down there.In the present time of the novel, the people of Terre d'Ange are known throughout the world for their beauty and grace, since they're all the descendants of angels. And because of Naamah's sacrifices, a sort of \\"blessed whore\\" tradition has perpetuated itself into the Court of Night-Blooming Flowers---thirteen whorehouse-temples whose male and female prostitutes are all sworn to the service of Naamah (who has the status of the Virgin Mary in this land) in various ways. Some houses specialize in delicate beauties who blush and faint; others specialize in clownish types who make their patrons laugh; still others specialize in darker arts.Into this mix is born Phedre, a child who's rejected from the house she's born into (the delicate-fainter house) primarily because she has a \\"flaw\\"---a tiny blood-spot in one eye. In Terre d'Ange, this is called \\"Kushiel's Dart,\\" and it's the marker of one chosen by the cruelest of Elua's angels, Kushiel, who administered punishments to sinners in Purgatory. It also marks Phedre as an \\"anguissette\\"---a masochist.Phedre is sold to a man deeply involved in the politics of Terre d'Ange. He understands her potential immediately, so he tutors her in languages, histories, all sorts of things, while she grows up and eagerly awaits her debut to the service of Naamah. Once she starts her work---making assignations with the wealthy and powerful of Terre d'Ange society (who seem to consist of an awful lot of sadists) and spying on them---she becomes embroiled in the politics of the land. These politics lead her into an extremely complex and shocking series of events, taking her into alternate versions of the Nordic lands, Scotland and Ireland, gypsy country, and beyond. Ultimately she is the only person who can save Terre d'Ange from a terrible invasion---and she goes about it in her own unique style.What I love about this book is its protagonist. Phedre is witty, sensual, cultured, and haughty, and although she enjoys being bound and tortured during sex, she's by no means a subservient character. Indeed, that's a theme of the novel, repeated several times--- \\"That which yields is not necessarily weak.\\" She may play the servant at need, but she's always looking out for her own interests, and those of the people she loves. She can be downright ruthless, frankly, and she manages to bring about the downfall of a number of powerful people.I also love the sensuality of this book. This is a world where all of the whores have spent years studying the erotic arts before they ever lose their virginity; they even have a textbook. And Phedre knows every technique in it. Phedre's assignations are sometimes described in tactful but powerful detail---not crude or pornographic, but clear enough that the reader sees both how much pleasure she gets from the act, and how she wraps her patrons around her little finger in the process. It's not always pleasant, and those who are repelled by sado-masochism or bondage might find some scenes disturbing. There are also some scenes when Phedre is forced into unwilling slavery to a Nordic lord, and is raped (although because of what she is, she enjoys even this---and hates herself for it). But overall there are more than enough good scenes to make up for the not-so-good. Including several homosexual encounters, as a warning to those with more limited tastes. Phedre has no preferences, and her greatest lover/adversary happens to be a woman. (That's another thing I like---there are very few weak women in this novel.)The only thing I could possibly call a flaw is the absolute complexity of this novel. And I'll qualify that by saying it's not really a flaw; I just prefer not to have to *study* when I read a novel for fun. There are dozens of characters in the book, all from different houses of nobility and different bloodlines of angels and different duchies and so forth, and even quite a few from different countries. And all of them are interwoven in a tapestry of intrigue so deep I almost got lost in it. We discover the threads of this tapestry as Phedre does, and we understand the whole of it only when Phedre comprehends, so for at least half the novel all these characters and all these events are a confusing jumble. Several times I was forced to look at the glossary of characters, thoughtfully placed at the front of the book rather than the back---it's a necessity. However... when the tapestry begins to come together, it does so masterfully, and I realized at that point that all of the layers of detail were absolutely necessary. This is a completely realistic conspiracy, and by the end it's completely realistic that a masochist-spy-prostitute would be the one to foil it.A definite recommend. =)"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Others have written about the plot, so I'll concentrate on who would probably like this book best, and who should probably avoid it.Fantasy readers who like magic-focused stories---there's not enough magic here, except in the symbolic and vaguely mystical sense, to interest you. This world's magic is all psychological. Anyone looking for standard fantasy or sci-fi---avoid this book. There's nothing standard about it. The story is set in an alternate version of Europe, but this is just a trick to allow the reader to more easily comprehend the cultural and political complexity that Carey has written into this novel. Once the reader figures out that the Skaldi, for example, are basically Scandinavian/Vikings with all the attendant cultural tropes, that saves the necessity for tedious culture-building and lets the author get to the real meat of the story---the characters. Speaking of which, people who like a world-focused story should also avoid this. This story is not about the decadent country of Terre D'Ange and its people and troubles. The story is about a very complex woman who lives in this world, loves it, suffers for it, and ultimately triumphs. A key theme of the novel is, &quot;That which yields is not always weak.&quot;And---it must be said---people who have even the slightest unease about reinterpretations of the Christian faith, or people who are even slightly squidged by alternative sexuality of any kind---this is not the book for you. You'll find yourself wondering why the author is spending so much time on the sex, or why she's chosen to reinterpret Christianity in this fashion, and frankly---if you have to ask, you shouldn't be reading this book. Might as well ask why Frank Herbert chose to reinterpret Islam, Catholicism, and gender politics in &quot;Dune&quot;. Speculative fiction doesn't always speculate only about science or history or the macabre; sometimes it speculates about human society, and I've personally found this to be the best speculative fiction of all.As for who *should* read this book... Well, the opposite of the above, for starters: fans of religion in fantasy/sci-fi (particularly alternative religions), fans of alternative sexualities, fans of mysticism, fans of avant-garde fantasy. To add to that, fans of star-crossed traditional romance will find something juicy here, too, in the danger-filled relationship of the seductive Phedre and the celibate warrior-monk Joscelin. Fans of excellent writing should definitely read this, just to be treateed to some of the most artful and elegant prose I've read in a long time. Fans of strong female characters--- the strength of this character is far more subtle than what you'll see in most books, but undeniable nevertheless. Fans of mystery and intrigue, a definite recommend, although I found this to be the one weakness of the book. The intrigue is sometimes *too* dense (for this reader to comprehend, at least), and its revelations were sometimes too subtle for me to interpret. I think sometimes Carey forgets that not all readers are trained to this, like Phedre!Not everyone will or can love this book, and if you don't love it you'll probably hate it, with no middle ground. The styles are too unusual and the themes too strong for the least common denominator of fandom. But for those who can appreciate it... this is a real gem."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Kushiel's Dart is a fun, different, sensual historical fantasy/romance. I didn't find it really &quot;big&quot;, though, not epic or mythic the way George RR Martin's or Frank Herbert's books are. It's really a personal adventure, the story of a woman with extraordinary gifts and problems who manages to find a place in her world and save her country as well as herself along the way.This book reminded me at times of Guy Gavriel Kay's A SONG FOR ARBONNE -- but with a lot more sex and S&amp;M, and with a heroine who is definitely one of a kind. Fantasy/romance readers who don't mind explicit sexuality, say fans of Storm Constantine or Laurell K. Hamilton, should love it.Phedre, our heroine, is born an &quot;unwanted whore's get&quot; in a nation sort of like medieval France, and raised in a society of courtesans. She has the curse (gift?) that she enjoys being made to suffer, and enjoys pain. Naturally, she's trained to serve as a prostitute for men and women with sadistic tastes. But she soon becomes more than that. From prostitute she becomes a court intriguer, from court intriguer she becomes captive and spy in barbarian lands, from captive and spy she becomes a wartime ambassador, and by the end she's become a noblewoman in her own right, come to terms with her taste for suffering, and found True Love. Oh, and she saves the kingdom from treachery and invasion, too.Phedre is what makes the book worthwhile -- watching her grow into herself, celebrating her victories, rooting for her when she's in evil hands (which is often). Phedre is almost never safe, but she's always growing, so to speak, always becoming stronger, and the challenges she faces keep changing. She certainly earns her victories. She's both the most distinctive and the most real fantasy heroine I've read in a long time. Other fantasy heroines are too often generic &quot;compassionate women&quot; or &quot;warrior women&quot; or (still worse) &quot;universally perfect women&quot;, but Phedre is both unique and completely believable.The writing in the book is very good. The setting and the other characters are fine, they seem quite real, but the interest of the story is always Phedre. That's my one complaint. Unlike Zelazny's Amber books or Herbert's Dune, I can't say the _world_ of this book fascinated me. I don't find myself yearning to know more about most of the places the author describes. I can't say I cared too much about what happened to the people who weren't in Phedre's personal struggle. For me this book was all about the heroine, and the world and the plot were just stages (if well-written stages) through which she moved. So whether you love or like or hate this book probably depends on what you read fantasy for: the world and the story, or the hero(ine) who leads you through it? I fell in between on this one.If you're a &quot;world&quot; person or a &quot;plot&quot; person, you might be happier elsewhere. But if you read for the sake of a main character you hope to fall in love with and suffer and triumph with, and if you don't mind a book with a lot of sexual content, Kushiel's Dart should delight you."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Jacqueline Carey has written a beautiful novel that is hollow at the center. The main flaw is her central character, Phedre, who spends most of her time reacting (submitting?) to events as they happen, rather than risking more to overcome increasingly negative events. In summary, a typical scene is as follows: Phedre goes to a patron, gets tied up and flagellated, has rough sex, then collects information which is used to further the plot (such as it is). Now as this is a fairly quiet novel and primarily a character study, we need to see inner conflict, hopefully manifested as outward events that are directly influenced by the character. Other than acknowledging Phedre's inherent conflict between pleasure and pain, and realizing that both drive her, we don't really learn much else about her, nor do we care.For some readers, the BDSM angle will seem \\"new, daring, pushing the boundaries,\\" etc. and that's great -- if you're looking for literature that echoes your own inner thoughts or fantasies. It's just not enough to drive a character, though, and while I give Carey plus points for using beautiful language to describe what some readers might find disturbing, it's not enough to sustain a novel-length work.On the plus side, the pseudo-Europe is well-researched, crafted, and described in beautiful detail; for me it's one of the more memorable fantasy worlds to come into print recently. But a travelogue can hold attention for only so long, then readers need to see something more.For those of you on the bubble as to buying this book, I'd suggest borrowing it from your local library or waiting for the paperback, then deciding whether to spring for the hardcover. Interestingly, there seems to be a cadre of seven or eight Carey fans who downgrade any review of less than four stars, and uptick only the five-star ones. If nothing else, this should be a caution sign that you should consider carefully the bad reviews along with the good before you make your buying and reading decision."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Rather a good find, especially for a first novel...I picked up this novel on a sort of whim, it looked detailed and filled with shallow intrigues, the kind of thing I like for light reading. Carey takes her time in establishing the setting, and at first I wondered if I had picked up a piece of erotica masquerading as fantasy. I read with trepidation through the first 200 pages or so, noting how the author was taking her time and setting up what seemed like several plot strands, prepared to groan when she did not develop them completely. But, much to my pleasant surprise, I was disappointed in that expectation.The plot follows Phedre, an indentured slave and courtesan, through her training and into the polite society of the D'Angeline court (which claims its bloodlines from the descent of angels), where she becomes embroiled in intrigues while following her own path, that of an anguissette-- one born to the spiritual line of Kushiel, her patron god, and one destined to find pleasure in pain. This is the first part of the novel, and I would definitely point out that a large portion of it is set in a boudoir, or &quot;pleasure chamber&quot;-- not to the point of being tasteless, but I was at times speculative as to whether or not there was some larger plot at work at all.But then, somewhat abruptly, there was, and that is where the novel proved interesting, when those intrigues Phedre had been somewhat unwittingly involved in become larger concerns and she is forced to survive and engage herself in a much larger game.Though the novel is engaging and I recommend it, I will note that one of the most annoying aspects of it is that it is told by Phedre herself, from the vantage point of a later date. Her commentary as a narrator tends to the dramatic and highly romantic-- which can be annoying, but as the reader comes to know Phedre through the story, it actually becomes rather endearing. From the comments of other characters we come to realize we are perhaps not the only ones annoyed and amused by her dramatics.Don't go into this book expecting anything radically different in terms of plot. Yes, there are interesting and unique elements here, particularly the acclaimed celestial heritage of the book's people, and interesting depictions of religion and culture.I recommend it highly to those who enjoy high fantasy, meaning fantasy including the likes of princes, priests, and courtesans. There is little overt magic in these books, which I missed, but there is ample mythology and intrigue. The structure of the book is solid, and once you get past the first 200 pages or so, it's nearly impossible to put down-- each time I got even slightly bored or thought of stopping, something dramatic or particularly twisted would happen and I would be forced to keep on reading-- forcing a couple of very late nights, which is always a good sign of a book's enjoyability.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Many reviews here present what is good about this book. And, I did like it. However, I found that there were some flaws in it that were so jarring that I haven't yet decided if I want to continue the saga. The three that prompted me to write this review are these:1) In the first third of the book, Carey overuses the technique of \\"foreshadowing\\"..... The structure of this section of the book is Phedre recounting her youth and she often says things along the lines of \\"....if I had only known that going to the Valerian House would have had such an important consequence.... \\" Use this technique once. Maybe twice.... Or even better --- not at all! But to use it over seven times in the first third of the book. I found that very amaturish and it so jarred me out of the storyline, that I started counting how many times it happened. I don't think the author needs to point and go: \\"LOOK LOOK! Look how important this is going to be!\\" Or, at least, not in such a contrived way.2) The eroticism in the book was such an interesting part of it --- again, in the first third of the book. You were right there with Phedre and her patrons, and the writing was very evocative and I liked it a lot. However, after the first third, Carey suddenly changes her technique and the sexual interludes are handled by Phedre saying something like: \\"And I am not going to go into the details of that night.\\" WHAT??? Why not? The details were cool and interesting and erotic and evocative. Granted, this is not a book of erotic literature -- but why write it one way for the first 100 pages and then change afterwards? Again, I felt this was amaturish and I felt a little manipulated....3) I, personally, didn't like the use of slightly-bastardized medieval history and places and people and things. The Picts and the Vikings and ancient Europe and Jesus and the Magdalene. The Irish mythology of Cuchulian and the Black Boar. Again, I thought it amaturish. Maybe even a bit like stealing or \\"sampling\\". The idea of the Night Court was so interesting and unique and unlike anything that I had ever read before. And, then, to plop it down into Bizarro-History-Land? Other authors have created worlds from whole cloth. Carey would have been better served to do that, in my opinion.All of these points, to me, detract from what would have been a top-notch, A-one fantasy saga. The characters in the story are interesting, and they grow and develop and change. And you understand their motivations. Argh! This could have been great! Up there with George R.R. Martin's Songs of Ice and Fire, or Rosemary Kirstein's Steerswoman Saga --- if only it had been handled with a bit more maturity.After writing this review, I am almost convinced that I won't be reading the second book of the saga. However, maybe that book has the maturity I am looking for.... because authors *do* grow and change......Hmmmmm..."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Two days ago I walked into my favorite bookstore and was greeted with shouts and a rather heavy book tossed into my hands. The owner told me that this book \\"had my name written all over it\\". So I shelled out my money and took it home.Wow! I cannot say that I ever imagined such a book as this existing. With today's society being as obsessed and disgusted with taboos as it is, the fact that a book that combines S/M, fantasy, erotica, slave literature, political intrigue, and incredible battle scenes is out there, it's just too lovely.I'd recommend this book to anyone who has a penchant for the interesting, but not for those who are light of heart. Phedre's scenes with her patrons are often more in depth than the average \\"spanking scene\\" that books incorporating S/M contain. Kushiel's Dart also maintains an impressive ability to be pansexual. No matter what sexual orientation or proclivities it's readers have, they will find something to interest them.The best part of this book, as far as I see it, is the fact that the villainess is not 100% loathsome to the protaganist. In fact, it is the love/hate/fear relationship that really sends the plot running.This is a great book, and I'm still trying to figure out how this is a first novel."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is the story of Phedre, marked as a masochist by the angel of pain and punishment, and trained from youth as a courtesan and spy. The book follows her through her childhood and then the vicissitudes of one fateful year, in which Phedre learns more about pain and love than she had ever dreamed possible. Tragedy strikes her comfortable life, and she is sold into slavery among the Skaldi (Vikings), and must use her talents and her wits to survive. The Skaldi plot to take over Phedre's home country of Terre d'Ange, and Phedre is stunned by the fact that several nobles she knows are complicit in the plot. She escapes to warn her Queen, but finds herself assigned to a dangerous mission in Alba (Britain), which will further test her skills and her emotional strength. The climax comes with a battle scene almost as adrenaline-laced as the siege of Minas Tirith, and _Kushiel's Dart_ ends with the aftermath.I don't think I understood the depth of Carey's novel until I finished it. Pleasure and pain are forever mingled in Phedre's life, but it goes far beyond the bedroom. Terre d'Ange may have won a great victory, but we are never allowed to forget those who died to make it possible. Many fantasy novels focus on the triumph of the nobility while seeming to forget the commoner blood spilled to achieve the nobles' goals. This is not one of them. War in Carey's world is always a tragedy, no matter who wins, because there are good and bad people on all sides, and because the dead are made real to us instead of just pawns on the chessboard. Love, too, is a double-edged sword. What if you found the bravest, kindest, most loyal man you could possibly desire, but could never be satisfied with him because he could not satisfy your darkest proclivities? And what if you knew you would forever long for a cruel traitor who had the blood of your family on her hands, but who was the only one who truly understood your cravings? Love and pain are never far apart. By the end of the book, we've all been pricked by Kushiel's dart.One caveat: Before you read this book, make sure to check out the number of pages! _Kushiel's Dart_ is forbiddingly long and relentlessly serious; I could only read a few chapters at a time before becoming overwhelmed and setting it aside for lighter reading. However, Carey's plot was interesting enough that I never left the book sitting idle for more than a day or so. Very good, though long."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Overall this was a good and entertaining book. It has lots of political intrigue, so if you enjoy that, you will probably enjoy this story. I felt that at the beginning it was quite cumbersome to learn and remember all the different characters. I kept forgetting who was who, and who was related to who. Carey drops little hints through the observations of her main character, but most of the time I was unable to pick up on them simply because I couldn't remember who everyone was or where they were from. Towards the end of the book this obviously got easier as she narrowed down her character cast, and also made them a direct part of the story, rather than having passing comments about them.My favorite character in this book was Joscelin. The main character, Phedre, is interesting, but I felt I enjoyed the characters that were around her more than I enjoyed her.There is some strong sexual content in this book, though I think it is more prevalent and in more detail at the beginning of the book then the end. It might be offensive to some people, but check out some of these other reviews to see if this book is for you.For the most part the writing style is good and keeps you hooked. The only thing that bothered me were the constant one liners for dramatic effect. For example:\\"...We raced desperatly across the ruined earth, my lungs burning for air, each step an agony of blossoming pain.That's when the skies lit on fire.From atop the battlements...\\"This seems to be a favorite literary device of hers, and for me it got old by the end. Thankfully it didn't ruin the story. I did enjoy this book and plan to continue on in the series."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"First, I am not historically a Fantasy reader. I found myself bookless at my boyfriend's house & he suggested I pick this one up. The first third of the book (I still can't believe I stuck it out that long) was PAINFULLY slow. Too many characters and lands with unnecessarily long titles, too many wordy explanations. I couldn't stop squirming as I read.But then...It got GOOD - REALLY GOOD. The story hit it's stride, developed tentacles and sucked me in; I couldn't put the gosh-darn thing down. Invariably, I had to check that I was still breathing after each intense twist and turn. Read other reviews for character and plot details. This reviewer's intent is to simply encourage that you READ ON! It's very, very worth it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Kushiel's Dart is seen totally through the eyes of Phedre, a courtesan and spy raised in the Night Courts of the kingdom of Terre D'Ange, a land founded by fallen angels. In this land, the supreme command of their God is \\"Love as Thou Wilt\\", and there are 13 houses of courtesans, each with a different attitude towards sex, from Joy to elegance to mysticism, and, yes, even S&M;, who support this commandment. Phedre is marked by Kushiel's dart as an anguisette, one who takes pleasure from pain. She is indentured in the service of Anafiel no'Delauny who protects her and teaches her how to use her intelligence and bedskills to extract information from his enemies. Intrigue and treachery are everywhere and Phedre finds herself in the thick of it, when one close to them betrays her and Delauney. Her travels take her from her homeland to the harsh Skaldi northlands to the isles of Alba and back to her beloved Terre D'Ange, accompanied by an ever increasing number of faithful followers, as she races against time to save the land she loves from treacherous betrayers.This book is beautifully written, the intrigues are direly clever, and Phedre, for all her strange quirks, is a joy to read about......... I HIGHLY RECOMMEND The Price Of Immortality by C.M. Whitlock.............."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"After reading the reviews on Amazon I decided to take a chance and buy Kushiel's Dart(it was hard cover and not cheap), but it was worth it. I was unable to put this book down, as I was drawn into the detailed web of beauty, power and intrigue. It is amazing that this a debut novel as it is stunningly written, with flowing descriptions and imagery and unforgettable characters.As it has been said in previous reviews, the novel does focus on the arts of pleasure which Phedre employs, and that some are violent and rather disturbing. However this is part of the character, the pain of these acts is almost a neccessity for her. She may despise the reactions of her body in certain situations but it an integral aspect of her which makes her who she is. Carey uses her skill for vivid imagery to describe some of the scenes, however it is not porn. Instead she describes the situations with rich words which cover more than graphic blow-by-blow accounts do. The novel is not masochist porn, but rather a different aspect to such actions.I will admit I did not care much for the protagonist at the start of the book, she was rather willful and self-centred instead I preferred the surrounding characters who are just as important and as richly described. You will love some and hate some, but they will remain vividly in your mind long after reading. Whether it is the subtle deceptiveness of Delauney, the cruel cold beauty of Melisandre or the heoric stubborness of Josclin, they will stay with you long after you have closed the book.Take a chance like I did and buy this amazing book. It will spellbind you with its intricate plots and wonderous people. A true gem to fantasy."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I enjoy Storm Constantine, so when I heard her quote on this, I picked it up. I hate typical fantasy - magick, witches,elves, etc. Especially women's fantasy - usually too romance oriented. However, I fell in love with this book from Chapter 1. Watching the heroine grow up in this strange religion of holy (prostitutes), courtiers, and royalty. It mixes \\"Dangerous Liasions\\" with \\"Braveheart\\" The battle sequences are action-packed, the sex scenes tinged with S/M. It was just really original, fun, and emotional. I even got tears in my eyes in parts. Some people might find it too dark and too weird, but if you're looking for something completely new - try this. And the ending is such a cliff-hanger you'll scream in frustration, and probably keel over of impatience waiting for the second! Read this NOW!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"KUSHIEL'S DART is an extraordinary epic set in a re-imagined medieval Europe. This is one of those rare books that combines an intricate plot with extremely well developed characters. The story is told through the voice of young Ph&eacute;dre n&oacute; Delaunay, a courtesan and spy in the country of Terre d'Ange but the supporting &quot;cast&quot; is given full attention as well-without bogging down in minutia.Throughout the sweeping epic, Jacqueline Carey never loses sight of the arch of the story so be forewarned: everything she writes is significant. At the end, you will see how she's tied all the pieces together into a tightly woven whole. Oh, but there is a window left open for a sequel. Whether you read this book because the characters are fascinating, the story fun and nerve-wracking, the writing exceptional, or the sense of place and religion so believable, I know you'll be satisfied. This is my new favorite book!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book had me from page one. Though I must admit I was quite apprehensive at first, due to the synopsis of the book (it isn't something I would normally read even if it is of the Fantasy genre) and because it was written in first person. I have this great dislike of books written in first person, and have always said that a book in the Fantasy genre could not be written in first person, there are simply too many characters involved to pull it off. Well, Jacqueline Carey proved me wrong in this.I must admit that I found the first four hundred pages or so a bit slow, not enough to turn me off reading but enough that I will willing to put the book down at any moment, the middle of a chapter or the middle of a paragraph it didn't matter, I could set it down. But the moment it left my fingers I was reaching towards it again, I just had to know what was going to happen next. The thing that really kept me glued to the pages was the intrigue of the book, the various mysteries that surrounded the numerous characters, the bits of information that trickled in taunting you with the possibilities of answers but also leading to even more questions. And then of course there was the mystery surrounding Anafiel Delaunay. I kept wondering just who he was and what his true purpose was.Even as some of the mysteries came to light, revealing answers I may have guessed at, and in most cases did not see coming, I was still enthralled with what would happen next. After the first half of the book there was nothing that could make me put it down. Each paragraph, each chapter had me begging for more. Phedere is a strong character who kept surprising me along the way, I knew she was clever and well versed in many things thanks to the training Delaunay saw her to, but even then I was impressed by the things she pulled off.The sex scenes, if I can truly call them that, were, well they were somewhat what I would expect out of this sort of book, considering what Phedere was. However I did find them also disappointing. It seemed that they focused so much on her pleasurable torment that it was added as more of an afterthought at the end of \`oh and they also had sex'. That being said, I have never been a fair of reading sex scenes, but I felt that this book somewhat needed them, or at least needed better ones. The one scene I was dying to have better detail of was between Phedere and Josceline. I saw it coming, was glad it was happening, but again found myself disappointed at what was actually played out in that scene.With all the characters in this book I was very interested in their role among the puzzle pieces. How would they effect the next piece? Would they reveal who they truly were or continue to wear a mask that hide things? So many questions and as the book came to an end I realized how many are yet to be answered. Those answers will of course come in the next book and perhaps even the third book in the series. One thing I am looking forward to is the finding out what will happen with Melisande, a character I both hate and love."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book was first recommended to me by a friend who was serving oversees, who convinced me to read it after he threw me the tantalizing bait that the main character reminded him of me.OK, I don't necessarily buy into that either but it was enough to get me to go against my better judgment and read the novel. I'm so glad I did.My fears prior to reading this were:1. It would be some cheezy romance with a thin plot strung through.2. It would be some cheezy erotica with a thin plot strung through.3. It would be some cheezy teenage boy's fantasy with no real character development and a thin plot strung though.4. It would be nothing more than torture porn with a thin plot strung through.I was wrong on all accounts.From the first few paragraphs, beginning with the heroine recounting her early childhood and discovering her position in society and to the royal court, I realized that this was a novel with actual, three-dimensional characters who learn and grow throughout the story. This isn't just rare in \\"dark\\" or \\"erotic fantasy\\", it is rare in most works of modern fiction. Carey did a superb job of developing not only the history of the characters but also a fascinating, alternate history for its setting.I read with dismay some other reviewers who were put off by an \\"Anguissette\\" (a woman who takes pleasure from pain) being the heroine. My response to this would be to further explain that not only are the sex acts entirely consensual, they are met with absolute enthusiasm by a heroine who was literally born to do just that. Enthusiasm is the polar opposite of forced or unwilling sex. There is more to complain about regarding many \\"romance\\" novels (especially \\"proper\\" Victorian romances, as well as those written in the 70s & 80s) where heroines need to be raped in order for them to experience the \\"pleasure\\" from sex. I can appreciate that not all readers may wish to identify with such a heroine. This does not mean we cannot appreciate the story, even if the sex acts are not our cup of tea. There is plenty of mystery/espionage/adventure/drama for many appetites. For those of us who may understand that the lines between pleasure and pain can often be blurred, this story is a welcome relief to both the torture porn and the vanilla \\"erotica\\" which saturates our culture. It is everything it claims to be and more.Still, this novel is not for everyone. If you are someone who:1. Thinks \\"erotic fantasy\\" includes the Star Wars scenes between Han & Leia / Anakin & Padme;2. Thinks that the only acceptable sex is vanilla sex, regardless of the desires of those involved;This book would not be for you.However, do not begrudge those of us who find Carey's work absolutely brilliant."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Plot Summary: A beautiful baby girl with a scarlet mark in one iris is deemed damaged goods, and thus sold to a brothel. Ph&eacute;dre grows up training for whoredom, and in her early teens she is purchased by a scholar whose political game runs deep. He trains her mind to complement her body, and uses her to gather information from horny aristocrats. From there, the story turns into an epic saga of slavery, escape, diplomacy, and battle. Supporting Ph&eacute;dre is a woefully small cadre of friends, but foremost is a conflicted warrior-priest who becomes her greatest protector and love.I was really close to giving this my top rating, but I can't ignore some pressure points that bugged me along the way. Since this is a hefty series, I'll save my raves in the hope that the next book(s) blows me away. I think it's accurate to call this story an epic, and during the days I spent reading it (yeah, it's a big one) I ran a whole gamut of emotions from boredom, to anticipation, to disgust, to admiration, and finally satisfaction.Jacqueline Carey's pseudo-European fantasy land feels comfortable and exotic at the same time. Staged in the era of horses, sails, and swords, the climate, tribes, and religions closely mimic human history with a few twists. The list of characters must number over 50 (and yes, there is a list a the beginning), and to be blunt, I did not find it encouraging. The sheer amount of information that the reader needs to absorb to understand the plot is intimidating, and I found the first third of this book to be tedious as a result. Fortunately there is a dramatic turning point that kicks off a never-ending series of adventures that carried me to the end.The crux of the tale rests on Ph&eacute;dre, our unlikely heroine from humble beginnings. I don't feel the need to couch this in polite terms - Ph&eacute;dre is a whore, and she was trained to be the ultimate pleasure servant from her childhood. This is fairly titillating in itself, but it gets even better, since she's also an anguissette (someone who derives pleasure from pain), so Ph&eacute;dre is the perfect plaything for men and women who get off on S&M.; The sex scenes manage to be both shockingly graphic and obtuse at the same time. Carey shows just enough to give the reader an understanding of Ph&eacute;dre's gift, curse, or whatever you'd call it, but it's usually just a passing glimpse. I for one am grateful, because I happen to be a big fat wimp when it comes to pain, and I won't pretend that I understand how whips and flechettes enhance sex.Ph&eacute;dre uses either her brain or her body without compunction throughout the story, and if I didn't always admire her, I didn't begrudge her drive to survive. I absolutely hated her sick, twisted, and desperate relationship with the nemesis of the story, and I'm still having a hard time believing that Ph&eacute;dre could love and hate this person in equal measure. Those were the moments that made it hard for me to admire her, since I didn't understand this strange sexual, mystical compulsion that manipulates Ph&eacute;dre without needing her consent. It was weird, to say the least.There are many characters that demand attention throughout this narrative, but I found Joscelin to be the most interesting of all. He's a warrior-priest who is constantly battling himself regarding his vows, and his development is like watching a bone break and grow back even stronger. Joscelin's relationship with Ph&eacute;dre was definitely a highlight for me, and it's one of the reasons I'm interested in continuing this series. It's not every day that I read something as grand and ambitious as Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and I tip my hat to the excellent storytelling that had me hooked from the first crisis onward."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend initially because he thought I would like it. From reading the back cover I was a little dubious. It sounded like erotica thinly veiled as fantasy. But I was deeply impressed by this book. There are scenes that are erotic, but they are backed up by a plot and a world that is rich and full of depth...which is exactly the sort of thing I love in a book. If you are looking for straight romance, then you might not enjoy this book as much as I did, but if you are looking for a complex world and an interesting plot, then I think you will love this book.My favorite aspect of the world is the religion Carey creates that is a spin-off of Christianity, with the main precept of \\"love as you will\\". I just find the notion to be very intriguing...especially since \\"love\\" can and is interpreted in many different ways in the book (so it's not just one mindless sex scene after another).I actually enjoyed this book so much that even though the hardback is over 700 pages long, I pulled an all nighter and read it in one sitting. I have since purchased the entire series because these books are the rare ones that I will want to read over and over again."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Jacqueline Carey, Kushiel's Dart (Tor, 2001)After my first day on Kushiel's Dart, I tallied up the pages I'd read, extrapolated, and budgeted a month for finishing this nine-hundred-page doorstop. It's now five days later, and I finished it last night. There's a lesson to be learned from this: sometimes the pace of the opening pages of a novel do not prepare the reader for what is to come. (Not that I advocate dropping the fifty-page rule, by any means, but just something to note.) I really should know better; Martin's now-iconic A Song of Ice and Fire has one of the slowest first hundred pages I've come across in a modern fantasy series.Kushiel's Dart is the story (or the first bit of it, anyway) of Phedre no Delaunay, who lives in an alternate-world France during what would seem to be (and my apologies if I'm showing my ignorance of European history here) an era roughly akin to the reign of Louis XIII. This land of Carey's, though, is about as different from Earth as could be. Jesus and Mary Magdalene had a son named Elua, and it is he and his disciples who form the basis of civilized religion in this world. France (Terre d'Ange) and England (Alba) are not trade partners, nor are they enemies; the English Channel is uncrossable, thanks to a figure named the Master of the Straits, capable of whipping up storms to sink any boat that tries to make contact with the other civilization. Italy (Caerdicci) is a land filled with plotting slithery-type folks (okay, so that doesn't really differ from Alighieri's description of Italy a few centuries before all that much). Everything from Germany eastward, as far as we know, is ruled by the Skaldi, northern barbarians. Terre d'Ange is not, to put it mildly, in a terribly strategic position. As if the threats from the outside weren't enough, politics is waged like war within the kingdom. Phedre's patron, Anafiel Delaunay, is one of the combat's most adept players, and he brings Phedre-- born into a house of courtesans-- up to be not only the courtesan she was born to be, but a spy as well. And while the first half of the book seems nothing more than Phedre's memoirs, eventually the plot is revealed in all its glory. And then the real adventures begin.That the second half of the book is good is, to be fair, not much of an accomplishment. Once you start packing in the action, it's pretty easy to make just about anything readable. What truly impresses me about Kushiel's Dart is that, even with the slight pacing problems of the first fifty or so pages, the first part of the book is just as good. I should mention at this juncture that I don't really do memoirs. Why bother, especially in an age where one can become a star by writing a memoir (rather than writing a memoir because one is a star)? Writing of the \\"and so it went\\" variety just doesn't normally work for me. Unless you've got a really good, solid writer on your hands. And the first half of this book is constant, unrelenting \\"and so it went,\\" to the point of the phrase \\"and thus it was...\\" being used multiple times. And I still lapped it up. Why? Because, unlike most of these wannabe memoirists writing actual memoirs these days, Phedre no Delaunay is actually an interesting character. Which, I guess, is easier to do if you're fictional, but Phedre's voice reads real. She's nave in all the places you'd expect, with a gradually increasing sense of wisdom (and somewhat unavoidable cynicism, given her various plights). These characters interact with one another well, and they're very well-drawn. They could just move around and talk, and it would be interesting. (Oh, wait, that's the first half of the novel.)There are a few weak points in the novel, most of which are first-novel-blues kinds of things. Chief among them is repetition; the repeated piece that stood out most to me was everyone's wryness. And I mean everyone. They all had wry grins, or spoke wryly, or what have you. I don't think I've seen the word \\"wry\\" that much since my last kosher meats convention. (I hasten to add that bad puns are entirely the fault of the review author, and the book is not cursed with them.) That said, such things are certainly not going to keep me from reading what promises to be the rest of an absorbing, fascinating series. ****"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book is a study in elegant writing and world building. A luxurious read, it tickles the critical intellectual in all of us and tosses in the occasional licentious pleasure. Though not appropriate for young readers or for the squeamish, it's an interesting take on a fantasy story-one with a dusky atmosphere and startling twists on our basic assumptions.It's not a life-changing book. It won't really challenge you or help you grow as a person-but it will expand your horizons and offer you some compelling erotica. Read this one in the bathtub with a glass of wine."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Okay...so I'm writing the 5,00289 review on this book. I couldn't not write it. This is one of my favorite books ever. Dark historical fantasy with an intricate, very deep plot. This is one book you won't regret picking up.High recommend!Along with all the rest of the books in this series. If you like fantasy, you've just found the mother-lode."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"After reading so many reviews for this book w/ Five Star ratings I decided to give this book a try. Sadly I was very disappointed-- I did not like this book.My number one complaint is that the author should have put a Glossary in the back of the book for all the words that she created in her story that the reader had to guess at their meaning. Trust me, I couldn't find much of the words in my Oxford English Dictionary. This annoyed me most of all.The cover art on the book is its best feature...it is downhill from there. I got very aggravated with the author and her writing style..poor sentence structure throughout the book. Perhaps, since many likened this book to the Rennaisance period-- that is why the author wrote sentences that were poorly constructed(?) I just don't know; it just irritated me to have to re-read sentences because of this-- much of the writing did not flow.This book was confusing to read, reviewers state how poetic this writer is--I think the author has a large vocabulary and perhaps a high IQ-- maybe this is why she applied 'big' words everywhere in this story---it did not make the author's writing flow any smoother.If you want to read fiction that reads like a textbook-- then read this book. All the characters are beautiful in this story...the heroine gets her pleasure from painful sex acts; if you are into S&M; then read this book, but be warned, the sex acts and any romance is scarce in this book --this is not Fantasy Romance fiction or Erotica.I realize the author created a fantasy world but they were human; I just don't think that it is human nature to accept the vocation of prostituiton and find it immensely satisfying--I don't care how intellectually educated the author made her characters--it just did not fit.So, you have a heroine who is 'highly intelligent' who enjoys painful sex with either of the sexes and who is stunningly beautiful, etc., etc..There is so much more I could say but my time is too valueable to waste much more on this review--I wasted enough time reading this , \\"powerful, poetic masterpiece.\\" Ha!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"What all the reviews say about this book is true--it's something new for the fantasy genre--in fact, it barely fits in that genre at all. I have to admit I've never read anything quite like it. And while many readers will enjoy this very original, senusal, sophisticated book, others who prefer a more traditional kind of fantasy writing (like myself) will find it hard to finish. In fact, at the time of writing this review I'm only half done the book and I don't think I'm going to finish it. Quite frankly, I found the graphic scenes of masochistic ... (both heterosexual and homosexual) quite distasteful. It's just not something that I can relate to, although I will admit it is written in a sophisticated language--no crude language is used. If anything, the language of this book is too flowery. The plot outside of Phedre's career as a courtesan I find both confusing--dozens of names, the Duc of this and the Comtesse of that--and quite boring--it all seems to be about nothing but court intrigue, which is a waste of time for me to read. In a fantasy novel I want to see magic and exciting battle scenes. Although Kushiel's Dart does have many vivid characters, the plot just doesn't interest me. Perhaps it gets more interesing toward the end of the book; but I'm not sure if I can make it that far."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Ok, everybody, calm down. Once again we have breathless abandon of praise that is really very overblown [though explicit sexuality and S$M sometimes does that to people--I'm convinced that's why Terry Goodkind has a following.] To be fair, Carey is a better writer than Goodkind, but she has the same tendency to exploit the sex rather than really thinking out the society. In addition, her heroine has no vulnerability, and it's hard to root for such a know it all on any but the parody level. The &quot;we're Phedre's boys!&quot; song to me was SO anachronistic it made me want to scream.On the other hand, the sex is not the offensive part of this stroy. It's the reliance on it and the fact that this somehow yields praise."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes at some scene or event. I liked Phedre, for the most part, but found her love-interest Joscelin to be annoyingly weak. He's suppose to be her body guard, but he's a wimp.Carey created a beautiful society with an interesting culture and completely lost me by using our own world as the setting. Was it just too difficult to create her own version a barbaric society, so she planted the Vikings in the story, instead?I've been told that you have to read the series to understand (\\"love\\") the whole story, but I just can't get myself to pick up the next book."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I was bored witless after reading the first five pages of this book. I felt like pulling my hair out after forcing myself to read past page 80, and I found myself at a hopeless standstill somewhere around the 200th page.I won't judge the writer based on the one book of hers that I managed to partially read. And on the same subject, I'm not in any position to make judgments towards any person's method of writing. I'm not an English professor, and I'm not here to critique Jacqueline Carey's writing style.The thing about this book that bogged me down the most was the tedious progression through the plot. I've read in other reviews that the real story doesn't pick up until you pass the 300th page, but I honestly don't think it's worth reading that far.The first few pages of the book relayed a sob story about how Phedre no Dalauney (who's name I absolutely can not stand)was born into a world of servitude, surrounded by beautiful people, while she herself is the epiphany of imperfections. From what I forcibly managed to read, Phedre's soul purpose in life is to sleep with strangers for money.I actually stopped and reread the pages on numerous occasions just to make sure I didn't miss anything \\"interesting\\" that may have happened in the story while I dozed off in my efforts to complete each chapter."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Product arrived very quickly and was in fantastic condition. Would definitely purchase from this seller again."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Not a steamy sex book, so you won't get that if that's what you're looking for, but it's intriguing with a very unusual, but strong heroine. There are some petty hot scenes, but there is SO much more to this."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I only have two series on my keeper shelf, the Kushiel's series & the Outlander series. This author is extremely talented. She brings amazing depth to her characters, & I love the parallels between her fantasy world & the Renaissace era. I cant say enough good things about this series, it was a great experience!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I loved the first 300 pages or so of this book. I thought I'd be bored or embarrassed by all the bondage sex or whatever. actually it created a very interesting set of tensions. the quasi-historical setting hints at commentary and allegory -- it's blunt enough to be provocative, yet subtle and invigorating. the protagonist's a submissive yet assertive character in this phase.but the book later turns increasingly daft and self-indulgent. this is where my expectation about being bored or embarrassed came true -- both parts of it -- but the sex wasn't even the stuff that turned boring or embarrassing. it was everything else -- the narrative, the characters, the setting, etc. -- it all fell apart, devolving into childish stupidity, almost as if the author wrote the first half of the book when she was in grad school, but somehow time-travelled backwards and wrote the second half in junior high.I suppose it's a bit obvious to say that this book's narrative turns masturbatory towards the end, and I realize for many people that might in fact be the whole goal, but it would have been better had she kept the level of quality high from start to finish. or, if you're going to write a book which has stupid parts and smart parts, put the stupid parts in the beginning and the smart parts at the end. if she'd done that instead, it would have been more fun."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"An interesting read., yet I was not blown away by the book. The things she survive and endure get a bit too amazing."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"No matter how many times I read this book, I still cry like a baby. This book arrived really soon after shipping and was in great shape. The product description had me well prepared for what I would be receiving and I wasn't disappointed."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The unexpected artistry of description and emotion from the heroine, Phedre, was what won me over with this trio of books (Dart, Avatar, and Chosen). There is nothing else like them. Following the thought process is fantastic. The intrigue is singular among fantasy novels. So is the alternate world and religious history. The first book is Careys best. I've read them all. None of her others come close, but they try!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I generally read books that can be consumed in a few short hours. I tend to avoid anything involved, involving a language, a people, or species with which I am unfamiliar. The Kushiel series came highly recommended to me, so I purchased them years ago. I tried a few times to read Kushiel's Dart, but was unable to put the time and effort into it, and would give in easily and set it aside. I finally picked it up a couple of months ago, and determined that even if it took me a year, I would finish the book. Despite not having more time to read than the 20 minutes a day, I FINALLY made my way deep enough into this book that I understood the heart of it, and aligned myself with the characters. I was hooked, and anxious for my next few moments of stolen reading time.I cannot express enough how lovely and absorbing this book becomes, how much you'll want to walk beside Ph&egrave;dre n&oacute; Delaunay in her journey, or watch the morning routine of Joscelin Verreuil, or witness the contagious smile of Hyacinthe.Fantasy is not my genre, but I am hooked. I have to read three other books for my book club selections, but I will be reading Kushiel's Chosen (book 2) very soon!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I've bought several copies because I keep giving my copy away and then want to read it again. With each new book my addiction to Carey grows."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"An inspiring read and refreshingly from a female author: a bizarre multi-layered world where the female protagonist is a powerful courtesan: a profession which is actually coveted in the realm, rather than condemned or derided. Make-shift worlds are presented cogently: unlike other fantasy yarn where half the pages are scripted with invented non wiki words, here we have a world which is totally believable and accessible, and a heroine who is powerful and charismatic. Intrigue, politics, familial relationships all intertwine to create a credible thread of otherwordliness. Recommended."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel's Legacy series is, so far, a trilogy of trilogies, so to speak. A couple of summers ago, I read the first book in the latest trilogy, Naamah's Kiss, and really enjoyed it. This first book in the entire series showed me that I have a lot to look forward to.Ph&egrave;dre n&oacute; Delaunay's world is one that is both familiar and not. Carey has given us a reimagined Earth with elements that are familiar. There is a lot of known religion and mythology in her fictional religion and mythology. The countries are almost recognizable as Scandinavia and the Middle East and parts of Europe. The problem is timeless - who will rule Terre d'Ange?(As a side note, when I read Naamah's Kiss, I compared Terre d'Ange to France, but after reading this book, I thought it was more like England. Anyone else have any opinions?)Ph&egrave;dre is not your typical fantasy heroine. She is a courtesan, and an unusual one at that - her specialty is pain, and the scarlet mote in her eye makes her unique in her time. The first third or so of the book is really about her and her journey from a young child sold into indentured servitude to a young woman who has earned her freedom. Once her real quest begins (along with her companion, the religious warrior), she finds out just how much she has learned along the way, and that she'll need every last tool in her arsenal in order to survive."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"not all fantasy novels are created equal. i found this series of books to be so satisfying that i have plans to read them for the third time soon. i believe the series gets better as you go along though i admit i prefer the stories told from phaedre's point of view. the books that come later (though beautifully written) are missing the constant presence of phaedre."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I am an avid reader and tend to collect books by the author. Once I find a book or series I like, I tend to seek out all that author produces. That said, not only do I have this entire series and love this author and series, my adult daughters are only allowed to Borrow these books:)"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"It's funny. :) The people that review this with low star ratings, invaribly start their reviews out with \\"...I read fantasy all the time\\" or \\"an avid reader of fantasy\\"...as if to lend credence to their low star rating. Are they aware of the psychologicial mechanism where one defends loudly what one is not?This is a fabulous, worthy, CREATIVE tale of bold and daring adventure. There is the bondage/dicipline thing going on, but in flowery language so as not to take away from the tale, and does provide the \\"soil\\" of the whole story in a quintessential way.Discovered on a rainy day with low spirits, this revived me! You will not regret reading it, if you enjoy a good yarn. A PERFECT read for dark cold nights, mittens and hoodie complete, under a down blanket."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The writing is excessively florid, and the fancypants archaic words are often used incorrectly. For instance, I really wish Ms. Carey's editors would let her know that betimes means early, not \\"at times.\\""},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I got this book because I was looking for a fairly hefty \\"historical fiction.\\" This book completely delivered! I found myself swept up in the whole fantasy of the story. I am not going to give any specifics away lest I ruin it for anyone else. This was one of the best books I have ever read. I am going out to get the other books in the series because this one was so great."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This debut novel is an incredible, fascinating, page-turning read with a plausible world and believable characters that capture your heart and run away with it. Phedre is an unexpected yet truly gripping heroine that brings a dimension of reality to the overall epic story that takes place. Although there is an erotic element to the narrative, Carey seamlessly ties it into the storyline without hindering the main action or making the novel pornographic in nature through relating a series of unrelated sexual events. Carey successfully overturns traditional gender roles through Phedre's character and proves that: \\"That which yields is not necessarily weak\\". Beyond a doubt, an entertaining, suspenseful and beautifully written first novel. I couldn't put it down and would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"So, after reading the reviews for Kushiel's Dart, I was really expecting something great. I mean, a book jam packed with eroticism, political intrigue, bondage!!!! What could make for a better book? Haha, I kid, but in all honesty I was expecting a very exciting book. Anyway, as soon as the book was purchased and in my hands, I set to reading it. What really annoyed me at first was Carey's intensely flowery prose. At the time, I didn't think it flowed very well, but after a while I got used to it and even came to quite like it. There is no doubt in that Carey is a good writer-she's amazing!-I just felt like she over did it with the wording at times.But anyway, continuing on, during the first 300 pages or so, I was thinking to myself \\"How in god's name did this book get such good reviews? IT'S SOOO BORING!!!!\\" I presumed to stick to this incredulous appeal for another 30 pages or so, but then, I realized, I was enjoying it! And as I got further and further into the book, I became crazily obsessed! I even took this book with me to a concert; I was so incapable of putting it down! Once you get to the middle, this book becomes SO addicting. Near the end, I felt the book was dragging a bit again, but it was still VERY good. This was... a fantastic read. I love, LOVE, Phedre and Joscelin's romance. Though, I must admit, Phedre annoys me at times. What is not wrong with this woman? Um... lets see. She's beautiful, supposedly to a startling would-go-to-war-for-her, worth-20,000-ducats-to-sleep-with-her degree, she's GREAT in bed, she can learn a language in like...2 days, she is super duper intelligent and a sure genius when it comes to political intrigue, everyone loves her, she's never scared (at least not very much), etc etc etc. I think it would be a lot easier to like her if I wasn't so ENVIOUS of her.Anyway, all in all, this was an AMAZING book (not to mention trilogy)!!!!!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The one thing you have to understand about Carey, whether or not you can appreciate the story or relate to her characters; the woman knows how to write. Kushiel's Dart is such fun to read, so effortless, that I went back and reread it before giving it a rating. I absolutely love Carey's style, which is extremely elaborate, with a rich setting and detailed characters.I understand this book isnt for everyone and I have a few warning's for people before they pick up this book. Understand first that this book deals with highly adult material that is very explicit in parts. However, I dont see how people reading the jacket could have been surprised when reading the book. Also, Carey's main character's have what some author's tend to fall on, which is super hero syndrom. They're pretty much perfect in every way so don't expect to see the harsh realities of human nature in this novel. And finally, Carey's writing style is quite poetic, a little flouncy, tending to forshadow often, but immensley detailed. None of these detracted for me however for the book. It's fantasy and I love it to death =)"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I love a good epic story but Kushiel's Dart is not one of them. I had to force myself to get though the first 300 pages and then I gave up.There was no excitment and I had no interest in the main character who to me comes off as shallow and emotionless. None of the characters were interesting enough to keep me involved, a page turner it's not.I had high hopes for the book but it wasn't exciting, erotic or an adventure, everyone just seems bored and jaded. Yet I suppose if your entire life worth is based on your skills as a high priced courtesan then you're going to be jaded, but it still doesn't make you interesting."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I don't get the hype. It's wordy and flowery concoction of nothingness. Ph&egrave;dre is little more than a Mary Sue wannabe. Mary Sue (Ph&egrave;dre) does everything perfectly, says the right things, does the right things, and is in the right place at the right time at every turn of the book. The evil characters in this book fall all over themselves to get Mary Sue to bed and have a mind blowing (epiphany) orgasm, and is praised for giving them the best sex they ever had.I agree with the one brave reviewer who calls Ms. Carey on her over used flowery antiquated use of flat prose to describe a sex act, when the sex act is about BDSM. BDSM has nothing to do with romance or flowery prose.I hope the author will reimburse me not only for the 7.99 paid for the book, but for the 4 days that it took for me to read this badly written tripe."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I bought this book on the strength of the recommendations here on Amazon and found myself regretting the purchase almost from page one. My biggest complaint? The characters are so hopelessly flat! Real people have flaws, that's what makes them so interesting! In Kushiel's Dart, no one seems to have *real* flaws. For example, Phedre is perfect in every way - she's smart, drop dead gorgeous, everybody loves her and she's apparently irresistible in bed. Her main flaw, the thing that she struggles against? She orgasms too easily and everything turns her on, most especially pain. Wow. That's like complaining you have too much money! Yes, there is plenty of political intrigue, and there are plenty of external obstacles for her for face, but the inner struggle that takes place is just a joke.And that brings up another, very annoying thing about the book. Everybody loves Phedre. Even her enemies can't wait to hop in the sack with her. There is one scene, early on in the book, where this guy *knows* she is laying a trap, *knows* full well she will try to bait him, but he can't resist and has sex with her anyway. In the afterglow of sex, he reveals a pinnacle secret. It's so annoying how the villains are so incredibly dumb!! The arch-villainess is supposed to be this manipulative, brilliant strategist, who incidentally has a weak spot for Phedre and lets her go right when she has her in her clutches. Then after letting her go, complete with her own body guard, she assumes that she is dead because she reckoned no one could survive the cold climate.Sad to say, I read the entire book. Why? Because I actually liked the interplay between Phedre and Joscelin. I wanted to see what happened to them, but I was let down in that area as well. The romance was so anti-climatic, I nearly threw the book across the room out of disappointment.So free book to anyone who wants a slightly beaten copy."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I was intrigued by the idea of a fantasy novel where sadomasochism was made explicit, rather than an undercurrent, and so I read this. After all, sadism and masochism are well-known themes of fantasy. Why else lock princes in towers, or feed princesses to dragons? Kushiel's Dart began well and that, perhaps, filled me with anticipation for something wonderful. However, the pretty opening is merely an elaborate wrapping around a hollow box. There is nothing good inside. The love, where you can find it, is unconvincing and therefore the sex is less interesting than a romance novel, despite the implements of torture. The story descends from Dynastic stratagems to the tedious pursuit of plot coupons. We toil after the heroine as she achieves one task after another, without her finding any real challenges or growth. The novel reads like a mediocre role-playing log, which I suspect is where it originated. The writer even succeeeds in making erotic torture dull, which is an achievment in itself. As for the other characters, the gypsy is unconvincing, not even suceeding as a sterotype and the most interesting characters are killed off without the reader being compensated for their loss. Dull. Dry. Don't waste any precious time you have on this book."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"while this book starts out with names and titles that are initially difficult to remember, you start to learn and love the characters; their tragedies are your tragedies. The plot of the book is deliciously twisted, and leaves you breathless. The main character, Phedre, is dark yet innocently sexy. The plot of the story is not like the repetitive stuff churned out in mass, it is different in that the hero, or more triumphantly, heroine defeats the bad guy using not strength or magic but the gift of her sexuality and knowlege instilled in her. She is obviously sexy, but thankfully she is intelligent. She is not perfect, in truth her flaws are shining marks that make her human."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"First, the bad news: I had a hard time slogging through the first hundred pages or so that describe the history, setting, and character backstory (which didn't see enough payoff later). If an author is going to go into that much detail about fantasy brothels, I expect them to feature prominently throughout the book, but they don't. They disappear and instead, the heroine becomes apprentice to a spymaster. Once I got past that unexpected twist, I was still slightly bored for the next hundred and fifty pages as the heroine completes her apprenticeship. It's okay, but not that compelling.Now for the good news: once the heroine is forced to go on the run (around page 250, IIRC), the story takes off like a rocket! From that point on, the author delivers a wonderful, epic romantic fantasy adventure for the 650 or so remaining pages that serves as a sort of travelogue for the kingdom and its closest neighbors. The setting is a stand-in for medieval Europe with the serial numbers filed off (concentrating mostly on fantasy versions of France and England), but that made it easier to relate to, much like Joe Abercrombie'sThe Blade Itself (The First Law: Book One)and Robert E. Howard'sThe Coming of Conan the Cimmerian: The Original Adventures of the Greatest Sword and Sorcery Hero of All Time!. I also liked how there weren't a bunch of stupid orcs and elves and wizards like so many fantasy novels have; just humans with the high fantasy, magical elements kept to a minimum. This makes for a grittier story and the kind of fantasy I prefer.However, one thing that struck me strange was despite the fact that the heroine is some kind of magical BDSM prostitute who can endure incredible amounts of torture without batting an eye, the book does very little to deliver on that in an erotic context. Frankly, I expected something much more BDSM along the lines of John Norman'sTarnsman of Goror Sharon Green'sThe Crystals of Mida: Jalav - Amazon Warrior #1, so I was a bit disappointed when it became clear the author was not going to deal much with that element. Seemed kind of weird to me, though I suppose that choice did make it more mainstream . . . but then why have that character as the heroine? It didn't really make sense to me, except to have the most unlikely heroine possible save the world.Flaws aside, Kushiel's Dart is still a great fantasy that could have been dang near-perfect had it not taken so long to get the epic part of the adventure started."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"While this book might not be for everyone due to the BDSM eroticism, it is superbly written. The geography and cultures consist of both fantasy and historical elements blended very well. Clearly the author has traveled and researched.For anyone interested in historical fantasy not afraid of sexual elements, I strongly recommend this book.Also, I would have to add that the author uses suggestion more often than graphic representation on the sexuality end, which I feel is a much better way to approach the issue."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Kushiel's Dart is very different from anything I've ever read before. It's a book that is at once enthralling yet overwhelming to the point that I think that I only understand the over-all big picture of the plot but the details have completely lost me. This is the story of Phedre no Delaunay, the first anguisette to be born in the blessed land of Terre D'Ange in nearly three generations. This is an epic story about a woman who started life as a \\"[prostitute's] unwanted get\\" and became something more than she ever imagined.Carey has crafted a world that is so detailed that you could almost reach out and touch it. It found the descriptions of the lavish excesses of Night Court and the D'Angeline nobility absolutely riveting and the religion of Blessed Elua facinating. The politics add a lot of depth to the world, but it is so complex that it is also very hard to follow. From the beginning to the end, there are a ton of details to keep up with, about the internal working of Terre D'Ange and the surrounding countries.See, Phedre is a Servant of Naamah, who pimped herself out to save Blessed Elua's bacon, making prostitution a holy act. But she's also been pricked by Kushiel's Dart, the scarlet mark in her eye. Kushiel is Elua's angelic companion who inflicts pain on sinners. As such, Phedre finds pleasure in pain. Phedre is made the bond-servant of Lord Anafiel Delaunay because her particular skills may help him in his political intrigues by gathering information from his rivals and enemies. However, Phedre learns to much and becomes enbroiled in a fight to save her Queen's throne from a cunning traitor, her country from a barbarian army, and her own life.Much has been made about the sex because of the BDSM and homosexual elements, but that this is an overrated aspect of the book. Phedre describes her early assignations in detail, but it's too clinical to qualify as erotica, which is fine since my limited experience with such is to find them hilariously stupid. It seemed like Carey was going for shock-value first and formost becuase as the book gets past page three hundred, Phedre starts to slam the bedroom door in the reader's face. Even the tender, emotional sex scenes and their aftermath are only mentioned in passing.One thing I found very jarring was the Master of the Straights subplot. Up until that part of the book, the world of Terre D'Ange had no fantastical elements or magical beings and such. Then all of a sudden this aquatic super-being just shows up. Very out of place considering that everything that happens before and after is realistic.Overall, I really liked Kushiel's Dart and plan to read the others in the series."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This was truly a great book. However, I have specific reasons for giving it four stars instead of five.The bad:The complicated names, combined with the deeply woven political plot is a really bad combination. The plot would not have been so hard to decipher if the names were not so complex. Besides for complex names, each person has about three different names they are referred too. This causes a gigantic stumbling block that trips you over as you try to sail smoothly through the story. Constantly, I had to go back and look at the name chart at the beginning of the book to understand what was going on, and even that took awhile.2 - There were segments of boredom, the first 250 pages is a real drag, I had to push myself through these pages in hopes the book would get better, fortunately it did.3 - The last three hundred pages could have been told within the span of 100-150 really. Pages 600-900 was a forced read.The Good:Besides all that I have stated above, Jacqueline Carey's prose is beautiful, and underneath the beautiful prose lies an AWSOME storyline, and an AWSOME protagonist. Also, the setting is so perfectly clear, the images are vivid and dance in your head. Thus, you have a solid storyline and great prose, I do not regret buying this book at all, and I will read it again someday."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Just finished this book and though it's been a while since I've read fantasy, (though this is borderline fantasy), it reminded me how much fun this genre can be.I must admit that when I started it, I felt a little intimidated when I discovered the pages and pages of character profiles. LOTS of characters. But, you end up grateful for all those profiles and really get to care about most of them.The plot is very intricate and unpredictable. I loved it!At the beginning, there is a sharp learning curve to absorb all the history and politics but it's well worth it. Oh yeah...and the S&amp;M element is interesting, too!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The first volume of a trilogy, \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" is an epic example of world-building fantasy at its best. Loosely based on European Renaissance culture with an admixture of an unusual religious mythology, Carey's world is one of highly paid courtesans, powerful nobles, and deep intrigue. The heroine, Phaedre, is a courtesan, a spy for her master, and eventually a political player in her own right. The narrative alternates between the intricacies of court politics and rousing action. Carey's characters are complex and well fleshed-out.What makes \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" unique is that Phaedre is a sexual masochist who hires herself out to clients with very special and perverse tastes. In the hands of a lesser author, the sex scenes might be merely prurient. In Carey's, however, they are neither overdone nor gratuitous; rather, they are an integral part of the plot. Phaedre is who she is--a women for whom sexual pleasure involves physical torture-- because she has been marked by a god. Within the world of the story, that is neither good nor bad (although it does cause complications in her love life)--it just is. Phaedre's unusual nature puts her in a prime a position to observe the political intrigue going on around her.\\"Kushiel's Dart\\" is an engrossing book and much better than most of today's fantasy series. Its thickly-textured and complex narrative provides a great way to while away the day. And yeah, the second volume is just as good."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I am a lover of fantasy and an avid reader of fiction and non-fiction alike. About this book, all I can say is:OhMyGoodness!The other reviews will give you a sense of the book. I would agree that the first 100 or so pages in this book was a wee bit tedious to get through, but Ms. Carey is laying the foundation for an amazing trilogy, so the reading time is WELL worth it.Ms. Carey's inner world must be phenomenal to give birth to such a story. And I can only begin to imagine the joys and difficulties that writing such a trilogy would offer the writer.So - on behalf of fantasy lovers everywhere - thank you, Ms. Carey for bringing forth this trilogy"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Jacqueline Carey's debut into fiction with Kushiel's Dart puts her on top in fantasy writing. Carey's characters are unique, inventive, and very believable. The world in which her novel takes place, an old world- fictional- Europe, has an engaging culture and an amazing religion that is based on Judeo-Christian traditions and Carey's own creative mind. An absolutely original heroine completes the fabric of wonderful tale. This is one of my favorite books, and defiantly worth reading."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is an amazing book. The sheer imagination required to come up with the world in which the main character, Phaedre, inhabits is simply mindboggling (check out the details as written by professional reviewers). Ms. Carey writes with a skill I've rarely come across in this genre. The depth and breadth of her story which spans three books, ingnites a compulsion to read all three in one fell swoop. What I like best is the very humanity of the characters. The good guys have flaws and the villians have their sympathetic moments. Most important, I never once went &quot;Oh riiiggghht, like THAT could happen&quot;, even though the most fantastic things do happen. Ms. Carey manages to infuse realism into every situation. I'm heartbroken that the series appears to be finished. I could do with more of Phaedre's adventures. Read these books!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I love this book because it brings such intelligence, depth, and intrigue to the art of the courtesan. I love it because it is more of what you want historical chick fiction for. I love to travel vicariously and the novel's heroine is all about travel. The cast of characters is totally entertaining. It's not for everyone...but if you like adult fiction, it's a great long ride."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Things I liked about this book: epic world-building, some beautiful and insightful lines of prose, and a portrayal of the life of a masochist that makes them understandable and human to me. I felt for the main characters, and cared what happened to them. The political scene was believable and interesting.Things I didn't like about this book: heavy-handed foreshadowing, unnessesary archiac and french-like words, too much &#34;telling&#34; and not enough action. It was too long - especially the first third, which was slow. This book would be better at about 70% of its current length. Also, does this world not have any form of birth control? If not, why doesn't Phedre have 10 kids? I also would have liked to have read about other sado-masochist relationships in Valerian House, so I could see what exactly was so rare and different about an anguissette."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Thanks for a great book. Does great to find obscure books. This is a great series. Bought the set and love them. Great author!!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I loved this book! It took a little to get into, the world building is quite intricate and quite a few different characters to remember. However this would have to be the best fantasy book I have read in ages. If you like epic fantasy with some naughty romance you will love this book!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The starter to one of my favorite fantasy series. Carey dispenses with a lot of the normal fantasy tropes for \\"what is a hero\\" and develops a very interesting, very different protagonist. Phedre uses her sexuality as a weapon instead of a sword. The world is also very developed right down to minute little details.Having reread this again recently, I'd say the only real negatives are that the author is sometimes heavy-handed on exposition (this bothered me more a second time through) and the language may be too flowery for some. Also the sex...not that it is bad, but some people probably want more of it. lol!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Another book club pick, this one was a gentle foray into the world of BDSM. Yes, you read that right. No, it's not graphic at all. It's probably the most gentle BDSM ever. Mostly it's an epic fantasy complete with army battles, political court intrigue, and oh yeah, a religion based on sex. Yes, there are some sexy scenes but they don't go into a lot of detail. I've seen and heard worse on HBO.I had a hard time reading this one. At first, it took me awhile to get used to the voice. The language is rich, lush, and a bit flowery. The narrater is the main character Phedre, and the story is told as though she's writing a journal. I got used to it fairly quickly though, and by the end of the book I couldn't imagine it any other way because it simply was Phedre's voice.I didn't like the politics when it was just a list of names and happenings. There was a lot of backstory and world building at the beginning, and I just couldn't wrap my brain around all the name dumping. I started skimming the long paragraphs and stopping for the dialogue. The dialogue indicated something was actually happening with the main characters, and those bits were interesting. Then it would go back to court intrigue in the year dot, and who slept with who and did what, and my eyes blurred. I was about to give up when I asked others why I should keep reading. They told me \\"it gets really good about 40% of the way in.\\"That's a long time to wait for something to get good. Especially with a book this long.However, I toughed it out. Why? Because I really did like the main characters. I wanted to know what happened to them. I just didn't care about the history behind it. I don't even like learning about my own history, much less anyone else's. So I persevered, and continued skimming.And then it started to get juicy. There was murder, intrigue, accusations on all sides, some sex of course, a kidnapping, barbarians and slavery. And all of it happening to the main characters. Finally we were out of the history lesson and on to the good stuff! They were right, it really does get better about 40% of the way in (if you read on a Kindle). I stopped skimming and started hanging on every word until the battle scenes, which I also skipped because that's just not my thing.First Line: \\"Lest anyone should suppose that I am a cuckoo's child, got on the wrong side of the blanket by lusty peasant stock and sold into indenture in a shortfallen season, I may say that I am House-born and reared in the Night Court proper, for all the good it did me.It is hard for me to resent my parents, although I envy them their naivete. No one even told them, when I was born, that they gifted me with an ill-luck name. Phedre, they called me, neither one knowing that it is a Hellene name, and cursed.\\"I think this gives the flavor for the language of the entire book, and it's a stumbling block for some. But for me it helped build the world, and Phedre's character along with it. The first line did draw me in, because I wanted to know exactly what the Night Court was.I enjoyed the world she created, which seemed to blend a lot of Christian, Muslim and other religions along with a good bit of Greek mythology. I liked the basic story. I found the idea of the religion they follow fascinating. Sex is a holy, serious thing that is meant to be enjoyed any way you like, no stigma attached. Those who practice the \\"art\\" are revered and respected, for the most part. It's refreshing to see a world like that.For those who like Game of Thrones, this has a lot of the same epic feel, especially during the battle scenes. Armies are moving and aligning, war is waged, power changes hands. And through it all, court intrigue. If that's your kind of thing you'll probably like this.If it's not, skip over the bits that bore you and hang on for the good bits. They are worth the wait."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 9/10PROS:- The world-building is incredible, with a mythology that has parallels to those of various existing belief systems but is unique overall, and the plot is intricate and fast-paced, even during phases when Ph&egrave;dre spends her time in seemingly idle study and extended periods of time are passing.- Carey's descriptive language is varied and beautiful, bringing to life both magnificent and horrifying settings in equal splendor. This is one of the first descriptions that caught my attention: \\"The adepts of Cereus House followed them, a white-and-silver fantasia of creatures and wintery spirits; I lost count, with the froths of silk and gossamer and silver piping, horned and hooded and masked.\\"- I've read quite a few books that contain characters with masochistic tendencies, and this is the best I've encountered at describing the physical melding of pleasure and pain as well as the psychological longing for the release brought about by that pain.- The number of three-dimensional characters here is astonishing. Even those who play only minor roles in the story have well-formed backgrounds and intricate personalities with complex motivations for their actions. Ph&egrave;dre is as strong and admirable a female character as any I have ever seen portrayed, and the other primary characters--both friend and foe--are worthy of their positions across from and alongside of her.CON:- There are so many characters and place names, many of which have a foreign sound and are thus difficult to distinguish from one another, that I had to consult the map and the list of \\"dramatis personae\\" at the start of the book a great many times to keep them all even remotely straight in my head. In some instances, this task became quite onerous given how many characters are mentioned in such quick succession. (Here's an example: \\"His blood-father had been among them, slain at the hands of the Tarbh Cr&oacute;. Maelcon's mother, Foclaidha, was of the Brugantii, who followed the Red Bull; it was her kin who came, overrunning Bryn Gorrydum, starting the bloodbath.\\")Overall comments: This is an excellent choice for fans of fantasy romance. The characters are well-formed, the plot is gripping, and the writing is good. It may not be for everyone, with its descriptions that detail Ph&egrave;dre's love of erotic pain, but I enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Summary: Ph&egrave;dre's parents gave her away to the service of Naamah when she was just a child. Along with a home full of other children, she will be taught the arts of sexual pleasure until she reaches maturity at the age of 16 yrs old. At that time, her virginity will be sold to the highest bidder and she will be an indentured sexual servant until she has earned enough money to pay off her marque and be a free woman. In the land of Terre d'Ange, this is a common practice. They live by the precept \\"Love as thou wilt.\\" It is considered a great honor to serve Naamah, and Ph&egrave;dre is looking forward to her future.Her path changes when a mysterious man named Anafiel Delaunay purchases her indenture to take her on as a student and foster child. From this point forward, she is known as Ph&egrave;dre n&oacute; Delaunay. Anafiel recognizes the blood red spot in her eye as Kushiel's Dart, a legendary physical brand that no living person has seen in their lifetimes. Kushiel is one of the original fallen angels to wander the Earth, and his mark on Ph&egrave;dre indicates that her sexual appetites and talents will be extraordinarily unique. Ph&egrave;dre's greatest pleasure will be achieved with physical pain and mental torture.Delauney's intentions are not to use his two apprentices for something has mundane as profit. Ph&egrave;dre and her foster brother Alcuin are being trained to spy on the nobility they will be servicing. Their skills in strategy, observation, and analysis are being honed to perfection. Their education and linguistics rivals that of scholars.When the two apprentices finally begin their service, neither is quite clear about what Delauney is looking for in the information they are bringing back to him. But they do discover quickly that there are many secret meetings and alliances going on behind closed doors. It seems that the failing health of the current King is drawing the attention of those who would like to take the throne. When people begin to take sides, violence comes to their beautiful city. Delauney will take no risks with Ph&egrave;dre's safety, so he makes arrangements for a Cassiline Guard named Joscelin to be her constant companion.When Delauney is betrayed, Ph&egrave;dre and Joscelin are kidnapped and sold to a warlord from another country. Their situation is dire, but their focus is as much on the future of their beloved country as it is on their own situation. They have finally unraveled the plot against the throne, as well as the identity of the traitors. They must find a way back to Terre d'Ange to save their country from an imminent demise. This begins the journey of a lifetime.Review: I had moments when I both loved and hated the predominant element of this story: Ph&egrave;dre's destiny to be a sadomasochistic servant of Naamah. In layman's terms, she is a prostitute. On one hand, I thought it was really interesting and unique to feature such a person as the protagonist in a fantasy novel. This kind of originality is one of the first things that die-hard fantasy fans look for in their favorite series. Ph&egrave;dre's profession is the reason she has access to the people who create the story's conflicts. And, because she is the only person in this service who has been marked by Kushiels's Dart, she is revered in a way that allows her to both influence people, and be in a position to manipulate those whom she would bend to her wishes.On the other hand, it's risky to use this profession as the thread that ties all of the characters and plotlines together because there are so many cliches and stereotypes revolving around this role in any society. Yes, the author goes out of her way to make Ph&egrave;dre something different: the passion she can only experience with pain, the vast amount of education, culture, strategy and cunning she learns from Delaunay, her acceptance among the nobility, and her unabashed love of and craving for her job. But when you are using \\"the world's oldest profession\\" as the story's catalyst, it is not enough to make Ph&egrave;dre a unique character - her actions need to be just as unique. After all, to stand out in the land of Terre d'Ange, where prostitution is considered a sacred service, she can't just stand out against the general public, she has to be unique compared every other prostitute as well. This is where the author made a few blunders.Although it was predictable, I didn't mind that Ph&egrave;dre's life was spared on occasion for the sole reason that her enemies were simply too curious to pass by an opportunity to experience her talents. She was considered a treasure of sorts, and even the most evil villains will want to acquire a few treasures. The story fell short in a few scenes where Ph&egrave;dre's behavior was vapid and unimaginative. Why give this woman the education and training of a world class espionage agent if she is going to choose to solve her problems with a roll in the sack? Sometimes it was just too easy. I was very disappointed when these scenes occurred because it was so contrary to how her character was developed. Her power didn't come from giving her body away, it come from the lascivious anticipation and greed she elicited in people. It is human nature to want what we don't have more than we want what we have.Aside from these few disappointing scenes, I enjoyed the rest of the book. The supporting cast of characters was phenomenal. Delaunay had a fascinating history that probably could have been a book by itself. And from the moment that Joscelin Verreuil was introduced to the story as Ph&egrave;dre's Cassiline bodyguard and companion, I couldn't get enough of him. He had to make some of the most difficult and life-changing choices throughout the book, and I loved that he followed his own mind and heart rather than following the rules. There were other characters who were introduced so mildly that I was caught by surprise later on when their roles became pivotal to the plot.In spite of the fact that sexuality was such an important part of this culture, the number of graphic sexual scenes are minimal and relatively short. I would recommend this series to fans of medieval fantasy with strong female leads. I'm looking forward to the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Kushiel's Dart by Jacqueline Carey is enchanting. Part of the reason I re-read this series is because I want to go back to the land of Terre D'Ange. People want to focus on the sex--it is interesting, but the characters are so well created that they feel like people I actually know. Love."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I have been avoiding Jacqueline Carey's books for years for no reason I can recall except that I think I disliked the name Kushiel for some reason or other. Well, no more. This books has it all, writing, plot, action, sex (albeit not 'straight').I will not detail the plot. Suffice it to say that it was complex with a goodly number of characters. The editing was excellent as one naturally expects in a printed book. The action was fast and interesting. The sex was unusual but it was interesting so keep an open mind. The author knows the sexual activities she is writing about perhaps from her psychology major, perhaps in some other manner.The book is well worth the reading and the time. I am sorry that I waited so long to read it but I console myself with the thought of the others in the series. The book is heartily recommended.This review also appears on LibraryThing."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is a great book! Rich in detail and characterization. It has passion, intrigue and betrayal, with plenty of plot twists. Don't let the warning scare you off, the sex scenes are tastefully done. The author only goes into detail the first time Phedre has sex with another character and even then the detail is not over done. I found the look into a masochistic mind most intriguing. This is funny because I almost didn't buy the book because of the masochistic theme. The only thing that ticked me off about the book was no fault of the author, the cover art doesn't represent the character in the book. Phedre was clearly described as having a massive amount of long curly hair and pale skin and her marque (the tattoo) ran up her spine from the top of her tailbone to the nap of her neck. The cover art shows her with straight hair (that just touched her shoulders, in the book it was past her shoulders so she would have to move it to show her marque.) and her marque is clearly to the right of her spine and finished below her shoulder blade. The placement (and the length) of the marque was right on the second book only to be screwed up again on the third. And none of them have the blood red drops that she loved the most of the details on the marque. I know this is nit picking, but I think that when the cover art doesn't match the description in the book it throws off the visualization of the character."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I chose this book based on the reviews and several listmania lists that convinced me to at least give it a shot. Not normally the type to pick up a fantasy novel, and especially not one where there's a half naked woman on the cover (I admit, I'm a book snob), I was wary.And very pleasantly surprised.Carey puts together a story over the 904 pages that absolutely draws you in. The mystery of who her master really is and what his purpose is draws you in...you hope for Phedre to find happiness somehow, with her master, her friend, her protector, or her housemate, anyone. Even though this world is not ours and definitely a well thought out one, you believe in it.My only complaint is actually minimal. I didn't like the religon of the book...to me it somehow seemed too corny...a man who walks around singing and says \\"love as thou wilt\\" just annoys me. But there are only a few pages directed to him, even though everyone runs around saying \\"blessed Elua\\".I will definitely be buying the sequels, and I've heard even more good things about them.Great book."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book is phenomenally crafted. Once you get over the initial shock of massachism (spelling?), you realize that the story wouldn't be the same without it. The romance of Joscelin is real, and thrilling. Every character is brought out with vibrant beauty, although some may seem one-dimensional. Carey illuminates the complexity of human relationships, especially those involving sexuality. Carey delves into a subject most authors stay safely away from, or dance around with cheesy euphemisms. Sexuality is a powerful force our society likes to deny, and this novel explodes with blatant examination of the touchy subject. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and its sequel, and am anxiously awaiting the third."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"OH my I LOVE this charecter and this book. I actually bought Kushiel's Chosen the second of the trilogy first, by accident. Due to my obsession with reading things from series or trilogy in proper order I sought out Kushiel's Dart to read first. And I am now on 3 waiting lists for Kushiel's Avatar the final book. I have never been able to get into fantasy and sci-fi reading being an Old English Literature lover, and student.It always seemed to out there and random. Though catagorized as Fantasy i prefer romantic history, yet this series is so many different genre's all rolled into one, fantasy, history, literture, poetry romance, adventure and a heroine the likes of which I have no comparison. This will appeal to Darklings, Lit buffs, Romance lovers anyone who likes to read will find something to love in this book. If you like the concepts of Old english lit or history you have touches of the Romans, the Picts, ancient Spanish and Germanic tribes and small religous touchs easily parraleled into many of our modern cultures.The ideal of the heroines lifestyle is appealing to many, she is known as an anguisette AKA masochist of sort but it is done so beautifully and sensual it is not in the least bit off turning or crude. The ideas of her culture are to &quot;Love as thou Wilt&quot; and love is, as always the bottom line of any beautiful story. This one is no different. I hope to read more of Carey's works and hope that they all remain as well done and beautiful as this triology has turned to be."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I was skeptical at first, thinking this was purely a smut novel like so many fantasy authors have begun to write (ahem, LKH); however, I was amazed to find myself engrossed in the world Carey created. A true epic, the novel extends over a period of time that allows us to watch Phedre grow from a confused child into a skilled and intelligent adult. Carey created a world similiar enough to reality that the reader doesn't get completely lost when the characters travel from one land to the next, but the cultures of each place visited are very new, rich, and well thought-out. The book portrays characters with real depth, including a villian that is the definition of Machiavellian. This is the first fantasy novel I've read that completely turned me on to alternate worlds and histories. I highly recommend it for anyone looking to escape reality for a few days."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I loved this book. My friend recommended it to me, and I was a little hesitant. However, once I actaully started to read it, I really liked got drawn into it. I like how the politics were used in the story, because, truely, it is the main plot. It is all about politics. My one complaint was that there were so many important and semi-important people in the book. And normally I don't have a problem with this, but some of their names are very similar, and I kept getting confused. Also, minor charactures, suddenly become important several hundred pages later. And unlike some author's, Carey doesn't keep re-stating the same information about the same person over and over. Which I must say is a fresh breath of air. I also like have the people actaully develope through out the story, and aren't just the same through the whole book."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I am desperately in love with this book. It is intoxicating, intriguing, and intricate. The plot involves sometimes very confusing political and social twists and turns. It is certainly not an easy read, nor one that you can put away or return to the library as soon as you're finished. Kushiel's Dart requires going back and rereading sections for the simple reason that the characters cling to you. Phedre and her companions might very well be the most wonderful and flawed I've ever experienced. The book constantly wrenches a new set of emotions from the reader. It is long, yes, but certainly not tedious. It is extremely confusing, but keep going and you'll figure it out. And, though some may rail against the sensuality, Kushiel's Dart is a novel of faith and love."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Carey did an excellent job in Kushiel's Dart. The reader really comes to see the world from Phedre's perspective. I am an avid reader and just pour through this genre; however, the world of Terre d'Ange is simply captivating, while the characterizations are nothing short of marvelous. I find it wonderful that a strong female character has been used in this book, in that this book really breaks the barriers of sexuallity for women. Kusiel's Dart never once makes the fact that Phedre is a courtesean a debasing fact, rather a liberating reality. Indeed, it seems that I felt every emotion and sensation that Phedre felt from arousal to cold to hunger and to, most importantly, pain. One must be advised that this book is not for the faint of heat, while many would term Kushiel's Dart in many instances sexually explict. The book also has many instances of graphic violence of a carnal nature as well as more generalized war-type violence and on occaison, torture. The brave will definitely want to read this book, though for the plethora of sensations and feelings that it allows the reader to vicariously partake."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I am constantly reading, but it has been a while since I have truly gotten in to a book. I picked up Kushiel's Dart in a book store one day before going in to work. I read the first few lines and knew that I had to have it. I went without dinner that night because I had to use my dinner money to pay for the book. I don't regret it in the least.Although the lenghthy list of characters and houses in the first few pages seems incredibly daunting, especially to one who occasionally has trouble keeping track of relations, you are gradually able to connect everyone and their positions as the story unfolds to Phedre. It was an exellently written and and conceived story idea. I absolutely loved the intricacies of the plot line and the use of the melding of different religions and mythologies to create one society. I enjoyed this book more than any other I've read in a long time. I can't wait to see how it all ends."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I was hooked from the first paragraph, which is not an easy thing to do. I'm actually considering buying the second book in hardback, I am so impatient to read the next story.Phedre is an intelligent, sexy, sensual woman, who finds herself used by her mentor, Anafael to learn more about plots against the throne of her world. After several traumatic events, she must use all her wits to save herself and her bodyguard Josselin from slavery, then from being branded traitors and murderers. How she succeeds and yet fails at the same time is the heart of this wonderful story.It is epic in its setting, tale, and delivery. I found myself comparing this book favorably to several by my favorite authors. I can confidently say if you're looking for the dark sexiness of Anne Bishop's Jewels series and the epic political plotting of any of Melanie Rawn's works, you'll LOVE this book."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"A good adventure/fantasy read from Jacqueline Carey.I've decided to do a review of all three \\"Kushiel\\" books,(that being \\"Kushiel's Dart', \\"Kushiel's Chosen\\" and \\"Kushiel's Avatar\\") as one review; all three books are connected with the same ongoing story line, quality of prose and a consistent level of interest and intrigue.This is a story of Phedre, a heroine who is blessed (or cursed, depending on your point of view) with some special talents and skills; she rises from obscure beginnings to queens' favorite over the course of the three novels.The books were well written and gripped one's interest from early on. There is travel, love, betrayals, unexpected enemies and friends, and a few situations where magical qualities are displayed; but my favorite scenes were those of the battles and escapes. You should also be aware that there are some very intense, sexually explicit encounters in these books.All in all, I enjoyed this trilogy very much; while not deep or philosophical it was easy to read and found myself looking forward to finding time to return to these books when the opportunity arose. The only negative, (and this is purely a subjective, personal opinion) was that I found the areas involving travel within the book a little long and dragged out; but this is a minor complaint compared to the overall quality of the entire trilogy. 4 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Jacqueline Carey's \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" is set in fictional Terre d'Ange, populated by a race descended from the Son of God. That's an interesting concept in itself. But the conceit this book turns upon is its protagonist, Phedre no Delaunay, a young woman born with a scarlet mote in her eye--\\"Kushiel's Dart,\\" a mark designating her as one who experiences pain as pleasure.Before you think this book is soft-core S&M; porn, consider the editorial praise Carey has earned. They don't hand that out for Gor-like novels.\\"Kushiel's Dart\\" opens with a phrase that was either lifted from Mary Renault's \\"The Persian Boy\\" or a deliberate homage to it. But it works in drawing you into this story that is easy to predict but delightful to read. Phedre is sold into slavery in childhood, only to be redeemed by her strange imperfection; taught the erotic arts and educated, she is unleashed on several political figures as a player in a game of intrigue that touches on Terre d'Ange's royal line. Of course, she soon runs up against Melisandre Shahrizai, a major if shadowy player on the political stage. Melisandre gets Phedre exiled and sold into slavery to the enemy Skaldi, whose leaders plan to take Terre d'Ange for their own.Although the book is written along familiar lines, the writing is paced quickly enough to keep you reading, and the characters are likable. One of Carey's strengths is that she never loses her narrator's \\"voice\\" in anachronisms, be they idioms, metaphors, or syntactical structures. Her villain Melisandre just skirts the edge of excess, but exudes a charm and charisma when she's on the page. Phedre's uncertainty and regretfulness are annoying at times, but at least she never drops into mawkish sentiment. And Carey's dialogue is quite eloquent, a cut above most romantic fantasy where the characters usually express themselves in Hallmark-ian language.It's always good to see fantasy go in a direction that's not all about elves, dragons, and McGuffins. For this and for the book's other qualities, I heartily recommend \\"Kushiel's Dart.\\" It's as familiar, and enchanting, as a fairytale."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"After reading the summary at the back cover, I decided to buy it. From the first page I was hooked. Not a boring moment despite the political intrigues and the building up of the alternate world, Terre D'Ange (situated about France nowadays). The culture society is described well, given little by little along the way, not in a full history lesson, except for explaining the religion foundation of The Blessed Elua and His Companions. The story about who was Elua itself is a new thing for me and close related with crucifixion tale.Against the strong religion and political background, Phaedr&eacute;, a whore's unwanted get, adopted by Anafiel Delaunay and raised as the rarest scion of Kushiel, in other word, an anguisette, the right hand of the Punisher Angel and also as a spy. In the end of her lessons, she found herself in the mist of political turmoil, with the Princes of Blood trying to take the throne from a very old King and his young granddaughter by way of marriage or force.Who was Anafiel? Why was he so interested in political game and using Phaedre and Alcuin, his other student, both as pawn and spy? Befriended from childhood by Hyacinthe, a Tsingano boy who could see the future, Phaedre tried to find out the truth which only made her rue the day she found it out.Spiced with 'chaste' romantic relationship between Phaedre and a Cassiline brother (though I'm sure will develop in the next book), this dark romance novel is a hard-put to be put down. A sensually engrossing story."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Warning: If you're a single girl and, erm, frustrated, take heed. This book is quite explicit. Amazingly, I didn't feel like I was reading Penthouse Letters. Carey words these scenes in a very poetic way, but, well, they're still explicit.That aside, this isn't your usual fantasy novel. There's no dragons, or anything really magical (well, at least in the first book). It is filled with, however, political intrigue, romance, and even a smattering of biblical and European history.We follow Phedre from being really nothing to working her way up the societal latter. She's got the mark of Kushiel, which basically means she likes pain. Really likes it. As a courtesan, this makes her particularly special, and people pay a lot of money for someone who likes to be beaten. Thats the blunt way of describing it, but Carey makes this interesting trait sound much more romantic.I don't need to give you a synopsis, since those are already available to you, but I can give you my opinion. This trilogy is amazing. You will fall in love with the characters (in fact, a friend of mine would just love to name her first-born after Phedre's love interest, because he's simply that amazing), and the plot is filled with adventure.I used to only recommend this book to girls, simply because of its explicit nature, but suprise, a lot of men enjoy this too. You don't have to be a fantasy fan to read this, honestly. Just try it- you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Kushiel's Dart is an astonishing debut fantasy. Jacqueline Cary matches Robert Jordan and Tad Williams in sheer number of pages and characters, and a political by-play to equal Melanie Rawn's Exile's series (who also has a lot of pages). She also isn't the first to jazz up fantasy with erotic episodes (for that, read Jean M. Auel who also writes lots of pages).And on top of it all, Carey displays tremendous originality - a world loosely based on old age France, the Roman empire and the barbaric northern races, but layered with its own history, philosophy, mysticism and love of ... well, love.Our heroine, Phedre no Delaunay, is a high class courtesan, trained to be a spy by Terre D'Ange's most respected \\"spider\\" (spy master), Anafiel. Phedre and her counterpart, Alcuin, are played by Anafiel as pawns. Using their skills as \\"entertainers\\" they accept assignations from patrons influential among elite society to uncover elements of a plot unknown to anyone but the spy master.Whereas Alcuin is every woman's (or man's) dream come true of sweet, pure, innocent love, Phedre is cursed to be a masochist who can only find pleasure in pain. Her patrons are somewhat more obscure than Alcuins, but between them they unwittingly uncover elements of a plot that fit together neatly as a game of chess - all the more dangerous to the spies, as one of Anafiel's counterparts, Melisande, begins to move her pieces.All of these elements set the stage for what could be a truly stunning piece of fantasy writing. Nevertheless, something is lacking. The elements are there, but the sum does not equal to all of the parts. And it is difficult to pinpoint just exactly what the problem is.Perhaps the lack is due to the somewhat limiting perspective of the heroine's first person point of view and her lackadaisical story telling. Readers follow Phedre's story, and it takes some time for all pieces of the puzzle to fall into place. And yet, even when they do, the revelations do not appear that original or extraordinary. They don't even seem to be so unusual to Phedre, judging from her tone of voice.Phedre's life and world are undoubtedly different, and have a certain mystic appeal. Yet, the elements don't seem to flow. The reality of Phedre's life jars with the reality of her surrounding world, giving the book something of the surreal. The reader cannot quite dispense belief properly.It appears to me that in searching for the holy grail of fantasy books Carey has tried to implement too many unusuals, and the outcome is a court jester's apparel rather than a magic carpet."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This ambitious novel blends the erotic and sadomasochistic with a tale of political intrigue and for the most part handles all three well. Carey's imaginary world is well thought out and amazingly complex, filled with intricately described plots and settings, a feature common to many fantasy novels published today. The religion of Elua, who preaches \\"love as thou wilt,\\" provides an interesting view of sexual morality that makes Ph&egrave;dre's occupation as a courtesan seem a natural part of her world.Courtesan here, of course, is another word for sex slave, which despite all the rationalizations provided, Ph&egrave;dre quite clearly is for most of the book, whether in the cultured world of Terre d'Ange or as a captive in the hands of her enemies. That she enjoys pain is an interesting idea that brings to mind Anne Rice's \\"Beauty\\" Trilogy or Pauline Reage's \\"The Story of O.\\" As a feature of Ph&egrave;dre's character this would be interesting to explore further, but it is decidedly a secondary feature of the plot.There are two reasons this book rates four stars rather than five. First, it is so complex that the political machinations are nearly impossible to follow; Carey's skill as a writer makes it an enjoyable read nonetheless, but to be honest I was lost as to who was who and what they were doing almost from the beginning. A second and more serious flaw is the book's length. At 901 pages it tries too hard to do too much, and the ending, by the time you get there, is so long and drawn out that it becomes anticlimactic. I was left wondering if this wasn't a marketing ploy, with the idea that people would be more likely to buy a thick fantasy novel than a thin one."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"How to review this book? It has something for everyone. There is a great storyline, based on an alternate reality Europe, with enough of real history thrown in, to keep you trying to guess at the final outcome. The writing is elegant and baroque. The plot, has been well described by others; no need to delve into it.Phedre, our heroine, is a servant of Naamah, or in other word a sacred prostitute, indentured into the service of a nobleman, who is half spy, half poet. From this unauspicious beginnings, she will go on to become a heroine of her land.There has been meticulous research done, in the writing of this book. The language of the Tsingani (The gypsies) does approach the Romani that real gypsies speak, and the Habiru (Hebrew) that the Yeshuites (the Jews have accepted Jesus (Yeshua) as their Messiah in the story, go figure) is indeed Hebrew.There is erotica and S&M; in the story, but it is unobtrusive, and should not offend anyone, unless he is a real prude. Ms. Carey smartly uses French terms for some of the erotic terms, such as \\"languisement\\" and this, not only keeps it exotic, but probably prevents some of the more easily offended readers from taking real offense.The cultural research is accurate, the plot moves along, and I felt drawn into it from the beginning. The large number of characters, and the complex relations between them do not pose a problem; there is a dramatis personae at the beggining which is helpful, if you get lost.If you like high fiction, you will love this. If you are looking for an erotic kick, this is not for you.I would not recommend this book for anyone under 15-16 though. (18 if you are really conservative)There are some homosexual scenes in the story, elegantly related, and non-explicit, but be warned."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I cannot compete with the lengthy review already posted for this novel. I just want to tell you I picked up this novel on Wednesday and could not put it down.Phedre is a very compelling character. Despite her bizarre gift that makes pain one with pleasure and her consequent role as an exotic plaything, the reader empathises with Phedre. The author cunningly sets up Phedre's world to make it perfectly clear an adept of the Night Court is not the same as a prostitute and so sidesteps the reader's automatic stereotype of Phedre as unclean.The only negative thing I would say about this novel is about the excessive use of foreshadowing at the beginning of the novel. I found it quite annoying and distracting. This novel chronicles the maturation of Phedre. At the beginning she is a child, but I did not hear the voice of a child. The narrative voice of Phedre the adult gets mixed in and quite negates the impression I am sure I was meant to have of the headstrong young woman eager to try her new skills or the awed little girl at her first Midwinter Mask. It would have been much more poignant if all the foreshadowing had been left out. I would have been drawn into Phedre's world from the onset instead of waiting until Delauney's death to become fully immersed in her world. I would have better appreciated the scale of the gilded trap created by all of the political intrigue. This is why I give it four stars.I look forward to picking up the next one."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I love it! When I started to read I it didn't want to put it down because it just captured my complete attention. With it being in first person it feels as if you are the character and not just the reader sitting in the comfort of your own home.Phedre, the unlikely herione of the book, is Night-Court trained until she is ten. She is then sold into servitude with Delauney who teaches her (along with another student, Alcun)languages, intrigue, the arts of passion, and most impotantly who to listen, analyze, and remember. The levels of intrigues are so in-depth that I had to reread someparts to understand it.A great novel, and hard to believe first! Miss Carey did a wonderful job!A definate read!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"One thing that can be said for most readers of fantasy/science/ speculative fiction, is that while we generally like to be entertained, we also love to be challenged. We're not tied to hidebound notions of &quot;the way things should be&quot;; rather we are far more interested in the way things &quot;could be&quot;, or &quot;might have been&quot;.Kushiel's Dart is part alternative history, part romance, and part (albeit small) magical journey.Phaedre no Delaunay is one of those intriguing heroines who stretches the limits of what a heroine should be. Is she merely a passive plaything at the hands of a master manipulator, or is she a subtle player in a larger game that even the reader is unaware of? Like Michael Moorcock's intriguing albino, Elric, Phaedre is also blessed/cursed with a rather interesting &quot;gift&quot;, and it is the use of this &quot;gift&quot; that forms much of the crux of the novel.There is a rather intriguing take on the Christian faith, and one that may incite hyper-sensitive readers. All others will find it thought-provoking.This is author Jacqueline Carey's first novel, and she is to be commended for writing a multi-faceted novel that takes the reader beyond what a fantasy book can be. This is a huge and lush novel that is to be savored in small bits, and enjoyed like a box of truffles. I am left wanting more from this author, and I am certain that any first time readers will be feeling the same way."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The first part of the book, when Phedre is in training, is wonderful. Had the book stopped there, it would have gotten a 5.The action continues to be wonderful, but the secondary characters start getting confusing. (There is a listing in the front, but it only gives basic information.) If you read this book, do not take a break of more than a day or 2 (unless you have an amazing memory), else you run the risk of not remembering all the political factions once you start up again."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I did not know much about the book before I began reading it, and at first I was annoyed about the political details within the story. I wanted more erotica! After a hundred pages, I was hooked on the whole story. It is a unique storyline and offers a look inside a rich, vibrant culture that is alive and unbelievably detailed. The story is woven intricately and you are left guessing where the plot will turn next. Aside from my initial irritation about the detailed political climate, the humanity brought to life by Carey in this novel is worth the time investment. I even grew to love the complex story that fed my creative mind.Of the three books in the series, this is by far my favorite. But if you read one, you're sure to read them all!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I did read this book in 2 maybe 3 days. And I loved the ideas behind the world building...ie, Elua, his Companions and the strong religious sentiment of the book. The alternate Europe was well drawn but for a book this long I wanted much more atmosphere than is given.Carey gives us a lavish society and interesting characters, but the interuptions from Phedre as narrator are prosaic and distracting. Mostly she says things like I don't have the craft to drecribe what happened, and then proceeds to do so. Which, if we are to believe her studies under Delaunay, she must be very equipped to describe her experiences.And her sexual experiences are not develed into emotionally enough, nor with the true detail (not pornographic mind you). I think Carey strives to accomplish much with her descriptions of these sequences but I might suggest she look to Tanith Lee's Tales From the Flat Earth, Secret Books of Paradys, or Vivia for examples of really subtle yet vivid sexual descriptions.The end of the book left me disappointed, the characters that are poignant to the story loose more and more focus, mainly Joscelin, and I felt as if I'd just finished an intriging Romance novel, rather than a work of Fantasy.More of the Religious experience of the character, as a servant of Naamah and Kushiel would have filled out the flatness of Phedre as the plot progresses.Not a waste of time definately not, and as a first novel, very ambitious and quite an accomplishment. It will be interesting to see Carey progress and if she polishes her craft to live up to the goals she seems to have set for herself in Kushiel's Dart."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I found this book to be excellent - very intelligent, well written, and intriguing. It had everything - action, an intricate plot, romance, eroticism and a bit of magic. I definitely found it as sophisticated as Martin and Jordan. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"A superb prose stylist, a complex and sympathetic heroine, an engrossing plot. There is, so far as I can see, only one thing to quibble about. In the land of Terre d'Ange, the ruling commandment is to &quot;love as thou wilt.&quot; The principal deity of this land, Naamah, sold herself to any who wanted her. The heroine of the book, Phedre, was brought up, first in the Night Court, then by aristocratic Anafiel Delaunay, to be a cultured and highly skilled courtesan. Such courtesans are highly prized, acting as both servants and incarnations of the deity. Yet every now and then, a disparaging comment is made about &quot;whores.&quot; Yet this is, in the end, only a quibble, and hardly detracts from what is, all-in-all, a superb first novel."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"One of the best books I've read this year. Part political intrigue, part fantasy, part erotica, author Carey pulls it all together like an old pro yet this is her first novel. You'll savor each chapter."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Prepare to be enthralled! It's A.N. Roquelare meets Sharon Shinn and then some! A veritable feast of war, passion, honor and betrayal. A delicious summer read!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The novel starts with the basic background of the protaganist, but Carey has used a twist and it will certainly suprise the reader. The novel is on the dark side with a strong erotic undertone. The novel is extremely well written, which focus on the pyschological aspects of the characters she has created. You actual get inside the characters heads and understand what,why,and who they are. This book may shock some, but I found it refreashing. I hope she continues to write in this style."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"THIS REVIEW IS OF THE KINDLE EDITION ONLY, NOT THE BOOK, which has been well reviewed by others.The Kindle edition of this book is VERY badly formatted. It appears to have been scanned and then converted to .AZW; there are ink spots and splotches throughout. There are many bad line breaks, type moving out of line on the page and pushing other type around. It is a mess. I downloaded a preview of the second book in the series, and that appears to have been properly typeset, so this concern may be limited to the first book alone."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Fantasy is my favorite genre. I thoroughly enjoy reading Robert Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\" and George R.R. Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\". I've also enjoyed lesser known authors, like Tom Dietz. They are, first and foremost, storytellers. They write in a very straightforward way, the primary goal being to \\"spin out a good yarn\\". And to make that \\"yarn\\" accessible to just about anyone. They captivate you with their creativity, drawing you into their world of epic-sized action, violence, political intrique, romance, thrills, mysteries, and suspense.Jacqueline Carey is an author from a different mold. Kushiel's Dart is well-written. Jacqueline Carey spends more effort making her words and sentences \\"beautiful\\" and elegant. Her writing is not as accessible as the aforementioned authors. And you won't find epic-sized violence, action, thrills, or suspense in Kushiel's Dart. What you have is an elegantly described account of Phedre's life. Phedre is a young woman who was sold into the services of Anafiel Delaunay. Delaunay is a powerful courtesan, who trains Phedre not only to become a skilled lover, but also to become skilled in matters of espionage. Kushiel's Dart is basically Phedre's journey from childhood to becoming one of the most sought-after pleasure-givers in the city. Using what she learns from her \\"pillow conversations\\", she helps Delaunay further his own political machinations.There's really not much story in Kushiel's Dart. Certainly nothing close to the likes of The Eye of the World and The Game of Thrones. Jacqueline Carey is more of a writer than a storyteller. Now, I realize a lot of people will appreciate that. The elegant sentences and all of that. However, that is not what I like. I much prefer a storyteller to a writer. Tell me a story! Spin me a good yarn. And say it plain and straightforward. I'm not looking to critique your sentence structure. Not at all. I just want good plot, deep character development, exciting action, etc. No flowery writing is necessary, nor desired, from my perspective.But, I cannot really knock Carey for writing elegantly and flowery. There's a place for that. What I can criticize her for is the lack of \\"story\\" in the novel. What is the point of a novel that doesn't have much of a story? That's like serving a hamburger on an elegant platter, on freshly-baked bun, crisp lettuce and tomato, but the actual beef itself only fills up a quarter of the bun. Not enough to make a meal out of, in my opinion. And that's the problem with Kushiel's Dart. Yes, it is elegant, but there's not enough story to make up a novel."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I wanted to take to time to tell anyone willing to listen, if you have any interest in darker sensuality, get this book! Buy the series, it's beautifully enchanting, and totally erotic."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"It's hard to find a book now that is engrossing in every aspect as this one.

It is without a doubt one of my favorite books of all time! READ IT!!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is a amazing trilogy. I bought this book on a off chance that it would be great, and IT was. I got all 3 at the same time and read them back to back. My husband asked me if I was married to him or my books...LOL (though he loved the results of me reading this...LOL), I told him hush and kept flipping the pages (Then used his body shamlessly..LOL). Make sure you have lots of time and read it all (And have a partner to work the steam off with..LOL). This is a great page turner and gripper. WOW at plot, sex, and climaxes, relationships scenes. I cried, laughed,panted, got hot and wet all at one time. (I wish I could become part of this book. I have read them over and over again). It is so great when the author pulls you in to their stories so that you lose track of time, feel the emotions of all the characters and forget all wifely duties until you need to release...LOL. I am waiting for the author to get another one out there. It is so sad when they do a big hit then stop, I am left drooling and waiting for more. I do hope the author reads this and gets back on the horse and starts a new trilogy for all of us who loved it. I am a devoted fan, so PLEASE CONTINUE!!!!For those of you who don't know the names of all the books in the triolgy here they are: GOOD READING!!!!Book 1 Kushiel's Dart (Kushiel's Legacy)Book 2 Kushiel's Chosen (Kushiel's Legacy)Book 3 Kushiel's Avatar (Kushiel's Legacy)Let me tell you, I actually read all the reviews before buying a book and it does really help. Thanks to all of you who take the time to caution us and warn us on buys.I GIVE THIS OVER 5 STARS but it only allows me to give 5."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This series got such great reviews, I decided to give it a try despite some misgivings from the cover - yes, I was judging the book by its cover. Sadly, I should have stuck to my first impression.The overall story is engaging and well written, with an interesting main character and fairly well-developed world. Descriptions are generally effective without being tedious, and the dialogue is handled smoothly. So technically speaking, Carey's writing was inoffensive. Sure, the love interest was blindingly obvious from the moment he appeared, the characters are two-dimensional, and the plot got hopelessly bogged down mid-book, but it could have still been an interesting read.What I found completely off-putting were the repeated graphic, violent sex scenes. As you learn very early, the main character has been blessed/cursed by the god of - evidently - sadism, and she craves pain. As a costly prostitute, this is what she receives from her clients. While that could have led to an inventive story by itself, Carey finds it necessary to describe in intimate detail virtually every sexual encounter. The plot effectively becomes a bland distraction between ridiculous soft porn episodes of cruelty and violence.If sadism is your schtick, or you're looking for porn-with-a-story, this series will probably be up your alley. If you're looking for a good fantasy read with robust characters, tight plot, and a great story - keep looking."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I haven't read anything like this since the Angilique novels of the early 70's. Our heroine is both slave and independent female. She likes both roles.This was not a fantasy, it was a cheap romance with a formulaic plot set in a quasi mideval world. I will pass on the sequel."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I find first person writing hard to get into in the first place. Now I have to wonder what is up with Tor. Child prostitution, rape, and all other forma of perversion seem to gather great reviews but left me with my stomach turned.This is certainly a carefully written book, so I gave it an extra star, but the plot is dully buried under the titallation and I did not find the characters appealing. I guess sex sells."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"[Some spoilers below]I don't know how I got through this book. In paperback it's over 900 pages of torture that is meant to be pleasant. Which it would be, if I was an anguissette, like Phedre. Except I am not.First things first, my edition had a blurb on the cover, by the late R. Jordan. \\"Intricately plotted\\", the man says. The same man who wrote 11 books of the dreaded Wheel of Time cycle. I should have realized what I'm getting into right when I read the blurb. Alas.Kushiel's Dart is about as intricately plotted as the latter installments of Wheel of Time series. And that's no compliment. The entire plot dumbs down to the protagonist being thrown around various locations in order to save the kingdom. I say \\"being thrown\\" because Phedre herself has the ambition of a blow-up doll. Human size one. Nudge-nudge.Many reviewers mention that the sex drives the story. Umm. Phedre goes someplace. She needs someone to do something. She sleeps with that someone. Another obstacle overcome, yay!Drives the story? Delaunay could have been Kasparov and she could challenge people to chess to get what she needed. Heck, it would probably make the story more exciting.Oh, there is pity sex too. Like after someone pointless dies pointlessly.Did I say pointless? Pretty much every character outside primary five or so is pointless. By the end I didn't know who \\"Percy\\", or that \\"D'envers\\" guy were. Sure, they are all nobles and all important and stuff, but it's like they all became this single mass of dudes who do stuff. For all I care, she could have a single guy called \\"Noble\\" do all the tasks like discuss tactics and give commands and chuckle and nod.Oh, there are villains too. One is Melisande who is so OMG beautiful that Phedre practically loves her. Did I mention they are all really beautiful? Carey reminds us about twenty five thousand times. In case we forget. There is also Selig who wants to enslave all the beautiful people. \\"Who wants to enslave all the beautiful people?\\" he yells. And like ten million barbarians (Skaldi) go \\"We do!\\", yay! That's how grand villains are made right there, woohoo! All villains are given about 50 pages of action in the entire book. The rest is about Phedre being thrown through places. With a chapter for each day. Mhm. There are also entirely pointless plots like with Albans battling some usurper guy. I cared so much. No wait, I didn't.Probably the most exciting thing would be Master of Straits. There was alot of talk about him which got me all pumped up. Until Phedre actually meets him. And he is just some guy. Who talks. And then leaves. And that's it.I liked most of Carey's language. What ruins it is constant description, often of thing I absolutely don't care about. If this book is of any indication of the series as a whole, I think she could condense 3 books into one.In conclusion I can see where Carey's fans and accolades are coming from. There is definitely some originality in the setup, if not the story itself. There is also the whole sex thing. Is this enough to entice me? It did somehow, when I was ignorant (only read good reviews, alas). In retrospective, however, I find it insulting to my intelligence. For books like Kushiel's Dart there should be an injection to immediately get the entire plot into the receiver's brain. Otherwise it's just a waste of time."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"The characters seemed flat, almost stereotypical. The religious aspect didn't help.The world, based on medieval europe, wasn't imaginatively constructed. This itself isn't so bad, but the lack of imagination seemed to spill over into other parts of the book as well, such as the characters and religion, which were at most variations on various well-known, standard forms.The prose seemed ponderous to me. I also didn't like the foreshadowing aspect.On a normal day I would give the book a 2 as it had a (very) few redeeming qualities, but seeing all the 5's, I have to say \\"Why?\\" and give it a 1."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I bought this book because it was so heavily hyped, but it turned out to be mess of stilted prose, overly demanding plot details, and bad sadomasochistic porn. Every sentence rings of foolish bombast, the characters have no emotional appeal, and I felt so manipulated I had to throw the book across the room. I have tried to pick up the book again, being a third of the way through, but it repels me again and again. I am no literary snob, I read science fiction and some fantasy all the time, and I am no literary lightweight, enjoying Henry James as much as the next guy, but this piece of marketing mush failed to appeal at any level. The book reads like it was started on an alt.sex newsgroup."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I have literally been excited to read this book now for quite some time and finally this weekend I went and purchased the book at a local bookstore.

I know that many people have rated this with 5 stars and that is another reason why I thought I would give it a try, but I have been severely disappointed. I thought this was going to be book with strong female characters and possibly even something with a religious overtone, but the whole thing falls way short. Sure there is something of a theological aspect with the correlation to Christ but you ask yourself why. Maybe that's the problem with the book is that there is absolutely no reason for anything the author is writing about and she gives you no explanation as to what the things are that she is talking about. It's like walking into a 2 hour movie 15 minutes before the thing ends. Personally I would save the money and if you were looking for something fantastic with more of an edge and definitely easier to understand an apply then try Ayn Rand.

I am not one of those people. Maybe you know about Bishop Sheen being an \\"old\\" preacher, and maybe that concerns you? It concerned me. But under the guidance of someone I trust I purchased this book 3 years ago and read it.It is a string of perfect pearls!Each chapter deals with one section of the life of Jesus Christ and is filled with not just biblical references but with insights from Sheen that could only come from a deep, DEEP love for Christ. A deep understanding of history, and deep understanding of scripture.When you look for a good book to read on the life of Christ, don't let your reservation (or prejudice) about the authors location in history bother you. My prejudice was, Bishop Sheen was a man of the 50's and couldn't speak to me on a level I could be engaged. I was wrong. I am a woman of the 90's and I do not have a college degree, but I have a solid high school education. Sheen is a man of \\"letters\\" and that also frightened me. I promise you, don't let it frighten you.His method of dealing with his subject is so clear and enlightening, it feels like having the cobwebs and dust removed from an abandoned building. Sheen turns on the light!One of my favourite parts of this book is when he deals with the \\"Woman at the well.\\" There is just so much there that after you read this chapter, you'll be as excited as the woman was when she ran back into town shouting to anyone who would listen \\"Come and see a man who told me everything about myself..\\"Bishop Sheen loves Christ, if you are looking for help in meditating on scripture. You will find that help here.

You'll understand how not even the slightest sigh He made was unintentional. It's an insight into the mind of Jesus, and when done with this, you'll understand both Jesus the Man and Jesus the Deity better. When I finished this, I began from page one again. Bishop Sheen also has a writing style that draws you in and keeps you looking for more, mixed with a simplcity that won't lose you either in word or concept. I am now looking for more by Bishop Sheen."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"I own a few of Fulton Sheen's books, and the man is simply excellent when it comes to writing about spirituality. While some of his books are a little short on substance and are written in a way that touches on brief ideas of spirituality (like the wonderful but short \\"Way to Happiness: An Inspiring Guide to Peace, Hope and Contentment\\"), this book is truly his masterpiece. Coming in at over 650 pages (Doublday edition) it is not only full of material, but what is in here is distilled brilliance. Sheen takes the reader on a guided lecture of the life of Jesus Christ, and his style (common in all of his books) is as if he were sitting with you, relaxing with a cup of tea, and having a one-on-one conversation about his topic- only this topic is the entire life of Jesus Christ (no wonder it is such a big book!).\\"Life of Christ\\" is broken up into 62 Chapters (yes, you read that right) detailing different parts of Christ's life according to the Gospels. He presents it chronologically, and uses LOTS of Scripture, inserting the actual verses intermittently with his lecture/narrative telling of Christ's life. What is so special about Sheen's work is that he not only retells the actions and events pertaining to Jesus Christ, but he offers his own (and extremely useful) analogies, observations, and insights. He also includes statements that are deeply paradoxical or meant for further pondering. Consider this: \\"Every other person who ever came into this world came into it to live. [Jesus] came into it to die.\\" Speaking about the Nativity story Sheen posits, \\"Could it be that the Creator would not find a home in creation?\\" These little nuggets of thought allow the reader to enter more deeply into the mysteries of Jesus' story itself, and Fulton Sheen definitely has the knack for telling a good story. Of course, this is a story that most people are quite familiar with, and yet he writes in a way that is highly accessible to anyone regardless of how strong their faith is. It does seem, though, that Sheen assumes a minimal belief for those readers going into this work: this might not be the best apologetic regarding people who are critical of Biblical scholarship or who are antagonistic to Christianity in general. His other books might be better, and I'd personally give the nod to Chesterton'sThe Everlasting Manor Lewis'Mere Christianityif one is looking to defend the faith in that regard.Still, for the Christian who wants a companion with him or her while delving deeper into the Gospels and seeking the historical and personal Jesus, Sheen's \\"Life of Christ\\" is a phenomenal read that blows away 99% of the \\"modern\\" Christian books on the market. It focuses on the narrative, and doesn't get bogged down in scholarly or critical details that other books trumpet. While that might sound like a negative, it is clear from his writing that Sheen is a Scripture scholar and one of the top Christian thinkers of the 20th century. \\"Life of Christ\\" would make for a wonderful personal devotion for any Christian, whether Catholic or Protestant.***************************************Notes: Because the book was written in 1958, Sheen uses anachronistic references to the Soviet Union through Communism. Some might find it odd or even jarring, but I found it wonderfully insightful (just use a little imagination- history repeats, after all). Also, Chapter Two is almost 60 pages long (the rest of the Chapters are more evenly spaced and digestible)... I would politely exhort the reader not to get stuck here in the beginning, but press on as it only gets better and more well suited to a one-sitting reading!"},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"I just finished this book recently, and I have to admit; I was totally blown away. It's a fantastic book about Jesus; true, blue Catholic from start to finish.Any good Catholic looking for solid teaching, presented in a dramatic, entertaining and captivating manner needs to look up the name of Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen. He was an extremely faithful Catholic, a wonderful teacher, and incredible intellectual, and an amazingly charismatic speaker. Little wonder, then, that for years and years, he not only wrote numerous books and sermons, but had his own show on the radio, and on television. He even won an award for best television personality; back before the anti-catholic prejudice in the secular media became the epidemic it is today.The Life of Christ is some of Bishop Sheen's best work; a point-by-point retelling of the life of Jesus, with bible quotes and reflections for each major event contained in the gospels, as well as additional tidbits of information about the majority of the events described. Bishop Sheen's writing is enthusiastic and insightful, and at more than one point, he applies the gospel message nicely to the problems of his own times.Of course, the times that Bishop Sheen addressed were a generation ago, when Russia was a threat, but his words about communism, China, and the problems facing the United States are just as true now as they were then. If anything, I think that the last thirty years have only served to prove Bishop Sheen's points even more than ever.The church that my parents attend no longer has a crucifix above the altar. Now, we just have a sculpture of the risen Christ, and in this book, Bishop Sheen makes a point of saying, many times, that we can't afford to accept just one (Christ) or the other (the cross.) We have to take them both.I honestly think that this desire to avoid preaching the hard truths of Christianity that we see so often in \\"modern\\" churches in the west is responsible for the declining mass attendance. How are we going to see Jesus as sympathetic to our suffering if we don't dwell on what he suffered? This is the sort of thing that this book got me thinking about.If I had to find any fault with this book, it's that Bishop Sheen does repeat himself once or twice; making the same point two or even three times over the course of the book. Still, this is not neccesarily a fault, since many of us need things repeated in order to remember them. This is why I give the Life of Christ a perfect score. It's a truly magnificent book, which really helped me to understand more about the faith, and I highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"If you've read a lot of Archibshop Fulton Sheen's work, you're familiar with his brilliant insights, powerful intellect, fantastic sense of humor, and almost miraculous ability to express very complex topics in straightforward ways.Tell you what, though--he really outdoes himself in this work. Clearly a labor of love--intense love--for the subject matter, Archbishop Sheen pulls out all the stops in this book. He presents the life of Jesus Christ in chronological order, weaving together the details from the Gospels and other scripture. I would think that all readers will come away with a deeper understanding of--and appreciation for--the most remarkable life ever lived.This book isn't so much read as studied; every page has a depth of meaning that can't be absorbed instantly. Nearly every phrase calls out for reflection. There's no kidding around in this book, this is serious business; the \\"cuddly\\" Fulton Sheen is largely missing, replaced by the intensely scholarly man who started his career with such distinction at Louvain.I've heard that many great Catholics, including Mother Teresa, kept a copy of this book close at hand, and after reading it, I can see why. I'm sure that I'll refer to my copy again and again.Now, if you are not familiar with the books of the Archbishop, starting with this book may seem like a bit of a challenge, but it is well worth the effort.Overall, this is a true masterpiece of Christian writing."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"Quite simply, the best and most important book I have ever read. It will provide the reader with the understanding of Christ's life, death, and resurrection. It will provide the reader with the light of knowledge and wisdom. It will provide solace to the reader seeking the Truth in the world today. Fulton Sheen must be heralded as one of the world's great modern theologians."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"I wasn't sure what I was going to get when I opened this book, as my experience with Fulton Sheen had been based entirely on replays of his \\"Life is Worth Living\\" tv shows from the '50s and '60s. I wasn't expecting this much depth based on that criteria. Well, I seriously underestimated Bishop Sheen. This is a complete and full life of Christ for the believer or for one who wants to know why he or she might want to believe. It isn't a scholarly work, there aren't a whole lot of citations. However, one book that is cited extensively is the Bible. Sheen walks us through the life of Christ event by event and gives deep insight into each of the incidents that made up his life. I found myself not only more informed about Jesus, but moved by a new feeling of closeness to my Savior. I will admit that on several (or even many) occasions while reading this book I was moved to tears, and I'm not one who cries too easily.I'm a lifelong Christian and thought I had pretty much heard everything at one time or the other, but the Bishop presented many aspects of Christ's life in ways I had never thought of before. I found myself almost spellbound at times wanting to find out what happened next, even though I knew very well what was coming up. That's the quality of Sheen's writing--he can take a story you've heard many times before and make it fresh and new.If you're looking for a scholarly work based on historical criticism this isn't for you. If you're looking for a complete history of Jesus, including major emphasis on the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy, you'll like this. And if you just want to feel closer to the Lord, this is the book you want."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"This is the best Life of Christ that I have ever read, and I have read several. Not only does Bishop Sheen provide insightful commentary on the Gospels, he relates them in a very understandable and practical way to life. This would be my top recommendation to anyone."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"I found it hard to read this book for long stretches at a time. Not because it was boring, far from it, rather because the chapters were so chock full of wisdom and insight that I could only handle small portions. This is truly a rich and nourishing read.Fulton Sheen doesn't add anything to the story of the Life of Christ, rather he unpacks what is already there. He sheds light on the symbolism of actions, words, and objects found throughout the Gospels. This coupled with Sheen's writing style really connect the reader with the events of the gospels and bring them to life.I don't recommend this as a book for a plane ride, rather as a book which you have the time to slowly digest and ponder over. It's a wonderful read!"},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"I apologize if I seem to use hyperbole in the review title but this thought seemed to recur in my mind while reading this glorious book by the late Bishop Sheen. I am a voracious annotator and will usually put \\"wow\\" or \\"!\\" in the margins when coming across passages that startle me. You know what? I just gave up there were too many instances. Sometimes I said to myself, \\"did this book come from a seraph from the Throne Room of God\\" (sorry again, lol)? You can tell the bishop had a close, intimate loving union with the Lord Himself to pen the words he did.I must firmly disagree with Karl Keating in putting this Life of Christ after Frank Sheed's \\"To Know Christ Jesus\\", while in itself a good read, Sheen's stands alone in profundity, lucidity and eloquence. I urge you, whether catholic or protestant, and are a lover of the Lord Jesus Christ, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE get this awesome, wonderful book and be blessed. You know what? I'm going to go read it again!!Jesus bless you all!!!"},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"This is a timeless book which is current to our world today just as it was when it was written! We wre using this book in a Catholic bible study group and it is great for this purpose but it could be used by any Christian group, as Bishop Sheen has written this so that it woill appeal to any group seeking a deeper understanding of Christ's life, as well as the reason why he came in the first place.I think this book is a must read for any Catholic or for any Christian, as well as someone on a journey seeking a deeper meaning to life.Bishop Sheen wrote some 90 to 100 books and many feel that this is his best.Please, take the time to read this book. It is both readable and will also be useful to the serious student."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"I grew up listening to Fulton Sheen. This is his epitaph a true work of art.

Beginning with Jesus' birth, climaxing at the Crucifixion and ending at the Ascension, Sheen explores and explains the ministry of the Messiah when He walked the Earth some 2000 years ago.I found Sheen's careful, clear and piercing insight very helpful and enriching as he explains the parables, miracles and healings of Jesus. The way Sheen breaks down passages and makes remarks bit by bit focuses the reader's attention on the verses in question. Although a Catholic, Sheen writes about Jesus in a way that all Christians can appreciate, even if he devotes a bit too much attention to Mary than I think is necessary. Sheen was also fixated on certain troubles in his day, such as communism and psychology and this comes out in his writings as he contrasts these worldly systems with the divine wisdom of Christ.This book is long but rewarding and I would recommend it to both Catholics and Protestants."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"I highly recommend this book for anyone desiring to learn more about the person of Jesus Christ. Because of Sheen's immense understanding of Sacred Scripture and the history of when Christ lived, this book will serve as a type of scriptural commentary that will greatly benefit your study of the Gospels. It is a long book, and needs to be read slowly so that you can internalize everything you read - as you can imagine with Fulton Sheen, it is very academic. But it is also excellent for prayerful depth as Sheen gives spiritual and pastoral insights to scripture that will edify any reader. It took me some months to read this book in its entirety simply because I had to go back and re-read parts in an attempt to digest the richness of the text. Everyone I have met who has read this book considers it essential to the Christian life."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"one of our better buys, we'd do it again if the opportunity presented itself; we're very satisfied with the product"},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"An awesome and inspiring read. I highly recommend this book to any and all that want a greater understanding of the life and purpose of our savior"},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"'Life of Christ' is an exposition of the Gospel stories of Christ. Somewhat akin to Pope Benedicts XVI 'Jesus of Nazareth', but more theresult of meditation with scholarly tone. Lets you go deep in the gospels from the birth of Jesus to his Crucifixion, Resurrectionand Ascension in 650 pages.Concerning the Preface & Author Alone----------------------------As an aside in the preface and stated in 1958 when published, Cardinal Sheen presciently describes his time 1958, which was basically the peakof Catholicism, its best time and the glory years in the U.S., and his description is ever more precise when it comes to its fulfillmentin our time:\\"The Western post-Christian civilization has picked up the Christ without His Cross. But a Christ without a sacrifice thatreconciles the world to God is a cheap, feminized, colorless, itinerant preacher who deserves to be popular for His greatSermon on the Mount, but also merits unpopularity for what He said about His Divinity on the one hand, and divorce, judgement, and hell on the other. This sentimental Christ is patched together with a thousand commonplaces, sustained sometimes byacademic etymologists who cannot see the Word for the letters, or distorted beyond personal recognition by a dogmatic principlethat anything Divine must necessarily be a myth. Without His Cross, He becomes nothing more than a sultry precursor of democracyor a humanitarian who taught brotherhood without tears.\\"Sheen also predicts correctly in 1958, once again in the preface:\\"The problem now is: Will the Cross, which Communism holds in its hands(in a sense through its discipline, self-abnegation, surrender,hard work, study and dedication to supra-individual goals) find Christ before the sentimental Christ of the Western world finds theCross? It is our belief that Russia will find the Christ before the Western world unites Christ with His Redemptive Cross.\\"..."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"Fulton Sheen just sees things clearly!! Fill your kindle with words of wisdom and download as many of these gems as you can find!"},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"&quot;Life of Christ&quot; is an extraordinary achievement on the part of one of the Church's truly great (and, I have no doubt, inspired) theologians. Outside of a mere handful (including the Holy Father himself and Father George Rutler), no one today can be even remotely compared to Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen. This is hardly surprising, given the number of politicians, managers, and blatant dissidents within the Church's current hierarchy.I can't laud this orthodox book highly enough. It's beautifully written, remarkably incisive, and provokes thought, while engendering spiritual fervor. To be sure, the book is a bit long and occasionally redundant. There are only two significant negatives, however, neither of which is Archbishop Sheen's fault or responsibility. First, the cover art. Of all the magnificent and inspiring artistic depictions of Christ Crucified, why the editors selected a flat and ugly painting by the empty Salvador Dali is quite a mystery. Second, and more importantly, the biblical quotations are from &quot;The New English Bible&quot; (an awful and mundane translation). I have no doubt that the original edition of this book contained quotes from THE Bible -- the Douay-Rheims.The bottom line? This is an outstanding book, which needs to be read today even more than when it first appeared."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"A great read for those who would like to understand deeper the Life of christ as written in the Bible. Wonderful insights by this saintly Man of God,Bishop Sheen."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"I read this book every Lent, especially on Good Friday. It has also come in handy for Bible studies, due to the many scriptural cross-references.More importantly, the way Sheen wrote was the way he spoke - eloquently, direct, and witty. He will have you grinning one moment, followed up by smacking yourself in the head for not seeing what he just made seem blatantly obvious. You'll understand, but you'll also wonder more. Excellent for meditation and study."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"Fabulous reading for everyone, from the most devout Christians to those questioning God's existence. Well developed concepts that are deep,yet explained clearly by way of analogies and similies as only Fulton Sheen can. Every provocative sentence begs deep consideration and contemplation. This is absolutely essential reading for anyone with even the slightest interest in spiritual truth.It impacts me differently each time I read it, based on my current life situation and relationships. The third time I read it, I decided to highlight the most important points for reference later. Upon finishing, I realized that I had highlighted most of the entire book!Buy it and read it as soon as you can. Read it slowly with great contemplation and meditation, and then read it again! Share it with those you care about. For many, this book can be absolutely life changing. I can't possibly recommend this book more strongly."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"It's become fashionable in certain Catholic circles to deemphasize or even argue against \\"the atonement theory\\" by which Christ's sacrifice on the cross purchased our salvation. Bishop Sheen, always one to have the good sense to rebuke nonsense, would have none of it. Read these pearls of wisdom from the introduction to \\"Life of Christ\\":\\"Plunging into the Life of Christ what seemed to stare at me from pages of the Gospel was that Christ, the Son of God, did not come into this world to live. He came into it to die. Death was the goal of His life, the gold that He was seeking. ... Unless there is Good Friday in our lives there will never be an Easter Sunday. The Cross is the condition of the empty tomb, and the crown of thorns is the preface to the halo of light.When all is said and done, there are only two philosophies of life. One is the first the feast, then the hangover; the other, first the fast and then the feast. Deferred joys purchased by sacrifices are always sweetest and most enduring. Christianity begins not with sunshine but with defeat. Sunshine religions that begin with psychic elation, end often in disillusionment and despair....If we leave the Cross out of the Life of Christ, we have nothing left, and certainly not Christianity. For the Cross is related to our sins. Christ was our 'stand-in' on the stage of life. He took our guilt as if He were guilty and thus paid the debt that sin deserved, namely, death. This made possible our resurrection to a 'new life' in Him. Christ, therefore, is not just a teacher or a peasant revolutionist, but our Savior.\\""},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"This is by far the best commentary on the Gospels I have read so far. His insight seems to be the Holy Spirit speaking directly to you. This book helped me to better discern my vocation, and to come to a better understand about Christ's life.

This is a MUST read for all Christians, especially Catholics."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"Bishop Sheen's greatest work. His insight, wisdom and knowledge is found on every page.

Sheen seamlessly weaves together the events from the four Gospels, always emphasizing Christ's mission to suffer and die for our sins, and showing how the cross casts a shadow backwards over all the events of Christ's life. Sheen does get a bit long-winded at times, and has a tendency to repeat the same ideas again and again, but still the excellent content makes this book well worth reading. I would highly recommend this book for all Christians."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"It's not a compliment, this book did change my life.

Well I got on the website to check any returns that the may have put on me and nothing showed up.

Fulton J. Sheen wrote in a manner that made it story like yet filled with facts. For me a must read during Lent."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"Fulton Sheen's book Life of Christ is a literary masterpiece. Sheen brilliantly navigates through the life of our Lord and highlights some of the more touching moments, while really bringing to life the moments that often get overlooked. Most importantly, this book will help you to nurture and inculcate a deeper and more profound love for Jesus Christ.Sheen's treatment of Jesus' childhood is masterful. His narrations of Jesus' presentation in the Temple is so moving and spectacular that it will almost bring tears to your eyes. Sheen highlights that throughout Jesus' young life the cross was always looming over him and accompanying him wherever our Lord went.Most of the book deals with Jesus' public ministry and Sheen does an excellent job of probing the gospel accounts for deeper spiritual insight. His constant references to the cross are always highlighted by His appeals to His resurrection and glory. Sheen illustrates how the apostles only wanted a bread king or a political Messiah, but never a suffering Messiah who was a sacrifice for our sins. It would be impossible for me to highlight all of the wonderful topics Sheen discusses in this book, but his treatment of Jesus' public ministry and his true reason for becoming a man are always highlighted throughout the book.This book is perfect for anyone wishing to understand Jesus on a more intimate level, but it is also perfect of pastors and church leaders who wish to use this material for future lessons and sermons. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wished to know more about Jesus because when it comes to our redemption, Jesus is the only thing that truly matters."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"I am not a Catholic and I don't share all the views of this life of Jesus, but I have to say it is a wonderful presentation of the Gospel and of the Divine Jesus. I would recommend highly that everyone read this book. The insight of Bishop Sheen is astounding. It is a wonderful way for laymen to benefit from a man of God who obviously dedicated a large part of his life seeking the Creator, and then presented Him to the rest of us. Please read this book and take the adventure yourself to meet Jesus,the source of life and the way to salvation. You will not regret it and I'm betting it's message will remain forever etched in your being. I just want to say, Please read it! ."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"This book more than any other demonstrates the ability of Bishop Sheen to bring heavenly concepts down to earth.

It explains the time and circumstances around each quote. This book has helped me realize more fully how much Our Lord suffered for me and how much he loves me. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get closer to the Lord."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"Fulton Sheen is arguably at his best in his &quot;Life of Christ&quot;, which, as he said in the book's introduction, he wrote &quot;when gall did mix with ink in those dark hours&quot;. Suffused with scriptural references, exegetical insights, and a truly down-to-earth manner of bringing to the reader what is important in each Gospel narrative of this Nazorean called the God-Man, Fulton Sheen conveys to the reader a Person's life that is hard to reject, is hard to spurn once understood. This is a book that must be read a number of times over a period of one's life for a full benefit to indwell in the reader. Combined with Sheen's &quot;The Priest Is Not His Own&quot;, &quot;The World's First Love&quot;, and &quot;Go To Heaven&quot;, the &quot;Life of Christ&quot; emerges with them as the working of a truly gifted and genuinely kind-hearted communicator, a text which marks Sheen as one of the truly inspiring religious writers of the 20th Century.When I met Fulton Sheen at his office in 366 5th Avenue in 1966 I departed thinking to myself &quot;Only one such person comes along every hundred years like this Bishop&quot;. When I read his &quot;Life of Christ&quot; for the first time in 1970 and most recently last year, I knew that what I thought in 1966 was truer than I had ever imagined.I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"Fulton J. Sheen's Life of Christ is, simply put, an incredible work and the best Christian non-fiction book that I have read to date. It is a book in which you sense the author's sweat, blood, tears, and joy on almost every page, and there's good reason for this. According to the introduction, Sheen experienced a \\"dark night of the soul\\" over a period of several years that threatened to overwhelm him. Instead of falling into despair or unbelief, however, he threw himself into Christ's embrace and used the time to study and draw strength from the life of his master, savior, and lord. The result is astonishing: He left behind a rich, deep, and profoundly moving work that has the potential to draw any Christian, whether Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, or Protestant, into a much deeper relationship with Christ.Sheen takes the Gospel according to John as his launching point and main source; this gospel provides the broad outlines of Jesus' life as covered by Sheen. The synoptic gospels are used to flesh out the story with additional material not found in John's gospel, but even so, Sheen has not provided us with a complete recounting of Jesus' life that could be derived from the four gospels. Sheen evidently intentionally passes over much of Jesus' teaching; he neither discusses the parables, nor does he provide a full examination of the sermon on the mount. Instead, he places his emphasis on events in Jesus' life of great spiritual significance.And it is in such emphases that Sheen really shines. Even if you've been a Christian for many decades, you may well be stunned, as I was, at the connections that Sheen makes between different events in the life of Christ, or between events in the life of Christ and events from the Old Testament. You may be awestruck, as I was, at Sheen's deep mining that unearths truths that you never dreamed of in a million years.Does this sound like an intellectual tour de force? Think again. This book is as much or more heart as head, as much or more feeling as thinking in orientation. Sheen, out of his travails, produces lyrical, poetical passages that leave you heartbroken or overwhelmed with joy. Only someone who faced a great darkness and intentionally if painfully carried his cross into the light of Christ could produce passages such as those found in this book. Some of the writing found here is among the most wonderful you will find in any book.In effect, through this book, Sheen becomes a spiritual director leading other Christians on a journey of love and pain through the life of Christ, showing them just how much their lord did for them and how much he loves them and the church. This journey is a hard one: Sheen over and over again emphasizes how Christ came to die for us, not to live and be a great teacher. While there is much repetition on this point, you can sense just how much Sheen himself learned this experientially through these dark years. And in this book he invites all of us to travel down the same road, one in which we take up our cross to follow Christ wherever he may lead, even \\"through many dangers, toils, and snares\\" (\\"Amazing Grace\\").This journey took me two years; I just finished it a few days before I wrote this review. Life interruptions caused me to put down this book at different periods of time. Still, I'm very glad I did not rush through it. Your journey with this book may well be a quicker one than mine was, but take it slowly and attentively. Sheen packs more meaning into one phrase or clause than many writers do into an entire book, and his emotional passages are worth much rereading so as to let them sink into your soul.This book seems timeless except for Sheen's repeated references to communism. Those sections keep reminding you that the author wrote this book in the middle of the last century, but, overall, they do nothing to detract from the power of the work.If you're a Christian, you should read this book for spiritual nourishment and, particularly, to love your savior and lord more deeply. It's hard to imagine your love for Christ not increasing as you read this book, even if you're a Protestant who disagrees with some of Sheen's theology.If you're not a Christian, know that this book is very traditional and theologically orthodox in its perspective. Sheen apparently had very little respect for the liberal theology of his day. Furthermore, some of his arguments are similar to those made by C.S. Lewis. If your heart is open, you might find this book profoundly moving and even life-changing.As for me, it'll be a long time before I can forget much of Sheen's wonderful prose and imagery: the ox and the ass present to worship at the birth of Christ in repentance for how men had worshipped them throughout the ages; Jesus ascending the pulpit of the cross to deliver his greatest sermon; the beginning of Jesus taking on the sins of the world not on the cross, but in the garden of Gethsemane; the marked contrasts between Peter and John in their reactions to their resurrected Lord; and many other passages too numerous to mention. This book is one of my top three \\"desert island\\" books: I would always want to have it on hand as spiritual sustenance. (The other two books, for the record, are the Bible and The Lord of the Rings.) It has been a life-changing book for me, and it may be for you as well."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"In the pleasure and pure awe of the realizations derived from this beautiful enlightened volume on the death of Christ so that we may live, I am nearly speechless. I am almost driven as much as if I was reading the Bible itself. Bishop Sheen has simplified the explainations of the message and brought out the realizations of the cross overshadowing the stablecrib. &quot;He came to die so that we may live.&quot;I have never felt so secure in the aquisition of news of the faith.

It is great if you already know the Bible, so you see how it Jesus fulfills the prophecies. If you haven't read much of the bible you will want to look up verses Sheen points out. I have loaned my book to many, everyone absolutely loves it!"},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"If you've read anything by Fulton Sheen you know that he was an astonishingly talented writer.

Buy the hardback copy if possible becuase you will want to read this treasure again and again."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"If Ronald Reagan was the \\"great communicator,\\" then Fulton Sheen was the \\"master communicator\\" both in speech and in written word. This book is not only for CATHOLICS, but is a marvelous recapitulation of the life of Jesus, weaving together all four Gospels into a rich tapestry of the life and love of Jesus Christ. I remember when I was seven or eight that I would sit enraptured by the Bishop's talks on radio and TV. I have recently rediscovered him, and he is no less captivating today. If you want to know the essence of Christianity or want to strengthen your faith, READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"This is a thoroughly concise writing on the life of our Savior. It is smooth reading, inspirational, and even deep enough to bring a lump to my throat and an occasional tear (at the risk of coming off too emotionally). It is written with confidence and makes me feel confident that I am receiving the truth. If you want an undistorted biography, this is it. Thank you for having it available."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"This book is an amazing reflection on the Gospels from one of the greatest Catholic minds of the 20th century. After finishing this book, I was able to not only understand the Gospels better, but pray them better too.I found this book to be a perfect blend of spirituality, knowledge, history, and contemplative thought. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially if they are unfamiliar or have doubts concerning Christianity."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"This is a great book to use as a bible study, to understand Christianity in general and Catholic theology. It was easy to read, with wonderful insight about Jesus and His life and teachings. Also reviewing the old testament and the prophecies. I recommend it to anyone wanting a deeper understanding of Jesus, Christianity, History of the Bible or who just want to have a deeper understanding of our purpose."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"I loved this book. It's not difficult to understand and it really brought the scriptures alive for me. It also brings the scriptures into context with what else was going on at the time. I now understand some verses that previously did not make sense to me. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"This book has helped me to understand the life of our Lord, Jesus Christ more. As I read this book, it answered a lot of questions that I didn't know before. A lot of times I attend Mass but I feel that the pastor did not give a clear explanation of what the Gospel or Readings were saying. After reading this book, I have a better understanding of what Jesus wanted us to know."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"Purchased this book as a gift for someone who had read it previously and wanted to read it again and share it with friends and family. He believes this book to be easy to read and truly inspirational. A must read for all families."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"This book gives you insights you have never heard before. This is a classic and I think should be read by everyone interested in the Life of Christ. The processing time of this purchase was great."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"I found this book to be very edifying, the depth of understanding of Christ's life, death and resurrection that Sheen emparts to the reader is simply priceless.

The author seems to have some misunderstanding about confucious. Confucionism is a physolophy and a learning and not a religion in a strict sense. Confucious last name is Yau and his other names are Chung Lei.Yau Chung Lei is his full name. During his lifetime, he never proclaims that he is God messenger or prophet or any kind.He is just a phylosopher and a teacher.The worshipiing of confucious came about when the chinese people went a step beyond honoring and respecting him into vunerating him as God like figure."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"I'd say get this book as well as get a good Bible.If you haven't received Jesus Christ into your life, you should then. Many people have not been saved, and many are going to hell. Reading this book will tell you alot about the life of Our Lord, but still you need to be saved in order to be granted eternal salvation (to live with Jesus Christ forever). Say this prayer, \\"Jesus, I repent of my sins, i ask you for forgiveness. Come into my life Lord, and take me to Heaven once i die. In your Holy name. Amen.\\" Pray this prayer, and get a good Bible, and follow the Lord. I recommend this book. I saw Fulton Sheen on TBN. Nice caring man."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"\\"Life of Christ\\" is probably my favorite book next to the Bible, and I've owned a couple of published editions of the book.

This will serve me in many years to come as a great resource. Most intriguing for me were the parallels between the cross and the grave. The distinguishing nuances of \\"Son of God\\" vs \\"Son of Man\\" are also very interesting. Overall this is a beautiful meditation into the \\"Life of Christ.\\" The reader will walk away with a deeper understanding of Jesus' life and will have a deeper appreciation of His coming and going and will undoubtledly know that \\"HE LIVES\\"."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"This book is the best, most accessible way to learn about the life of Christ.

Knowing how He lived examples how we ought to live."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"Fulton Sheen's book is a Scriptural masterpiece. Sheen meshes the narrative synoptic gospels with the theological Gospel of St. John. With his superb use of analogies/language he gives the reader an inspiring and practical view of each event/phase in the life of Jesus Christ. I have purchased over 50 copies at various times to use as gifts and for use in 2 book clubs and 2 Bible Studies. I usually insert a recommendation to the ladies:\\"Dear ladies,In Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen's LIFE OF CHRIST, there are 62 chapters, most averaging 10 pages or less with just a few over 10 and almost every chapter can be read in about half an hour. Each chapter is an entity unto itself, but all connect.Starting when you receive your book, try to read a chapter a day..................UNDERLINE what strikes you as important or unusual..................WRITE personal comments or questions in the margins..................ADD question marks next to \\"problems\\" so we can discuss them.My role will be to keep the ball rolling; keep us on course, and rescues us from rabbit trails as well as to deal with any Scriptural or theological problem that might arise.\\"I highly recommend book to anyone who wants to deepen her spiritual life.Barbara Reagan"},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"The author has done an amazing historical review of the life of Jesus. A book to be given as a gift to every new Christian. A powerful book to understand who Jesus is and His mission; a book that is suited perfectly for Lenten reading. A reassuring work of truth and light in this time of satanic confusion about Jesus, His mission and His church."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"A truly awesome explanation of Christian Salvation. Bishop Sheen (born 1895) brings reason to the Roman Catholic perspective from Jesus' physical body to the Mystical Body of Christ - from incarnation through transfiguration to ascension.The first publication of this book was 1958, and it has been enduring critical acclaim. Paperback edition has 476 pages. Includes: Foreword by John Muggeridge March 1990, Preface, Contents of 30 chapters, relevant references to Scripture, alphabetical Index."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"Arch-Bishop Sheen does an amazing job of describing the Life of Christ while preaching truth.

Not even C.S. Lewis and Mere Christianity, although his comment to those who state that Christ was only a \\"good teacher\\" was one of the best comments I have ever read...of course, that is what I once said...I can't say anymore than all the reviews here. I am ever grateful for however this book made it to my hands. It is even more amazing that I was given the ability to understand it."},{"Title":"Life of Christ","review":"As a Protestant who went to Catholic grade school in the early '60's, I had head of Bishop Sheen. He was a star of early TV, popular with both Catholica and Protestants. And now I see that this was well deserved. While not strictly chronological, he does do an amazing job on the Gospels. Especially on the Agony in the Garden, which I have never seen handled better. Like his boss Pope John 23rd, he did accept that Protestants were also Christian, and not heretics. One warning though, since he wrote when all Catholic Bibles were translated from the Latin Vulgate, some verses may look strange, and some names stranger. Isaias, Jeremias, etc."},{"Title":"It's Good to be Black","review":"I found this to be a fascinating read, and recommend it to anyone of any race as a way to walk in another's shoe's. I have read reviews that put it down for not being angry and realistic enough. My impression was that there was a lot of realism, but told with warm generosity of spirit. This is the autobiography of an African-American woman growing up in DuQuoin, Illinois in the early 1900's. It has a special fascination for me because it also the place and shortly before the time when my Mother was growing up in DuQuoin and where a number of my relatives still live. While there were racial tensions, Duquoin in that era apparently was more hospitable to African-Americans than most towns in the area.What I know of the time and place is very congruent with her stories. Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"It's Good to be Black","review":"Why is Black so powerful? Because it endures hardship and can thrive when placed in rich, nourishing soil to grow freely. Author Ruby Berkley Goodwin has written a wonderful book of stories not only about the black community, but also European immigrants finding a place alongside working blacks in America.The connected stories make for a wonderful and enlightening look at the black family values that have been passed down through generations to this early twentieth century family of Braxton Berkley, the author's proud and powerful father. The blessing of having the racially tolerant small mining town of DuQuoin, Illinois as their home gives the place a sense of protection and security from the racially prejudiced world outside DuQuoin. The racially mixed town of miners were more skeptical toward non-miners than they were toward any foreigner or race.So much of Ruby's story carries what I believe are the roots of many an African-Americans' family history today, myself included. I found so many of the folktales, characters, sayings and situations as things and people I'd either heard of or actually experienced while growing up in a black community in the north populated with black families with roots in the south.This book is a reminder to everyone that black communities full of good black men have existed before, during and after slavery and continue to exist till this day. It has survived terrorism, urban relocations, crime and drug infestations that a people of lesser strength (physical, spiritual & psychological) might perish from. And as long as black people know it is a privilege and not a pity to be born black, they'll continue to be the wise, loving and forgiving people showing others that with God all is possible.I hope to give a copy of this book as a gift to my aunt. She remembers!Interesting the author had an acting career playing mostly maids. Here's a very telling article I found from the 1953 Jet magazine publication:Jet MagazineWeek of April 16, 1953Mrs. Ruby Goodwin, former secretary to the late Hattie McDaniel and actress Ethel Waters, has written a book based on the life of her miner father in the southern Illinois coal fields. A Los Angeles housewife and mother of five, Mrs. Goodwin tentatively named her book \\"It's Fun To Be Black,\\" but Doubleday and company, her publishers, said the title was \\"too undignified.\\" They may change it to \\"I Looked Over Jordan.\\" The book is scheduled for release in October."},{"Title":"Programming SQL Server 2005","review":"After reading other reviews, I ordered this book. I've worked with SQL Server since version 4.2 and just wanted a resource for new features. I was very disappointed. I found very little of use.Integration Services is new and I looked forward to the chapter on the topic. There is nothing in the book to explain the design or graphical use of SSIS. Everything is programatic. I followed it through the chapter. It was difficult to follow and to set up. When I got to the end of the chapter, it said data flow (a common use of SSIS) was beyond the scope of the chapter and referred the reader to Books Online.My experience is that you might as well use Books Online as this book. I own many technical books. This one I sent back."},{"Title":"Programming SQL Server 2005","review":"I enjoyed reading this book as a walkthrough style introduction to programming SQL Server. The writing is good. The graphics are sparing. The topics are relevant to the kind of work we are doing today, for example, there is a lot of material on XML.I would like to see the next version have some more reference level material to it. But I can't strike the book down for that since the MSDN is very useful and local. I just like how O'Reilly puts reference works together."},{"Title":"Programming SQL Server 2005","review":"The title of the book is \\"Programming SQL Server 2005\\". This title is misleading at best. It should read \\"Programming SQL Server 2005 - New Features Only\\" implying that if you really wants to learn programming SQL Server 2005, you should actually buy two more titles from the same author, the previous release of this book covering the SQL Server 2000 and the book about ADO.Net.The book covers all new features of SQL Server 2005 because most of programming features of SQL Server 2005 are new according to the author. It probably does a good job at that. But when it comes to T-SQL and ADO.Net 2.0 it also covers the new features only. If one is new to SQL Server 2005 and wants one book that covers programming SQL Server 2005, please be aware that as far as you are concerned, this book does not cover its intended subject.I think thar O'reilly made here a gross editorial mistake that taints their otherwise excelent reputation. This observation is intensified by the fact that the only two changes that O'Reilly had to do was to include the chapter about T-SQL from the previous release of the same book and repeat the material about the pre release 2.0 features of ADO.Net.ZA"},{"Title":"Programming SQL Server 2005","review":"This book is an easy-to-read tutorial on many of the new features of SQL Server 2005. It covers the expected topics, such as T-SQL Enhancements, HTTP Endpoints (Web Services), CLR Integration, and the XML data type. I was pleased to discover, however, that it also does a good job of explaining the often left-out features such as SQL Server Management Objects (SMO), SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), and Analysis Services. (There are three chapters on SMO alone!) There is even a chapter on using SMO to program the SQL Server Agent service. That's an extra that I haven't seen before.One of the things that I really liked about this book was the writing style. Reading it didn't feel like a chore. I wound up reading a bit of it each night after work, in order to relax. This is fairly unusual for me, as I typically get more than enough exposure to SQL during the day.I was quite pleased with this book. I am a Microsoft Certified Trainer, and have been teaching classes on SQL Server 2005 for over a year. Therefore, I've seen numerous books and classes on SQL 2005. In my mind, this book stands out from the pack."},{"Title":"Programming SQL Server 2005","review":"As a new student to the field of SQL Server 2005, I was hoping to obtain a book learning the various methods of programming in SQL Server 2005. I was initially hearted by the first paragraph in the preface:\\"You don't need to be an experienced SQL Server 2005 programmer to use this book...\\"which is indeed the case if you intend to use it as a paper weight.The book suspiciously looks like the syntax guide found in most MS products: the procedure name and inputs followed by a description of the inputs. It is not for the beginner/intermediate learner and is somewhat of a disappointment comming from the O'Reilly range (\\"SQL on SQL Server 2005\\" is an excellent counter point to the book being reviewed from the same publisher). This book serves mainly as a reference (which on page 7, it clearly states that it is not a reference) to new doctrine in the SQL Server evolution."},{"Title":"Programming SQL Server 2005","review":"This book provides a clear, concise walkthrough about programming all aspects of SQL Server 2005. Numerous code samples are included that can be downloaded from the O'Reilly web site. The book contains excellent coverage of programming CLR routines, XML support, native Web services support, and SQL Server Management Objects (SMO) (which replaces DMO). I also found the sections about topics such as Notification Services, replication, Reporting Services, and Integration Services helpful. These topics are new to me and I now both understand them and have been able to program solutions.As a previous reviewer correctly mentioned, this book only covers new T-SQL features. I actually prefer this since I already know T-SQL (and there are already a lot of good T-SQL books available). The coverage of new T-SQL features is complete and the examples are good.This book includes an appendix that explains the new features of ADO.NET 2.0. The writing and examples are clear and helped me understand the changes and enhancements. It's great that the author chose to include this since programming ADO.NET 2.0 is related to programming SQL Server 2005 but not the same thing at all.Finally, I really like that this book does not simply recycle MSDN content, but rather complements it. There is enough reference material in the book to support the discussion and examples. After reading the book, you'll know enough about programming SQL Server 2005 to quickly find any reference material that you need in MSDN."},{"Title":"Programming SQL Server 2005","review":"This is a very good book. It is quite compact and does not waste time and pages on huge examples that would not make any sense at the end. The only issue, at least for me, is that it includes only the new features of the Sql Server. As a result if you are a beginner with SQL Server you need to buy an introductory book before you read this one."},{"Title":"Programming SQL Server 2005","review":"This book covers nearly all topics on SQL Server programming. It begins with the differences between the SQL Server 2000 and 2005. 2005 has new tools (SSMS, Profiler, BIDS, command line), data types, xml support, and .NET integration. Chapters 1-4 go over these topics in turn. The next series shows the reader how to program using the Visual Studio IDE, deal with XML programming, and web services (Chaptes 5-8). Chapters 9-14 are on programming SQL Server management and reporting tools plus interfacing with the objects exposed by SQL Server through .NET. The remaining chapters are on programming services: SS agent, intergrations services, broker, notification services, and analysis services.The book is quite thourough and has a large number of examples, code, and pictures for each topic. The book is generally easy to read and well indexed. Programmers will feel right at home with all the extra help provided by the book.Folks who have no programming experience of any kind will likely struggle with the information in the book. Basic SQL is shown but not explained. It is clear the book is meant for people programming and/or automating SQL Server topics rather than just running basic queries. That being said, the chapter on XML was very helpful even from just a querying point of view. Using XML as a bulk load technique was particuarly useful and turned out to be very fast when loading text based data to the server. Querying XML data was covered by using both FOR XML statements and using XQuery type statements. The chapter sovering SSIS was also very useful as there is not much material on SSIS yet.This book is a must have for SQL Server DBAs, programmers, and professionals."},{"Title":"Programming SQL Server 2005","review":"'Programming SQL Server 2005' by Bill Hamilton is a nice book, but the title is a bit misleading (in a sense). When it says '2005', this books MEANS 2005. For a book that says \\"Programming\\" in the title, I would expect a thorough examination of discussing the old AND new of SQL Server, but this text decides to focus on the new gadgets and abilities that the 2005 generation provides, without focussing specifically on the existing programming features/abilities.At nearly 600 pages this book sounds like it's a good amount of material, but for any book that says programming and with a topic so diverse, I would expect more.If you are looking to find out more about what SQL Server 2005 provides, create some applications that talk to your database server using the Visual Studio 2005 suite and get up to speed, this is a nice resource, but I cannot give it 5 stars as it just doesn't jump off the page for me like I would have hoped.**** RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Programming SQL Server 2005","review":"Having never written C# or C++ or DMO, I was able to quickly read parts of this book and successfully create a C# program using SMO/RMO to create my transactional / merge replication republishing environment.

Though not quite as good as Heilbroner in the story-telling department, Fusfeld is better in the area of breadth. &quot;The Age of the Economist&quot; covers a wider range of thinkers right up to the present. Also following Heilbroner, it makes an admirable attempt at fusing together the intellectual, sociological and economic influences shaping the thought of various individuals, schools and movements through time. This is a difficult, but essential task to perform in an introductory text, not least because it impresses upon the uninitiated the importance of taking account of the many and various influences upon the history of economic thought.

I skimmed the cover of the frst one, wasn't too pleased with it, and stuck those books on my bookshelf. A few days later, I took those books, read the covers, and put them in the order that I wanted to read them. The first one, terrible; the second one, even worse; but the third left me speechless. I knew I HAD to read it. A Candle in the WInd was in that stack. A Candle in the Wind was the third book.I dove right into the Minzunos world, delving deeper and deeper with each paragraph. I explored their feelings and reactions to the murder and at times couldn't believe that so much betrayal and tragic could happen, but then I remembered, it does happen.A Candle in the Wind is an exemplary book that showed me, and can show you, what life really is like when you look at it through a victim's eyes.Hate is bad.

Terri can be any one of us, at any time, and it's unfortunate that it took a tragedy to happen for her to find out who her friends really were in her life.

That's why I bought it.But...It was completed in August of 2000, and so was published before reality set in on the many technologies and companies used as case studies here. I feel that I should have known to avoid a book claiming to reveal the \\"silver bullet\\" for KM and e-commerce. I already knew from first-hand experience that there is no such thing. (That is my experience-based bias.)Fensel is guilty of the worst of the hype that was common during the e-commerce boom. For example, in naming companies who have brought ontology-related products or services to market he repeatedly cites revenue and market size numbers which have no bearing or relevance on the quality of the technology or applications (but only on the extent of the hype and the ignorance).The companies and on-line marketplaces cited here are either a small shell of their former selves, or are gone completely. The many ontology \\"standards\\" cited are not standard at all, but just proposed standards which have few if any viable commercial applications.The reality is that ontologies and semantic technologies in general are still very hard to deploy successfully -- and it will likely remain that way for some time to come. It appears as if ontology standards activity has stopped. (As of April 2002 for example, the ontology.org site hasn't been updated since August of 2000.)The book is short and does not cover the subject in much detail. Still, it provides an overview and perhaps a few ideas for those who are working hard on the long, slow path to successful deployment of technologies based on imbedded semantic knowledge.There are no secrets to success in this book. I don't know what the opposite of a \\"silver bullet\\" is, but that is what you will find here.

This allows agents to share a partial understanding of the domain of discourse and still respond intelligently to requests. It has also been observed that the acceptance by the people outside the knowledge representation (KR) community is critical to the success of the Semantic Web.Dieter Fensel provides the first pragmatic and comprehensive approach to using ontologies on the Web in his book &quot;Ontologies: A Silver Bullet for Knowledge Management and Electronic Commerce&quot;. He presents one of the most exhaustive surveys of various ontology based knowledge representation techniques in light of their applicability to the web based information interchange.Dieter Fensel examines the applicability of the two new web standards (RDF and XML) for machine understandable web data in constructing ontologies. He also discusses first order predicate logic languages (CycL and KIF), frame based logic languages (Ontolingua and Frame Logic) and Description Logic.The book holds appeal both to those within and outside the knowledge representation community.

This book systematically introduces the idea of ontologies and shows clearly and in detail how to apply this conceptual framework for enhanced Internet-based e-commerce and improved Intranet retrieval of corporate information and knowledge. The notion of ontologies first gained acceptance outside philosophical circles among those working on the Semantic Web as a means to enable agents to reason about Web content and provide sensible responses to unanticipated situations. Fensel provides a thorough survey of a range of ontology-based knowledge representation techniques in terms of their applicability to Web-based information exchange.

The author was the first one to elaborate and actually write down the idea of using semantic annotations to build better systems of the web. The fact that he mainly refers to the Ontobroker system is mainly due to the fact that at that there were almost no comparable systems around.The importance of the book for the development of a semantic web becomes clear when we look at the last chapters. The description of the OIL language and the rational for its development foudn here can really be considered as the starting point for work on web ontology languages that is now even being supported by W3C.Summarizing I think that this books marks an important step in the development of the Semantic web.

A. Henty)","review":"\\"With Wolfe in Canada\\" or \\"The Winning of a Continent\\" by G.A. Henty.First of all, historical fiction is probably my favorite genre of writing. So far I have not found anyone like G.A. Henty with the ability to tell a tale like he does. I have read as many of his books that I could get my hands on. They are just plain hard to put down once you get started; that is if you are a fan of historical fiction like I am. Henty's stories typically revolve around a central \\"boy hero\\" character during a pivotal period in history. This \\"boy hero\\" character usually ends of accomplishing some pretty amazing (though not unrealistic) feats by the end of the story.Henty lived during Queen Victoria's reign and literary critic Kathryn Castle put it well when she said: \\"Henty...exemplified the ethos of the new imperialism, and glorified in its successes\\". He was a very strong supporter of the British Empire all of his life. Henty had some pretty amazing adventures of his own during his life, such as the Crimean War, the opening of the Suez Canal and the California gold fields to name a few.\\"With Wolfe in Canada\\" is a story that is centered on the French and Indian War of 1754 - 1763. This war was really the American theater of the Seven Years War. The \\"Wolfe\\" in the title refers to General James Wolfe the commander of the British expedition to take Quebec.The tale begins where \\"James Walsham\\", the main character, began his life; in Sidmouth, England, born the son of a country doctor who died when he was quite young. It tells of his growing up here in some detail, and of the surroundings that made up the life of a common fisherman in that day.James's mother, a school teacher, had wanted him to follow the profession of his father and become a doctor, but this was not meant to be. As James had deep love for the sea ever since he was a young boy, he naturally was around fisherman and the sea in general quite a bit. This may seem rather obvious as Sidmouth is a coastal town.It turns out that he becomes involved in a smuggling operation and is pressed into the service a British warship. Don't take this as a clue that James had turned \\"sour\\". In those days smuggling in that region of the world was not really looked on as major crime by the locals, and most of the people were in sympathy with the smugglers. The British government certainly did not think so and the law was strictly enforced by the \\"revenue men\\". James time of service on the warship is what brought him to America, and on his discharge there he decides to join General Edward Braddock in an expedition against the French. The main bulk of the story involves his adventures during his time as a scout in America, but also involves a fascinating tie with circumstances back home in Sidmouth involving some competition for his \\"girl\\" Aggie, someone that he had grown up with. Also woven throughout is the treachery of a Richard, the nephew of a friend of James's back home who was jealous of James accomplishments.Overall, \\"With Wolfe in Canada\\" is a very compelling novel that is very historically accurate and provides the perfect balance between a fictional story and the true events of the French and Indian war. It is well worth your read.G.A Henty, Blackie & Son, 1886Preston/Speed Publications, 1999[Wikipedia.org/G.A. Henty]"},{"Title":"With Wolfe in Canada: Or the Winning of a Continent (Works of G. A.

It is enjoyable as well as informative."},{"Title":"The Culture of Ancient Egypt","review":"Wilson's book is now a half century old. In its time and for quiet a while, it was the standard one volume text. But time, archaeology and knowledge marches on. Wilson is certainly a good read and for the study of Egypt an important one, but much has changed in the field. I mention only the emphasis on hydrolics as a conditions factor of Egyptian life, and our increasing understanding of the interrelationship between Egypt and Africa, as examples. Many points covered by Wilson have also seen new theories and ideas emerge and be accepted. Read with historical understanding of the field of Egyptology and caution."},{"Title":"The Culture of Ancient Egypt","review":"This volume was first published by the University of Chicago Press, as \\"The Burden of Egypt\\" (Oriental Institute Essay, 1951). The title, as revealed by an epigraph, was from the King James Version of Isaiah 19:1, and means \\"The Message Concerning Egypt.\\" The 1954 Phoenix Paperback edition from the same publisher, in very slightly different form, was given the rather dull, but more informative, title of \\"The Culture of Ancient Egypt.\\" (I am not sure how closely the Kessinger reprint, in hardcover and paperback, follows the pagination of the original.)This title change was perhaps just as well -- by the 1960s \\"The Burden of Egypt\\" was being listed in some textbooks on Middle Eastern history among books about British rule in Egypt, presumably by people who didn't think to look beyond the card catalogue, and certainly didn't catch the biblical allusion.One could indulge in interesting reflections on the generational differences in Biblical literacy involved in the title change. More pertinent is the fact that the \\"Oriental Institute Essays\\" (the others being Henri Frankfort's \\"Kingship and the Gods,\\" and the collaborative \\"Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man\\" -- also published, shortened, as \\"Before Philosophy,\\" with the sections by Wilson, Frankfort, and Thorkild Jacobsen) were exercises in very high-level popularization, with enough substance to interest specialists.Wilson had a busy career as an Egyptologist, and as director of the Oriental Institute during the difficult years of the Great Depression. He definitely belonged on the language side of Egyptology, rather than the archeological; his associates have reported that his favorite self-description was \\"a grammarian.\\" (Most of his fieldwork seems to have been in connection with the early years of the Oriental Institute's Epigraphic Survey, still in progress.) He was also (as the second title indicates) more interested in understanding the underlying concepts of Egypt civilization, as against expounding a detailed political history. (The latter, as he often observed in his later writings about Egyptology, produced unfortunate disputes, often based on incomplete data; see his \\"Signs & Wonders Upon Pharaoh: A History of American Egyptology,\\" 1964, and \\"Thousands of Years: An Archaeologist's Search for Ancient Egypt,\\" Scribners Scientific Memoirs, 1972.) His version of cultural history, however, was alert to the roles of wealth and power.\\"Burden\\" / \\"Culture\\" is based squarely on his own detailed knowledge of Egyptian writings, and illuminated by well-chosen examples of Egyptian art. Since he was dealing with some demonstrable constants of Egyptian intellectual life, from the Pyramid Texts to Hellenistic times, most of the book probably needs corrections mostly in fine detail (if at all), and, where later textual information warrants it, in his translations. The only obviously obsolete passages are some of his comments on the geology of Egypt, and the hydrology of the Nile, and his whole discussion of the fascinating Amarna episode (Akhenaten, Nefertiti,and Tutankhamun), which seems to undergo wholesale revision every five or ten years. (Wilson himself revised his opinion on some points.) Absolute dates for less controversial episodes and reigns are also subject to correction (the Oriental Institute has published a long series of studies of Egyptian chronology and Egyptian calendar systems).I can't claim any Egyptological credentials for this view -- it is just a conclusion reached after comparing Wilson's account with works by qualified Egyptologists published in the last thirty or so years.Besides new copies of the paperback edition, and a hardcover incarnation under the same title, Kessinger reprints, and various used copies of both \\"Burden\\" and Culture\\" from dealers, available through Amazon or elsewhere, the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute has issued free pdf versions of both titles, available as \\"Miscellaneous Publications\\" on their website. These are a little awkward to use -- nothing is interactive about them, and the digital page numbers are not \\"logical\\" (i.e., they don't correspond to the page-numbering of the print edition). Still, the price is always right, and the book is not so long or so complex in layout that reading the pdf becomes another type of burden.[On the day this review was posted, the Oriental Institute put up another large set of \\"Miscellaneous Publications\\" (their category) in pdf, including \\"The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man: An Essay on Speculative Thought in the Ancient Near,\\" by H. and Helene A. Frankfort, John A. Wilson, Thorkild Jacobsen, and William A. Irwin. Originally published in 1948, it represents much of the conceptual background in which Wilson was working. Penguin Books issued a shortened version (without Irwin's \\"Old Testament\\" material) under the title \\"Before Philosophy,\\" which for decades was the form in which it was best known. The pdf is the full version, with revised select bibliographies from from the paperback edition of 1977. It goes well with \\"Kingship and the Gods\\" and \\"The Burden of Egypt,\\" ]Some readers will be interested in seeing more of the the ancient texts Wilson quotes, and perhaps wonder if he had been picking and choosing convenient examples to fit his theories. In fact, Wilson had, for a couple of decades, been translating key Egyptian texts for his own use, and only quoted from some of them in \\"Burden\\" and \\"Intellectual Adventure.\\" A fuller set appeared in James B. Pritchard's \\"Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament\\" (1950, revised 1955; expanded edition 1969), most commonly referred to for decades as ANET.Wilson's total contributions amount to a fair-sized anthology on their own. Unfortunately they were not well-represented in the the paperback selection of \\"The Ancient Near East: An Anthology of Texts and Pictures,\\" (1958; later re-leased as \\"Volume 1\\") or in \\"The Ancient Near East, Volume 2: A New Anthology of Texts and Pictures\\" (1976). Indeed, the latter intentionally only included material added in 1969. The pictures, which included some interesting Egyptian material, came from \\"The Ancient Near East in Pictures Relating to the Old Testament\\" also edited by Pritchard (1954; with supplement, 1969)All of these are officially out of print, but in 2010 Princeton University Press issued a complete, but re-ordered edition, of the material in the two paperbacks, re-edited by Daniel E. Fleming, as \\"The Ancient Near East: An Anthology of Texts and Pictures\\". This is available and the paperback edition is at a reasonable price, figuring in the current (January 2013) Amazon discount. It is still unrivaled for expansive coverage, although the contents are anywhere between fifty and thirty years old; in Wilson's case, as noted, sometimes older still. There are also many unfortunate cuts in the included material from the 1958 volume. So I can't give it an unqualified recommendation.Wilson's translations were frequently cited for decades, and are still informative, and strictly from that point of view a library copy of ANET is worth consulting. However, the Egyptian texts are exceeded in coverage by Miriam Lichtheim's three-volume \\"Ancient Egyptian Literature,\\" which is itself somewhat aging (1973-1980; re-issued 2006, including a Kindle edition). Less comprehensive, but also less dated, is W.K. Simpson et al., \\"Literature of Ancient Egypt\\" (third edition 2003), which has received a number of reviews (including one of mine), several of which are interesting and informative. It, too, extensively overlaps with Wilson."},{"Title":"Access VBA Made Accessible: A Complete Course on Microsoft Access Programming (Visual Training series)","review":"This book is really a CD with some 1323 PowerPoint slides on how to program VBA on Access.

Lee.\\" - from the back cover.The two most important rules when writing a good historical mystery are to get both the history and the details of the setting right. In her new novel, *Duty, Honor, Murder,* Author Pamela Cummings succeeds in the above so spectacularly that you'll swear she must have lived through the tumultuous decade leading up to America's Civil War. Another element that always helps spice up a historical mystery is utilizing a major historical figure in a supporting role. For this Cummings chooses Robert E. Lee, whom in the early 1850s served as the Superintendent at West Point. Cummings is carefully sparing in her use of Lee as a character, giving him just enough to do to avoid demystifying his legend.The main protagonist is a young, newly minted instructor at the academy, Second Lieutenant Garet Morgan. Not long after Morgan's arrival, a legendary engineering professor, the detestable Captain Edgewick, is found floating in the nearby Hudson River. When Morgan finds himself suspected of Edgewick's murder, he teams up with the other prime suspect, an aristocratic Southern cadet named Lambert Gardner. Assisted by Gardner's intellectual sister Elizabeth, the pair probe into Edgewick's death in order to clear their names.In addition to providing plenty of rich historical details, Cummings has created a challenging murder mystery with enough twists and turns to keep the reader guessing until the very end. She possesses a keen understanding of the military mindset, which is vital when writing about the internal workings of the Army academy. Her characters are quirky and well drawn, and in the context of the story quite believable. Lingering in the background are the issues (slavery, the growing North-South split) that were tearing the country apart. Above it all stands Lee, whose very presence lends the story a weight it would otherwise lack.Overall, *Duty, Honor, Murder* is an excellent historical mystery that will be thoroughly enjoyed by both history buffs and anyone who likes amateur sleuth tales.A Futures Magazine book review"},{"Title":"Britney Spears Is a Three-Headed Alien","review":"While the title of the book may make you turn away, the content is amusing and you just don't want to put the book down.

It is at the same time a history of language, a guide to foreign tongues and a method for learning them. It shows, through basic vocabularies, family resemblances of languages...Teutonic, Romance, Greek...helpful tricks of translation, key combinations of roots and phonetic patterns. It demonstrates that it is as easy to learn several languages at once as it is to learn one; it condenses vocabulary to a minimum of essential words; it simplifies grammar in an entirely new way, and it teaches a language as it is actually used in everyday life rather than in the abstract manner of textbooks.(...)"},{"Title":"THE LOOM OF LANGUAGE - A Guide to Foreign Languages for the Home Student","review":"A good reason exists why The Loom of Language, first published in 1944, is still in print. It remains one of the best overviews of Indo-European and Near East languages to date. While a basic grasp of linguistic tools will help, the reader essentially only needs an understanding of English grammatical rules to get through the book. The explicit goal of The Loom of Languages is to introduce readers to a broad range of languages, language timelines, language roots and the tools necessary to understand a wide variety of linguistic patterns so as to learn new languages. The greatest asset of The Loom of Language is that it never strays off track. The authors carefully, consistently marry one chapter to the next. This is no dry linguistic workbook either; the authors take the time to explore the history and culture behind various languages, peppering the work with colorful anthropological anecdotes.If one fault could be listed with The Loom of Languages it would be that a muddy xenophobia trickles into some of the chapter as witnessed by this comment concerning the lack of Greek and Latin language influence in the Eastern Europe of antiquity: \\"The comparatively late appearance of loan words in the Slavonic lexicon faithfully reflects this retardation of culture contact with more progressive communities (page 419).\\"Modern day readers unaccustomed to the cultural proclivities of earlier linguists and anthropologists may find the repetitive use of words like \\"Aryan\\" or \\"high culture\\" unsettling. That said, the nitty-gritty of the data (with a few exceptions) in The Loom of Languages remains unadulterated and essentially informative.

However, its flaws are that it doesn't take into account the predominance of Greek roots comming into common usage through scientific terminology, not Latin roots that many of the other attempts use. It doesn't respect the widespread knowledge about English even in Asia and neglects the need for a simplified lexicography.

One may argue that nothing really new is presented and it fails to engage present day discussions, but the way Stevens explains his position is so clear, consistent, and concise so as to gain a much better understanding of traditional doctrinal concepts to help me better articulate NT teaching.

The Appendices and Suggestions for Further Reading are an added bonus."},{"Title":"Going to the sources: A guide to historical research and writing","review":"The chapter on how to use a library is worth the ten bucks all on its own. It is exactly the kind of overview of research materials and their use that librarians give when someone bothers to ask! Overall, the book is simple, straightforward, and USEFUL. Everything you need to know and nothing you don't when it comes to writing history papers. The couple of hours it will take you to read this book will pay off in the depth and quality of your paper, if you follow Brundage's research advice. This is THE book to buy if you have never written a research paper and have never been inside your campus library before. It is written for history majors, but there are only two chapters that other disciplines would want to skip. Most of the book is helpful to anyone who wants to learn something from their assignment -- not just get it done."},{"Title":"Going to the sources: A guide to historical research and writing","review":"In his book, Going to the Sources: A Guide to Historical Research and Writing, Anthony Brundage offers a concise and informative guide on the often daunting task of historical research and writing. Throughout the book, the author maintains that history is a &#8220;dynamic and evolving process.&#8221; Therefore, it is not only important to think and write like a historian but to also &#8220;explore ways in which historians actually go about examining the past, constantly searching for fresh patterns and meanings, and developing new methodologies to achieve them.&#8221; (Brundage xi)In a style that is both engaging and accessible, the author deftly explores all aspects of historical research and writing, including, but not limited to, the history of history writing, identifying and obtaining source material, types of historical writing (research paper/historiographical essay), and a section on formatting footnotes and bibliographies. The result is a superb methodology that helps the novice, as well as advanced history student, understand the essential elements of research and writing, and the importance of creativity in interpreting and describing events of the past.What makes Going to the Sources stand out among the other instructional guides is its ability to simplify and clearly spell out a sequential step by step process to scholarly research and writing. Chapters 2-5 form the heart and soul of the book and offer sound advice on the fundamentals of writing history. Throughout the chapters, Brundage guides the reader through the elements of good historical craftsmanship - the use of historical sources (primary/secondary), selecting and refining a topic, note taking, outlines, quoting, and editing and revising.Especially useful is the historiographical essay sample found in Chapter 4. In many graduate courses, students are required to write historiographical essays; yet there are limited sources to help guide the student through this complex mode of historical writing. Although historiographical essays focus less on a particular research topic and more on interpretive themes of scholarly literature, Brundage feels, and rightly so, they are important enough to warrant coverage in this text.The author begins and concludes his book with the essence of historical creativity. Here, Brundage maintains that &#8220;our views of the past evolve as we move into the future and thus acquire an ever-changing vantage point.&#8221; Therefore, it is absolutely vital that historians continue to offer &#8220;fresh approaches, new methodologies, and revisionist interpretations.&#8221; (Brundage 88-89)Although Going to the Sources offers a wealth of tips and advice on the fundamentals of research and writing, it lacks the detailed instruction that takes one beyond the basic research paper/essay. For example, book reviews and historiographical essays - requirements for most upper level graduate courses - demand critical thinking and analysis. Unfortunately, with the exception of a brief chapter on historiographical essays, Brundage chooses to focus less on the analytical process and more on the rudiments of writing. Readers interested in analytical writing techniques would be better served with other prominent works in the field, such as A Short Guide to Writing About History by Richard Marius and Melvin Page. This book offers solid instruction and writing samples on the different analytical approaches employed by historians.The main drawback notwithstanding, Going to the Sources is an eloquently written, hands-on research and writing manual. Brundage has done an outstanding job at presenting his topic in a fresh and compelling fashion. His unique ability to make sense of the often confusing world of historical research is commendable. Although the volume is a slim one, it is packed full of information on everything you need to know about the research and writing process. The couple of hours it will take to read this book will pay huge dividends in the end. Going to the Sources: A Guide to Historical Research and Writing is a highly affordable, convenient tool for any student faced with the daunting task of writing a research paper."},{"Title":"Joel Rothman's Basic Drumming","review":"My son and I have been using this book for many months now since we first started learning drums.

With a plot taken right off Miami's sports pages, [The author, Sam Leonard] spins a complex web of greed, arrogance, desperation and good detective work as the defending World Series champions, the National League's Florida Sailfish, take some extreme measures to trim their lineup and cut salaries. The team owner, Harry Hvide, is a stand-up guy who earned billions hauling garbage and renting videos, but now he is saddled with an overpriced baseball team that loses money every year. To sell the team, Harry must get rid of Dick \\"Don't Call Me Rictchie\\" Johnson, a home-run-hitting outfielder with a $66 million contract and a no-trade clause. Johnson is also a whining, prima donna with no loyalty or morals, and is enthusiastically hated by management, coaches, teammates and fans. Greg Barrett, an associate of Harry, comes up with a private plan to put Johnson on the disabled list permanently, but he is not the only one with a reason to want Johnson tagged out. Enter Stanley Starfish, a brilliant, tenacious detective who looks like a choirboy, which is why everyone foolishly underestimates him. However, no one's plan works out as expected, and the twists and turns provide some delightful surprises. [Leonard] writes like a baseball insider, with intimate knowledge of team financing, trade and contract negotiations, player-management relations and the not-always-admirable personalities of the players. From the boardroom to the locker-room, and from Miami's South Beach to Little Havana, this is a superb sports yarn with a line-drive pace and a colorful scorecard of pampered athletes and nervous executives. (Nov. 2000) Forecast: [The author] has a good thing going here, with his double appeal to sports buffs and suspense novel aficionados. If the publisher and booksellers capitalize on the book's dual market, it could slug a few home runs. Its appearance after the end of the baseball season will present a challenge, but will also make it a good sell to those looking for something in the field to fill the time until spring.\\"Publisher's Weekly, September 25, 2000"},{"Title":"Difficult Trade, A: THE Baseball Mystery","review":"Looks like it doesn't have to be spring to enjoy baseball!

Johnson is shot outside a Miami strip club. Enter Miami Police Department detective Stanley Starfish whose investigation results in confronting some of the most powerful personalities in South Florida, and a plot of twists and turns leading to an ending that is as satisfying as it is surprising.

I have learned a lot about the insurance investigator, the team owner, his right-hand man, one or two of the ballplayers, the mistress of the owner's right-hand man. What I haven't read is anything about the actual story. The book seems like an excuse to develop 10 characters who are only tangentially related to each other. I feel like I know more about the &quot;back story&quot; than I do about the plot of this book.I am a huge baseball fan, which is what led me to this book, but so far it has had little to say about baseball, the team, or the plan to dump salary by killing the star (overpaid) player.I usually don't write reviews until I finish the book, but with this one, I don't think I have the energy to keep reading.

A tripulao enfrenta um dilema, pois alguns querem permanecer no planeta e coloniz&aacute;-lo.Antes de decises serem tomadas, eles comeam uma explorao do planeta...Os antecedentes &eacute;tnicos destes colonizadores so celtas e espanh&oacute;is, incluindo cientistas e fan&aacute;ticos naturalistas.&Agrave; medida que os anos passam sem contato com o seu planeta natal, as etnias e ideologias dos colonizadores foram se misturando, desenvolvendo uma cultura darkovana independente e distinta.

Saw the omnibus and decided that the \\"historical\\" beginning of the series would be a good place to start since I had heard many good things about the series. If you've never read either of these two novels, keep in mind they are connected in only the loosest possible way; set on the same planet. It would be like reading a book set in ancient Greece and one set in modern times. Nothing wrong with that, but if you're not expecting such a difference, it can be a bit startling.The first book was a good enough standard introduction, and had some really interesting ideas like the Ghost Wind. Very space-pioneer feeling and there was a whole lot of potential to work it into something outstanding. But it just sort of fizzled and fell short of the mark. There was a lot going on in the book's society, but nothing really *happened,* if you get what I mean. When I finished the first book I found myself really hoping the second one would pick up where the other left off and run with it, but instead you're taken to a society so different there's basically no comparison. You'll see a few sir-names you recognize, mention of starstones, and nothing else. Nothing about the ghostwind that caused the first colonists so many problems (in fact, most of the first book dealt with Ghost Wind-induced issues), and a strange reliance on Spanish-ish words. Strange considering how prominent the Celtic heritage was in the first book and that more than half the characters spoke Irish or Scottish Gaelic.More happens in the second book, but there's not a whole lot of reason why. Kingdoms attack other kingdoms without provocation or reason, people are either put-upon saints of the blackest of sinners, and there's no real motives given for either of their actions (and many of their actions are so bizarre that they need motives to be understood by the common reader). The author spends so much time making the men out to be domineering, women-haters with mommy issues then with literally one sentence, changes them into mewling kittens. Again, potential for a great read, but it's like the author did everything she could to string the reader along without delivering.In both books I was left with the feeling that I was cheated and that the author did everything in her power to wrap the story up with a bow in two pages or less, regardless of whether it fit with the rest of the book, or even made sense.I have read worse books, but I have read better, including better by this very author.

At a time when many radical theatre-types were resting on their laurels (or regurgitating works they created decades earlier), Ludlam and his constant collaborator/companion, Everett Quinton, were experimenting with new forms, keeping things fresh. Unfortunately (or perhaps not), he's been pidgeonholed by theatre historians as working exclusively in gay theatre; in point of fact, though, while his audience was largely \\"downtown\\" and therefore predominantly gay, his influence was felt throughout theatre community.That's not, however, to say he was a benevolent gay genius. On the contrary: secondhand stories about his professional habits and beliefs are enough to curl the toes of even the cruelest tyrant. That, of course, is why this book is SO enjoyable--and important. Part autobiography, part manifesto, it explains Ludlam's ideas about art, life, and theatre in his own words.

Ludlam writes about what he knows and what he loves -- the theatre.

Luna McGraw, a former therapist, a recovering alcoholic, and in the midst of trying to quit smoking is working in the floral department of the local supermarket in Taos, New Mexico. Luna's life is finally becoming balanced again when she meets Thomas Coyote, the man she's had a crush on for years, and when her daughter, Joy, comes to live with her. The story is lyrical and luscious. Samuel brings New Mexico to the reader in a way that makes you want to go there and visit if not to live.I think it's a mistake to classify Samuel's books as &quot;romance.&quot; They are more than that. But if you like romance novels (not that there's anything wrong with that), then fine. And if you don't, please try this one.

Both were excellent. In this novel we don't quite have the narrator's quirky sense of humour to cope with the terrible times in life, but in a lot of respects it is more upbeat. I love Luna and Thomas; they are a terrific couple, really HOT and Taos New Mexico is really brought to life. Her daughter is a wonderful character too and also the secondary characters Tiny and Maggie.It is not a perfect book, but it is really excellent. I read it in one sitting, just like her first. This one will not make you cry gallons, though. It is much more upbeat. The use of Maggie the teen's diary is I think the only weak part in the book, since I really wanted more of a smoochy scene with Luna and Thomas at the end of the novel. But then I am an avid romance reader. One other minor flaw is the start of the book really lurched a bit and could have benefitted from a much better editor who could pick up the niggling little errors like what time the daughter's flight landed.This book is an excellent cross over thought for women who like good fiction, and anyone looking for a book which affirms the healing power of love and the fact that god really does work in mysterious ways.

After four years of out of control alcoholic bingeing, she hit rock bottom and finally entered rehab. Now she is four years sober and her ex-husband has transferred custody of their daughter Joy to her. Luna looks on this as a second chance to be the mother that her daughter needs but she is scared that she will fail her.Thomas Coyote is a two-time loser in the divorce wars. His second wife cheated on him with his brother after they learned Thomas is sterile; now she is pregnant and married to his sibling. The last thing he wants to do is fall in love for the third time but when he meets Luna, the attraction is electrifying. Luna feels the same way but she is fighting it because she fears rejection from her daughter as much as from Thomas.A PIECE OF HEAVEN is a beautiful love story starring two scarred individuals who still have issues from previous relationships they have to resolve before they can think of coming together. The likable characters are realistically drawn, especially Joy who is wise beyond her years. Barbara Samuel has written a relationship drama that will appeal to fans of Kristin Hannah and Barbara Delinsky.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Piece of Heaven","review":"It started slow but chapter after chapter I was hooked.

In my opinion, the most remarkable thing about this book is its vivid and easily grasped depiction of the working of Einstein's intellect; how he was deeply disturbed by inconsistent phenomena which people had taken for granted for hundreds of years and how he performed ingenious thought experiments to arrive at remarkable theories that seem to contradict our very common sense."},{"Title":"The universe and Dr. Einstein","review":"While some of the scientific results stated in this book have been overtaken by the advancement of knowledge, overall it still remains an excellent primer on Einstein's work.

The combination of the special and general theories of relativity is a refinement of Newtonian physics that explained most of the special case anomalies that the physics of Newton could not.Using clear and understandable language, Barnett explains these theories without sounding patronizing or sacrificing broad detail.

Noble\\"The Universe and Dr. Einstein,\\" by Lincoln Barnett is a great book. I've enjoyed it immensely. I've now read it twice. It has an introduction by Albert Einstein verifying its credibility to the \\"lay\\" reader.Well, from one lay reader to another, I have two criticisms: One is Mister Barnett's conclusion with regards to the existence of a God: and the second has to do with a reference on page 24 to Quantum physics and \\"freewill.\\"On page 24 Mister Barnett states that because of a Mr. Heisenberg's \\"Principle of Uncertainty\\" brought forward in 1927 which hypothetically states the impossibility of determining both the position of an electron and it's velocity at the same time, man may honestly and truly be possessive of a free, undetermined will.If this seems to you to be a rather drastic jump in logic and common sense, I'm with you. What the possible randomness or even factuality of an electron's position or predictable course, has to do with Man's freewill, I'm at a loss to figure out.Mister Barnett goes on to express that the nature of probability in Quantum physics brings into question the notion of Causality and Determinism. I interpret this to mean that because the human race is at the moment unable to technically determine or predict the actual position or future direction of a particular electron, simultaneously, the Universe may truly be without direction, randomly established, and of an unpredictable indeterminable cause.I would presume that in pointing out this Heisenberg principle, Mr. Barnett would be challenging the existence of a God. This is not the case. In the conclusion Mr. Barnett uses the third law of thermodynamics, the Hubble notion of an expanding and eventually destructive universe, and Einstein's notion of the non-existence of space (an aether) as a proof of the existence of a God.So, Mr. Barnett establishes Man's freewill with the Heisenberg principle of uncertainty, and God existence via the third law of thermodynamics, Hubble's expanding and self-destructive universe, and Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. And supposedly Albert Einstein, himself, has read this book and agrees with it. Wow! I'm at a loss for words. Where do I begin?First of all, I don't think that you can have it both ways. You can't on the one hand claim that the Universe is without cause, undirected and unpredictable and that therefore man is in charge of his own destiny and totally free; and on the other hand claim that because the Universe is on an inevitable path to its own destruction, that this destruction implies a Creation and the inevitable existence of an all knowing, (non) deterministic God. How can God be in control of the Universe and not in control of Man?Freewill is an argument that has two directions. The Philosophical argument has always been with the nature of God and His relationship with Man. How can Man be free in relation to an Omniscient, Omnipotent, and all knowing God? If, as the religious and theological philosophers contend, God must of necessity be \\"actual\\" and not \\"potential,\\" how could He have then created man, with all knowledge of man, and then not in some way be responsible for Man's actions or for Man in general?The argument is, if there is a God, as defined above, then - Man of necessity must be determined. Man may have the ability to make choices, but whatever his choices, God \\"knew\\" or must know the results.The second argument with regards to man's freewill deals with his physiological and psychological makeup. Man as we now know has a genetic code (DNA). His physical structure and individual design is pre-programmed to a degree by this genetic code. It is so accurately programmed that we are now experimenting with the notion of \\"cloning\\" exact replicas of ourselves. Regardless of this new discovery, the very fact that a man is a man, or a particular thing, as opposed to \\"any\\" thing is determination enough to substantiate the notion that man is not self determining, or totally free. Because Man's choices may be indeterminant or even infinite it does not follow that Man is totally free or even possessive of \\"freewill.\\" Because a monkey is provided an infinite variety of bananas to choose from, it can not then be concluded that the monkey is possessive of \\"free\\" will or even that he is possessive of a will to choose freely. Man is limited by the fact that he is \\"a\\" man.Psychologically man is as much a formation of his learned \\"environment\\" as he is the product of his genetic code. Man is limited by what he is genetically, and also limited by what is made available to him environmentally. So man is \\"determined\\" and limited in terms of his genetic makeup and his environment. In this respect man is not possessive of a total freewill even if there is no God. God or no God man is not \\"free,\\" nor is he in possession of a \\"free\\" will.So, what does Heisenberg's indeterminate, unpredictable electron have to do with Man's freewill? How does an unpredictable electron suppose an undetermined individual man?What does Heisenberg's unpredictable electron have to do with the theory of causation?The implication seems to be that if Man can not predict the course or position of a particular electron then nothing is predictable, or he can make no predictions about anything? And therefore, since everything is unpredictable man himself is therefore totally undetermined and consequently without limits in his ability to choose - and therefore possessive of \\"freewill.\\"Does the unpredictable path of an electron have any bearing whatsoever on the atom that it is involved with? Does the course that this electron eventually chooses, have any bearing on the structure or known and predictable properties of the atom it is involved with? Does this electron's position or direction make for any changes in the atom involved? Does this electron's unpredictableness have any relationship to this particular atom's other myriad of relationships?If this electron jigs left as opposed to right is an atom of gold changed to an atom of silver? If nothing of any consequence is changed, then for all practical purposes couldn't Heisenberg's Principle of Uncertainty be placed right along side the \\"aether\\" as in Einstein's theory - in other words, of no consequence?David Hume supposedly dealt with the principle of causation a few centuries ago. But without even reading David, I am sure that he did not make the notion of causation untenable. He may have destroyed the notion of establishing an efficient cause or a primary cause, but not the notion of \\"causes.\\" Without the notion of causes, even if they be varied and multiple and difficult to pinpoint, we could establish no theories and certainly no principles or facts of nature.Without causes and our ability to determine them, we have no knowledge, nor do we have the hope of ever having any. All science and all of our accumulated theories and knowledge are dependent on our ability to determine events by studying causes. Without this little trick our search for knowledge is condemned to perpetual ignorance, and all that we now claim to be knowledge is unfounded.How does Heisenberg's theory question the foundation of causes? Isn't Mr. Barnett in fact using Heisenberg's theory of Uncertainty as a \\"cause\\" in establishing his theory with regards to Man's freewill? If the theory of causation has been challenged or compromised by Heisenberg's Principle of Uncertainty then how can Mr. Barnett establish Mr. Heisenberg's Principle as a \\"cause\\" in his establishment of his own theory of Man's freewill?What has this electron got to do with one's belief or non belief in the existence of God?A believer in God, Mr. Berkeley, for example, would simply say that whatever choice this electron makes, you can be sure that God knows about it. There is also the theological notion of spontaneous creation. This notion explains the Universe as God's work in progress. God, in effect, recreates the universe moment by moment, instant upon instant - thus not only accounting for \\"change\\" but miracles also.On the other hand from the non-believer viewpoint; is predictability of the habits or idiosyncrasies of Mother Nature a proof that the Universe has a Creator, or merely an observation that the Universe is, at present, conforming to certain predictable physical phenomenon? If certain physical phenomena are permanent, unchangeable, repeatable and infinite, would this imply anything more than the fact that these phenomena are permanent, unchangeable, repeatable and infinite. And if the reverse were the case would the conclusion be any different? To point to something that \\"is\\" and say that it \\"is\\" only because of something that isn't, is not reasonable. God is being viewed in this case as an unconfirmed suspicion or an illogical impossibility.In conclusion, with relation to God, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle changes nothing. The unpredictable Heisenberg electron neither verifies nor disproves the existence of God.With regards to causation and determinism the philosophical arguments still remain as they have always been. There are causes. Determinism is still a philosophical and theological paradox - inevitable when combined with the existence of an Omnipotent God.Freewill is not a paradox. It is confusion in terms. There is no \\"freewill\\" as such, but this does not negate man's ability to make choices or to make selections between what is perceived as either good or evil. The case for Man's genetic determinism and his psychological and environmental determinism in this regard certainly cannot be dismissed for the convenience of society and/or religion - civil or Divine Justice. The Cosmology of the Universe remains indeterminate with or without Heisenberg's wayward electron.Note: This is only one third of my complete critical review of this book.

But since they already put the psionics into the game, the Handbook kind of becomes necessary to own if you want to play through all of the game's aspects.3. Especially since at least 1/3 of the monsters can use psionics, and, as the monster manuals state, it kills the game if you take the powers out of the description.4. Also some PC's don't really care about your no-psionics opinion and will continually request you to run a game with Psi-powers.5. Unless you are a fluent learner, you will naturally be much less sure about the use of psionics than magic, as the latter appears much more frequently in the everyday world. This leads to unbalanced characters, monsters, and gaming sessions.6. So, for the synopsis, if you don't feel too sure, prohibit psionics and be happy.

This book should be a supliment for the DM for when he/she needs to know how to run a psionic monster or villian, not for the players. The only part of this book I would recomend allowing players to use would be the wild talent section."},{"Title":"The Complete Psionics Handbook: Player's Handbook Rules Supplement, Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)","review":"This book is great for AD&amp;D players and Dungeon Masters alike. However, everything you can find in this book is also found in the Player's Option: Skills and Powers book as well. Save your money for the Player's Option book; the complete psionics handbook is a waste"},{"Title":"The Complete Psionics Handbook: Player's Handbook Rules Supplement, Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)","review":"I find the very nature of psionics to be a bit alien in a fantasy game that already has &quot;normal&quot; AND &quot;priestly&quot; magic. Also, while the original game concentrated on making the magic system as far from spell-point system as possible, this is exactly what psionics is: a point-based system of magic - you get a numbered rating of exactly how much psionic havoc you can unleash.While the book is undoubtedly well-done and very professional in appearance, some of the powers seem to be a bit too powerful for the game's balance. The class of psionicists itself is perhaps the most powerful class at the high end of the clasial spectrum, and unlike its wizardly counterpart, who start out with barely any power (yes, I am comparing wizards to psionicists), mindpower users begin with an already considerable arsenal. I fear that the wells of creativity at TSR are getting a bit dry."},{"Title":"The Complete Psionics Handbook: Player's Handbook Rules Supplement, Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)","review":"This book is valuable merely for the list of psionic powers it contains. It's a fairly complete list; combined with the revised Dark Sun package and the Player's Option books, it presents a list of powers that needs no further expansion. Use the mechanic from &quot;The Will and the Way&quot; (in the Dark Sun box, or available for free online from TSR) or the Skills &amp; Powers book, though. It makes a lot more sense.Psionics don't unbalance a game if your DM addresses the issue appropriately. I've played psi characters and found it to be incredibly challenging; I've DMed for psi characters and have had no problem with game balance. The key is that the DM needs to be aware of what psionicists can and cannot do and then plan accordingly. Besides, once your psionicist is out of PSPs for the day, he's not much more effective than a mage who has cast all of his spells for the day."},{"Title":"The Complete Psionics Handbook: Player's Handbook Rules Supplement, Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)","review":"The PHBR (Player's Handbook Reference) series is one of the most highly-regarded, and yet much-maligned, series of supplements ever created. Each sourcebook takes one of the races or classes of the AD&amp;D game, and adds to it huge amounts of new detail - new equipment, spells, kits (sub-classes), lore, new rules, etc. The problem is that the players love these so much that the DM often feels compelled to buy into the rest of the series - an expensive proposition! Fortunately, these works were \\"reprinted\\" in the excellent AD&amp;D Core Rules CD-ROM. This one introduces the powerful and alien class of the Psionicist - if you are not running a Spelljammer or Dark Sun campaign, you will want to think VERY carefully before allowing this class to players! The power and versatility of these characters is amazing. Details of this book include: the Psionicist class and restrictions, a full explanation of psionic powers, disciplines, and advancement, special abilities, the powerful Wild Talents, psionic combat (a great system), the great powers (Clairsentience, Psychokinesis, Psychometabolism, Psychoportation, Telepathy, and Metapsionics), running a psionics campaign, and great monsters! It's a wonderful book - and used carefully, it will add a whole new dimension to your games."},{"Title":"The Complete Psionics Handbook: Player's Handbook Rules Supplement, Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)","review":"First off, I will say that this book is not necessary for a campaign; psionics is something you can take or leave. The book introduces the Psionicist as a character class and offers up psionic powers for use in the D&amp;D game. The powers are organized well and are diverse, interesting and useful. Better yet, you are allowed to choose the powers you want, allowing you to custom tailor your psionicist. This allows you to create an interesting character more versatile than even a mage. The big problem with this book is that while psionics are fascinating abilities, the text of the powers are, for the most part, vague and confusingly written. My D&amp;D group spent too much time trying to puzzle over how certain powers work in certain situations(example: what can hurt a character in ectoplasmic form?). This can really bog down game time as we spent too much time trying to come up with house rules and then later struggled to remember them. The whole issue of telepathic tangets and telepathic attack/defense modes got really confusing and overly complex, too. While it is better than the poor &quot;revision&quot; for psionics in Player's Option: Skills &amp; Powers, vague and insufficient wording is a major flaw of the Complete Psionics Handbook."},{"Title":"The Complete Psionics Handbook: Player's Handbook Rules Supplement, Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)","review":"Psionics: The system TSR can't get right. The First Edition's psionics system was cryptic and confusing. The CPH version isn't a whole lot better, the power descriptions being on the whole vague and the systems being unnecessarily complex. There's also the problem of power.You see, the CPH makes a big deal about psionics not being magic. That's fine until you realize that most AD&amp;D monsters with high magic resistance are completely vulnerable to psionics. Your nonpsionicist has only one defense against psionic attack -- stopping everything he's doing and concentrating. This makes high magic resistance, anti-magic shells, and the like a joke.Anyway, the CPH is like an early alpha release of an operating system -- it doesn't work very well. Maybe TSR can finally fix psionics in the Third Edition.Maybe not. What am I, a mind reader?"},{"Title":"The Complete Psionics Handbook: Player's Handbook Rules Supplement, Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)","review":"The Complete Psionics Handbook is, in and of itself, one of the most important, useful, and helpful supplements ever to be released on the market. In its pages, it not only outlines the system for Psionics use in AD&amp;D, but contains more powers and uses a better system than that outlined in the Player's Option: Skills and Powers supplement. In addition, the Complete Psionics Handbook presents this information in an easy-to-understand format. It also includes a small collection of psionic-savvy creatures, which, as a DM, I found highly interesting. Included also is a section devoted to tips on introducing psionics into various campaign settings, a section which I found most helpful. I close in saying that this handbook is an interesting addition to any AD&amp;D library and is an invaluable tool, to both DMs and players alike."},{"Title":"The Complete Psionics Handbook: Player's Handbook Rules Supplement, Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)","review":"well, where do I start, I think the Psionics class is a very interesting thing when givin to a player that would know how to handle a being with such obvious powers and abillities, but they should only be played by experianced players for it could quickly get out of hand. I do not mind if Psionics are included in my campaign, you know hell half your enemies have then, there might as well be at least one character or a good aligned NPC with the abillity to fight back on even terms. I think every DM should allow the class to be available , just in case a player would like to try one on for size, besides you gives you the DM a chance to learn how to deal with them in your worlds. And back to my summary line, how can you compaire a Psionics endowed character with a Wizard, or Mage, they may have a few similarities but they are drastically different in more ways than they are similar, well I guess that's enough out of me for now."},{"Title":"The Complete Psionics Handbook: Player's Handbook Rules Supplement, Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)","review":"Ok ill jump straight to it. Psionics using second edition rules (which is the correct way since third edition makes them nothing more then weak sorcerers) are not unbalbalancing in any way because of one very important aspect. All psionics have to be LAWFUL. That simple. They are not going to read random peoples thoughts, teleport into random rooms to steal, dominate or mind control anyone \\"just because\\". They need a good reason to do what they are doing, if they dont have a good reason then they are becoming chaotic and will loose access to their abilitys. A chaotic person doesnt have the discipline to do what a psion does.In Greyhawk, Forgotten Realms, Ebberron, amd most campagins, magic is a invicable force that affects all things in a invisable weave (kinda like the Force in Star Wars) in Dragonlance they come from the moons, and in Dark Sun they come from living plants and animals, that is how mages get there power. A psionic gets his power soley from his mind, he can do just fine in a magic dead zone.Finally psionics are not overpowered because i gurante they will not make all there power score checks when they need to, and they better have some allies there to help them. Also psionics in 2nd edition rules only have one power that can affect a group of enemys (called death field pshcyometabolics) and that comes with a great cost to the psion. All other powers are individual only, so really a 3rd level psionic has a better chance of beating a ogre then three goblins.If you have looked at second edition youll see that the powers listed are unique in the way they work, with maitnance cost and power scores needed. Third edition psionics are just a different (wearker) type of sorcerer. Power may come from the mind but it does the exact same stuff. I run 3.5 edition campaign but use 2nd edition psionics. basically you use the chart giving in the 3.5 psionic handbook for skill points, feats, save throw, etc. but for the powers you use the 2nd edition handbook. To calculate a saving throw for a target I use this formula. 1d20 + penalty to power check + main stat modifier = will power save DC.For example John the telepath is going to use psionic blast on a ogre. John has a wisdom of 18. Psionic blast is Wis -6. First he uses contact, since this power cant hurt the ogre i dont allow a saving throw (you may if you like but thats up to you) then the next round he rolls a d20. (wis of 18 - 6 = 12) he needs a 12 or lower to even activate the power. If he rolls higher then a 12 then the power doesnt even attempt to work, if he rolls lower then the power works. Assuming it works lets see if it hurts the ogre, he gets a Will save to ignore it. Save DC is 1d20 + 6 (the penalty to the power score) + 4 (wis mod). If you wanted you could just say that the d20 roll is allways a 10 (like magic works) but i find that using a random roll on every save makes psioncs feel different to.I have more to add but I think ive written way to much, if youd like to comment good or bad, go nuts"},{"Title":"The Complete Psionics Handbook: Player's Handbook Rules Supplement, Dungeons & Dragons (2nd Edition)","review":"Psionics can serve to expand a campaign tremendously; they provide just one more big twist that players can use to their advantage, and that a clever DM can turn back around on them. Being non-magical, they provide an effective counter-attack on magicians and priests alike, but PC's are obviously not the only ones with access to Psionics, and as always, any fight that a player wants to pick, the DM can win. Dueregar, Illithid, Tanar'ri, assorted Powers, just about everything on Athas, and innumerable other monsters everywhere, use psionic powers at the DM's discretion. So, if I'm such a big fan of psionics, why did I only rate the CPH three stars? The game mechanics offered in the CPH are awkward and antiquainted. Dark Sun started off with these rules, and later went on to use what are now refferred to as &quot;Players' Options&quot; rules, changing it from an odd sort of proficiency system to a more streamlined and sensible combat system with mental THAC0's and Mental Armor Class. Unfortunately, anyone wanting to use these improved rules who is unfamiliar with the brutal Dark Sun campaign is forced to buy the otherwise excrutiatingly useless Skills &amp; Powers book, or look everything up on the CR2 CD-Rom.

Psionics is a more believable system with better written and more down to earth powers. I won't play in a game that doesn't have psionics in it, nor will I run without it. This handbook is a great place to start if you haven't used psionics in your game yet, or if you're a player wanting to make your first psionic character. It's also worth noting that this is the only in print publication (that I know of) that has a concentration of psionic powers.

That's about it, but what a step! It gives all necessary rules for playing a psionicist (which is just as fun a class as any), and allows for expansion, customization, and playability. The only problem: there are no kits. A very, very small price to pay for a vast enrichment in the game. As a GM and player, I've found psionics put a certain something into the game that I've felt has been missing. To not have it would be like playing without another basic class usually available like fighter, thief, cleric/priest, or mage. If you're wondering which Complete Handbook to buy, this is the one.

Also, a March 1999 New York Times article contains quotes from the author (she says she's a college graduate and runs an investment advice website, among other things) which don't match the book's narrative.All this is fine, as long as readers know not to approach Without a Net as literal truth. At the end of the day, the book is an interesting read but the author should have included a disclaimer to let readers know the story is semi-fictional (or selectively true) in places.Readers mainly interested in social criticism or descriptive accounts of homelessness won't be very satisfied by Without a Net. It is essentially an oral history with a finding-my-true-love story layered on top."},{"Title":"Without a Net: Middle Class and Homeless (with Kids) in America","review":"This book should be titled, \\"Without Goals.\\" The author doesn't graduate from college, despite vague yearnings in that direction. She practices the haphazard method of birth control - with unsurprising results. Then, she follows her husband to a remote cabin and chooses to spend her meager earnings on feeding and caring for a team of sled dogs. She experiences years of frustration with her husband and dissatisfaction with her life, but fails to PLAN her escape - such as, saving some of her earnings so she can leave him.That she finds herself homeless with three kids is not a surprise. The only surprise is she acts stunned that it happened. This book is less of a doctrine about how easy it is to be homeless as it is a treatise on how not thinking ahead can have dire consequences.That said, she is honest with herself (and in doing so, the reader) in some areas, and the book is a fast read. Also, I got a very clear picture of living on the beach in Maine - good descriptions on her part. However, I still found myself shaking my head at such decisions such as her choosing to stash her money in her glove box rather than opening a savings account or buying traveller's checks, where the money would have been replaced if lost or stolen. She left far too many things up to chance."},{"Title":"Without a Net: Middle Class and Homeless (with Kids) in America","review":"I agree with those who said that she was NOT really WITHOUT A NET. She refused to use whatever nets were available to her.I was completely drawn in by this book, and could not put it down. At a certain point, though, I was ready to SCREAM. I couldn't understand WHY she refused to explain the situation she was in to her parents, or to others at social welfare agencies. Her stubborness actually put her children in a lot of danger, and I don't agree with readers who say she was a \\"caring mother.\\"I thought the book was trying to make a political point about our society, and about the fact that you could end up \\"middle class and homeless in America.\\" But all this book really proved to me was that, yes, that's possible if you make enough bad choices and are then incredibly stubborn about getting help. This book could be used to provide support for Republican arguments that people who end up homeless have brought it on themselves!!! I don't think that was the author's intention."},{"Title":"Without a Net: Middle Class and Homeless (with Kids) in America","review":"Without a net.This is a story of a young lady who makes a few bad decisions in life but possesses the ware with all to get though these bad decisions, accept responsibility, deal with the consequences and overcome all of this.It starts with a marriage of convenience. She marries her boyfriend not really for love but for tuition assistance Unfortunately few months later she quits school. She continues to stay married. Her husband is gone a lot of the time so she fills the void with children who intern provide her with love and give her a cense of being needed. She settles into middle class society but discovers that it's not all it's cracked up to be.Over several years she hangs on to the idea that she can make things work with her husband. They only problem is that he is not committed to her or the children. Finding herself married to a self centered man who through lack of awareness endangers the children lives. With essentially a loveless relationship with her absentee husband who when he is home is not really there, and three kids, she decides that life could be better for her children and herself.The best decision she makes is to leave the relationship, take the kids and make a new life for her self and children. At this point she really shines though her ability to overcome adversity and rises above all of the self inflicted handicaps and not only survives but conquers.As bad of a birth Father as these children had in my opinion Michele more then made up for it. Her children are everything to her. She lived in a car with her children to get them away from a father who was not capable of handling the responsibility of being a Father. She did not eat so that her children would have enough to eat. Every thing was planed around her children's needs. She possesses the ability to look at things that most people don't give a second thought to use it to help her.In the end for me this is story of love, inner strength, sacrifice and the ability to handle adverse situations through confidence, perseverance and the innate ability to survive with three children under some tough circumstances with very little assistance. The only bad decisions are the ones you don't learn anything from. Michelle learned a great deal about herself as a person, human being and a mother through these decisions so in the end perhaps they weren't so bad after all.While I am a computer technician, I work in the Human assistance field. I have heard a lot of stories that start like hers but unfortunately for one reason or another they fail. This was a wonderful feeling for me to read a story of success in this situation.This is both an emotionally interesting and enthralling read.

The author does not claim an absence of responsibility for the position she's in- and she makes some odd decisions along the way.

That is truly inspiring."},{"Title":"Without a Net: Middle Class and Homeless (with Kids) in America","review":"This was an interesting book, but I was put off a bit by the numberous discrepancies. For example, at one point the author states that they drove around exploring a lot while homeless in Stone Harbor; yet the very next page she states that she doesn't know where their money goes as they hardly drive and therefore don't spend much on gas. She also states at one point how she left her number at the pub for her husband and he didn't call, yet later when he does call, she wonders how he got her number and assumes thru her parents. There are many instances of this sort of disonnance in the book.She did have her parents as a net, and altho I do not want to be judgemental, leaving her children in a car while she worked was dangerous. She even states that at times they wandered into the restaurant (one so young as to still be in diapers); what if they had wandered into the street instead, or into the clutches of a pedophile?Otherwise a fairly intereseting, quick read."},{"Title":"Without a Net: Middle Class and Homeless (with Kids) in America","review":"This book was far more riveting than I expected, and I was compelled to finish it in about a day and a half. Michelle Kennedy's story was fascinating. Sometimes I was frustrated with her, particularly when she wouldn't tell her parents about her situation. I could understand why she wouldn't want to feel like a failure, but when you have kids, you have to set aside your pride. I gave it only four stars because this was her memoir of a time in her life when she was facing tough times, and not much of an analysis on middle-class people falling into poverty. She seemed largely unaware that there were other people in even worse situations than she was, and more focused on letting the reader know that she came from a relatively privileged background. Most people who are truly homeless do not have the option of choosing not to ask their families for help. Even the title \\"without a net\\" is a bit disingenuous, because she did have a safety net, she just didn't want to take it.It might sound like I'm being pretty harsh on the book, but it definitely earned a solid four-star review from me for what it was. It was a very compelling memoir and I was really rooting for her by the end. She was able to get me emotionally invested in the story. I just wish it wasn't being marketed as a commentary on poverty and homelessness, since that's really not what it is."},{"Title":"Without a Net: Middle Class and Homeless (with Kids) in America","review":"Kennedy belongs to the cult of victimhood. The book artlessly documents how her deliberate choices led to unwanted--but not surprising--results. She leaves college, employment, and marriage because she finds them banal. Declares it would \\"be stupid to get pregnant\\" when she isn't financially stable, yet goes off the Pill and has one child after another. A dreamer, not a doer, with delusions of grandeur, she only occasionally questions her actions. The title is a misnomer, and the book detracts from the plight of the real homeless without nets."},{"Title":"Without a Net: Middle Class and Homeless (with Kids) in America","review":"I thought this was an interesting book. It is true that I felt she was naive and made many poor decisions. It did not seem to me that she wasn't in any dire straight and it was frustrating for me that she would not seek any financial assistance from her husband. However, it was good to know that she pulled herself out of homelessness without help (even though she actually \`had a net'.) But, I did get the understanding that she is a loving mother because of her unwearied and tolerant ways toward her children. I got to see the intimacy that time can bring between a mother and her children. Selfishness is not what I witnessed. It takes strength and love to provide for your children and she took complete responsibility for them instead of shipping them away for someone else to take care of. She did the best SHE thought she could and it made for an interesting read."},{"Title":"Without a Net: Middle Class and Homeless (with Kids) in America","review":"I've been wanting to read this book for a while and I can't believe I waited this long. I read it in one afternoon-- quite a feat with three children butting in for sippy cups and more Playdough. Kennedy is a born storyteller. She writes simply and mater-of-factly and tells her story as if she were sitting in front of you sharing a cup of coffee while her children played at her feet. To be honest, I did not know if I would be able to finish this book because I felt so overwhelmed by the thought of this woman, or me, living in a car with small children. Her courage inspired me to be a witness to what she experienced. What a refreshing change from the self-indulgent, verbose memoirs that seem to be everywhere."},{"Title":"Without a Net: Middle Class and Homeless (with Kids) in America","review":"I read this book in the course of 3 days--it was hard to put down! Michelle is a great writer and she draws the reader into her story where you feel as if you are there right along with her. Although she clearly made some poor choices, there were many instances where the 'system' absolutely failed her in her attempt to make a better life for her and her children. Above all, it is a story of a mother who deeply loves her children and does all she can to make a better life for them. It will get you thinking about all the little things we take for granted (ie., daily showers, refrigerator, heat and air conditioning, beds, etc.). Really a great read."},{"Title":"Without a Net: Middle Class and Homeless (with Kids) in America","review":"I wondered about this book when I read the description, would this really be something up my alley or not? The author seemed awfully young to have this many children AND be homeless, especially given her past \\"success\\" history.I suppose the main \\"moral of the story\\" is something like \\"there by the grace of God go I\\" and is primarily about the choices we make and living with the consequences of those choices.Lord knows I have made some really stupid choices in my life, I just haven't written a book about them. Ms. Kennedy's writing style is conversational and pleasant, but not anything extraordinary.I kept waiting for this book to become extraordinary.It isn't a horrific read, as some people have suggested here. I wasn't insulted or upset by it and yet I also felt... \\"Sooooo.... Ummmm... ok...\\" and managed to read it all while sitting in a bookstore waiting for an appointment.In rereading my notes about the book I scribbled \\"Resurrected life\\" (this from the ending) moving from corporate employment to nothing again except.... well, if you want to know, pick up the book next time you are at Barnes and Noble. Don't want to ruin the ending for you."},{"Title":"Without a Net: Middle Class and Homeless (with Kids) in America","review":"\\"Without a Net\\" isn't really correct; the title should read: Would Not Ask for Help. Although I suppose it's trendier and more women's magazine friendly [note: award on book] to believe women just fall into these things and it could happen to anyone at any time. However, Michelle Kennedy had a net; she just chose not to use it. Yes, her marriage went south at an unfortunate period in her life, when she was mothering three small children. Yes, her husband's sudden Back-to-the-Earth crusade to live in a cabin in Maine off the grid was sudden and bizarre. But there were always her parents or her friends to petition for help; she chose not to tell them what was going on. She could have insisted her husband step up to his responsibilities. Instead she let him do his thing and put her kids in possibly dangerous situations (sleeping in the car, running around in a bar, being babysat by a total stranger). She could have educated herself as to her options at the Welfare Office instead of just stomping off after they refused her the specific financial help she requested. The fact is, the net was there, she just chose to walk the hire wire and pretend it wasn't. It's likely that, had her situation continued on this way into the winter months, she'd have had to get serious about locating resources. Still, one has to admire her patience, flexibility, and loving attitude with her children. It must have taken a lot of energy just to remain positive for them.The book is told in sort of journal form - the writing is rather basic and rarely descriptive. It's just Kennedy's thoughts about her situation as things change or crop up, organized only roughly and chronologically. This is nonfiction because it's a memoir of sorts, but it's not an educational treatise on homelessness by any means, or even a how-to manual. Anyone looking for tips on how to weather this particular storm will be disappointed.From a story standpoint, it's also a bit of a letdown. I've read numerous romances whose plots paralleled that of the ending of this book - woman in need meets handsome altruistic fellow with a love of children - and almost all of them were more enjoyable than Without a Net. Not because there isn't chemistry between Kennedy and her new suitor, Hogan, but because their story is so bluntly told. A more seasoned writer could have really made their romance sparkle, but here it seems more like a solution to all of their problems with a little lust thrown in.And was Kennedy's constant bad language really necessary? Very Junior High of her. It added nothing positive to the book, nor shed further light on her situation. Someone should have edited it out."},{"Title":"Without a Net: Middle Class and Homeless (with Kids) in America","review":"What a beautiful, easy to read book. I couldn't put it down! Yes, how easy it is to lose one's way in this society.

She gave of herself to her children in the most basic and giving of ways - especially as such a young woman herself. Her words are easy to digest and I feel like I know her. I want to congratulate her for not only writing such an inspirational story, but being the type of loving parent we should all strive to be - especially those of us who have been fortunate enough to have all the luxuries of life. I have always been grateful for what I have, but I hope Michelle's teachings will stay with me for a long time."},{"Title":"Without a Net: Middle Class and Homeless (with Kids) in America","review":"It is a sad statement that in America, do something stupid, irresponsible, or even reprehensible, many times you are rewarded with a book deal, a reality TV show, guest-hosting some mindless TV program or exclusive rights to their story & actually make money off it. It is even sadder that we the people seem to sometimes elevate these people to folk hero/heroine status, regarding the adversities they suffered as proof of their inner strength or something like that. This is another such case. As many have pointed out, the writer made bad decision after bad decision. And these weren't reasonable decisions that turned negative but anybody with any common sense could have seen the consequences. She drops out of college; hads 3 children by the time she is in her early 20's; marries a man who is decidedly unstable; lives beyond their means; follows her husband's insane idea of living like a hermit when he has a family; and finally moves out & starts living in her car with her children rather than ask her family or social services for help. Descending from middle class to homelessness can certainly happen, - job loss, disease...& the effect is devastating. However, reading her book, it seemed to me she never really had that wrenching feeling inside of her...maybe after living in a cabin in Maine she had gottten accustomed to a Bohemian sort of life. And that's the feeling I got, she was more counterculturish (without the political connotations) than homeless. Also it seems Stone Harbor, ME is a wealthy, touristy town with a sense of community & little crime which enabled her to live that lifestyle, & let's face it, she had a job, a car & stable, loving parents & friends (& like many others, I'm dumbfounded she didn't go to them, which strenghtens my feeling she was roughing it partly by choice, maybe subconsciously she was trying to one-up her husband). Nevertheless she did endanger her children...& I doubt she could have continued that lifestyle in Maine's winter. Of course, this wasn't an easy 3 months for her, I'll grant that, but then again, those who say \\"I could have never survived that\\" underestimate their strength; people have tremendous resilience in difficult situations. There are many 'ordinary' people who have gone to Africa or India to help the poor, the sick & the needy, & they live under far more stressful circumstances than living in a car in a safe, wealthy American town. Oh & finally how does she come out of that situation? By marrying a man (who was at that time another woman's boyfriend!) & becoming a dependent homemaker once again! I guess one can call that an accomplishment. The book is easy to read, but so shallow that it feels like a teenager's diary, easy, but doesn't really touch you."},{"Title":"Without a Net: Middle Class and Homeless (with Kids) in America","review":"Michelle Kennedy was a promising young student at American University when she married her husband Tom. After she has dropped out of college to become a full time mother, Michelle's husband decides that their family is too dependent on material things and announces that he has quit his job. He moves the two kids and Michelle (who is pregnant with their third child) to northern Maine, where they live in a rustic cabin with no running water or electricity. Michelle is determined to keep their family intact despite the increasingly irresponsible behavior of her husband, but after an accident that occurred which Tom was supposedly supervising the kids she decides that she and the children would be better off rejoining society.Michelle drives her children to the coast of Maine, where she plans to find a job and get an apartment. She finds work as a waitress, but her small hourly wage and tips are barely enough to feed her young family, let alone pay for child care and a security deposit on an apartment. Though she receives virtually no financial assistance from her husband, Michelle's pride prevents her from asking for money from her parents, so she and her kids find themselves homeless and living out of the car.Once I started this book I could not put it down - I stayed up until 2 am hoping for a happy ending. Michelle's story demonstrates how difficult it is for the working poor to survive, and how few bad decisions or a streak of bad luck could put almost anyone in the same position. This is a very moving story."},{"Title":"Without a Net: Middle Class and Homeless (with Kids) in America","review":"I thought it was just me in finding all of the descrepencies. I found myself going, \\"Wait a minute, didn't she just say the opposite?\\" So, I would flip back through to find the original spot and sure enough it was the complete opposite. As the reader wrote below I saw the same spots where the author states that they drove around exploring a lot while homeless in Stone Harbor and then on the very next page she states that she doesn't know where their money goes as they hardly drive anywhere. I also saw a spot where she says her husband never ever calls her at work and then a few pages later says how he won't stop calling her???? In a way I found the book interesting, but I feel it was almost a situation she allowed herself to be in so she could write a book. She had parents that wern't well off, but her parents would have taken her in and loved her. Her friends were willing to do anything for her. That is not true homelessness. She chose to put her kids in the car and she chose not to go for help to those that cared.

But she creates phony characters -- a colorful landlord, a physician's wife who decides to do childcare for $2 an hour, friendly cops. Baloney. This woman is half-crazy and married a man who was fully crazy. Now she's got four children and a book deal. Puh-leeze."},{"Title":"Without a Net: Middle Class and Homeless (with Kids) in America","review":"I have just finished Michelle Kennedy's excellent memoir \\"Without a Net\\" and am planning on giving it to friends to read, especially the female ones. Bad decisions happen to everyone and Ms. Kennedy honestly writes about her bad decisions and how they led her and her 3 children to living out of their car. The United States, being a country that is wealthy, has just as many people who are hungry and \\"living without a net\\" and Ms. Kennedy writes a powerful story. For those of us with roofs over our heads and food on our tables, we should be extremely thankful."},{"Title":"Without a Net: Middle Class and Homeless (with Kids) in America","review":"I was really curious about how this mother of three with a middle class up-bringing ended up homeless and living out of her car. But she pretty much spells it out for us...it's one bad decision after another and a TON of foolish pride.While I'm pretty sure I couldn't have done what she did and have maintained my sanity I'm not so sure that what she did was what a good mother would do. I understand that she felt she had to but given that that was her thought process I think maybe there is something not quite right with her thought processing. I think she was really really lucky the way that things turned out for her in the end. And lucky for her that no one reported her to child protective services.I didn't understand why she didn't go to her parents for help, she never gave any indication that they were anything but caring parents. I also thought it was surprising that she couldn't have found some resources to help her when she was homeless.Bookwise...I thought it was a quick and easy read and if you want to know how she ended up living out of her car it's all in there."},{"Title":"Without a Net: Middle Class and Homeless (with Kids) in America","review":"I read this book in 3 days! Hard to put down even at night when reading in bed and tired! Amazing what this woman did with 3 kids and how she got thru such a time. I don't even know how she lived in that cabin with her ex-husb. Maybe that helped her live out of her car?? Most would have tried to live with friends or family but she didn't want people to know and toughed it out. I'm sure there are more people out there like her that we don't know about. We only see the people who sleep on the park bench or beg for money at the over pass. She did what she had to to survive. How wonderful that her story has a happy ending."},{"Title":"Without a Net: Middle Class and Homeless (with Kids) in America","review":"Like many other reviewers, I found the author's passitivity and willingness to blame \\"the system\\" for a situation she squarely chose to put herself into maddening. Ms. Kennedy doesn't finish college (mistake #1). She has three kids in quick succession, stays home with them, and never makes an effort to get any kind of skill training for herself, or get a job, even though she knows her marriage is rocky - she just keeps depending on her husband for support, knowing the bottom could drop out at any time (Mistake #2). She passively sits by while her husband makes some incredibly stupid decisions that she knows threaten the economic survival of her family (Mistake #3). She then sits around blaming her husband for his inability to take care of the family rather than getting off her duff and doing something herself that will bring in income (Mistake #4).Then she ends up homeless and makes her kids live in the family car, because she's too proud to ask her family, or social service agencies, for help. She gets a series of menial jobs and makes her kids stay in dangerous and threatening situations so that she can make an attempt at earning a living. The worst part? This isn't a \\"down-and-out mom makes good by pulling herself up by her bootstraps\\" story. Ms. Kennedy's way out of homelessness and poverty isn't hard work - it's latching on to yet another man who will support her, and having another baby.As a feminist this book made me sick. Women ending up without resources to support themselves is absolutely the reason why the feminist revolution occurred - to give women options so they can earn a living and not end up living out of a car with their three kids. Instead, the author makes poor choice after poor choice and then seems to blame society for her dire situation, rather than herself. The bottom line is that no woman, in this day and age, is helpless to help herself and her children out of a bad situation. There are social service agencies, there are job-training programs. You do not have to rely on a man for support unless you choose to. Ms. Kennedy chose to travel the path of passitivity and inaction, it wasn't chosen for her. There are some major Cinderella Complex issues here, that Ms. Kennedy chooses to overlook. The answer to poverty isn't having baby after baby with no means of supporting them other than relying on whatever guy you're hooked up with at the time, it's getting educated and learning some skills so you can earn a decent living.I can only hope that young women in dire straits reading this book don't think their only way up and out of poverty or homelessness is latching onto a man. Because that isn't true. Women today have many options besides the \\"have a baby so your man will stick around to support you\\" scheme. It's a shame Ms. Kennedy couldn't have created her own story about success without having to resort to that tired tactic. I don't recommend this book to any strong woman who has pride in her ability to create a future for herself through hard work and effort. Because that's not what the author did."},{"Title":"Without a Net: Middle Class and Homeless (with Kids) in America","review":"If I could give this book 0 stars, I would! I bought this book, read it in a night and have never been so upset in my life. This is basically the story of a selfish, thoughtless woman who stumbles through life pulling her three children with her. Why would you get married just to get a better financial aid package ? Why couldn't she take leave of absence, work, & save up money for school ? Marriage is not supposed to be used as a convenience to more easily fund your education. You do what I did - work in the summer, work during the school year and take education loans. Then, why would you continue to get pregnant knowing that your husband doesn't seem to really be involved with you or the children ? And finally, why on the earth would you move with your three children to a log cabin in the woods of Maine with just a wood fire for heat & no running water ? Had I been one of her neighbors, I would have called Child Protective Services to have the children taken away from her - children should have adequate food, clothing, shelter and supervision which she was unable to give them. Additionally, why didn't she pursue her husband for child support so that she could have enough money to pay for the kids ??DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!

I am quite sympathetic to the homeless problem and thought this book would provide me with a little more insight as to why people are homeless and how they deal with it. The truth is that this woman was not really in the kind of dire straights most homeless people are in. For one thing, her parents would have taken her in if they knew she was living in her car, regardless of their being disappointed in her. She should have been arrested for endangering her children's lives by leaving them in her car while she worked in a bar. She could have gone to a shelter or something but she didn't even try. She preferred instead to endanger her children's lives. The \\"happy\\" ending comes when she steals another woman's boyfriend who she meets at the bar. She made every stupid, selfish choice a woman in her position could have made, and we are to feel sorry for her? The only ones I feel sorry for are her children. It's unfortunate that this woman is set up to represent the homeless. If I thought all homeless people were like her I'd say, forget them all, they're idiots. I'm just glad that I borrowed this book instead of buying it...she doesn't deserve to make money from this phony-balony portrait of the homeless. In fact, she's doing them a diservice."},{"Title":"Without a Net: Middle Class and Homeless (with Kids) in America","review":"I waited 2 years for this book to come out! I read an excerpt from the book that was published in a magazine. Having kids myself and an unsteady income I could really see how someone like myself could become homeless. What I was dying to know was how she got out of it. Therefore, I was sorely disappointed when I got the book and learned that her way out was becoming pregnant and letting someone who had a crush on her take care of her.However, I couldn't put the book down.

The ending is obvious, since she wrote the book, but I had to find out how the author got into this position and how she got out.Michelle Kennedy puts you in her shoes with her descriptions which are detailed, but not too lengthy.

Critiquing the writing of the book vs. the actions of the author I know are two differnt things, but the writing style was nothing outstanding to remark on, really.She becomes homeless from a stream of not so wise choices of her own and yes, she does what she can for the moment to make their lives livable. She succeeds in getting an apartment and a better job after about three months of being homeless.Then once she is living as a normal person in an apartment on her own, she gets a great job and starts living again...great, but it didnt last.First thing she does is move in with a boyfriend, quit the awesome paying job and gets pregnant a fourth time. Are you kidding me?This book made me crazy because the author did so many stupid things. However, that being said, it did point out to me yet again that the worst thing a woman can do for herself is allow her husband to take care of her 100%. She should have known better. What did she expect? She wasnt even doing what she wanted to do by staying home and having babies- she wanted adventure and life...yet she chose what? Living off her husband and taking no precautions against babies when she knew they werent ready for them. No wonder her husband wasnt happy. Maybe it was a differnt time, maybe not. In any case, She is the one who made the choices to become homeless. It wasnt her husband, it wasnt her parents...she walked away from bad choices she made.I have no doubt that there could possibly be a sequal to the story about \\"my homeless life and FOUR babies\\" after all she learned nothing from being on the streets for three months and went RIGHT back to living off a man, barely supporting herself and her kids, and pregnant once again. She learned nothing."},{"Title":"Without a Net: Middle Class and Homeless (with Kids) in America","review":"I didn't love this book, but it was an enjoyable read.

I have even had to go to food banks for food or figure out how to make a little go a long way. I am not homeless but the reality in today's world is that homeless could be trying to figure out how to make next month's rent or food budget.Some people think that everyone is able to get on food stamps or help whenever they can or want and that these people's income is below or in the poverty line. This is not always true. Both my husband and I make decent money but yet we have to take into account other things in order to make it week to week. This includes paying old bills and keeping up to date on others. We are unable to get food stamps or any help. We make too much money based on what the state and federal government states. I am not a victim, but people have to look at it on both sides of the coin. Just like Michelle attempt to help her family with making bread to sell and doing other things.

His latest book takes a different approach, not a reference book but more one that takes information about CSS and applies it here to real life examples, which makes it much easier for the average CSS author to learn and see how the CSS styles shown relate to what is being done on the site it affects. The book consists of 13 chapters or &quot;projects,&quot; ranging from converting an existing page to CSS, to styling a press release or events calendar, to even creating your own online greeting card. There's a companion web site, which lets you download the files to be used with each project.The book is wonderfully laid-out with lots of gorgeous color drawings and figures, which aid the reader in understanding each change. The step by step instructions are easy to follow and with each CSS code change or addition shown in red, also easy to understand and follow along with. I was amazed at the wide range of effects that can be done using CSS, as shown with each project.This book is an excellent &quot;tutorial&quot; for those wishing to learn more about CSS."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"Unlike most of the CSS books floating around out there currently, &quot;Eric Meyer on CSS&quot; gives you practical projects to work through, and apply CSS to, talking you through the whys and wherefores all the way. It takes you all the way from transforming an existing HTML table-based layout into a more streamlined structure using CSS, all the way up to bleeding edge design concepts that will be more and more feasible as the browsers catch up to web standards.I would not recommend this book to someone who has absolutely no experience or knowledge of CSS (maybe check out the tutorials in your HTML editor, or look at some of the online tutorials at Webmonkey.com before diving into this book).And, for intermediate users (you've been using stylesheets for awhile, maybe just to handle typography), I'd recommend also getting Eric Meyer's &quot;Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide&quot; for a more in-depth study of the CSS specs, though you can make it through most of the concepts presented here with just the information given with a little extra mental effort and perseverance.The writing style is conversational and entertaining, and there are clear reasons given for everything. Meyers is definitely trying to teach you to fish rather than hand you a mackeral and send you on your way.I really enjoyed that the book was in full color, and had a lot of visual aids -- New Riders is great for this.If you're interested in the possibilities of web design using CSS, this book is well worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"Like many others, I bought the book based on on-line raves. I thought it was great at first but now the blush is off the rose. The book IS a more informative and user-friendly intro to CSS than the others I have (many are &quot;look what I made, mommy&quot; books by designers...nice visuals but not the best learning tool). Some of the lessons were a struggle so, fortunately, there were the free tutorials from w3schools.com to help with the rough spots.....never thought of myself as a slow learner until now.Then, just when you think CSS will answer all your prayers, you get seriously gored by the infamous NN4 incompatibilities and then IE problems crop up.What this and every other book lacks is a decent chart reference which shows browser incompatibilities like the great cheat sheet programming cards from visibone.com BUT, I shouldn't have to buy this kind of critical tool, it oughta be a pullout or be in the appendix.Until a better book comes out, prospective buyers should go ahead and get this one PLUS Meyers Programmers Reference (ISBN #0072131780). Round it out the Visibone cheat sheets for quick reference and to keep those nasty NN4 and IE4 nightmares from giving you an ulcer. Between all this stuff and the W3C School site (PS:which also has HTML and CSS validator links and other very cool stuff), even I was able to master CSS...but it takes more books and programmer's aids."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"As an avid reader of Eric Meyer's other books I was a bit hesitant at first: I usually work with references, and as a 'code warrior' I'd rather read the W3C specifications than a nice little article about how cool it is to colour a heading.I was in for a surprise: The projects make it actually easier to see the connections between the theory and code on one side, and the results/web page on the other side.Now I have a book that entices me with neat ideas - and the images that show me how it could look. Every project leads me step by step through the process of changing a bland pure HTML page into a CSS page, and how I could change and tweak it even further.Make no mistake: this book is still full with code and theory, but Eric Meyer combines this with his typical writing style: concise, clear, to the point and with a certain lightness and wit that is in all of his writings.This is not a book for beginners, but if you know about HTML and CSS and want to do more, learn new things and prepare for the future: that book was worth the wait."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"I have been working my way through On CSS, and when I picked it up I thought I was very wise in the way of cascading style sheets. Mr. Meyers disabused me of that notion. He is an expert and by working through the examples you can really learn to make this system of styling sit up and bark. A note on the back cover says the book is for intermediate to advanced people, the note is correct. Don't buy this book if you are just trying to learn CSS at first. I think some of the disappointed buyers were too new at style sheets to get the expected benefit out of this book. Newbies would do well to investigate Elizabeth Castro's HTML For The World Wide Web by Peachpit Press and all the W3C.org tutorials out there before tackling a man like Meyers. But if you're ready for Eric, Eric is ready for you.One thing you have to remember, play with the examples after you do them. Try to break them, and don't just follow along without understanding what you are doing. If you try to follow Meyers like a cookbook you will really let yourself down. This is a great learning tool, worth the time and money investments.Another great feature of On CSS is something which you might think was a miserable drawback at first, but it turns out to be where you can get the most out of the book. The designs you end up with at the end of each chapter are C (Average) grade. Each one screams for a good designer to make them better. So when you finish each exercise, take the style sheet and turn a lackluster presentation into a Grade 1 design. Meyers invites you to play with the finished product at the end of each chapter, please do that---you earned it.So, I would also say that if you are going to get Meyers' books, open up your wallet a little wider and get Robin Williams' book The Non-Designer's Design Book. I think of her as Meyer's big sister and the two go together like XHTML and CSS (or peaches and cream for you more lyrical folk). Robin Williams is an expert on teaching good design for layout and text (and images as well). Her book is ostensibly for text, but you will have all of the best design lessons you need to style up a remarkably svelte webpage if you do what Williams says with Meyers.On CSS is a great addition to your understanding (as I am sure the second one is)--As Long As You Put In The Work And Go The Extra Mile.P.S. Both the Williams and Castro books I recommended are under $20 each and will turn into reference books to keep and go back to often."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"To those reading the below reviews with less than 5 stars...DON\\"T BUY THEIR REVIEWS. They obviously are very uninformed when it comes to designing with web standards. I have to reply to the above (Eric J. Tischler) who referred to hand coding pages as \\"the web stone age\\". This is, in every sense of the word, BACKWARDS.Although WYSIWIG editors are great time savers, they can never replace your BRAIN! Stop falling victim to the mindless \\"click and serve me\\" mentality and seperate yourself from the herd.Learn what Mr. Meyer painstakingly offers in this book.The power it will give you over layouts is immeasurable and CSS will be a vital part of the futre of web design as HTML4.0 will be relegated back down to where it belongs as structural markup only. HTML was not meant to be used for presentation, which CSS1 and CSS2 perform beautifully at.thank you and good night! (try the fish!)"},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"New Riders publishes nice looking books, but many of them, this one included, suffer from a lack of professional editorial oversight. A book that sells for $45.00 should be proofed a little more closely. The book's companion site lists dozens of editorial errors that should have been caught before the book went to press: [...]. After spending this much on a slim paperback volume, the last thing I want to do is spend an hour paging through the book, hand-correcting editorial errors that New Riders' editors should have caught in the first place.Otherwise, Meyer's command of CSS is evident, but this is not the book that it could be. The presentation is hampered by its organization into \\"projects\\", and the reader must slog through details of Meyer's application of strategies in his own projects to find ideas that can be used elsewhere.CSS is a great technology, but users are in need of something better organized, better presented, more comprehensive, and less crippled by rampant editorial gaffes."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"&quot;Eric Meyer on CSS&quot; is one of the first and only books on CSS to take a real world and hands-on-teaching approach to CSS. You will learn CSS and how to apply it to real world situations, which helps to re-enforce what you are learning. This book will guide you through a series of well thought out projects that show you how CSS and can be used to solve problems. The book is in full-color, which makes it fun to read. Eric's writing style is very approachable and conversational, which makes you feel comfortable. His tips on browser bugs and gotchas are worth the price of the book alone!You should have a solid understand of basic HTML and web design principles before you read this book. But once you are ready to learn CSS - make sure this is a book you don't pass up! In a market flooded with technical regurgitations and theoretical pontifications, it is so refreshing to see this kind of approach taken with a subject like CSS. There is just no better way to teach CSS!As a fellow author and Web developer, reading this book was not only informative but very engaging and entertaining! This book should be part of every Web designer/developers curriculum. Do I have any complaints? Nope, I just wish there was MORE of it!"},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"Eric Meyer is the acknowledged master of CSS, the new styling mechanism for the Web. His newest book, which completes a CSS book trilogy, reflects this vast experience. On the surface this book is a collection of 13 redesign projects, each illustrating different aspects of CSS layout techniques and HTML. Underneath is a philosophy, a way of thinking, and a collection of ideas. The book makes CSS look relatively easy, when in fact it's not.The projects illustrate (in full color) how to rework existing designs in CSS, from the simple to the sublime. As you're reading the book, you get the feeling Meyer isn't fighting the medium, he's working with it in almost a Zen-like way. Tables can stay and be styled or go, it doesn't seem to matter to him.Meyer works within browser bugs and limitations and shows a hack-free path through CSS layout and font styling techniques. Only in the last chapter, where he nearly recreates the layout of the book in CSS, does he resort to voice family hacks to work around browser bugs.Each of the thirteen projects has the same basic framework. He strips example designs down to pure structural HTML and builds them back up, CSS layer by CSS layer until the design technique is recreated. Everything from hyperlink styles and menu skinning, print style sheets, forms, multicolumn layouts, fixing backgrounds, and recreating the book's own layout in CSS is covered, not an easy task.Meyer's prose is also easy to take, peppered with pithy quotes and humorous headlines. The net effect feels like you are looking over his shoulder, watching and listening to him redesign web sites that will be \\"forward compatible\\" and made to last. Meyer makes learning CSS seem easy. As Jeffrey Zeldman wrote in the foreword, I don't know how he does it."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"This is a good book, but before buying it, check that you are in the target audience. It is not a reference book. It is not for complete newbies. It is not for gurus, either.It is more like a hands-on CSS training course for somebody who has used HTML a lot, knows a little bit about CSS, and who wants to make fuller use of CSS. If this is what you are looking for, this is an excellent book. It is well-produced, with appropriate and intelligent use of color screenshots, too.You will need to use some kind of reference in addition to this book when you actually write CSS for your own sites."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"If you learn by doing the examples, this is the book for you. Clearly written with extensive source code available from the net."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"This is a gorgeous, full-color, masterfully laid-out piece of work by an author with cutting-edge understanding of Cascading Style Sheets and willingness to share his fine creative judgement. Yet it may take you a while to convince yourself (as it did me myself) that you need one more Eric Meyer CSS title. The glowing reviews finally broke through my resistance, and my facility with CSS has had several breakthroughs as a result.Like many of you, I already have Eric's two premier titles for guiding web transitions from the difficult world of patched-together HTML solutions to the powerful, systematic, maintenance-friendly potentials of CSS. Here's my experience so you can see if it matches yours.Through insightful and persuasive volumes such as Owen Briggs 'C S S: Separating Content from Presentation' (see reviews at ISBN 1904151043) I finally got that *aha* experience about CSS: These new standards are more than just style sheets, design aids, and download-enhancers; more even than the sum of these: once HTML 4 standards are better followed by browsers, CSS will open up all web-design work in remarkable ways. *HOWEVER*: design life in the meanwhile is extremely frustrating while browsers take their sweet time repairing past imbedded sins. As much as I wanted to break free from old HTML ways, the inconsistencies and vagaries of how browsers render CSS so discouraged me from solving design issues with CSS, that I considered taking a two year sabbatical from design until technology caught up. I thought I was just 'losing it' until I found Eric's own statement right on my desk in 'C S S: The Definitive Guide': &quot;You may notice that, unlike other chapters, almost none of the figures in (the chapter on Positioning objects) was generated with a web browser. This is... a statement about the reliability and consistency of positioning implementations...&quot;What's the average designer to do when even Jeffrey Zeldman admits (in his preface here) that his fallback position in the current world of CSS is *emailing Eric Meyer*? In this volume we see. Eric walks you through common types of design and redesign issues are solvable through CSS (and provides frequent color screen shots displaying exactly what happens after small changes in code). It is refreshing that so much care is taken with both the design and writing of this book. Even the *hints* in margins surprise me - after I thought I had read practically every CSS hint published to date. Eric puts them together in an engaging manner.No matter how skilled you are with design or with HTML, unless your mastery of CSS specifically is on a par with Eric's (all 3 or 4 of you such people), I think that after reading twenty pages of &quot;Eric on CSS&quot; you are likely to feel you wasted valuable time each week since this book's release! Thanks, Eric. Thanks, New Riders for the time and expense to make such a quality volume. Fine work on the companion web site and downloadable code as well!"},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"Eric Meyer has shown once again that he can provide exactly what the industry needs at the time that it is needed. Now that CSS is working similarly for the most part in the top 3 browsers, this book comes with perfect timing.Meyer's previous books, such as &quot;Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide&quot;, were great. I still have several photocopied pages of that book taped up around my monitor (like the complete box model from chapter 8). I raved about &quot;CSS 2.0 Programmer's Reference&quot; when it came out; it was exactly what was needed for a DHTML programmer.This new book, however, truly brings CSS to the masses. I really like the slick, color pages used by the publisher, New Riders. I think this is finally the book that will make CSS so accessible that it will become what it was intended to be: the norm.&quot;Eric Meyer on CSS&quot; does an excellent job of drawing parallels between CSS syntax and HTML. The book presents realistic situations in a project-oriented approach. The code is broken down into step-by-step bites that really remind me of the Sams &quot;Teach Yourself in 24 Hours&quot; books. But make no mistake: this book is useful for advanced users, too. One can never have access to too many tips &amp; tricks!My first experience with Cascading Style Sheets came as a challenge from a 17 year old who in 1997 said &quot;get on the bandwagon, gramps&quot; and start writing CSS. So I opened up Notepad and started writing CSS, afterwards looking at it in Internet Explorer 3.0. That was the summer of 1997, and I was 29 years-old. My previous experience writing RTF-based Help told me this was exactly what HTML needed. But extensive use of CSS seemed slow to catch fire.In 1997-1999 I was using CSS in an ideal setting: on a company intranet where all users were using at least IE 4.01. But as I moved on to other web sites during the &quot;dot-com&quot; craze, I found that my use of CSS would be limited due to varied browser usage throughout the World Wide Web.We're now at a point with IE6/NN6 (and Opera, too) where widespread use of CSS--and advanced CSS at that--is possible. &quot;Eric Meyer on CSS&quot; is going to be an important tool in making that happen. Do yourself a favor and learn all of the CSS syntax you can from this book instead of relying only on a point-and-click GUI. There are excellent tools available, such as TopStyle, but these tools are no replacement for &quot;mastering the language of web design&quot;, as noted on this book's cover."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"As someone who understands a great deal about web design, I am usually very critical of books I read. In general, they either lack the detailed examples or the plain language that I prefer to find when I read them. However, Eric Meyer has done an excellent job in providing both. The book is broken down into projects where you are taught how to apply CSS to everything from skinning a menu to creating an online greeting card. I have always had a rather basic knowledge of CSS and let my WYSIWYG editor do most of the work, but now I have a powerful tool to do some advanced, custom work. I recommend this book to the beginner as well as the advanced designer."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"After all that I've read about Eric Meyer, I must admit I was left wanting after reading this book. The experience reminded me of certain teachers I had in college: very bright, knew what they were doing, but did not know how to effectively convey their knowledge to others. For instance, his erratic use of varying units of measure within the same CSS rule - usually without explanation - goes against most all professional design convention, making the resulting code both difficult to learn AND difficult to maintain (VERY confusing for subsequent Web technicians needing to modify the work).Buy the book - but buy it USED."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"I have a few issues with this book, and I have to admit from the start that I only worked through part of the first chapter, then gave up.1. You are forced through the learning path of working through the examples whether you want to or not.A reference book this is not, and good luck trying to find an answer to a particular question by searching the index or the TOC. You run across some good stuff just browsing, but that's not how I work best.2.If you want to learn this way, then fine, but I found his instructions for working through the examples inadquate and often confusing. For example: I read the paragraph at the bottom of the page on page 5 about 10 times and still didn't understand his recomendation for dropping cellpadding and retaining cellspacing when restyling a table layout [excepts]: \\"...CSS2 states...that margins are not applied to table cells...support for padding on table cells...is pretty good, so we can drop cellpadding. If this approach strikes you as a bad idea, yo could leave in cellpadding to go with cellspacing.\\" OK, so what should I do????3. He indicates that the book is aimed at intermediate web designers, but presents some really basic info in sidebars, such as defining \\"declaration\\" on page 6 and \\"rule\\" on page 7. [In fact, why weren't these defined in the same visual area, in relation to each other? That's when you really get it.]4. He doesn't give the adequate overviews or context for the restyles, and doesn't explain his syntax. I mean, if you don't know what a \\"rule\\" is, why would you understand why he uses an id that looks like this: td#advert and then one that looks like this: #content-top td. I knashed my teeth over this one for a while. Still don't get it. Or why use ems or percentages for fonts? He uses both, with no explanation of why, or the pitfalls.I may get more out of this book when I know more...but then I will know more, and may not need it.I do recommend the Visual Quickstart Guide by Teague: DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, 3rd edition. Easy to read, information is grouped and presented logically. Easy to find answers. This book is not comprehensive, but a good basic reference."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"I have used alittle CSS on my pages before, but Eric shows how to take full advantage and explains the benefits of implementing more CSS styles than I have ever thought possible. I have cut the amount of code on the pages by at least 20% and at the same time added more style and control to the pages.I started using some of his styles within a week of picking up the book. I was stuck in one area, I down loaded the lessons. It is the easiest way to see how the code effects the pages and what changes and additions I needed to make. I can't say enough about how easy the styles and the code are to follow with the down loaded pages."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"This is the best book on CSS, period. It is not a reference, and in fact it would be beneficial to have a reference on hand while reading it. However there is no book within miles of this one in describing the power of CSS for use in everyday web design.Most books try to list the specifications CSS with hopelessly simple examples that leave one with little knowledge of how CSS can be used to design web sites that are complex and elegant. This book shows one how to, any why it is important to, unlearn all the HTML work-arounds we have been using for years. No more transparent gif's to organize empty space. No more tables nested in tables nested in tables.Brilliant work. Now I know why they developed CSS. You cannot go wrong with this author and this book."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"If you really want to use CSS, but were put off by a lack of practical guides, then your ship has come in. If you think that perhaps this is going to be a geeky, bleeding edge trip that ignores the cross-browser question, then you're wrong. Eric Meyer does CSS that you can use now- not next year.Get it. You'll be very glad you did.-Al Sparber"},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"I wanted a quick crash course in CSS; instead this book gave me a comprehensive start that led me on a path to a solid foundation in designing with Cascading Style Sheets.Attention to details, comprehensive and professional writing style, and superior clarity are just some of the strengths of this book. I only wish that more IT books were as easy to read as this one."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"In the interest of full disclosure, I submit my bias up front: everything I've read by Eric, whether book, article, or newsgroup post dashed off to aid a complete stranger, has been clarity nonpareil. In addition, I cheerfully choose to ignore his gracious yet wholly unexpected and aberrant judgment in mentioning my name in the acknowledgements.If you are a person who frequents Internet newsgroups, listservs, and online forums related to Web work, you cannot have missed the word of mouth that is going around about this book. The praise is from all ranges of Web design experience and it is well-deserved.I don't need to outline the book's contents. The editorial reviews and the information on the book's web site do that in detail. Eric has also made the code available to people who do not buy the book. But if you just work the code, you will be missing the book's motivation, warnings, tips, advice, colorful layout, and wit that make the code pop.Eric, right from the outset, shows you how to combine both elementary and advanced style techniques. He leads you to do this in such a natural, seamless way that at different stages in each project you realize with a start that you just worked a bit of magic!A long time ago, working in a huge factory in Pittsburgh, I tagged along as a helper to a mechanic who was massive and muscular. I fully expected prodigious feats of brute strength from the man. None were to be seen. His favorite saying was &quot;If you have to use force, you must be doing something wrong.&quot; Eric calmly cuts through the clutter and makes it all look easy with just that spirit.I want to make an appeal to those Web workers, such as myself, who code exclusively for the Internet Explorer browser: from time to time Eric will invite you to follow along in another advanced browser, such as Mozilla or Netscape 6, to see effects not yet supported by IE. You will richly profit from the opportunity. By the time future versions of the Microsoft browser support the standards that Eric is showing, you will be way ahead of the game.&quot;Eric Meyer on CSS&quot; is destined to be on the must-have list of *everyone* who wants to stay ahead in this ever-changing Web game."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"Had the book about a week now, as a novice I was worried when I read the intro. and who the book was intended for. All I can say is that the book is suitable for relative beginners, it provokes excitement, wonder and amazement. I found the book mentioned in the Project Seven Newsgroup so a big thanks to everybody who mentioned it, and last but not least, to Eric for a great read."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"This is an outsatnding book. Unfortunately it turned me into a css geek for a few weeks and I had to rebuild my company web site from scratch.the flip side is that I now have a full featured e-commerce site with nary an html table in sight."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"Wanna learn CSS with a beautifully illustrated, simple, and technically accurate tutorial book? Look no further! Eric and the review team have crafted a wonderful book on CSS.Why would you buy it?1) CSS is the next step up in web design. It's fluid, flexible, can make your pages load faster, and can be MUCH easier to work with than screwing around with tables and placeholder images.2) It'll make your page more appealing to people and search engines.3) This is a tutorial book. You can get a reasonably good handle on CSS if you are not already an expert.4) It not only walks you through the exercises in words but presents visual representations of what your example pages will look like.5) Lots of books accomplish #4 to some degree but this is an oversized color volume, which makes it much easier to work with.6) New Riders makes good stuff. They are consistently one of the best publishers along with O'Reilly and this book is no different.There is no \\"quick reference\\" in this book for all the CSS markups you will learn in the tutorials and the index could have been a little bit better. There were a couple little things that didn't seem to work perfectly, but 99% of the time the exercises turned out perfectly. Other than those few things, this book is about as good as it gets.In the nature of fair disclosure, New Riders provided a complimentary copy of the book for review a couple of months ago. It has gotten and will continue to get plenty of use."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"The book is basically a cookbook on converting an existing table based web-site to a combo table/CSS format. After going through the first few chapter I realized a person would not learn much from this book. There is much better books on CSS on the market. Avoid this one."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"I initially checked this book out at the library and then later bought it. It's interesting but not that great. There are more than a few pieces missing from Mr. Meyer's explanations and, as he openingly admits, for someone not appreciably already well versed in CSS, the content can be quite confusing.He's has a lot of useful snippets and ideas but, as far as working through the exercises step by step--well, there's a lot of proofing work that still needs to be done. Too, he makes a lot of grandiose assumptions--I'm sure this stuff is obvious to him but the underlying logic behind much of his styling is poorly explained. Too, sections such as project 3 on formatting a calendar I found to be only marginally understandable. Case in point, he jumps right into defining a hodgepodge of multiple classes, which are, at best, over kill, assuming the reader is already thoroughly well versed in object-based theory.Overall, it's still a good book but, as other reviewers have pointed out, \`it ain't no reference text.' If your looking for some interesting concepts and approaches, there's lots it has to offer. If you need straightforward explanations of syntax, structure, nuts-and-bolts types of stuff, I'm sure there are better text out there."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"Awesome learn by example book IF you already have a little background in CSS, and even then if your knowledge is elementary you might be lost on some of the finer points. If it had a little more theory and explanations it would be a killer book, but I guess Eric Meyer didn't have patience enough for that. He is anyway a Master in CSS styling, no doubts about that, and the right author too look at for learning and inspiration. The book is structured around several projects that you see in the various developing stages from beginning to end in reasonably small steps. The explanations of what's going on are like what you would expect from a guru/designer/artist that is, far from complete and basic. Again is like you had the chance to peek over Eric's shoulder while he works, but he won't be bothered to lose too much of his time after you. But don't get me wrong, this book is a must have for anyone interested in CSS, even if I would not buy it now (it starts being a bit dated) but would wait for his next book that should come out this autumn."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"Meyer is the go-to guy for all things CSS, and this book is ample evidence of that. If you ever needed to know anything about CSS (and/or need a handy desk reference instead of constantly Googling or visiting AListApart.com), look no further. While those with a few years' worth of CSS under their belts already will find some of the content a bit slow and basic, you can't beat this for a first-class reference guide when you're stuck or need to double-check your compliance. This book is comprehensive, thoughtfully written and, above all, useful."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"Make sure you kow what you are doing before you pick up this beauty. Its not for the CSS beginner, but is perfect for the web developer who is really only looking for answers.Its format is sort of recipe-like in that he guides you step by step through some very specific types of projects, but you can certainly adapt the lesons to do your own thing.Since Eric is a bit of a CSS purist, he doesnt really cover hacks and work arounds for the various browser incompatibilities, and the screenshots are all on Netscape on Mac. I noted that in a few places my IE 6 on Win XP didnt render exactly the same way.Beautiful 4 color layout - but why did they make the images so small?Despite the couple of little issues I had with the book, this may be the best CSS book ever written."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"I found this book to be extremly useful. A step by step manual of CSS and how it works with over 20 great examples to learn by. For someone looking to learn more about CSS and it's abilities, this is a great beginers book."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"This book helped me learn CSS the professional way. This is the only book I've been able to use for a considerable period of time in comparison to other CSS books in market, for developing web pages. The only cons was that it took time for me to know the author's style of explanation!. Once that was cleared, it helped me to a great extent."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"Santa left this gift for me after watching me struggle with CSS. I've got a few CSS books and they've been helpful, but going through this book, using the accompanying website and working through the projects, \\"I got it!\\" And since it helped me so much, I've just odered the author's follow-up, More Eric Meyer on CSS. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"Being in the IT industry, mostly web based, I thought I would give this book a try to see what new material I could learn and apply in my job. Anyway, it was a disappointment. The book doesn't really explain anything but walks you through on changing from a non CSS site to one. It's not that good for what CSS is capable of doing either and the options associated with it. Overall, this book really isn't any good for someone that has experience. To me, it's more of a beginner to intermediate level for those who have only scratched the surface of CSS. If your experienced, don't bother."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"I have found better books out there, but this one is okay. Good to get you started."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"I sincerely think Eric Meyer and New Riders delivered a masterpiece. This is a project-based book on CSS; covering clean, CSS based designs, full of real world advices and common sense. As always Eric also gives advice on common browser's pitfalls and bugs and provide elegant and clean solutions to get around them. If you are serious at CSS, and anybody should be, you can't miss this book; yet, beginners may look elsewhere to get a solid understanding before digging this one.Last but not least, this is an oversized full colours volume, with gorgeous design and typography, definitely the best-looking computer book I ever read."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"Over 90% of the browsers surfing the internet are using IE, but this book's examples seem to only work best on Netscape browsers. Although the author suggested many hacks for both IE and Netscape, i.e. the voice-family in page 241 for the right margin hacks on Windows IE. It still doesn't work on Windows XP Pro IE6 sp1. The design concept is great though."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"I bought the book hoping to learn how to create pop-up menus. I was disappointed in that respect. I did find it to be a nice guide for using style sheets for specific situations. Readers who do the homework and visit the companion website can pick up tips on getting things done. I would caution against doing everything shown. Many of the tricks require setting specific positions or heights or widths. Such tricks create pages that are not highly maintainable."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"I can't understand why people are so attached to designing pages using code directly, rather than using the tools that have been created to automate much of that. You don't format a letter in your word processor using code, you click a button. You don't edit photos with code, you click a button. Publishers don't layout magazine pages or books using code, but Eric Meyer seems to think that web pages need to be done from scratch, meaning code. Its a colossal waste of time. This sort of thinking would have us all operating our computers from the command line for everything we do. That went out years ago. While this book may be great if you still live in the web stone age of code addicts, don't buy it if you want to design anything worth looking at. Do buy it if you want to spend five times as long creating your pages than you can in a wysiwyg editor that is capable with CSS, such as DW 2004 in design mode. I'm just glad I was able to sell my copy on Amazon.com for most of what I paid for it. Wake up to the modern age and forget books like this."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"I give this book 3 stars, because it does a very good job of explaining and dealing with common issues in CSS. Unfortunately, the designs themselves are on the whole horrible - sorry, it's the only word. It's a shame that the author didn't get some designs from a graphic/web designer to complement what are on the whole excellent explanations of dealing with real world CSS issues, especially as he makes design comments, he's not qualified to make. Have a look at excerpt 10 in the sample pages to get an idea. This is an important issue because one of the powers of CSS is that it can be used to integrate the design and the content in a meaningful and elegant way. On the positive side, often the small pointers that he has for labelling css are particularly good, and I regularly find myself going 'ah, that's so useful'. If your CSS skills are well up to scratch perhaps look at Zeldman's 'Designing with Web Standards' as a possible alternative, but if your still working your way through the CSS in the real world then this is a very useful and practical book and I for one (with 8 years of web-building behind me) find it useful."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"Before skimming through \\"Eric Meyer on CSS\\" I expected an introductory level CSS tutorial book that would provide readers with step-by-step instructions on how to create efficient CSS layouts. The back cover lists standard concepts that are covered in the book in addition to an accurate depiction of Eric Meyer's professional experience level and expert ability with CSS [...]. Yet, after reading the introduction and beginning the first few chapters, I quickly learned this book is ideal for persons with a solid foundation in HTML and at least a basic understanding of CSS. For example, project 1 (i.e. chapter 1) illustrates how to remove HTML markup and replace it with CSS layout, but does not go into detail about the HTML markup and mentions CSS properties/terminology as a side note rather than main point.I think a major selling point of \\"Eric Meyer on CSS\\" is its excellent project based approach to CSS; each project can be completed in a single session and built my proficiency and confidence upon chapter completion. Additionally, the chapter layout is quite organized and easy to follow with full support and completed files available from the book's website. For example, the necessary steps for each project are incorporated into the main body of the text with illustrations and easily identifiable code. Go to the website to double check for accuracy or help troublshoot your work. Definitions, clarifications, warnings, and sample code links are neatly laid out in the columns to the side of the text's main body. Depending upon your comfort level of CSS, it is easy to skip around chapters and projects or work straight through.An inconveniencing aspect of this book is that the CSS is difficult to reference. While the index lists the page numbers to CSS functions, the CSS is incorporated into any number of projects/tutorials, which may or may not be useful for the task you are performing. This book transforms HTML pages into CSS efficient pages; this is a positive consistent quality throughout \\"Eric Meyer on CSS\\", but it may have less relevance for people wishing to create HTML + CSS pages from scratch. In future versions of this book, I think it would be interesting to note layout differences between HTML versions and include CSS for XHTML.Overall, I found \\"Eric Meyer on CSS\\" a transformational book for HTML and CSS and I give it the highest possible rating. I recommend this book to anyone with a serious interest in CSS or who may use CSS on a quasi regular basis. It is a fine addition to any level (i.e. introductory, intermediate, advanced) CSS library or small collection. Essentially this book taught me how to do professional quality HTML \\"make overs\\" with CSS in a manner of speaking; it taught me how to convert HTML pages into more efficient and attractive pages using CSS."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"Being a fan of Eric Meyer's previous book on CSS, I was pretty keen on what to expect from 'Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design' in terms of quality. Mr. Meyer's original CSS book was a top notch piece of work when it first came out, and it's a great book today. Like HTML books, there are lots of options available to people if you want to learn how to develop CSS book from a design perspective, but there are not many books out there that look at the subject from a case study point of view.Look no further.In the author's book, he takes exactly this route, defining 13 projects, and the nuts of bolts of each one of these projects as it relates to CSS design. Headlined by full color pages and clear, concise writing, this is a book that is easy to read and enjoyable to follow.The problem is that the things that make this book so unique are also its weakness.While a case study approach sounds good on paper and it IS interesting, the fact that unless you plan to copy the exact design that Mr. Meyer is using, this text is little more than just a nice reference to relate to. Being different doesn't mean one is wrong, but unless the reader knows what to expect, they might be disappointed by this text.What this book IS: a case study book that points out different uses of CSS on web pages, highlighting certain tips and tricks that were put to use to get the desired effectWhat this book IS NOT: a reference book or a learning tool of how to get CSS working with web pages. This book fully expects the reader to have some understanding/experience of CSS, and they are looking to get further education beyond the bachelor's degree in CSS that they already got (perhaps from reading CSS: The Definitive Reference).Nice book, but different. Keep that in mind when considering purchasing this text.**** RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"If you are interested in learning about CSS, especially its power, you need this book. If you really gotta learn about CSS, you need this book. Of course it will get dog-earred from use and if purchased for a &quot;corporate use&quot; library, you may have to dust off your boxing gloves. I personally refuse to share!Excellent resource. Do yourself a favor and work the examples throughout the book. Once you start with Chapter 1, you'll want to anyway. Usually I start these but don't finish. This one was different. I felt I had to finish -- like a great novel you can't put down until you see &quot;the end&quot;."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"Last year, I watched &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; and I was amazed at the swordsmanship on display. Swords were no longer weapons, but extensions of arms - as if they were new appendages grown especially for the task. Eric Meyer can wield CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) in just the same way as those actors could wield swords. His level of understanding is exceptional and is only matched by perhaps half a dozen others.What sets Eric apart from others is his ability to convey his magic to almost anyone. Authors with a decent knowledge of HTML will be completely comfortable with this book. Eric demonstrates how to take exsiting designs and make them look professional and sophisticated, without resorting to bloated markup packed with font tags and spacer images.I got &quot;Eric Meyer on CSS&quot; for Christmas and spent much of the Christmas period reading it. I tackled the whole book initially without using a computer. Eric's writing style is conversational and amusing, putting the reader at ease immediately. I could follow each project without difficulty, eyes widening with every page. I am already pretty good at using CSS, but with each page I learned more. After finishing it, I went back and worked through the book with the computer, following each example and going through the various end-of-chapter experiments. Gaps in my knowledge were filled in and my understanding grew with each project.Having finished the book completely, I am eager to begin experimenting on my own projects. &quot;Eric Meyer on CSS&quot; has left me excited about what can be achieved and I strongly recommend it to those that want to further enhance any existing knowledge of basic CSS."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"&quot;Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design&quot; is an instructional book written for those who have been disappointed with Web browser display results from using various brands of popular &quot;drag &amp; drop&quot; website creation software.The author, Eric Meyer, is an expert with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). By using CSS computer coding instructions, more precision can be brought to bear in a website layout. Top, bottom, and side-to-side distances between Web page objects can be better controlled with CSS commands rather then using just HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) code.IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT DRAG &amp; DROPSeven years ago I purchased a thick book about HTML 2 and developed my first commercial website. The hand-coding involved not just the placement and formatting of text, it also required typing specific positioning instructions for the placement of the numerous JPEG images. It wasn't a precise exercise, and after going through this labor-intensive hand-coding process I anticipated with enthusiasm the development and arrival of drag &amp; drop website development applications that would presumably end the need for typing code.I purchased Adobe's PageMill drag &amp; drop Web creation application when it was first available, but found myself frequently going to the HTML source code to make changes and better position the text and graphics elements. After PageMill, Adobe's GoLive proved a much better and more capable website creation product, and I believed the era of frequent involvement with typing HTML source code was behind me. However, some website layouts were not satisfactory enough when viewed in a browser. Spacing between text and images would sometimes be too wide or narrow. Reviewing the HTML source code would reveal nothing out of whack. So how to cure the problem? Cascading Style Sheets, as it turns out.I've known about Cascading Style Sheets for a couple of years, but was unable to understand their real value from previous explanations I read. &quot;Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design&quot; solved the mystery for me. The knowledge and new skills I've gained from this book provided the learning breakthroughs I needed. I now get much better results positioning text and picture elements in a Web browser. Yes, it's back to some hand-coding, but I better understand and accept that CSS code is the best method for achieving the results I need and my clients require.Helping the learning process are practice files for each of the thirteen chapters in this book that are downloaded from the website location provided by the author. Each tutorial file is identical to an example being explained in a particular chapter.&quot;Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design&quot; is an excellent way to learn the creation of Cascading Style Sheets. There's only one improvement I can recommend for this book--spiral binding. With the typical glued binding I found myself needing weighted objects (including my elbow) to keep the book from slapping shut. Spiral binding would allow the pages to lay flat and make the process much easier with reading a paragraph and then performing the instructional tasks from the tutorial files while referring back to the book.Tom Shackle is a multimedia producer and a member of the Alaskan Apple Users Group."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"Wonderful book, but when the author says you need to know some CSS going in, he means it. This is not a beginners book, to get the most out of it you should know some CSS before opening it.I started with Steve Callihan's CSS By Example and then 'graduated' to this book. Boy was I glad. Learned a lot more by doing this. I also was able to concentrate on the design elements and tips Meyers offered instead of feeling like I was lost in learning the code."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"If I ever meet Eric Meyer in person, I'll have to drop to my knees and worship him. All of his books are outstanding, but this one is his best.It's not for CSS beginners at all, but if you're basically familiar with CSS and want to learn more practical applications, then this book is for you:- Navigation menus with CSS- retrofitting existing pages for CSS- creating printable pagesThere's something good on every page. I teach Web design and have recommended it to my students. You can't go wrong with Eric Meyer and CSS."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"This book felt more like a project book in which we follow along with Eric as he builds each of 13 projects. Although I found the follow-along process somewhat useful, it didn't address what I wanted to do - build my own project. To find the CSS elements I wanted for my own project required searching through page after page to find the rule I needed.I found Mr. Meyer's online project files quite useful and helpful because I didn't have to write any code. I'm reasonably proficient in HTML but not in CSS - so I was hoping for more of a reference manual - rather than a \\"this is how I did it\\" project book.As Mr. Meyer describes in his book (paraphrasing) - this book IS NOT for those new to CSS, who want to understand the subtleties of CSS, done web design only in WYSIWYG environments, or want CSS that works in any environment.This is NOT A CSS REFERENCE BOOK. I would call it a hands-on project book.If I were more of a follow-along learner, I'd probably rate this book higher. Especially if I wanted to know \\"how did he do that?\\" I'd rate it much higher. I'm not disappointed, but I didn't get much from this book."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"I was very skeptical of this book at first, Erics example projects that you learn from seem kind of lame and dated looking, and although they arent visually exciting this isnt a design book, its a book to learn CSS, and learn it I did.Im already an experienced web developer with some CSS experience but never with fully tableless design. I was able to read this book fairly quickly gather quick knowledge of the aspects of CSS I did not know about. The sites he has you build dont look exciting, however they do a good job teaching you the fundamentals, which is the most important part. I was able to read a chapter, then goto my own personal website which was more fun and apply what I learned. Then read another chapter learn something else and then apply that knowledge to the site I was working on. By the time I finished the book, I had also made a pretty cool site of my own that was visually exciting to me as well as CSS rich (look ma, no tables!)This way I was getting the most of his excercises, and then applying them to my own fun design. I think this is a perfect way to learn css and I recommend this \\"dual-path\\" approach so you don't get totally bored working on eric's designs only."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"The first seen this book seems one more technical guide about CSS, but to the first contact realizes that it is a great reference based on needs to everyday of the web designer.The book starts boarding how to initiate layout HTML transition for layout hybrid (still with the tables use but of optimized way), and with that goes gradually preparing the reader to think and to create the such wished Layout CSS (Tableless).Besides talking about CSS he shows how to conceive a semantically correct code HTML and thus obtain a more organized and accessible structure.This book boards the structure and presentation separation concept, positioning CSS, columns in CSS, leaves creation of alternative style, forms and effects presentation in links, lists and images.The book Eric Mayer on CSS is one of the best references about CSS who already I saw, and can tell that he is indispensable in the web designer library."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"This book is far from a comprehensive reference guide for CSS (see the O'reilly CSS Definitive Guide - also by Eric - for that), but it is a great step-by-step get-your-feet-wet introduction to the principles of CSS. We use it as part of our training for all of our web interns and employees."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"I'd been noodling around with writing and implementing CSS and run into my fair share of brick walls. But I see the future and it is CSS, this is the book that inspired me to take up the cause again in earnest.The book contains a series of real-life scenarios so you can jump in right away and start using CSS to do what you already do with HTML, just better and faster, and some things you can't do with HTML alone. The projects get increasing more advanced as the book progresses, which makes delving in deeper much less painful than it needs to be because you have an expert guide providing reliable tips and warnings the whole way. For those who have tinkered with CSS cross browser compatibly know that advice alone is worth the cost of the book. There's also a companion site where you can download files to follow along step-by-step with each chapter or double check your own work as you go along.Like all masters, Meyer makes CSS look easy and this book is put to best use as a companion to an expansive reference guide. After finishing the first chapter I was inspired to download the w3c standards for CSS2. Anything that can get me to read ultra-geeky dry-as-toast info from the consortium and make sense of it is really on to something. Use Meyer's insights and choices in this book as a guide for your own projects as a way to navigate the endless decisions you'll need to make when implementing CSS on your own. If you're looking for a book that will show you how to intelligently approach implementing reliable CSS and spark your creative side this is an excellent choice."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"I highly reccomend this and the \\"More Eric Meyer on CSS\\".

This book is great for taking you from ground zero to something svelte. The lessen format is like having your personal tutor. I will eventually get around to something practical. In the mean time I am expanding my universe.So far I find this to be midlevel coding. The real problem with top level is that you have know idea want you are doing and a lot of superfluous overhead is added to the commands; it is good for a quickie but can later paint you into a corner. Low level will give you tighter code and more control over results. Midlevel is a compromise but sometimes adds functionality that can not be reached at the lover level command line coding.Every language has it strengths and purpose they just do not invent more complexity for the fun of it. I hope to have the mechanics down before I find out what it is.CSS may come and go but it is necessary to be aware of it incase you need to correct someone else's code. For me this is the right book at the right time.

If you are not familiar with basic CSS mark up, this book is not for you. If you wish to learn CSS from the ground up- see Christopher Schmitt's book \\"Designing CSS Web Pages\\" published by New Riders as well. Anyone who uses heavy javascript in their design will also find many streamlined CSS alternatives to that clunky code. \\"More Eric Meyer on CSS\\" starts off with a lesson on how to convert an existing table layout to cascading style sheets. I like the way Eric leads through the examples, every step in the code reveals possible browser conflicts. Lucky for us, he is able to supply the right workaround to make the pages compliant. Readers will also walk though styling a photo gallery, styling a financial report, \`transparency layout', and many more. My favorite lessons were CSS-Driven Drop-Down Menus, Opening the Doors to Attractive Tabs, and Designing in the Garden. I have been a fan of the csszengarden site, and I had fun reaching the Zen Garden!Overall, this was a useful and comprehensive book. Eric Meyer has a simple way of presenting the lessons. None of the ten lessons he covers should take longer than one hour. He is obviously extremely knowledgeable in this field. His praise is well deserved. I personally plan on implementing these lessons on my personal site and those of future clients. The only flaw I found with this book was chapter 10's missing lesson file from the books website, this was alright, as a similar html file was supplied. It was definitely not enough to lower my perfect rating though."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"This book does a great job on what it says it does. But do you know what it does? Just be sure you do before you buy it. This book is intended not to teach you CSS, it presumes you already know CSS2. Instead of teaching you the actual language this book shows you how to apply it. Each chapter is a detailed 'case study' if you want to call it that. Meyer does a great job at walking you through various real life scenarios you might encounter such as converting a normal web template to a CSS one. So don't get me wrong this book is a 5 star book in that regard but the problem is I don't think most people realize that's all this book is really for.Simply put, if you don't already know how to write complex CSS2 stylesheets then BUY ANOTHER BOOK first. Fortunately for myself I've been a professional designer / developer for 5 years now, so when I picked up this book (not knowing how to write complex CSS prior to reading it) I was able to figure out the code and learn CSS2 on the fly. However this is not a good way to learn for many people so if you don't know CSS yet or not really familar with it try another book before picking this one up. Otherwise BUY THIS BOOK becuase YES, it is really really good!"},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"I've utilized CSS for quite a while (being an early adopter on my personal site) and had a strong grasp of the language. This book proved to be a great surprise as I learned some great tips and tricks for Cascading Style Sheets and expanded my understanding of some of the fundamental intricacies within pure CSS (as opposed to browser-mangled support).I leant this book to a friend of mine who is familiar, though not an expert with CSS and she found it just as useful (if not more so) than I do.This isn't a CSS manual, if you don't have a decent CSS reference, I highly recommend that you pick one up. Even better if it is by Eric too. ;)Eric is a great source of CSS information and I hope he continues to produce such great material."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"Wanna learn CSS with a beautifully illustrated, simple, and technically accurate tutorial book? Look no further! Eric and the review team have crafted a wonderful book on CSS.Why would you buy it?1) CSS is the next step up in web design. It's fluid, flexible, can make your pages load faster, and can be MUCH easier to work with than screwing around with tables and placeholder images. (It is not perfect, however, so you may only use it to enhance table based layouts for now.)2) You'll be able to make your page more appealing to people and search engines.3) This is a tutorial book. You can get a reasonably good handle on CSS if you are not already an expert.4) It not only walks you through the exercises in words, but presents visual representations of what your example pages will look like.5) Lots of books accomplish #4 to some degree. This is an oversized color volume which makes it much easier to work with.6) New Riders makes good stuff. They are consistently one of the best publishers along with O'Reilly. This book is no different.There is no \\"quick reference\\" in this book for all the CSS markups you will learn in the tutorials and the index could have been a little bit better. There were a couple little things that didn't seem to work as they were supposed to, but 99% of the time the exercises turned out perfectly. Overall, this book is about as good as it gets.In the nature of fair disclosure, New Riders provided a complimentary copy of the book for review a couple of months ago. It has gotten and will continue to get plenty of use."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"The first thing I read to learn CSS was Meyer's CSS: The Definitive Guide (vol. 1) and it was helpful, but I needed the project work in Mastering to really get going with CSS.

By the end I felt ready to dive into the redesign my department's web site using CSS as the primary formatting language."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"I marvel any author these days who can produce a pratical and readable book on software. Eric does a good job at making us want to read and learn the gems in CSS. I like it because the examples are relevant and you can see how you can apply them.

Good book to have."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"Eric's writing is great, however, for a thin book with limited content, my opinion is that New Riders Publishing got greedy with the pricing of the book. $45 retail in the stores?! For the price I expected a book with more meat, more content as opposed to a few tips and tricks. For the price, New Riders could have at least included a disk with all the samples that you are required to download online if you wish to work along as the book is intended. In the book, what Eric has done is to show a few CSS tips and cool tricks, his writing style is very good and his tips are great, however, there isn't enough of it in this book. Don't buy it new, or at least not in the retail stores, it isn't worth the price.If this is a must have book for you, buy it at Amazon's online price, used, or somewhere such as nerdbooks.com and avoid the FULL $45 retail price such as charged by places like Books-a-Million!!"},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"I recently purchased this book based on the customer reviews I read here on Amazon. I must say that it is a very well-written book, and the author seems extremely knowledgeable about the subject matter. However, I am slightly disappointed that there is not more technical information on how to correctly write Cascading Style Sheets and all the different CSS properties available. Instead, the author leads the reader through several hands-on projects designed to teach the reader how to implement different design techniques using CSS. I would have preferred a little more reference information (maybe an appendix) that allows the reader to use the book as a quick reference when starting a new CSS project or brushing up on some of the technical aspects. The material strikes me as having been written more for someone already very proficient in CSS who simply needs more design ideas, not for somone who is still learning how to implement CSS into a Web site. Nevertheless, it is still a very useful book."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"This is an excellent book for progressing from using style sheets for specifying only fonts and colors to building entire sites driven by CSS layout rendering--it is not a reference book.

I've dabbled in CSS for some time now, and even though this is not a definitive reference book, Eric makes it so easy to follow each step, tossing in useful information along the way. It's easy enough to supplement this by looking up CSS references online.The extensive list of project files means you can pick up a project at any stage or skip ahead to compare how you are doing.

A colleague of mine gave me this book, and it sat on my shelf for about 6 months. Then I tried doing the exercises week by week, but would get distracted because the projects didn't look that aesthetically appealing to me, especially coming from a design background.However, I started working on a side project which used the barebones CSS, and then revisited this book, but this time, I dedicated a good full week, day by day, finishing each chapter. I must say, I'm on the last chapter of the book, and I really have started to get a grasp of how this all works. The exercises are a bit challenging, but very necessary. The last chapter is amazing that I wondered as an author, how he even began to contemplate on writing this chapter. He takes a his own exercise, and then restyles it for the web, which has been really engaging, even in 2009.I highly recommend this book. It's probably the first instructional book that I've completed.Some side pointers that have been recommended to me which helped:-I used the text editor Coda (which is for MACS only). It costs a little less than Dreamweaver, but it encompasses all the programming languages that are hip like [Ruby, Javascript, Actionscript, PHP, Python, Perl, etc. (19 in total)]. You can visit the Panic site, and purchase this as a combo with Transmit.-In the divs, I always put a temporary border so I can see the elements [border: 1px dotted green;]. Sometimes, I use different colors or patterns. But at the end I delete them. But being a visual person, this really helped. I would try it but if it doesn't work, don't sweat it and delete them.-Last there are a couple of links in there that are a bit dated because of course this book is 8 years old--pretty prehistoric in web years. Anyway, I want to say don't dismiss the URLs. Instead do a Google Search, and you will find the pages he talks about.Hope this helps. Feel free to ping me if you have questions."},{"Title":"Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design","review":"I was personally disappointed in this book, being the tech geek that I am. And yet I still end up recommending it to about 5 people a day since I got it. This book is project-based, and walks the reader through several designs using CSS. I remember thinking at first glance at this book \\"Not what I was looking for, but WOW! this would be very useful for . . .\\". And with that, I began evangelizing. I kept the book for a couple of days, reading through it, and showing it to several web site designers who after a quick glance would write down the title so they could get their own copy. Then I left the book with our two web developers, who were last seen wrestling over who got to use the book first (my company paid for the book, so I felt no loss).Now, as I mentioned, I'm a tech geek. I read the specs on the W3C website to find most of the info I want to know. I really liked Eric Meyer's \\"CSS: The Definitive Guide\\" and frequently visit the author's website ... for pointers and tips on using CSS (not to mention his fun little articles about life in general). But I realize for most people, they need a little more guidance - this book offers just that. This book is just one step down from having Eric Meyer come in and walk you through CSS.If you've been interested in using CSS, but have felt like it's a little out of reach, this book will put CSS firmly in your grasp. I have never seen a book that has generated this kind of excitement among our designers & developers.

Each project gave me several ways to solve current snags I was hitting in my code. Each of them also inspired me with the confidence to create more ambitious layouts.Although it's well-written and entertaining--a page-turner!--I haven't quite finished the book yet because I keep putting it down to tinker some more with the coding project that formerly had me stumped and demoralized. Then I pick the book up to leaf back through to a project that solved another problem I'm having, and that reminds me of something else really cool in there that I want to try out, and so on: two pages forward, twenty pages back. Eventually I'll have to turn the computer off to finish reading.Note: This is not a book for beginners. Meyer assumes that you know how CSS works and have spent some time trying to use it. You needn't be a whiz, though, to appreciate it.Negatives? All I can think of is that I want it to be longer. And, in fact, it is: be sure to check out the bonus chapters at the book's web site; they're important. Oh, and the index could be more detailed, but it's not a big deal since the book is compact and well-organized enough to allow you to remember where you saw something useful.In short, if you use CSS, buy this book.

With an accessible, informal voice, he also explains the reasons for each decision so we can begin to think like a style sheet pro.

I think that making input forms are the biggest challenge for web designers (they can look SO ugly).

It is now finally safe to go back to those old designs you did, and re-write them safely; logically and with minimal chances of drowning. I had a wonderful time with this book; using it to clean up and modernize many old web designs I've done over the years. You'll find it straight forward and very readable. Plenty of code, explanations, suggestions, color photos and design concepts. But the real action is the project-approach that this book takes. Work through them and then tackle your own stuff.

A great read."},{"Title":"Lords of the Levee: The Story of Bathhouse John and Hinky Dink","review":"This book, published in 1943 was reissued a few years ago. It's a fascinating political history of two early Chicago \\"Community Organizers,\\" Democrat First Ward Aldermen John Coughlin and Mike Kenna, in the late 19th and early 20th century. If you want to understand how Chicago Way politics became as they are today, this is a great place to start--and excellent entertainment as well. Vote fraud (50 cents per vote was the going price to pay \\"floaters\\" to come into the ward and vote multiple times), corruption and legislative vote selling (called \\"boodling\\" by the press), protection payoffs from gambling and bawdy houses to fund the Democrat machine--it's all here. In those days, it was out in the open. Now they try to keep it hidden from feds and the press, which still does weekly stories that would turn our stomachs, except those of us who live in Cook County have become inured to corruption stories. We read them, complain, and forget. And one-party rule goes on. This was the age of \\"reform\\" Governor John Peter Altgelt (the \\"Eagle that is Forgotten\\" of Vachel Lindsay's poem), William Jennings Bryan (Coughlin and Kenna were \\"free silver\\" men), Big Bill Thompson, TR and at end of the story, Al Capone.

Some articles in this reader are less helpful than others but overall it is a great introduction to masculinity studies and I highly recommend it.

And recognizing that early indications of a team in decline includes team members beginning to loose their unified commitment and when the collaborative climate fades - these insights have also proven to be of great value to many of the teams I have assisted.

The most important of which is that he wasa book reading machine, a scholar & thinker, from an early age. Consequently, when he writes, he synthesizes and combinesfrom that vast reading and thinking experience to produce fresh concepts either never noticed before or never popularly presented,in addition to his many quotable gems.This is a good book to add to your library concerning the Blessed Virgin Mary.There are two chapters within this book that I especially took note of:(1) Ch 17 \\"Mary and the Moslems\\" :This is the most quoted chapter of this book.Basically, Sheen relates the story of Fatima,Portugal, a former Muslim town hundred years ago.It was named after Muhammads'(founder of Islam) daughter Fatima who was venerated in the Koran, butthe Blessed Virgin Mary is the most venerated in the Koran above Muhammads daughter Fatima. Sheen relatesGods plan over coincidence and states that the Blessed virgin chose to appear as 'Our Lady of Fatima' as a pledgeand sign of hope to the Muslim people and as an assurance that they, who show her so much respect, will one dayaccept her Divine Son too.(2) Ch 21 \\"Mary and the Sword\\"Great depth in explaining that a double edged sword pierced both Jesus and Mary.Covers extensively the 7 Dolors of Mary.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to increase his/her faith and understanding of the Mother of God and the Mother of Christ's Church."},{"Title":"The world's first love","review":"I am a great admirer of Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen and I adore many of the books he has written, but I believe that The World's First Love is not one of his best literary works.This book is filled with such sweeping generalities and general statements that sometimes it is hard to take Sheen seriously. In fact, this is one of the criticisms levied against Sheen by Thomas Reeves in his book America's Bishop. Reeves notes that many of Sheen's works include so many broad assertions and generalities that Sheen often had to defend and recast some of the things he wrote.Just a few of the grand assumptions Sheen makes are things such as, since Jesus taught so much to the Apostles in the span of 3 years, just imagine what he taught His mother over the span of 30 years. How does anyone know what he taught Mary while he lived with her? Scripture is silent on such issues, but scripture does tell us that Jesus became actively involved in his public ministry after his baptism in the Jordan. Any imaginative specualtion about Jesus' years with Mary is just that, speculation.Moreover, in the beginning Sheen attributes some verses in the book of Proverbs describing wisdom to Mary. These are new developments to me! To assume that Mary was innocently playing during the acts of creation by God is quite a grand leap in logic. At one point Sheen remarks that this Wisdom being discussed in these verses is Jesus, but in the beginning of his book he says these verses are describing Mary.Also, implicit in Sheen's book is the idea that Mary is the pinnacle of human creation; The capstone of God's handiwork if you will. I have no qualms by saying that Mary was one of the holiest, if not the holiest person born of man who ever lived, but I don't place her at the pinnacle of human creation. Sheen's remarks about Mary being the quintessential woman and what every man desires as the perfect mate, and what every woman aspires to be in earnest are grand assumptions indeed.Nevertheless, I did appreciate a few aspects of this book. I loved how Sheen illustrated that every Christian who ignores Mary's epithet of mother of God can be classified into four groups all condemned as heretics. All Christians need to recognize that Mary is in fact the mother of God and needs to be called by that distinguished title; To not do so is to rob her of the distinction she claimed for herself in the first chapter of Luke when she stated that all generations will call her blessed. Second, I liked how Sheen debunks the view that Joseph was an old man when he married Mary. Sheen does an excellent job of showing why such a view is erroneous and implausible.Like I stated at the beginning, I am a great admirer of Sheen and love his literary works, but this book had too many defincencies and does not live up to the quality of some of Sheen's other works. Read this book to gain a greater appreciation for Mary and to contemplate her role in the New Testament, but do not take everything Sheen writes at face value."},{"Title":"The world's first love","review":"This book tells the story of Mary. It is not a biography, but a theological and devotional treatise on the Mother of God. Bishop Sheen adeptly considers the different phases of Mary's life from her Immaculate Conception to her Assumption. He examines Marian beliefs ranging from her position as Mother of God to her Apparitions at Fatima in 1917, and the importance of the Rosary. Sheen sets out to prove that devotion to Mary cannot be seperated from devotion to her Son, Jesus. Likewise, true love for Jesus should lead the disciple to a devotion to Mary. Sheen points out that without Mary, we could not have Jesus and we should love Mary simply because Jesus did! One cannot help but be moved by the authors portrayal of this Woman of Faith. It was Sheen's hope that his book would draw the reader to Mary as he was, &quot;like a piece of iron to a magnet but never without her Son.&quot; It is this readers view that Sheen succeeded admirably."},{"Title":"The world's first love","review":"The late Archbishop Fulton Sheen pulls together common misconceptions various religions have about the Catholic Church's beliefs about Mary, and gives insights and Biblical reasons why Catholics honor her so greatly. There is also a chapter I found really informative on &quot;Mary and the Moslems&quot; which tells about the Islamic beliefs of Mary, i.e. that she is to be the most honored of women and that the Koran speaks of Mary and the Virgin Birth of Jesus. This book would be wonderful for those wishing for a greater love for Our Blessed Mother, as well as those Protestants who mistakingly think Mary should be less revered and those beginning their conversion to Catholicism."},{"Title":"The world's first love","review":"A beautiful book on Our Blessed Mother -- remarkably thoughtful and incisive, and very well written. Moreover, for a book first published 50 years ago, \\"The World's First Love\\" remains fresh and relevant. To be sure, some aspects are a bit dated: Communism is not the threat it was in 1952, and the same is true of atomic war. Also, Archbishop Sheen has proven to be more optimistic than history has warranted. He more or less predicts, for example, that within 30 years (that is, by the 1980s) the world would have pretty much seen the Light that is Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Tragically, that wasn't true 20 years ago, and it's certainly not true today (if the sewage was up to our waist in 1982, it's up to armpits in 2002).No matter. This is a beautiful book on Mary, and I heartily recommend it (along with \\"A Woman Clothed with the Sun\\" as a delightful companion piece)."},{"Title":"The world's first love","review":"I was surprised that I enjoyed this book to the extremes that I did. I was equally surprised by the elegance of the writing. I know that many women will read this book and cringe at statements such as \\"Here is the essence of womanhood--acceptance, resignation, submission\\"(83). Reading this line did scare me, but if read within the context of the entire book and keeping in mind Sheen's undeniable love and respect for women throughout his discussion, it can be thought of in a completely different way. Basically, I view much of the writing in the book as ideals, such as ideals of love or ideals of men/women. Unfortunately, the world is often so corrupt that it is difficult to live or even think in ideals. This book is full of such beauty that it will make many women consider what it means to be a feminist or complete woman. I don't think women have to become men to be successful. Besides all of this, it is a wonderful introduction to Mary and the rosary within a broad discussion of love. The book does have some outdated sections, due to its publication in 1952, but much of it remains timeless. Even if you end up hating what the book says, you will not be able to deny the beauty of some lines such as \\"All human love is an initiation into the Eternal\\" (12)."},{"Title":"The world's first love","review":"Bishop Sheen's book on Mary touches on so many aspects of life that it is almost unfair to say that it is \\"about Mary\\" except that as the Mother of Christ, Mary's life IS all about our life.

The book is good for the student who is new to the study of breathing, but does not contain any bibliography for further study. Arnold Jacobs, former tuba player with the Chicago Symphony (and widely known for his expertise on breathing for musical purposes) has much more information to provide, and most of his discoveries were made many years ago, and still apply today. If you purchase this book, be sure to check out anything by Jacobs or his former students to see what you'll be missing."},{"Title":"Old Herbaceous","review":"Old Herbaceous was first published in about 1950. It is the fictional chronicle of the life of Old Herbaceous, the head gardener at an English manor house. He begins life as a foundling child, early develops a love for flowers which grow along an abandoned canal, and then becomes a gardener at the manor house after impressing the Lady of the Manor at a garden show. Gradually he rises through the ranks of gardeners to eventually become head gardener.This book is pleasing for several reasons. First, it helps us understand what a complex thing an English manor house must have been, with its ranks of servants and underlings. Secondly, it has beautiful descriptions of flowers, shrubs, trees, and other elements of the English countryside. Finally, its a great social history in microcosm of the changes England underwent from the 1870s through the World War II era.In many ways Old Herbaceous is another Goodbye Mr. Chips: a short quiet book about a seemingly unimportant individual who turns out to be much more than he appears."},{"Title":"Old Herbaceous","review":"Reginald Arkell's lovely book OLD HERBACEOUS is unusual as it is a novel about gardening with a gardener protagonist. Michael Pollen and company have added this book to their ever expanding collection of gardening gems-The Modern Library Garden Series. OH was first published in 1950.At the opening of the book, Pinnegar the protagonist has retired and is living in a cottage on the estate where he gardened for over 60 years. He reflects on how he began his gardening career when Mrs Charteris instructed her head gardener, a Mr. Addis, to hire him after he won a wild flower arrangment contest she judged. Sixty years later, Pinnegar has replaced Addis and acquired his nickname \`Old Herbaceous' from the younger gardeners who view him as a relic of a bygone era.The book provides a different perspective on the \\"new\\" gardens promoted by the garden designers and owners such as Jeckell, Bowles, and Robinson who became prominent at the end of the 19th century and in the early 20th century. In their books and correspondence, these individuals often write \\"I did this\\" and \\"I did that\\" but in reality they mostly instructed head gardeners who supervised a crew of under gardeners and carried out their instructions. Frequently, these designers and their gardeners were at odds with each other. As anyone who has ever gardened knows, to really understand gardening you must get your hands dirty. Learning to garden is an acquired skill gained via trial and error and cannot be learned by observation alone.Furthermore, the \\"new\\" gardens designed by Jeckell, Bowles and others which superceded \\"bedding out\\" (the hallmark of Victoria's reign) and formal 19th century gardens drew their inspiration from the cottage gardens of the working class. Cottage gardens consisted of a mix of herbs and perennials growing informally side by side. Sometimes, the \`new' gardens incorporated plants from exotic locales. The tender nature of these plants led to the invention and promotion of glass houses, cold frames, and bell jars. In OLD HERBACEOUS, Pinnegar acquires Ipomoea (morning glory) seeds and grows them in the main green house to please his mistress.The book covers a period from the end of Victoria's reign until just after WWII. While Arkell has a good deal to say about the business of gardening on a large estate, his book is also a study of the relationship between a family retainer his overseer. Pinnegar presents the workers view, or the view Arkin, himself a member of the middle class, believed a man like Pinnegar would hold.

Accurately portrays the events that lead to Eastern's demise. I am no fan of unions. But, Lorenzo displayed a blatant calloused disregard for Eastern, it's people, and everything connected with it."},{"Title":"Grounded: Frank Lorenzo and the destruction of Eastern Airlines","review":"This is a short book but a good telling of the tale of the downfall of Eastern Airlines under the managment of Frank Lorenzo. It is also a story that relates a great deal about the corporate attitudes of the late 1980s and the potential consequences of that attitude.The only shortcoming of the book is that the story line leaves off with the ejecetion of Frank Lorenzo as the debor in possession of the bankrupt airline and the appointment of a bankrupcy trustee in April of 1990. The airline did continue operation until sometime later in 1990 when the company was finally liquidated. The story stopped too soon."},{"Title":"Grounded: Frank Lorenzo and the destruction of Eastern Airlines","review":"While I lived in Dallas, I read Bernstein's book around the same time time that filmmaker Oliver Stone was in town filming the movie \\"J.F.K.\\". I submitted Bernstein's book along with a detailed proposal that included optioning the book rights for a movie with actors Daniel J. Travanti as Lorenzo, Brian Dennehy as Charles Brian and Michael Douglas as Trustee Marty Shugrue. Stone responded 5 days later to me through his assistant Kristina Hare that while this was a meaty subject, the political bent of the book ran counter to his convictions. I found this response puzzling. The book details how Lorenzo, a brilliant financial manipulator, rose from Queens, New York to the heights of owning the world's largest commercial airline empire second only to Russia's Aeroflot. This book is clearly a portrayal of how Lorenzo's get tough tactics with Eastern's notoriously militant IAM led by Charles Bryan from 1980 forward led to a war with Texas Air Management. Lorenzo ended up dismantling the very asset he bought by striking blows against labor in a bitter showdown. Eastern under CEO Frank Borman had 43,000 employees. By the time the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York ousted Lorenzo as \\"incompetent to reorganize Eastern's estate\\", only 18,500 employees remained and over $700 million of assets were either sold or dubiously transferred at little or no cost to Texas Air's Continental Airlines. So, Oliver Stone's rationale is quite strange. He is pro-union and this book details how Lorenzo started an unnecessary war with Eastern's unions rather than allow a professional manager to run the airline. Bernstein had unprecedented access to Frank Lorenzo and former managers of Texas Air as he delivers a step by step cautionary tale of how a well educated albeit, a brutal minded executive became his own worst enemy. It is a well paced and well written book that should become required reading for any business school management class."},{"Title":"Grounded: Frank Lorenzo and the destruction of Eastern Airlines","review":"This is a study in an ego taken over. I view is that the games he played could almost be criminal. I would have liked more information for the company as the author does seem to set out to make Frank be the bad guy. I would also have liked more details on the business end of the airline industry. I thought the writing was above average, he moved the story along through some topics that could be considered dull, union negotiations etc. All and all not a bad book and if you find the airline industry interesting then you should read this book."},{"Title":"Grounded: Frank Lorenzo and the destruction of Eastern Airlines","review":"I read the original publication in the early 90's. This book reads well and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The story is bewildering and illustrates a classic &quot;old world&quot; perspective of labor/management relations clashing with the modern realities of a deregulated airline market that would no longer tolerate labor friction."},{"Title":"Grounded: Frank Lorenzo and the destruction of Eastern Airlines","review":"Great read for someone as myself, an Eastern Airlines Pilot having lived through that era. Bernstein did an excellent job. I knew some of the events, Bernstein did clear up that fateful night when the Board of Directors, who should be taken to this day out and hung, gave EAL to Frank Lorenzo. Lorenzo was a thief in the highest order, and to have been there and watch him rape the airline we loved is more than most of us could bear. The so-called trustee, Martin R. Shugrue who's ego spent even more of the creditor's money (ours), I recall a PanAm buddy who allowed me to stay in his crash pad in NY, saying, my roommate is Marty Shugrue, watch out for Shugrue! Was my buddy correct! All I can say, if you have any interest in the history of the demise of the once great Eastern Airline, then by all means, read this book. I recall, as a young Naval Aviator, joining EAL. The magazines were leather bound, we ate from Rosenthal China, drank the finest scotch. Although, I walked out March 03, 1989, Eastern went from the third largest carrier destroyed in a bit over two short years by Lorenzo, ending up managed by a guy I had roomed with in Valley Stream LI. When Lorenzo was finally kicked out, it was hopeless for Eastern. Working for McDonnell Douglas, my manager at MDC said how would you like to be the first to repossess one of our DC-9's? I flew into Atlanta, strolled out to the aircraft I was to fly to Palmdale. Looking over the aircraft, EAL's gates, saw the poor shape everything was in, thinking, these poor devils, they had zero chance of survival."},{"Title":"Grounded: Frank Lorenzo and the destruction of Eastern Airlines","review":"Overall this book gives an sufficent explantian on the events that led up to Eastern's Shutdown. However, it is bias toward the unions without exposing there arrogance. If you ignore this fact and simply rely on the facts given this is a fairly good book. And also, it ends before the shutdown of the company in January 1991. It does not show the final stage of the Eastern Airlines saga between where Frank Lorenzo loses power and the company shutsdown. 3 stars."},{"Title":"Grounded: Frank Lorenzo and the destruction of Eastern Airlines","review":"Good account of the battle over Eastern Airlines. Labor vs. management at its worst. How personalities killed a once great airline"},{"Title":"Grounded: Frank Lorenzo and the destruction of Eastern Airlines","review":"One of the most unfair treatments of the demise of Eastern Airlines ever written and the second worst book on the subject. Biased towards labor from the beginning, Bernstein paints Goya-like pictures of an evil Frank Lorenzo and his henchmen cackling over a cauldron late at night, thinking up ways to lie, cheat and steal Eastern away from the hearths of America. At the same time, Charlie Bryan is portrayed as some mythic hero who &quot;. . .read Ghandi and Kahlil Gibran and even Sun-tzu. . .&quot;. Right. Bias shows in the fact that no Texas Air management are quoted; no personal attributes are ever given, making Lorenzo, Bakes et all appear as soulless corporate thugs, while the stalwart union defenders with defiant chins thrust forth, are given warm wonderful hearts and the purest of intentions. I'm surprised Bernstein didn't have pictures of Bryan petting a puppy and holding a baby. Of slight redeming value is the fact that the book does tell an accurate story. Eastern didn't have to die and maybe Lorenzo didn't have to kill it, but the interpretation and presentation are designed only to support an intransigent group of labor leaders in their refusal to see the reality of the world. This book is only marginally better than the worst book written about Eastern, &quot;Freefall&quot;."},{"Title":"So Others Might Live: A History of New York's Bravest--The FDNY from 1700 to the Present","review":"At first glance, Golway's book might appear to be a &quot;buff&quot; book - one aimed at firefighting enthusiasts. The truth - evident from the first pages - is that it's a book about much more than fires and firefighting. For in addition to telling the fascinating story of the FDNY's evolution from colonial times to the present, Golway relates many more -- the stories of New York City's growth and development, of technological change (both architectural and firefighting), of municipal politics, of labor disputes, of struggles by women and minorities for equal opportunity. Ultimately, it's a book about the stories of generations of firefighters and their day to day struggle, often overlooked before 9/11, to put their lives on the line in protecting the lives and property of the city's residents. Best of all, the book is beautifully written, reflecting the author's emotional attachment to his subject (he's the son of a firefighter), as well as experience as a journalist. You'll find this book an engaging read from the start - long before it tells the tragic story of the FDNY's darkest day, September 11."},{"Title":"So Others Might Live: A History of New York's Bravest--The FDNY from 1700 to the Present","review":"This book is an amazing book and essential for firefighters, as well as enthusiasts or people who just wants to learn something.

It's still the best work of it's kind that I know of and I'd highly recommend it. In fact I think it ought to be REQUIRED reading for anyone teaching about Columbus's voyage.In this work, Rudolf Simek sets out to answer the question of what the real significance of Columbus's voyage was for the medieval worldview. He carefully, and in great detail, demonstrates that the learned schools (including essentially all of the Catholic Church) accepted the world as spherical, disagreed about it's size, and were deeply involved in trying to solve various problems regarding astronomy. The book is full of various textual references including Marco Polo's description of a unicorn, namely that it didn't look like what Europeans imagined but was instead short, squat, and ugly, and that it only had a short horn (Marco Polo's unicorn is usually assumed to be a rhinoceros).Through the course of the work, Simek shows that the major objections to Columbus's voyage were real and reasonable, namely that while everyone assumed the earth to be round, nobody knew how big it was, and it wasn't generally considered to be a sound investment to let Columbus sail off into the west with only a small amount of supplies on a voyage of unknown length. Had they known how big the earth was, they certainly would not have funded his expedition.There are a few blind spots worth noting, however. The description of the evolution of astronomical systems is not done with the same care as with the geographical questions. For example, in one of his books (I think it's Tetrabiblos, but it could be Almagest), Ptolomy mentions in a sort-of off-hand way that Mercury and Venus circle the sun. This suggests that the later developments of semi-heliocentric models (with those two planets orbiting the sun and everything else circling the earth) was not a new development in the Middle Ages but could easily be grounded in the Ptolomeic texts. Similarly, Simek's treatment of the earlier Greek and Latin sources is somewhat cursory. Finally, I think Simek errs on the side of assuming rational explanations to medieval beliefs and approaches rather than asking how the beliefs fit into a coherent system. While I think Simek does this to try to avoid being prejudiced against medieval thought, I think there's a danger of simply changing how we back-project contemporary prejudices onto the era when we assume a basis in line with current approaches.Neither of these problems is fatal to the work, however. This is a short exploration of medieval concepts of the earth and it's place in the heavens, and how this was fatally undermined by Columbus, Copernicus, Kepler, and the like.The issues he points to, however, are not issues which are typically considered. For example, the discovery of the American landmass, and that it was inhabited, had substantial theological consequences even though confirming that the world was spherical did not.All in all, this is a great work and extremely thought provoking."},{"Title":"Heaven and Earth in the Middle Ages: The Physical World before Columbus","review":"This book helped me to understand a lot of the false mythology that grew up around the discovery of the New World by Columbus. Many of these myths Professor Simek shows were totally untrue, and not accepted by the Medieval world. Such myths are; the flatness of the earth, the theological condemnation of Columbus's journey as immaterial, and the idea that the earth did not rotate on its axis.In addition, Simek also provides much information by both Greek and Latin authors as to how they solved peculiar cosmological problems which they viewed when studying the night sky.I found this book to be informative, short, easy to read and understand, with many pictures depicting physical explanations of problems, and also very interesting. I would definitely recommmend this book to be readby both students of history and astronomy."},{"Title":"Daniel Webster (American statesmen)","review":"Daniel Webster contributed a large potion of the Civil War. To begin, he was born in Salisbury, New Hampshire on January 18, 1782. His parents were farmers so many people didn't know what to expect of him. Even though his parents were farmers, he still graduated from Dartmouth College in 1801. After he learned to be a lawyer, Daniel Webster opened a legal practice in Portsmouth, New Hampshire in 1807.Webster quickly became an experienced and very good lawyer and a Federalist party leader. In 1812, Webster was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives because of his opposition to the War of 1812, which had crippled New England's shipping trade. After two more terms in the House, Webster decided to leave the Congress and move to Boston in 1816. Over the next 6 years, Webster won major constitutional cases in front of the Supreme Court making him almost famous. Some of his most notable cases were Dartmouth College v. Woodward, Gibbons v. Ogden, and McCulloch v.Maryland. He made himself the nations leading lawyer and an outstanding skilled public speaker or an orator. In 1823, Webster was returned to Congress from Boston, and in 1827 he was elected senator from Massachusetts.New circumstances let Daniel Webster become a champion of American nationalism. With the Federalist Party dead, he joined the National Republican party, he joined with Westerner Henry Clay and then endorsing federal aid for roads in the West. In 1828, since Massachusettses had shifted the economic interest from shipping to manufacturing, Webster decided to back the high-tariff bill of that year to help the small new manufacturing businesses grow. Angry southern leaders condemned the tariff, and South Carolina's John C. Calhoun argued that South Carolina had the right to nullify or ignore the law. Replying to South Carolina's Robert Hayne in a Senate debate in 1830, Webster triumphantly defended the Union states by a very powerful but short speech. He said, &quot;Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable,&quot; made him a favorite and made him well known among many people worldwide.Webster and President Andrew Jackson joined forces in 1833 to try to change South Carolina's attempt to abolish the tariff, but Webster and the Whigs battled him on other issues including his attack on the National Bank. Webster ran for the presidency in the election of 1836 as one of the three Whig candidates, but he mostly only Massachusetts voted for him so he lost badly because no one else voted for him. For the rest of his career he tried very hard to get to the presidency and ran in many elections hoping to get his shot at the office, but it never happened and he failed every time.In 1841, Daniel Webster came close to his idea of President but was only named secretary. President William Henry Harrison appointed him to this position. When he got killed in April 1841, John Tyler was brought to the presidency. In September 1841, all the Whigs resigned from the cabinet except Webster. He remained to settle an argument with Great Britain having to do with the Maine-Canada boundary and he wanted to finish the Webster-Ashburn Treaty, which he finally did in 1842. The Whigs finally pressured Webster enough so that he would leave the cabinet with everyone else in May of 1843.The annexation of Texas in 1845 and the war with Mexico, both which, were disliked by Webster, forced the country to face the issue of expansion of slavery. Webster opposed the expansion but feared even more the separation of the union over the dispute of the expansion of slavery. In a powerful speech on March 7, 1850, he supported the Compromise of 1850, lowering southern threats of separation but urging northern support for a stronger law for the recovery of fugitive slaves. Webster was again named secretary of state in July 1850 by President Millard Fillmore and supervised the strict enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act. Webster's stand on the Act divided the Whig party, but it helped preserve the Union and keep it together for a little while after until the Civil War started."},{"Title":"Half Nelson, Full Nelson","review":"This story is about a family in Louisana.

Wonderful book!!!"},{"Title":"The Horror Film","review":"It's been said (I think by Mark Twain) that a joke is like a frog. You can dissect it to see how it works, but it will lose its life in the process. Is the horror film also like a frog? For Peter Hutchings, the answer is almost. His analysis of horror film - appropriately titled The Horror Film - offers a lot of insight into the genre but doesn't kill enjoyment of it in the process.Hutchings starts off showing that it is difficult to even define what a horror film is. The term really only came into use in the 1930s with the original Universal monster movies, including Dracula, Frankenstein and The Mummy. Of course, in hindsight, it is easy to see possible horror movies from the silent era, including The Phantom of the Opera, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and The Golem. Is the existence of the supernatural a requirement? If so, what about movies like Psycho or Jaws? As Hutchings illustrates, even a rather clear-cut genre like the western is not easy to define; horror is even harder.Subsequent chapters in The Horror Film look at various elements in the horror film, such as the nature of monsters, the psychology of horror, the use of sound in horror and the differences between \\"classic\\" horror and \\"modern horror\\" (the latter roughly categorized as beginning with Rosemary's Baby and Night of the Living Dead, when \\"good\\" was less likely to triumph). Hutchings introduces us to the theories of other writers as well. Some consider the horror film as statements on race or class or gender differences, and while Hutchings gives such views their due, he also is clear that at times, overanalysis is done.Hutchings is both critical of the horror genre and affectionate towards it. This is not the easiest of reads and is seemingly designed for students of film more than the lay reader (such as myself). That is not to say that others won't get anything out of this, but this is not a quick page-turner. If you are a fan of horror movies and have the patience for this book, you are likely to get something out of it. The Horror Film will allow you to appreciate these movies in a new light."},{"Title":"The Horror Film","review":"I enjoyed reading this informative book. I read this along with \\"The Monster Show,\\" and I have to say that this book contained much more information about how to analyze the horror genre.

If you are looking for an introduction to analyzing horror films, I would read this. If you are looking for an introduction to the history of horror films, I would read, \\"The Monster Show.\\" Together, they complete a well rounded study of the horror film."},{"Title":"The Horror Film","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It is the first book that I have read relating to the study of film. I felt that the writing style was solid and there was a limited use of technical words. Each of the chapters was organized well.

I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a good basic introduction to the horror genre that is up to date and accessible."},{"Title":"The Horror Film","review":"This was for my Horror and Sci-Fi Film Analysis class, and I found it to be an appropriate overview of critically analyzing major films in the Horror Classics as well as the Modern. The author did a good job explaining in detail elements of what characterizes the horror genre, how culture plays a role in influencing the symbolism that pervades classic horror films, and the increased use of violent and sexual images in modern \\"slasher\\" films."},{"Title":"Tandem Towns of Texas: Tuxedo, Frognot, and Oatmeal (and Many More)","review":"There is so much dry wit and humor in this book that I am afraid any levity I might try to inject in this review would pale in comparison. For that reason, I'll just give you my opinion and let the book more or less speak for itself.The bottom line is that this tome is highly readable, humorous and educational at the same time. If there was a scale of average witticisms per page, I'm sure that Tandem Towns of Texas would hold the record.As set out in the Introduction, the purpose is twofold: 1) to spotlight Texas communities that have quirky monikers and double-digit populations, and, 2) to group them together in pairings based on natural association, alliteration, or rhyme. For example, Beaukiss and Lovelady, Trickham and Dodge, Ding Dong and Bells.Each page contains one of these pairings. Additionally, it tells the location of the towns, the derivation of the names, and the history of those towns, and (when needed) names spelled phonetically. The index has all of these names plus the population of each one.After more than 150 of these matches, this book provides some additional zany information. This would include (an amazingly long list of) Texas towns with the first names of people (Alvin, Leona, Melissa) then a huge listing of odd names from the other 49 states (Tomato, AZ, Bliss, NY, Burnt Corn, AL). Finally, if you haven't had enough of this silliness, the authors provide a listing of books that also feature unusual town names throughout the U.S.Found in the book is some pre-publication praise from John Troesser, editor and chief of a very popular history and travel magazine on the Internet. According to Troesser, \\"The table of contents itself is worth the price of admission for this delightful, witty, and (only slightly) thought-provoking book. Just what would Tarzan do in Notrees? There are perhaps six people in Texas capable of connecting Electria and Blanket. Bill and Clare Bradfield are two. The other four are blood relations who carry the same mysterious gene. . .

This book might have to be forced into a few homes.Nox,Chuck"},{"Title":"The theatre of magick","review":"What happens on a stage isn't real. What is revealed in this book is slight of hand. Your money, from your hand to theirs. That's what this book is about. This stuff does not work."},{"Title":"Patrol to the Golden Horn: Unabridged","review":"Alexander Fullerton is not just a superb writer of tension-packed action stories; he actually served as gunnery and torpedo officer in a Royal Navy submarine during World War II. \\"Patrol to the Golden Horn\\" has everything a lover of naval novels could wish for - an exciting plot, lots of action, character development, and so much closely-observed detail that you really feel you are breathing the choking, stinking air of that apparently doomed sub. The Great War has not received as much attention as WWII, especially the war at sea, and Fullerton's \\"Nicholas Everard\\" series does much to redress the balance. For my money he is up there with Douglas Reeman and John Winton. His writing is as good as C.S. Forester's; the difference is that Forester, much as he would have liked to, never became a naval officer himself. Having finished this book, you might be disappointed that the experience is over. Good thing, then, that it is part of a series! I plan to read them all."},{"Title":"Effective Executive's Guide to Microsoft Access 2002","review":"This is kind of a funny computer book. For one thing, it's really well-written. (Not always the case with computer books.) For another thing, it doesn't just document the program, it explains how to use Access 2002 to build a database. (The example used in the book is building a database of donors for a nonprofit agency, but as you read through the book you see pretty easily how things would work in your real database.)One thing I appreciated was the real world perspective. When I read about stuff like when you need to augment Access with SQL Server or Oracle and how much these options cost, I could tell the writers had used Access in real business settings.One important warning though. This isn't a big book on Access. Think of this book as &quot;Access for Dummies&quot; minus the silliness and humor but plus business advice and information. This book is a fast tutorial that will get you very proficient and comfortable. But it's not a book to turn you into an Access developer.By the way, I read this after reading a positive review in Library Journal (they recommended the Effective Executive's Guide series) and a very positive blurb in Publishers Weekly (they said these books, uniquely, tell people how to get their work done)."},{"Title":"Effective Executive's Guide to Microsoft Access 2002","review":"I was extremely pleased to see this volume in the 'Effective Executive's' series. I have used a couple of these already and recommend them to my partners. Being a lawyer, not a computer expert, it is very refreshing to find a series of books that understands and directly caters to my needs as a businessman. Most database books that I have found fall into two distinct categories: those written for computer experts, and those targeted at the home user. I don't need an expert's \\"bells and whistles\\" reference, and being hand-held slowly through cataloging my CD collection is quite annoying when I have business-related database problems to solve. The authors have done a good job of taking this subject and organizing it into a logical series of 'Steps'. The example project was easy to tailor to one of several that I have been attempting in my own office. Being able to download the tutorial files from the Internet was a great time-saver and enhanced the book greatly, in my opinion--it's nice to not have to spend an extra [money] for a CD that's mostly blank or filled with junk. This book is an excellent tool for those of us who want to quickly learn how to use Access in our work."},{"Title":"Effective Executive's Guide to Microsoft Access 2002","review":"This book was a very welcome discovery. So many of the books on Access are either endless tomes full of high-end programming that I'll never need for my business, or else they're those quick little guides that look like they cover it all but don't actually tell you how to &gt;do&lt; anything.This was exactly what I was looking for. Its got examples that are relevant to me as a business owner and I've given it to a friend who is an exec for a big insurance company (think &quot;pyramid&quot;) and he said its addressing his needs, too. It's written clearly, but it's also an enjoyable read. So many computer books are so dry. I was able to get down to business immediately after reading this, and my Access databases are up and running great.

The English monarch also reward Bishop for rescuing his favorite daughter born out of wedlock by naming him the latest spouse of eighteen year-old Merryn de Gay, a four time widow and mistress of Penwyth Castle. His Highness believes that Bishop might just be the person who can end the curse allegedly placed by witches or Druids that any male who takes Penwyth Castle by force or assaults its mistress will die as some of the King's men have.Bishop thinks humans have done the murders so he concocts a plan in which he will arrive as the King's Wizard sent to solve THE PENWYTH CURSE. That he figures should provide him the time and cover to learn what is truly going on in this Cornwell keep. Merrlyn thinks he is a lying brute, perhaps a bit more clever than the others. As she sees he is a lot more different than the previous men because he cares about people, the couple begins to fall in love. In a bygone era a wizard also seeks the love of an elusive butterfly.Catherine Coulter is at her best with this historical romance that tells the stories of parallel loves. The story line moves back and forth between the two periods. This technique displays the author's talent as both subplots enhance one another. The four prime players and the secondary cast make for quite a wonderful time for fans of the sub-genre who desire a fantasy twist to a strong novel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"An equal mix of curse and blessing, Catherine Coulter's annual historical offering The Penwyth Curse interweaves two stories - one set in the 13th century while another in a vague surreal magical realm where dark sorcery reigns. Sir Bishop of Lythe is rewarded by King Edward I to be the heir of Lord Vellan and stake his claim on the much-feared Penwyth Castle in Cornwall. He must wed Merryn de Gay who is rumoured to be cursed by Druid spells and alledgedly destroyed the four men who tried to compel her into submission. Bishop intends to find out if the curse exists or whether it is merely a coercing farce by introducing himself as a wizard.It is unexpected that Bishop experiences an otherworldly dreamscape in his pursuit abruptly and readers are hurtled towards the overlapping story of an ancient wizard finding his love Brecia in the oaks forest and they run into their nemesis Mawdoor. Catherine Coulter establishes a brittle and jarring link between the two stories that ruins the momentum of the first story as the main protagonist Bishop is clueless as the readers are. Worse still - Bishop and Merryn are such potential characters with much to be explored but Ms. Coulter seems to be enjoying herself too much to be detached from the paranormal world with splashes of magic and sorcery.There are the occasional moments of sparkling delight and bawdy passion but the plot does stultifying injustice to the attractive characters sculpted by Ms. Coulter. There is part adventure and danger as well as mayhem and passion. However we seem to be assimilating them in confusing, bewildering patches. Its sprawling tale may be majestic but the lack of cohesion is a much regretted curse."},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"Nineteen years after the original release of CHANDRA, Catherine Coulter returns to her historical romance roots with a new addition to her \\"Song\\" series.For as long as anyone can remember, Penwyth Castle and its surrounding lands have been protected by a curse. Simply stated, death will come to all who dare to take Penwyth and marry the maiden with the red hair and green eyes. Since the death of her father four years ago, red-headed (and green-eyed) Merryn de Gay is the marriage prize sought by those who want the castle. Four times married and widowed, Merryn has resigned herself to dying a much-wedded but never bedded maiden.When Sir Bishop of Lyte saves his daughter from a band of bandits, King Edward decides to award Bishop by giving him Lady Merryn de Gay in marriage and making Bishop the official heir to Penwyth Castle. However, Bishop has no desire to be the next victim of the Penwyth Curse, be it manmade or not. He decides that the only way to survive is to destroy the curse before he marries the Lady Merryn. To discourage any who might wish to poison him, Bishop arrives at Penwyth declaring himself a wizard sent by the king to dismantle the curse. When otherworldly things start to happen, Bishop begins to wonder if, perhaps, he might have some wizard powers after all. Dragging a reluctant Merryn along, the pair leaves Penwyth to unlock the secrets of its curse.Meanwhile, in another time and not-too distant place, a wizard prince has come to claim Brecia, the witch of the sacred oak forest, as his mate. Unfortunately, Brecia refuses to forgive him for setting her aside once before. To make matters worse, a wizard rival named Mawdoor has set his sights on Brecia as well. When Mawdoor traps the prince and Brecia in his tower, the pair decides to join forces to escape. As their story unfolds, their actions will have consequences for future generations...Unlike the other books in this series, THE PENWYTH CURSE has a healthy dose of the paranormal with its parallel tales. Ms. Coulter cleverly weaves and melds the two stories to create a new twist in some very ancient legends. The result is a romantic adventure steeped in lore and sorcery. The dialogue is sparkling and fun, although there are times when it bogs down into head-scratching confusion. Nevertheless, readers will enjoy getting to know Bishop, Merryn and their various antecedents, as well as catching up with Philippa and Dienwald from EARTH SONG.TheSchemer"},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"I fell in love with this book the first time I read it. I got the book on tape, and now I have it on my Kindle too!! I love how it jumps back and forth, her style is fantastic. Not a huge fan of the other Catherine Coulter books...but this was amazing!!"},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"This is the first book i have read from Catherine Coulter. I have read many good historical romance books, i was quite skeptical about this one.However, i was quite surprised as the plot was fresh and the story was actually, quite romantic. This book is unlike any other which u have read. From this book, i have gotten double dose of the romance, which involves 2 couples and you would come to love the 4 characters - even it might seem a bit too much for a romance book, as most only concentrate on 1 couple.You can expect some funny dialogues, some magic, and romance - what could have been better than to join magic and romance together?I would recommend that anyone who read it, should pay close attention, or find themselves getting lost in the dialogue or the story being messy. During the first \\"time shift\\" in the book, i was lost, but when the second \\"time shift\\" happened, i was quick to adjust to it. If you can get the story, it should be one of the best of her books.The book is indeed addictive, and certainly gets me going with another book of her's!"},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"I like this book even though the writing was sub-par. The characters are quite funny but a person must pay close attention while reading it or they may get lost. The story is a bit choppy but the characters are quite likable even the obnoxiously conceited wizard prince. Proofreading should have been better done, but I am glad I read it. Maybe because I like tales of magic and happy endings."},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"If you're expecting CC's usual medieval romance you'll be taken off guard and frequently jolted into a sometimes confusing paranormal story that transpires simultaneously in another dimension of time - which was meant to explain the history of the curse and how to break it. Personally, I enjoy it when an author adventures outside of their comfort zone and enters into challenging new territory. In this d&eacute;but, CC did a relatively decent job.I really did not feel the \\"romance\\" per say of the leading characters Bishop and Merryn's relationship, but I did feel it for the paranormal co-stars Prince and Brecia. However, I did view Bishop as being purely physically motivated for sex and Merryn by her curiosity and fascination of seeing, touch and becoming acquainted with a man as young as she; especially since she basically lived her entire life secluded within the walls of her castle and amongst elderly people. Each couple's journey for truth was unique, adventurous and amusing.As always, CC allows previous characters from her series to surface, by bringing in snippets of humor from scenes with Dienwald & Phillippa - they always remind me of \\"Ralph\\" and \\"Alice\\" in the 60's sitcom \`The Jackie Gleason Show'.This is what I would describe as a \\"float or sink\\" read; not one I would highly recommend nor judge the author's exceptional writing talents by."},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"There were moments in which I really enjoyed this book, but often I was thrown out of my state of disbelief bylittle thing like the phrasing of dialogue, the changing sense of continuity between thepast and the \\"present,\\" or the ferocity of the lust between the main characters (or their counterparts).There was just enough eerieness to keep the mind engaged in the paranormal mystery, but somehow it neverdeveloped into a seamless whole.An air book in places, but hardly a keeper."},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"I've read many books by this author and have enjoyed most of them. This book was enjoyable but it also dragged out much longer than it should have. There were two stories incorporated into one and this was not always done smoothly. Cute idea and shows much imagination."},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"This book was a huge disapointment. Catherine Coulter is a talented author and has delivered wonderful plots and characters in several genres--but The Penwyth Curse is one of the worst novels I've ever read. It was a chore to finish it and I found myself just thumbing through the last half of the book to find out what, if any, &lt;yawn&gt; connection was between the Prince/Brecia and Merryn and Bishop. The idea of the alternating chapers and times was good in concept but poorly executed and made me feel like I was involuntarily changing back and forth between two movies just when one had started to get interesting. I wish I'd have checked the reviews here before I wasted my money."},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"This book just dosn't desearve her name on the cover.As usuall Ms. Coulter give's us funny dialoge and steamy love sceans between our hero and heroine. I thought the beginning was wonderfull, unique, interesting. But toward the middle the book started to fall apart. The reader finds him/herself time hopping from era to era. And at first, you have no clue whats going on. It almost seems like two different short books glued together at this point in the story!! Even Stephen King readers would find it hard to follow along Ms. Coulter's wrighting style in this one.I give this book two stars..one star goes to the begining of the book which was suburband one star goes to the end of the book which was kinda cool, because Merryn and Bishop find a trinket that belonged to the great wizzard Merlyn....."},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"I'm glad to hear others share my opinion of the book.

I feel robbed."},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"Having loved the first four books in this series I was eager to read this one, until I read the other reviews, which were less than flattering. I am glad I ignored those reviews and read it anyway! I loved the weaving of past and present. The plot was fun, the characters had wit and charm, and there was balance between the good and evil. I am always a sucker for a good magic story anyway. I can't wait to read the next series!"},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"This is a first (and last) Catherine Coulter book I've read, or at least tried to read. What started out with great potential very quickly became a confusing, error-ridden mess. The only question I have is did this book not have to pass through editing? It is simply a mess, just a bunch of words on paper bounded together to impersonate a book. Shame on the publisher!"},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"When I first got this book I was reluctant to read it because I had just finished Rosehaven, which i disliked very much, but once I started I was plensently surprised. The characters are much more likeable and romance is much more probable. This is a very good story that blends medieval life and fantasy perfectly. Although the two romances had to be shorter, they were both very well develped and sweet. I loved trying to figure out how they were related and how the mystery would end."},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"Please just don't bother with this Catherine Coulter novel. It had major potential - a mystical/creative/unusual plot concept, but the extremely disjointed narrative and the ending leave you unfulfilled and frustrated. Basically, there are two stories here, one in the &quot;present&quot; time and one even further in the past. Unfortunately, neither story feels complete and Ms.Coulter is unable to weave these two complicated stories together in any coherent fashion, so you find yourself wondering what exactly is going on in practically every chapter. I say skip it and go with one of CC's much better novels (Impulse/Edge/almost anything!)."},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"This author has definitely written better books than this one. I was dissappointed with this novel, it goes on and on over the same thing, a romance between a witch and a wizard, and it was boring. The plot is totally confusing, with many irrelevant things, and of course, totally predictable: you know both couples will end together, no surprise there. I read it to the end because I always finish the books I start reading, but it was not worth the effort nor the money I spent on it."},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"This is one of the most dreadful books I've ever read. When it finally rained I felt like going outside and doing a rain dance. I dislike very few of C.Coulter's books, and this one is right up there with the bad.

Maybe someone will enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"I have most of Ms Coulter's books and love to read her, but the Penwyth Curse just didn't cut it.The Prince-Brecia story was totally far-fetched and took up too much of the book, when I really wanted to hear about Merryn-Bishop, or at least more about Merryn's wacky family.I thought the reason why the Prince-Brecia and Merryn-Bishop are connected was pretty lame. It would have made more sense to me if Prince-Brecia were ordinary people from an older time so it became a time-travel type of story.I also read fantasy and cannot understand why there are people who loved the Prince-Brecia story. You want fairy tales, there are better ones out there. The things the Prince and Brecia and Mawdoor do don't advance the story, they merely take up space. The way they get out of trouble is essentially to snap their fingers, use a bit of magic and hey presto, let's do something else so the reader can turn the pages.A properly-written magical story would have had more rules for the magic.Please let her next book be better!! I'm not going to buy another magic-related book of hers."},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"It didn't seem like Catherine wrote this. I was very disappointed in it.

This book sounded very disappointing. However, due to the fact that my boyfriend insisted on watching football, I decided to go purchase the book so I would have something to do. I believe that this book, while not a great one by the previous standards set by the author, is still a good book. It's a bit confusing at times but it still made me go, \\"aww\\" at the end. That, generally, is my definition of a good book. If I don't care about the characters it doesn't happen but in this book there were four characters that I found interesting."},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"I must say, I always look forward to Coulter's books. I scooped up this book with high hopes. Needless to say, I barely could make myself finish the book.I had no sympathy or liking for any of the characters and the plotline was just too confusing...jumping back through time to wizards and the like.

Boring, boring, boring."},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"This is the first book I have read by this author, and I don't think I will bother with any of her other books. I picked it up as a frequent reader of historical fiction, but I like most any book set in England during the middle ages. The dialogue was repetitive and contrived, and the characters were flat. I did finish the book just to see how creative the conclusion to the mystery was handled. Unfortunately, not very well. Many questions were left unanswered. It almost seems as though the author just keeps repeating and obsessing on the aspects of the story she has worked out, while trying to think up a satisfying ending. If the subject matter and appeals to you, try Michael Criton's \\"Timeline\\" or Connie Wells' \\"Doomsday Book.\\""},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"Don't judge Catherine Coulter's historical romances by this book! They are nothing like this. In most of Coulter's romances, her characters are rich and well thought out, and you &quot;feel&quot; everything the characters feel. Not this one. It's proof that even the best writers lose their touch and eventually begin to write just for the money. Don't waste your time on this book - pick one of Coulter's earlier historical romances instead. Most of them are worth 4 or 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"The Penwyth Curseby Catherine CoulterReviewer: Pamela Ackerson (author Home of the Braves trilogy)Now this is more like it. This book is what I expect from Catherine Coulter. The Penwyth Curse is, in my humble opinion, one of her best. It is a book you can grab on to and not let go until it is finished. This is a medieval, historical, double romance, time-travel, mystery and intrigue type book. It is great. It is chock full of everything and worth every turn of the page. Ms Coulter delivers!"},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"I was a little discouraged after reading other reviews here but I was glad that I stuck with reading this one. What a great adventure! This is the reason I read. To go to the unknown, know that anything can happen and enjoy the happy ending. I enjoyed both stories very much. It makes me again a believer that EVERYTHING happens for a reason. I enjoyed all the charaters in these stories and the way the author wrote them. I loved the name &quot;Bishop&quot;, how unique!"},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"I can't believe there are negative reviews. This was a joy to read and hard to put down. Both stories center around Penwyth with very enjoyable characters and much humor. I love the conversations between Coulter's characters. While the two stories don't seem to mesh at first, they blend by the end of the book. If you think of this more as two short stories along a common thread, then this is a 5-star book. Both stories are wonderful, sensual, witty and fun to read."},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"If you love Catherine Coulter books, forget that this one is even on the market, it simply is not in the same category as her previous novels.Bishop is commanded by the king to end the curse of Penwyth and marry the already 4 times widowed Merryn. Merryn resides in Pennwyth with a cast of elderly characters who do not want to see the curse ended as this will mean they have been conquered by someone they aren't going to like real well.Splice in flashbacks in the form of visions as Bishop attempts to tame Merryn at the same time that he comes to terms with his own status as a wizard, the tale jumps around and frankly would have been hard to follow if I had really cared about these characters.As usual, Coulter flashes back to previous characters, which is always fun. However, they have no real contribution to this tedious tome.When all comes together and the bad guys get theirs, you come to the conclusion that CC had reached the quota for the number of pages she needed to write and tied it all together in an implausible ending even for writers of this genre. It was like she had to tie it all together and boom that is it - we can get married. (Hey I am not giving anything away here, you know from page one they are getting married, you just don't know how it will all come together.)Hopefully the next will be much better. I wish I had skipped this one."},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"I am an avid reader of historical romances and have been very fortunate in my selections to find books that appeal to my sense of romance and emotions. I myself rely heavily on reviews and authors track records, and even if a book does get slammed, if it is from an author whose excellence has been proven in the past, I try to still give it an unbiased read.Set in the 13th century, this tells the story of Merryn, a young woman who is forced to marry four times and is widowed and still a maiden when Sir Bishop of Lythe arrives at castle Penwyth. (This plot line sounded real interesting to me!) Penwyth bears the brunt of an ancient curse, which declares that no man will ever take Penwyth, or it's heiress, by force. All four husbands died within hours of storming the castle and seizing Merryn. Is the curse real or is their foul play at work? Bishop is wise enough to take precautions and figures he'll be safe if he woos the lady first. He starts to settle into life at the castle, then he starts having dreams featuring an unknown wizard and witch and this is where I feel the novel itself starts falling apart - at least for me.The dream-story/real time story - eventually overpowers the romance between Merryn and Bishop and at one point - I wasn't sure who the story was about as I believe there was an editing mistake that spoke of Bishop but the story seemed to be related to the dream couple. It was very convoluted and difficult to follow. The jumping around from past to present left me dizzy. Bottom line, I couldn't find myself getting emotionally involved with either couple and although there were a few quite humorous moments in the dialogs, I didn't find it to be an enjoyable and relaxing read - it was too much work to figure out who was who and where!"},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"...mayhap I have picked the wrong Coulter novel with which to begin. Even still, I cannot say it has been totally without mirth. I have found some of the dialogue laugh-out-loud funny (audio book version.) Talking back in response to the ludicrous dialogue affords some diversion, though mayhap most for drivers around me.Must everything be redder than red, blacker than black, whiter than white, higher than high, etc? Did I really hear that the earth moved during a vigorous amatory adventure? In subject matter, this dialogue is clearly intended for adult audiences. In construction, it rivals \\"See Spot run\\". By all the saints' pimply noses, mayhap the most fun is to be derived from the creative and deliberately non-repetitive invocations of said saints. I could wish though that someone close to the author would favor us by building an auto-correct into her word processor to over-ride \\"mayhap\\" and \\"hard\\".Oh, aye, I'll finish it (it really is a long, boring drive home and it is futile to wish the time back) but I'm glad this was a library freebie. By all the saints' split ends, I'd have been madder than mad had I purchased it."},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"When the king rewards Bishop with Merryn of Penwyth as his bride, the gift is a perilous one.

If he does so, he will die, and so far, that has been true. Bishop is however, a cunning man, and plots to win his bride's heart, and then claim what is his and live. He kidnaps her, and on the journey away, becomes haunted by strange dreams of someplace else. In this other world, a man seeks an elusive magical woman as his lover and wife. As the story unfolds, the two tales intertwine, and the key to one is the answer to the other as well.*** This overlapping story, well crafted by past masters, such as Cynthia Freeman, is more than slightly confusing here. Although Merryn is the standard Coulter heroine, full of fire and strength, and Biship is a dark, mysterious hero, the plotline is extremely difficult to follow, diminshing the enjoyment of otherwise interesting personalities. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"I was very disappointed in the much anticipated book. I had hoped for an exciting story about a curse and people in love. What I got was a time travel story with Witches, Warlocks etc... And a character who kept pulling one of the main characters back in time.I found this story confusing and disappointing. Not up the Coulter's usual excellent writing. There seemed to be parts of the story that were missing and that she had to force some aspects of the story to get things to match up. There were sections where things mysteriously appeared with no real explanation etc... At the same time I kept listening in hopes of being more interested.I recommend that you either look to the Legacy Series or read the Song series.Don't buy this one new. I'd wait until you could get it used."},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"I love Catherine Coulter. Her books have always been a joy to read. This book does not reflect the Catherine Coulter I know. The story line and the characters were boring. It is obvious that the time was not taken to develop this story the way it should have been. Catherine Coulter and other romance writers have started focusing more on writing suspense books while still trying to write romance. If this is what romance readers get in the bargain then please leave the romance writing to those who will put the time and effort into giving us great stories with great characters."},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"After reading the other reviews of The Penwyth Curse, I feel like I may be missing something. I absolutely loved this book! Perhaps because I read it as a fairy tale. A wonderfully romantic fairy tale. With magic, good over evil, and living happily ever after.I can understand one of the criticisms. The characters in the story did seem a bit flat. It felt to me that we weren&#65533;t given much time in the character&#65533;s heads; how they thought about things etc. But the relationships, within the context of the story, still seemed totally believable and endearing to me. Another criticism in the reviews I read was that the two story lines seemed disjointed. I have to disagree. I will admit, the first time the story switched to &#65533;Sometime Else&#65533;, I found it distracting and didn&#65533;t know what was going on. But then as the story progressed, the stories were drawn closer and closer together, and more relevant to each other, to the point of a complete connection at the end.And the story of The Prince and Brecia was WONDERFUL! I would LOVE to see an entire book dedicated just to them!This is a unique and fun story. I&#65533;ve read over 200 romance novels and consider this to be one of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"I have been a Catherine Coulter reader for 15 years, starting with her regency novels (very rare now). They were engaging and well-written. Her current offering is neither. I purchased it, more fool I, fully knowing that it wouldn't stand up to the Song trilogy that it relates to. I just wanted to see Dienwald & Phillippa again!As in the most recent novels, The Penwyth Curse lacks real depth and character development. The reader is only able to see the surface of the characters, and, given the off-the-wall ways that these characters act and react, this only serves to frustrate the reader. We can only guess at what motivates Merryn to accept Bishop - lust, perhaps - when we could have been treated to a rich internal dialogue about how she doesn't want to be alone anymore, or how she would love to fill her keep with red-headed children, or how she needs a big strong warrior to kill all the spiders in her tower room. Since only the lust is apparent, Merryn doesn't make a particularly sympathetic heroine. Nor is Bishop a sympathetic hero: he lies and says he's a wizard (from whence did that errant though spring?), he threatens repeatedly to rape Merryn, then to stake her out on a hill until she drowns from torrential rain. Who wants to read about these people?Not me. This one goes to the second-hand bookstore, where I will get all my Coulter in the future. I cannot stomach paying full-price for this quality of writing any longer."},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"Reading The Penwyth Curse, you almost believe there are two different writers at work - one moment you're reading fairly interesting dialogue and descriptions, and the next minute you read &quot;it would be a very bad thing&quot;, and the words &quot;simply&quot; and &quot;just&quot; repeated dozens of times throughout the book! The worst? &quot;she was so afraid she almost puked from it&quot; Oh, puhleez!It had potential, but &quot;just&quot; didn't succeed. &quot;Simply&quot; didn't."},{"Title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"This book was a huge disapointment. Catherine Coulter is a talented author and has delivered wonderful plots and characters in several genres--but The Penwyth Curse is one of the worst novels I've ever read. It was a chore to finish it and I found myself just thumbing through the last half of the book to find out what, if any, &lt;yawn&gt; connection was between the Prince/Brecia and Merryn and Bishop. The idea of the alternating chapers and times was good in concept but poorly executed and made me feel like I was involuntarily changing back and forth between two movies just when one had started to get interesting. I wish I'd have checked the reviews here before I wasted my money."},{"Title":"Surviving Without a Secretary (Crisp Fifty Minute Series)","review":"I cant believe I bought this. It is completely outdated and has no real information. The book basically gives you 50 tips to improve your productivity. However, the tips are so basic that even an 18 year old intern could figure them out on the first week. Worthless information."},{"Title":"Tales Cthulhu Mythos V-1","review":"Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos actually only contains one story by HP Lovecraft, the now infamous \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\". However, many other masters of horror contribute chilling, spine tingling tales of horror so powerful that if you read them, your mind will break! Personally, I recommend \\"The Return of the Sorcerer\\" by Clark Ashton Smith. Don't skip over this dark gem.This is a great starting off point for people wanting to begin reading tales of Lovecraft's great and masterful mythos."},{"Title":"Tales Cthulhu Mythos V-1","review":"This is a paperback reprinting of half of the stories in the original Arkham House edition of TALES OF THE CTHULHU MYTHOS that August Derleth published in 1969. It includes the problematic introduction to that book, in which Derleth quotes from what is now known to be a statement never made by Lovecraft, what is termed the infamous \\"black magic\\" quote. That aside, this anthology of Cthulhu Mythos fiction (a term that was never used by Lovecraft and was probably the invention of August Derleth) is wonderful. One of Lovecraft's best tales, \\"The Call of Cthulhu,\\" is included in this, Volume One. (Lovecraft's \\"The Haunter of the Dark\\" is included in Volume Two.) Neil Gaiman, in a DVD interview discussing Lovecraft, calls this tale \\"a crap story.\\" I find it an extremely powerful and original story, beautifully expressed. The magnificent silent film version of \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" created by The H. P. Lovecraft Historical Society has revealed to me that, as a tale of strange adventure and nameless horror, this is a great work of weird fiction.Two stories are included by one of Lovecraft's best friends, Frank Belknap Long. In his study, THE RISE AND FALL OF THE CTHULHU MYTHOS, S. T. Joshi dismisses \\"The Space-Eaters\\" as a bad story, yet it is a tale of which I am fond. Perhaps S. T.'s dislike of the story comes from the use of the Christian cross as a way of thwarting cosmic evil; yet it must be remembered that H. P. Lovecraft himself used this same symbol in exactly the same way in \\"Dreams In the Witch House.\\" This was probably the first tale of Cthulhu Mythos written by someone other than Lovecraft, and one of its main characters is a loving portrayal of Lovecraft himself. It has moments of exquisite horror. \\"The Hounds of Tindalos\\" is a powerful and original tale of cosmic evil, one that haunts the imagination.Other tales by Clark Ashton Smith, Robert E. Howard, August Derleth and Henry Kuttner are all competent works of weird fiction. The Robert E Howard story has long haunted me, and I made several references to \\"The Black Stone\\" in various stories in my own collection of Mythos fiction, THE FUNGAL STAIN AND OTHER DREAMS.But what makes this edition important is that it includes J. Vernon Shea's delightful \\"The Haunter of the Graveyard,\\" which was removed from the newer edition of the book edited for Arkham House by James Turner in 1990 (and it is this newer revised ans expanded edition that has been reprinted by Del Rey as trade paperback). Turner removed two excellent stories: this one by Vernon, and the effective James Wade story, \\"The Deep Ones.\\" Happily, S. T. Joshi will be reprinting the James Wade tale in a forthcoming Mythos anthology that he is editing for Mythos Books. Shea's tale is merely a bit of gruesome fun, but it is entertaining and well-written. He told me that he was working on the story when the invitation came from Derleth for Vernon to write a tale for the initial edition of TALES OF THE CTHULHU MYTHOS. Vernon had not planned the story to feature the mechanics of the Mythos, but brought the Mythos into the tale so that it would fit in with the theme of Derleth's anthology. J. Vernon Shea was one of H. P. Lovecraft's young correspondents, and many of Lovecraft's letters to him are included in the SELECTED LETTERS volumes published by Arkham House. I am glad that these pb editions of Derleth's initial anthology are still available, so that we may continue to enjoy Vernon's delightful tale. How I wish I never sold my own copy of the original hardcover -- it sells for around $300 now!"},{"Title":"Tales Cthulhu Mythos V-1","review":"All the authors in this book, with the exception of J. Vernon Shea, were personal friends or correspondents of H. P. Lovecraft. Several are distinguished authors in their own right. One, Clark Ashton Smith, could arguably be said to have made some fine contributions to the Cthulhu Mythos. But, apart from Frank Belknap Long's \\"The Hounds of Tindalos\\", none of this collection's stories are worth reading on their own merits.It was Lovecraft's \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" which gave the Mythos its name. While not Lovecraft's personal best, it is certainly one of the central Mythos stories. It has held up well after more than 60 years. That can not be said for many of his imitators. As this collection shows, there's some alchemy at work in Lovecraft's prose beyond the characteritic plot structures and adjectives, the props of gods/ETs and forbidden books, a power based in a carefully constructed paranoia with a decided scientific air about it -- and not reworked mythology.The worse offender here is the editor, personal friend, and arguable savior of Lovecraft's reputation: August Derleth. But Derleth's introduction shows he misunderstood Lovecraft. Instead of extraterresterial gods who care as little for human concerns as we do for sidewalk bugs, Derleth recast Lovecraft's work of cosmic callousness and amorality in to a Christian tale of Good and Evil. Where others of Lovecraft circle saw elaborate in-jokes via shared allusions of fearful tomes and alien races, Derleth chose to establish a systematic mythology of elementals. He imposed specificity on what had been disturbing, but vague. Derleth's two tales here, \\"The Dweller in Darkness\\" and \\"Beyond the Threshold\\" use Lovecraft plot devices and blasphemous books and allusions to Lovecraftian locales and are told in a Lovecraft prose style, but they are pallid imitations whose main point of interest is that Derleth chose his own native locale, Wisconsin, for the stories just as Lovecraft used his native New England. Derleth's air elemental, Ithaqua, is mildly interesting.Smith made his own ornate additions to the Mythos, but the best aren't here. His \\"The Return of the Sorcerer\\" is sometimes cited by Smith fans as his worst story. It's not bad as a biter-bitten tale, but it shows none of the ornate brilliance of his other work. Indeed, there's nothing except the byline to show it is a Smith story. \\"Ubbo-Sathla\\" is better and about the author of one of those legendary books Lovecraftian stories are full of. Still, it's not very memorable. Smith frequently did much better.Robert E. Howard, creator of Conan the Barbarian and Solomon Kane, shows up here with \\"The Black Stone\\". It's notable only for featuring Howard's addition to the library of suppressed books: _Unausssprechlichen Kulten_.Long's \\"The Hounds of Tindalos\\" succeeds by following in the thematic footsteps of Lovecraft's \\"The Dreams in the Witch-House\\" and his collaboration with E. Hoffman Price, \\"Through the Gates of the Silver Key\\". The ideas of Einstein and John Dee become \\"strange bedfellows\\" in a linking of extradimensions, and the entities that haunt their strange angles, with magic. Long's \\"The Space-Eaters\\" features brain eating aliens, and it's main attraction is the character of Howard, a horror writer who stands in for Long's friend Howard Lovecraft. (The narrator is Frank.) One wonders if Howard's thoughts on his predecessors in horror fiction, sharper than those on the same writers in Lovecraft'sSupernatural Horror in Literature, were taken directly from Long's conversations with Lovecraft.J. Vernon Shea brings Lovecraft up to date by having his unfortunate protagonist be the tv host for shlocky horror movies. Theatrically living near a cemetary, he runs afoul of the spirit of a deceased sorceror. The best bit here is that the host's favorite authors are Thomas Peacock and Jane Austen and not H. P. Lovecraft and Arthur Machen -- though he finds time to read them in the graveyard.There's nothing wrong with Henry Kuttner's \\"The Salem Horror', a reworking of \\"The Dreams in the Witch-House\\". But there's nothing exceptional either. Certainly nothing even approaching his work with C. L. Moore.But that's the case with most of these stories. You won't be angry or upset you read them -- but most won't linger in your mind either or surprise you."},{"Title":"Unless You Repent","review":"PLEASE DO NOT OVER LOOK THIS BOOK. It is an old book but extremely important. I have read many books regarding the doctrine of repentance from various view points but none has come close to this one. This is literally the best book on the subject. The author defends repentance at salvation from a traditional dispensational school of thought but He is not an antinomian, I can assure you of that. At the opening of the book, he writes:\\"It can never be out of place to proclaim salvation by free, unmerited favour to all who put their trust in the Lord Jesus Christ. But it needs ever to be insisted on that the faith that justifies is not a mere intellectual process-not simply crediting certain historical facts or doctrinal statements; but it is a faith that springs from a divinely wrought conviction of sin which produces a repentance that is sincere and genuine.\\" Chapter 1This book should be marketed and re-published for a greater audience. I think it would do well, especially in our day."},{"Title":"Unless You Repent","review":"This reprint of Except Ye Repent by H.A. Ironside is a thorough and important study of biblical repentance for all interested in understanding this important subject. Although the focus of the book is repentance as it relates to the person in need of salvation through faith in Christ, one of the many benefits I received from reading this book was a fuller realization of the importance of repentance in the Christian's life.The text has been lightly edited; primarily minor changes like paragraph breaks, capitalization, italicization, etc. There is, however, some re-wording, although I found only one instance where I would question the change (my preference is to leave the author's original words unchanged). This edition includes helpful subject and scripture indexes. Used copies of the original 1937 edition are available, but be sure to verify the edition you are purchasing."},{"Title":"Unless You Repent","review":"This book discusses a subject that seems forgotten in America. Repentance and Faith are both needed for a man to be saved. Those who say you can repent and continue living in a sinful lifestyle are wrong. Those who say you must repent and stop sinning are wrong. Repentance is a change of mind in relation to sin, self, and the Saviour. Repentance means a change of mind. This is not \\"works salvation\\". If YOU REPENTING is \\"works\\" then why is it when YOU BELIEVE that is not \\"works\\". You are doing both. Repentance is a change of mind that results in a change of action. If you change your mind about sin, then you will no longer want to live in it. It doesn't mean you will stop sinning, but that you will not want to. That is not \\"works\\" that is evidence. John the Baptist said \\"Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance.\\" Mat.3:8 Repentance is part of salvation. Faith and repentance cannot be seperated and are not the same. You cannot have faith without repentance, and you cannot have repentance without faith."},{"Title":"Unless You Repent","review":"Having read other books by H.A. Ironside, and having a great deal of respect for William MacDonald, I thought the book would be a doctrinal but dry look at the Biblical teaching on repentance. It is a docrtinal look at repentance, but it is so much more.I liked H.A. Ironside's look at the main theme of the book of Job. What an insight! Brother Ironside's comments in passing on a particular translation of the Bible, reveal the mistranslation of \\"do pennance\\" rather than the faithful to the greek translation of \\"repent\\". The historical synopsis in the back of the book on the history in America of the teaching on Repentance was an eye-opener for me, and alone justified the cost of the book.For anyone wanting a biblical view of repentance, and the occasional precious jewel of knowledge thrown in as well, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Unless You Repent","review":"A most excellent book! Written very well with the Biblical evidence that repentance of our sins is on the flip side of the 'coin' of genuine faith. There is far too too little of the call of repentance in the church today and as a result we have way too much of an easy believeism in the church for the lack there of. Repentance is indeed the very goodness of God toward us just as faith is a gift from Him to us through Jesus Christ, man's only Savior."},{"Title":"Annual Editions: Physical Anthropology 05/06","review":"This is the longest shipping time I have ever seen for a textbook.

I've been indifferent about many I've worked on that've found success anyway and enthusiastic about others that haven't necessarily found favor in the marketplace. So my personal preferences certainly haven't made me an authority about public reception or perception (or sales figures).I don't give praise lightly. But when I edit something that offers me truly useful and valuable information, that really makes me want to revisit my old practicing-artist self, I can't help but express my enthusiasm. And A Glaze of Color made me enthusiastic. It really inspired me to take up the craft of painting again, to just indulge myself in working with color again, no matter what the medium.So, discount my positive prejudice here if you must, but next time you're in a book store searching for some kind of artistic inspiration, for yourself or for your kids or for anyone, please look for Jane Davies's book A Glaze of Color, even just to thumb through it.(Hey, I'm a freelancer, so have no stake in encouraging profits for the publisher, author, or, least of all, myself.)"},{"Title":"A Glaze of Color: Creating Color and Design On Ceramics","review":"As an art teacher, I'm often looking for books that will benefit (inspire) my students.

Satire plays off culture, cultural references become obsolete and more often than not are unfamiliar to outsiders. \\"Master and Margarita\\" does not spend much time on exposition.The story of \\"Master and Margarita\\" is actually that of Satan and his four knights visiting Moscow in the thirties to play subversive pranks off the common traits and rites in that period of soviet society. Devil here does not so much seduce as exposes people for what they are. The milieu is mostly writers and artists and if you are one of them you might recognize and enjoy the natural buffoonery of the scene.The story of Master and Margarita is second storyline, the story of \\"true love\\". The common motif running through it is that of dignity. No quips about this one except for the idyllic ending - a cozy country house \\"somewhere over the rainbow\\", is rather coy to be good.The third is the short, tight story of Pontius Pilate, crucifixion and bears some references to The Terrible Vengeance by Gogol, I think."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"If there really is a Devil somewhere in the universe, I'm sure he closely resembles Bulgakov's Woland (along with his imfamous band of sidekicks).

It was sometime just after I left high school and I picked the book up in a corner store near where I lived. One of the owner's was a force for good and took it upon herself to make literature available in the neighbourhood. Ours was a university town but our neighbourhood was the poor one and the residents were regarded with genteel contempt by the university and business groups. Robertson Davies lived there and captured all of this in his Salterton trilogy which describes the town and with it its attitude to the 'North End' among other things. (If you have not read the books of the trilogy, I highly recommend them.)The owner insisted that her book rack be stocked with some literature over the protests of the distributors who said that only pulp would sell in the North End. I bought the book and with it I saw what the power of imagination and words could be. I had not been exposed to anything like it previously. In a real way, it did give me the opportunity to change my life. Now that is not bad for a paperback that cost me only a few dollars.I see from the ratings given here that others agree with me that this is a wonderful book full of imagination. It would be a great gift to a young relative or an old one for that matter.I recommend it strongly."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"This the most bizarre book I've read in a long time--maybe ever. It is also an amazing story, or stories told in a fun and entertaining way. This is a must read for fans of Russian literature. I have to confess that I was not able to pick up many of the allusions to Soviet Russia. That's probably not something you'd get unless you read this in Russian and had a good understanding of Bulgakov's period. Bulgakov also weaves Christians themes in the novel, mainly through a storyline about Pontius Pilate. However, this storyline is completely unlike the Biblical account. It is unclear what theological points Bulgakov was making if any. Regardless, it is an entertaining book which will stimulate your imagination. 3.5 stars"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"First, I am Russian and I've read this book in Russian.

So, if you want to better understand me you have to read this.Although, I can imagine the text to be a little difficult for an American -- some of the names are difficult to read and pronounce and you completely loose their meaning (some are transliterated rather than translated).There is a laugh on ever page and by the end of the book you will be in good mood and in deep thoughts."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"The Master and Margarita is first-class satirical farce; a glorius manifestation of magic realism; a personal and artistic triumph for its doomed author. It is a sweeping love story of the old-fashioned sort, a riveting re-telling of the death of Christ, but more than that- it is a spell-binding affirmation of what it means to be a human being, what it means to stay integral to ones beliefs, to ones art, in the face of darkness and depravity.It makes you laugh until you realize you are crying."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Only a writer as skilled as Bulgakov could pull off a story that interweaves the crucifixion of Jesus into a Faustian tale featuring the devil. But The Master and Margarita is so much more than the typical good versus evil novel. It's also an eye-opening social and political commentary, one that's so scathingly obvious that it didn't see the light of day until forty years after Bulgakov's death. The deep themes and hidden undertones are everywhere, but you don't need a Ph.D. in literature or a Master's degree in Russian history to enjoy this book. Although a little slow-going at first, the action quickly picks up in part two and the chapters leading up to Satan's ball will have you breathlessly ripping through the pages. The dark and bitter cold Moscow provides a fitting backdrop for this well-deserving classic."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"If you look for an intelligent, funny, grotesque, phantastic, never-boring, hilarious book - this is it.

But even then certain things were not allowed to make their way into print, nudity and oblique references to the terror that gnawed at the Soviet Union during the 1930's were deleted. two previous translations were carried out. One based on the censored Soviet text and the other based on the text as Bulgakov intended it. This, the third translation combines the best elements of both, being at the same time reaqdable and complete.This may make The Master and Margarita sound rather dull indeed. However, rarely has a wittier and at the same time more profound book come out of Russia. The book follows the adventures of the Devil and his mihions as they cause havoc on Stalinist Russia, visiting destruction upon the petty bureaucrats who were having such a profound effect on Russia. These antics are a funny as anything ever attempted by the Marx Brothers. But this book also features the love story between the Master and Margarita who like the principle characters of Dickens are often pushed off center stage by Bulgakov's demons. There is also an account of the last days of Christ (or is it?. Though an enjoyable read, in the final estimation, this is a profoud meditation on the nature of good and evil."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Before writing a book review, I always attempt to determine what the intent of the author was and how successfully the desired effect was achieved. So what, exactly, is the purpose of Bulgakov's \\"The Master and Margarita?\\"Is it to satire the literary intelligentsia of the Soviets? Is it to criticize the over-regulation and policies of the government? Is it to bash the atheistic policy of the state? Is it to provide an insightful account of Pontius Pilate and the crucifixion? Is it to reveal the vanities and greed of money inherent in society as a whole? Or is it simply to provide a humorous tale of the shenanigans of Satan incarnate and his demonic entourage?The answer, of course, to all of these questions is yes. \\"The Master and Margarita\\" is an enigmatic, unique, and even bizarre novel at times, that will challenge the reader. At first, the intent of Bulgakov is not entirely clear, as the first chapters detail the strange (and seemingly unrelated) tales of ordinary Muscovites and their encounter with an enigmatic foreigner, Woland, and his interpreter and talking black cat. Interspersed in this tale of Stalinist Moscow is the seemingly unrelated (and misplaced) story of a guilt-ridden Pontius Pilate and the crucifixion of two thousand years prior. The third subplot, and a link between the first two, is the story of the \\"master\\", an author whose book about Pontius Pilate was widely criticized by the literary Soviet elite, and his vivacious and adulterous lover, Margarita.Bulgakov does not directly bash the atrocities of the Soviets and collectivism, but through his interrelated tales, he paints a subtle criticism of the institutions and ideals of the Soviets. The fact that his tale (albeit embellished) of Pontius Pilate and the crucifixion is given as fact, this would, of course, directly counter the official state's atheism. The emphasis on official documents and passports provides a window into the life of a Muscovite, for if there is no official document, then that person does not exist.This is not a novel that should be read piecemeal, as it is best to read it in large sections at a time. The chapters alternate between characters (and millennia) frequently, as a link does not emerge until later. Since this is a Russian novel with a large cast of characters, the names can certainly be confusing and intimidating to keep straight. Overall, I was initially perplexed at the complexity of the novel, but as it progressed, it become more enjoyable.This is certainly a unique novel. Although it may be difficult to read at first, I would recommend it as an insightful, and humorous, tale of Stalinist Moscow."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Despite a horrid pun, Master and Margarita is a masterful work and my favorite of Bulgakov's works. In addition to sardonic humor of the literary circles in russia, a vodka-drinking tom-cat, and naturally a devil's ball--one has to admire the political and opinionated nature of the author. I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in reading Russian literature and who enjoys heavy, thought-provoking humor. Note that this is not an easy book to read, but rather a book for an intellectual to take to the beach."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"As far as I know, this book has the most percentage of readers in Former Soviet Union among all. I haven't seen a person in St.Petersburg (my birth town) who haven't read it. And everyone says this book had the greatest impact on their lives. Excellent work! A true masterpiece. Recommended for all."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Albeit I love George Orwell and Kurt Vonnegut, I have to label &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; as the best book I've ever had the priviledge to read. Clearly, Bulgakov is an insane author, which kind of makes sense of the cat who rips the emcee's head off, and the naked witch riding a pig. I loved every second of this book, and actually stopped reading &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; because Bulgakov's work was so much more fascinating. If you have a day to set aside, I guarantee you, you'll devour the entire work. The devil wreaking havoc in Moscow makes for fast reading."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"This is my favorite book. I'm not sure it's a good translation, so if you know Russian you have to read it in Russian."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Really I'm not into highly philosophical works, but Master and Margarita can be read purely for the adventure and the humour as well as the though-provoking criticism of Communist Russia. If at all possible, read it in the original Russian, if not, this translation is definately the final authority, i found it to capture the essence of Bulgakov's language (which is extremely important to the book, almost as important as the plot). Do not despare if you don't understand the very Russian humour, push on and u'll defintely discover a book to read and reread. very high ten."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"In my second painful year of Russian, I had my nose forcibly pushed into the first chapter of the original M&amp;M by a stony Muscovite teacher with all the humor of a gaggle of gulags. Despite the brutality of the initial introduction, I loved what I read. After combing through all the translations I could find, I finally decided that I would rather spend an entire summer cross-referencing my Russian copy with a battery of dictionaries then read a horrifically stilted English version that had none of the song or joy or humor of the original. It was then horrible and wonderful to happen upon the Burgin/O'Connor translation, where the words dance across the page. While they may not exactly be doing the original tarantella, it's closer than the box step other translations present. To describe the story is to do disservice to Bulgakov's brilliance - this book is about the entire human race."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Even if you already have read &quot;Master and Margarita&quot; read it again in this new translation! It is worth it because it's superior. The flawless work by D.Burgin and K.O'Connor gives to American readers a rare opportunity to taste one of the greatest entrees of Russian literary cuisine genuine and fresh.The three-day adventures of The Prince of Evil in the capital of the world's atheism prove that human nature remains human nature - communism or not.

Set againstthe background of the communist era, the Russian authormakes Satan come to Moscow and turn the regular-paced cityupside down. Spiced with bits of political satire, Masterand Margarita revolves around an almost fairy-like storyof two lovers, torn apart by life and brought backtogether by the devil himself. This is a surrealisticbook filled with surprises. Any open-minded reader with a senseof humor will surely add it to their favorite list."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Brilliant story combining parody, wit, sarcasm, and symbolism. Uses character sketches from Goethe, provides general plot movement like Thomas, and the conversations and story flow seem as if they were edited by Tarantino. Story is existential and pure fantasy, however, thoroughly covers Nietzche's nihilism, a spoof of the Soviet regime, a fable directly inverse to Faust, and his own personal attacks on the efficiency of the socialism/communism movement. Deep-rooted, but hysterically written"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"This amazing book can be interpreted at several levels or just read for the sheer enjoyment of the bazaar antics of all the characters. I found it to be full of profound concepts wrapped in a chaotic and fantastic romp of a good story.First, I thought the story was a tale of revenge. Bulgakov was highly discriminated against and his work suppressed throughout his career and life. A genius' work is smothered by Soviet brainless censors while a literaray elite develops composed of talentless writers and editors who only push the Communist Party line. Bulgakov has these nit-wits become the play-toys of the Devil in a story of hilarious dark comedy. Bulgakov never got revenge against the system that impoverished him until after his death when readers laugh at the incredible uncomfortable situations the Devil creates for the Moscow talentless literary elite.Second, the tale is a satiric critique of the Soviet system under Stalin. Many Soviet methods of social control, such as apartment assignments by the state, set the stage for wild adventures for Soviet citizens caught in this overly centralized society. The chapter on the Soviet authorities trying to take over the apartment of the be-headed editor from the Devil and his assistants is some of the most clever satire ever written. The magic shows performed by the Devil in a state-owned theater was a perfect commentary on the weaknesses of the Soviet system.Third, the novel is a superb essay on the killing of God as a political act. The Devil is delighted to come to the Soviet Union where belief in God is under attack and atheists rise to positions of power and status. The Soviets tried to kill God to better control their citizens. The genius of this book is that Bulgakov tells us the tale of Pontius Pilot and the High Priest of Jerusalem playing a careful came of strategy with the life of Jesus Christ. Both men had reasons to kill Jesus so that they could both maintain political power. But these two men are wise and they wish for the other party to take the blame for the crucifiction. Since Jewish law did not allow for the death penalty, the High Priest must manipulate Pilot to give the orders. However Pilot uses spys and murderers to cast blame back on the Jewish leadership by murdering Judas and throwing thirty silver pieces into the home of the High Priest. God must always be killed/maimed/distorted for a totalitarian government to maintain control. Suppression of God doesn't simultaneously suppress the Devil.Fourth, the events related in the story are extremely fun to read. The encounter with the Devil in the public park, the scenes in the dead editor's apartment, the magic show, the insane assylum, the Devil's ball, the flashbacks to Jerusalem, all will stick in your mind for days after you finish the book.This novel was finally released after Bulgakov had been dead for 30 years. The Devil in the story predicts this future when he says: \\"Manuscripts don't burn.\\""},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I have read \\"The Master and Margarita\\" three times, and I am sure that I will read it again. I was very lucky because all three times I read it in Russian, and even the best translation can not compare to the original. Every time I would find something new in the book, it would turn to me by different facets. \\"The Master and Margarita\\" is deep, very well written book with unforgettable characters. In fact, it is not one novel but three. First, about the adventures of Devil and his entourage in the 1920-th Moscow; second, about Pontius Pilatus and Jesus in Jerusalem, and the third one, about the Master, the writer who wrote the second novel, and his eternal and true love, Margarita. The story about Master and Margarita is the story of Bulgakov and his wife and muse, Elena. All three stories are connected and intertwine. All three of them end with the exactly same phrase. So, what is the book about? Good, evil, betrayal, talent, love, forgiveness? Yes, it is. But it is so much more."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"In THE MASTER AND MARGARITA, nothing is as it seems. A foreign professor turns out to be Satan, currency transforms into worthless paper, and luxurious clothing vanishes off the bodies of respectable women. The same can be said of the plot: on the surface, this novel is about the arrival of the Devil in Moscow and all the havoc he wreaks until he can settle his business with a failed novelist (the Master) who has written about Pontius Pilate. However, Bulgakov's novel is not merely a story about the Devil's antics; it is about oppression and persecution, about misguided government, about literary and personal self-importance, about devotion and bravery, about illusions. The satire is thick and multi-layered, with allusions and symbols that have kept scholars busy since the novel surfaced in the late sixties. Thankfully, you don't need any special knowledge to enjoy this hilarious send-up of life - political, literary, social - in the Soviet Union of the late 1920's, although the more you know about the Soviet Union and Bulgakov's life, the better you will understand the intent.Despite the danger in writing such a mocking novel of the Soviet regime, Bulgakov obviously had enormous fun writing this book. Who wouldn't want to turn a nosy neighbor into a pig, or behead an annoying control freak and then reattach his head? How much fun to have a man hauled off to prison, not for the bribe he just accepted, but for possessing foreign currency he knows nothing about. Satan's band itself is a ragtag group of dirty, bizarre-looking misfits who wiggle their way into Soviet society. Surprisingly, the brilliance of this novel is not its humor; it is the expert way with which Bulgakov links Pontius Pilate's interaction with Jesus to the desolate life of a novelist and his lover by developing parallel plots that merge in the final pages.I highly recommend this novel for readers of fine literature."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I bought this book here after getting two independent recommendations and seeing it mentioned in another book about Russia. As mentioned by others, the satirical humor about fatalism and the all out battle for class being fought on a square foot by square foot basis in the \\"classless\\" society of the Soviet Union is priceless, even to someone who has no first hand knowledge of the society. The foibles of bureaucracy is a universal theme.The second half of book was a wild ride for sure. The Devil and his retinue's exploits in Moscow finally involve \\"The Master\\", a failed author whose life's work is a non-religious account of Pontius Pilate and the last days of Yeshua (Jesus). Margarita is The Master's mistress, who sells her soul to the devil for her beloved. Bulgakov explores the nature of good and evil, of religion and history, and of freedom and totalitarianism, all in a world where the illusion of reality can be fractured in an instant. A good background in literature and religious history will help the reader, but the story can also be appreciated for its humorous and satirical aspects. Not for everyone, but certainly of interest to avid readers of all ilks."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"All of a sudden I feel bad for seemingly being the only person that picked this book up because it was Mick Jagger's inspiration for the lyrics of Sympathy For Devil. Like everyone else I feel that this is a great book that will blow away the reader and leaves one in a different mindset while reading it and in the following days. That is a very good thing where I come from."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I was only 14 years old when i first read The Master And Margarita for the first time, and, for I am German, in German.However, I am now 17 (still a little young some might think), going to school in the USA and have read it about a hundret times; still, whenever I get to the last page, i want to break in tears for both, the fact that it's over and the eternal forgiveness that the three main characters (the master, margarita and pontius pilate) experience.Bulgakov managed to combine a sharp political satire with a heart-breaking romance (believe me: I don't use that word very often...), he created a world that forgot the supernatural, whose tragic heroes literally go through hell to finally receive their well-deserved eternal rest.It is a book mainly about two things: HOPE and FORGIVENESS. And even if you might have trouble getting into it: Once you are, you are lost to it forever, just as poor me, who wishes for only one thing; to be with Voland (or,in the english version, woland)and jesus on the roof on that last day at sunset, or to be one one of the horses on ths sparrow hills and see koroview whistle... It certainly is one of the best books of our time, and will be a diamond of world-literature FOREVER.Thank you for your patience."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"In his biting social satire, Bulgakov take no prisoners. His chef d'oeuvre tells us of Satan's descent into 1930's Moscow and the chaotic consequences of the absurd meeting between a supernatural entity and a society that denies him. The devil, a paradox ironically explained as a hypnotist by a bureaucratic social monolith that is itself hypnotized (or, perhaps more accurately, enslaved, by Stalin), exposes the silliness of mass atheism, the materialistic pettiness of a rationed socialist economy, the moral excesses of self-righteous hypocrites, and the self-disgust of corrupt artists.One of the more interesting things to consider in this book is the 'hierarchy of creation,' highlighted by the parallel narration of the Pilate-Jesus story. Since Satan tells the same story that the Master conjures up in his mind, what are we to make of the origins of good and evil, of God, of Satan, and of human beings themselves? Further, the original take on the Christ story raises issues such as the accuracy of Gospels.\\"Manuscripts don't burn,\\" Satan famously declares, and indeed, Berlioz and his Stalinist compatriots don't seem fated to eradicate the Bible. This quote also seems to encapsulate Bulgakov's own hopes that his works would survive the test of time and ultimately find appreciation in a country and time whose leaders suppressed his talents.Bulgakov's prose is light and comical, if his ideas are substantial. After the devil is done debunking Moscow society, there is a headless master of ceremonies, an invisible bureacrat, literateurs and other hacks flooding the mental hospital and disappearing. The demonic cat Behemoth and translator Koroviev/Fagot provide ample satire with their high-flown speech and ironic ersatz naivete. The presence of an irrational power in a rationalistic system provides subversive elements suggesting a postmodern ethos. Some of the passages concerning the romance between the title characters are surprisingly moving, given the satirical undercurrents of this novel. Recommended reading (in Russian if you can)!"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Unfortunately, the translation I have is the terrible Michael Glenny one, the one that was stocked in the campus bookstore when I got this book for a Modern Russian Lit class. It has numerous typos, some &quot;translations&quot; of proper names (Richardovna instead of Rikhardovna, George instead of Georgiy, Claudia instead of Klavdiya), and misleading transliteration. I'm sure the book will be even better in the more updated translations.Most Russian novels are long, dark, and depressing, but this book is only a bit over 500 pages, and instead of being sad and pessimistic, is lively and funny. The Devil and a hilarious retinue of friends decide to pay a visit to Moskv&aacute; (according to the back of my edition, it's 1920), and immediately begin to wreak havoc everywhere they go and to cause weird and unexplainable things to happen, many of which get people in serious enough trouble to get arrested, turn into vampires, or be sent to the insane asylum. He first appears by Patriarch's Pond, where the writers Misha Berlioz and Ivan Bezdomniy (lit. &quot;homeless&quot;) are discussing why the latter's anti-religion poem isn't acceptable, since despite deriding religion, it treats the things in the Bible as though they really happened. Berlioz is telling his friend just why they didn't when the Devil (called Woland) comes up and starts to tell them they're both wrong, and he knows, since he was there at the Crucifixion. Based on all of the weird stuff he's saying, they believe he is insane (they already know he's a foreign visitor) and decide to secretly call the asylum on him. But the Devil turns the tables on them, and right away everyone thinks Bezdomniy is the nut. The Devil also predicted the gruesome demise of Berlioz, and no one believes Bezdomniy's explanations for what really happened. He is quickly taken to the insane asylum, while the Devil and his friends move into Berlioz's old apartment just like he predicted they would. In his retinue are Azazello (who has red hair, a huge fang, and a walleye), Hella, a naked female vampire serving as his maid, Koroviyev-Faggot (pr. Fah-GOAT, not the other way), his interpreter, who has a broken pince-nez and wears checkered clothing, and my favourite, a hilarious huge black cat named Behemoth. Behemoth talks, drinks alcohol, plays tricks on people, smokes cigars, wears a tuxedo and bowtie, plays chess, walks upright, gilds his whiskers, and shoots a Browning perfectly. His antics often annoy the others, but he's annoying in a funny and endearing way.The story from whence the title comes doesn't start until Part Two. An unnamed Master wrote a book about the Passion and Pontius Pilate, a story which is being told throughout the book, and it not only offended the censors, it also drastically went against everything in the Bible. In depression, he burned all copies of his book but for one chapter which his mistress Margarita pulled out of the fire. The Master is now in the same insane asylum as Bezdomniy and the other people who have been sent there since the Devil came to town, and despairs of ever getting out or seeing Margarita again. Margarita in turn loves him so much she is willing to sell her soul to the Devil and his friends just to free him, not even caring what getting in league with these people may entail.Besides the hilarious main story, I also liked the Master's retelling of the Passion. Like Berlioz and Woland were saying in the beginning, people only take the Bible's word for it because we have no other version of those events to go by. People don't even bother to critically examine what other people tell us, don't want to find out if it's truth, lies, reality, unreality, myth, or historical fact. Who's to say that the Master's version is any more accurate or inaccurate than the Biblical version and Pontius wasn't a sympathetic figure, Jesus wasn't a confused vagabond and coward, there was no Resurrection, or that any of the other people in events in this unique retelling did or didn't happen?"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I wanted to add my own review, not so much that I could add more than some of the very good reviews already written, but there is one that is misleading. It refers to Volokhonsky/Pevear's translation of The Master and Margarita. Just so you understand that This paperback is translated by Diana Burgin and Katherine Tiernan O'Connor.I'll accept the review on the other, as I haven't read it, but this version absolutely is amazing. When that reviewer said &quot;preserve the easily flowing bubbling like champagne Bulgakov's speech&quot;, it struck me that that is precisely how this version came across. Bubbling like champagne. Hints of flavor and smell with each pop and fizz, it read easily, consumed with delight. The only way it could be better is if I spoke Russian and could read the original. ;)"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA has long been one of my favorite novels, so I was delighted when I came across this new (and improved) translation, which gave me an excuse to re-read Bulgakov's masterpiece.The devil, in the guise of the foreign magician, Woland, comes to Soviet Moscow, and hilariously turns the place upside down. But Woland's mastery of sleight-of-hand pales in comparison to that of Bulgakov himself. Partly because of fear of censorship and partly because of the climate of post-modernism, Bulgakov's text is brimming with irony and double-meaning. Nothing is quite what it seems. Is Woland a bad guy or a good guy? Is Bulgakov critiquing his totalitarian regime, or the premises of modernity all-together? Who wrote that novel within a novel about Pilate? What is truth?My favorite irony is that against the post-modernists, Bulgakov clearly does believe in truth. Not the easy black-and-white truths that many hold, but something which lies beyond - in a vision where our simple notions of good and evil are mocked (in all good humor) and then set aside in favor of a vision which still has a sense that in the end, all will be as it should be. That is the greatness of Bulgakov - he gets the better of almost every argument that WE face (not just the Stalinists), and yet he likes us still, as he observes us in our flaming human weakness.You should read this book. It's really fun. Bulgakov draws you into a world where cats can talk and pigs can fly; where lovers love with passion, but you never see them have sex; and where Pontius Pilate can wait through all eternity with his loyal dog Banga for one last talk with that strange prisoner Yeshua Ha-Nostri. A book for the ages."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"This is a great book, every time you read it a new facet emerges, every two or three years you should read it and you will come away with something new to think about.

It is also the bravest book written in that same time period. Imagine writing a novel critical of your country when the leader of that country happens to be one of the greatest mass murderers in history. Obviously written for posterity, if it had gotten into the wrong hands, or come to the attention of the wrong people at that time, Bulgakov would have been in grave danger.I will not go on at length to describe this novel because many of the reviews here have already done so. It is also rather difficult to describe because it has many elements in it's composition. There is the obvious reference to the Faust legend, the Biblical references, the Dostoevsky and Tolstoy references, the symbolism, social satire, and allegorical treatment of contemporary political concerns. There is great humor in this book, and a love story that proceeds in phantasmagorical fashion and climaxes in what can only be described as a symbolic epiphany."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Having lived in Russia and read many Russian titles, Master & Margarita is on the top, particularly during Soviet times. Like much art and literature during those repressive times, Bulgakov clearly hides his message under the hilarious cynicism of his colorful prose. There are not enough stars for this masterpiece.

Personally, I'm not on drugs and I slept like a baby after reading The Master and Margarita, but these reactions just go to show you that this book incites strong feelings- as it was meant to.

There are various plot lines, a historical novel, and enough hilarity to make one laugh out loud. It is quite posible to read the book without referring to the notes at the end, but occasionally they add something to the book, or explain why the author wrote something the way he did. This is a timeless classic of literature and should be read by all serious scholars of 20th century Russian literature."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Forget your prejudices and cynicism, Reader! Stalinist terror permeates the atmosphere of this unusual story, exposing the nefarious consequences of political correctness on free-thinkers. A frightened, servile intelligentsia is concerned more with personal privileges that shaping a moral society. One of the best known moralists, Jesus is the allegorical subject of a parallel plot, in which the oppressor, Pontius Pilate, suddenly realizes that salvation means the avoidance of THE capital sin: cowardice. The bravery of the modern Jesus, the Master, whose revisionist story of Jesus is an allegory for the fate of revolutionary thinkers in the Stalin era, is viewed as insanity. With two exceptions: the first is Margarita, the positive mirror image of the quintessential femme fatale. Her adulterous love and total devotion, however, does not save the Master in this world. But now comes the second revolutionary, the true Savior, who is recognizing the bravery of the Master and plots with the conventional Savior to reward it. The true Savior is none-other than the so-called evil-doer, Satan, whose actions instill love and courage in the oppressed people. His colorful retinue mocks the Authority of the State and punishes pettiness. The convergence of the two Saviors is an amazing twist of old religious prejudices, which melt in the face of selfless love. Saint Bernard's assertion that \\"Hell is full of good intentions\\" is finally realized.Peace be unto you, Reader, but beware of black cats if your soul is not pure."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Mikhail Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita has everything: magic, mayhem and a vodka-drinking cat. This book is nothing short of a masterpiece of modernist literature. Bulgakov addresses a slew of themes throughout the novel including life in communist Russia, atheism, Christianity and love. These concepts are constantly running through the plot whether it is evident or not. What is most impressive about the novel is Bulgakov's ability to present the story with a certain surreal and mysterious quality, which at times is Kafkaesque. This is most apparent in book 1 when Woland (Satan) reeks havoc on the citizens of Moscow: neither the reader nor the characters in the novel are exactly sure what is happening, but for the characters the effects are very real. The fantastic elements in the novel, particularly the presence magic are primarily responsible for creating this effect. The rational, atheist citizens of Moscow are vulnerable to Woland's sometimes deadly, sometimes mischievous powers because they refuse to believe their senses. At the same time however, the citizens are willing to accept the impossible when it benefits them (as in the black magic show) and Woland exposes this weakness as well. There is also a strong absurd quality to the novel that helps the reader to understand the flaws in both mankind and society. This is evident in his depiction of Satan, Hell and his demon sidekicks. A talking cat that swills vodka and fights over a chess game is funny anyway you look at it. Satan holds a grand ball in Hell, which is presented as a grand mansion. The reader is not upset when bad things happen to the characters because the devil and his intentions are presented very lightheartedly. The devil even seems have more human qualities than most of the characters in the novel, especially when examining his relationship with Margarita in the second book. Overall this book was top notch. The story was entertaining and funny as well as profound, it drags in a few spots but not many and not for long. Buy the book on Amazon.com and read it. Even if you do not understand it on its most intellectual level (which I admittedly did not) you can still appreciate the work and take something away from it."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I admire this book and always wondered how it might have been translated into English. I reviewed several editions and versions, and found this one is a bit harsh in translation style, and not quite exact. I would recommend the edition from Penguin Classics, translation done by Richard Pevear; or the edition translated by Mirra Ginsburg."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I would first like to convey my intractable disapproval of the way I was misrepresented in the translation under discussion. As a true connoisseur, brilliant writer, and appreciator of learned cats, Dr. Bulgakov had absolutely intended me, Behemoth, to be the central character of this story (which I am in the Russian version, I assure you), and that is incomprehensibly lost in this, and every other, translation of The Master and Margarita. Russian may be a complicated language for some, but to turn it all around and say that the \\"Master\\" referred to in the title was meant for that inconsequential writer friend of Margarita's is really beyond belief! What has he got to do with anything? Ridiculous! And to suggest that the neophyte witch Margarita, no matter how charming she was at Satan's ball, would have the audacity to bully me--a creature with the strength to rip the head straight off the shoulders of that emcee, mind you--by simply pinching my ear! Who could believe such a thing? Another point is that chess game I was winning against Woland: it was _he_ who cheated his way out of a humiliating defeat by tossing my king under the bed, not the other way around! So, dear reader, if you should decide to read this otherwise enchanting novel, please keep in mind the errors made by its translators in casting my character in an unseemly, almost dismissive, light. As one who ought to know a little more about this subject than the throng of im-posters who have submitted their somewhat misinformed reviews here, I entreat you to read the story not as a political satire, social commentary, or any other such nonsense, but as a tribute to a worldly and fascinatingly accomplished feline who, more than even Dr. Bulgakov himself, has been severely and wrongly maligned through a sad misinterpretation of the facts so clearly at hand.--Behemoth"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"The translation is lousy. The one made by Michael Glenny is far better, though his is sometimes very free - for example he may write \\"heart attack\\" instead of lungs sarcoma, and he calls Solovki an asylum while it's a prison, he also may omit passages (not very important ones, though) but his translation beautifully conveys Bulgakov's humour and that's the most important part. The translation we are discussing here does not do this and the book sounds dead."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I first read this novel in about 1992. As soon as I finished the novel, it replaced the one that was at the top of my list of all-time favorites. I just recently reread it and it it still #1.There are so many synopses here for the book, so I won't waste your time by rehashing what you've probably already read.Had Bulgakov written this today, it would probably fall onto the shelf under urban fantasy or magical realism. But it is so much more. There is satire, a harsh critique of the Soviet system, romance, magic, comedy. In short, this book has something for just about everyone.Where else will you get a three-foot tall cat that walks on his hind legs, eats pickled mushrooms with a fork, and talks?Check it out. You'll love it."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"The book opens with a magazine editor Berlioz and a poet named Bezdomny sitting in a Moscow park when a stranger, obviously not Russian, approaches them and begins a conversation. When this stranger finds out they are non-Christian believers, he assures them that Jesus Christ really existed. Then he tells a story of Pontius Pilate first meeting Jesus and what happened at that meeting. Then the stranger goes on to tell Berlioz how he will die and his death becomes a realty not long afterwards. Berlioz's death shakes Bezdomny up considerably and he is convinced this stranger had something to do with Berlioz's death. Bezdomny begins following the stranger and finally ends up in the insane asylum.The stranger goes by the name of Woland and professes to do black magic and plans to give a public show at the local theater. Woland is not alone; however, he is accompanied by Korovyov who claims to be Woland's assistant and by a large walking cat named Behemoth and a short, fat man with a fang named Azazello. Also included in this little group is a woman named Hella who is very beautiful except for a scar on her neck and she goes around naked. They go about wrecking havoc on Moscow.The Master is a writer who has written a biography of Pontius Pilate but his novel is critized by the major publishers and critics. He becomes so despondent he leaves the love of his life, Margarita, and checks himself into the same insane asylum that Bezdomny is in. Margarita takes extraordinary steps to become reunited with the Master and through the help of Woland and company achieves her goal. There is quite a bit of excitement as Margarita goes through the steps to become reunited with the Master.This book is fun, cynical, and wonderful. Also you'll want to read it because it is rich and rewarding - a must read."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"This is one of those books that everyone has read and knows by heart, and not without reason. A very biting satire of life in the Soviet regime, Bulgakov is truly a master of prose. I give it 5 stars despite some word choice issues in the translation that I personally disagreed with, so if you have read the book in Russian and are wondering about how good the translation itself is, I'd have to say that it's very good but not perfect. If you do not read Russian, I think that this translation does a very good job of conveying the right tone in the right places.A must read for pretty much everybody."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Gloriously fun and funny novel, a real treat and change-of-pace. During Stalin's Soviet Russia of the 1930s, the rational and scientific take absolute preference over the intuitive and metaphysical, vast mechanisms are in place to hush up anything extraordinary or inexplicable, and aberrant citizens disappear mysteriously on a daily basis. What better place for Satan and his ministers to wreak supernatural havoc?The first half of the novel is dizzying and delirious, depicting the wickedly humorous exploits of the devil--in the guise of Woland, a black magician--and his unholy companions through the eyes of several average Russian characters. The second half zooms in on the title charcters, a sort of reversal of the Faust lovers, with young, beautiful Margarita seeking Satan's help to reunite her with her lover, a perscecuted novelist. Woven throughout the crazily uneven events of the main story are excerpts from the \\"Master's\\" novel manuscript, a demythologizing of the Pontius Pilate story.A terrific, extremely readable Russian masterpiece. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Pontius Pilate and Moscow's citizens are oddly coupled in this examination of the new class of soviet people. Even without the social commentary, this is a beautiful and engaging atypical love story. Best read with Goethe's Faust. Margarita is the Russian version of Margaret/Gretchen."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Written in the 1930's, not published until the late 1960's, a quarter-century after the author's death, this is an amazing book. Any short description I provide is necessarily reductive - it's a reworking of the Faust legend, with an embedded exploration of the story of Pontius Pilate, in which the devil and his retinue visit Stalinist Moscow. From this premise, the author produces a scathing satire of the politics of his time (fully aware that the book would not, and could not, be published during his lifetime), as well as an extremely thought-provoking discussion of the role of the artist, and the necessity of mercy and forgiveness.What I really liked about the book is the way he wraps some fairly deep themes into a hilarious story - we are given some hugely enjoyable tall tales by a mischievous, extremely funny narrator. The style is reminiscent of Flann O' Brien at his most coruscating; despite broad swipes at some fairly obvious targets, the overall story is uplifting, as the reader finally comes to the realization that Woland (the Satan-figure) is actually working on the same side as the Jesus-figure.It's obvious why, upon its delayed publication, this book immediately achieved the status of a classic of modern Russian literature. A completely unexpected delight - I highly recommend this book.The version I read was a translation by Diana Burgin and Katherine Tiernan O' Connor. Annotations and an afterword by Ellendea Proffer are based on 'two main texts' of the novel, one published in 1973 and one in 1989."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Mikhail Bulgakov lived during the Stalin era in the Soviet Union. Most of his work, this title included, was banned by Soviet authorities during his lifetime. It was only many years after his death that this book was published. The book is a wonderful myth, filled with both real and mythological characters, and considers the corruptability and mortality of man. The plot involves the appearance of Satan and his retinue, including a large, black tom cat who drinks vodka, and their impact of the good comrades of the city of Moscow. People encoutering the mysterious Prof. Woland try to deal with him and his powers in a rational fashion, but soon learn that this is no way to approach the devil. The mysterious Professor soon takes over the lives of those who cross his path, sending one to an asylum and another to Yalta while a third winds up dead due to &quot;sunflower oil&quot;. Also included in the text are stories of the passion of Christ and a sympathetic portrait of Pontius Pilate and his struggles over the crucifixion. This is an excellent fable and should be read by anybody interested in Soviet literature, or literature in general"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"There are a lot of great reviews for this book already. So I will only repeat after them that this is a must read for every person capable of thinking.This book is not really about satire on Stalin's Russia - it could have been written about any historical period of pretty much any country. This book is about how people's nature doesn't really change and how love is the most redeeming thing in the world."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Turn of the century Russia before the Cold War had always inspired a lost hope for the past, at least within myself. Historical accounts of this period are filled with hope, vitality and a sense of renewal of heroic proportions. Until I read this novel. Master and the Margarita, the skillful imagery, allegory, and vast plain of fantasy allowes a reader to grasp a dimension of post-serf Russia in an entirely new light.I can't help but to fall in love with Behemoth the cat, like I had with historical characters of a national movement which was the started the USSR. Seductive overtones of the circus characters allowed me to recognize a dark side of which I had identified as a antagonized enemy during the Cold War.Grew up really not wanting to find Russia unlikable, didn't for once put any faith into the propaganda machine. Entirely unwilling to find fault for the communistas, little thought went into how the intelligentsia viewed the Kremlin. Repression of outspoken works from the Russian intelligentsias led me to believe there was no unrest.Understanding now that repression of works such as \\"Master and Margarita \\" has the same effect as negative propaganda.Mikhail gave me a gift in this novel, the ability to lose my innocence in regards to a political movement I had previously found unfailing. Through the use of seductive characters in a spellbinding journey it wasn't as painful."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I woke up late this morning, still recovering from Christmas festivities. My mother was having a nightmare, talking in her sleep and groaning. I gently woke her up, told her she was having a bad dream. She thanked me after confirming my diagnosis. I checked my email and got the most terrible news. Benazir Bhutto had been murdered, shot in the neck amid a suicide bomb wreckage.I was going to start this review with a summary of all of Joseph Stalin's crimes, specifically those against Christians and Jews. Mikhail Bulgakov was a christian from Kiev, Ukraine and fought for the white army during the Russian revolution. His father was a theology professor in Kiev. The nascent communist regime was, of course, very much opposed to religion of any kind. In the decades after the revolution, the number of Orthodox churches decreased from over 10,000 to 500. Hundreds of thousands of priests were murdered just in the first decades of communism. If we had a precise record of Stalin's victims, he would make Hitler look like a pussy cat.Funny how the most evil people in the world's history keep being replaced by others just as terrible. But this should not be news to a christian since Christ foretold that evil would persist until the end of time. Mikhail Bulgakov's masterpiece, The Master and Margarita was the Soviet Union's first and only dose of the gospel, though the book was not widely circulated or published until 1967, 37 years after Bulgakov's death. The Master and Margarita is a tale of good and evil and is a satire of Stalinist Russia. Needless to say, the book was banned in Stalin's day.The Master and Margarita reads like a crazy dream interrupted by a few moments of consciousness. It's a crazy, but well told story. A friend of mine from Uzbekistan read it in Russian years ago and asked me wasn't he (Bulgakov) schizophrenic? \\"My head, my head,\\" the variety theatre's MC repeated over and over as he was whisked to a psychiatric hospital following a wild night of black magic at the theatre. Woland, a satanic figure, took off his head and then placed it back on for the excited crowd. Many other writers were at the very same hospital suffering from schizophrenia and were regularly tranquilized. Room 118's occupant was a writer called the master who had written a novel about Pontius Pilate and suffered much because of it. The love of his life was a young, married woman named Margarita from whom he was separated by the malicious forces that invaded the city of Moscow, Woland and his cortege. The story begins at Patriarch's Ponds in Moscow where Bulgakov resided with his third wife who was the prototype for Margarita.Despite the fact that the master, who has no name and no identity to steal, had burned his story about Pontius Pilate and Jesus Christ's crucifixion, named Yeshua Ha-Notsri in Bulgakov's story, Woland of course knows what he's written, and the words have a permanence in people's minds, like Margarita's and the publisher's that made the master's life on earth hell...\\"The mist that came from the Mediterranean sea blotted out the city that Pilate so detested.\\"Anyway, The Master and Margarita is a classic, one of my favorites. I'm so glad I'm an American despite my country's faults, it's one of the best countries in the world."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Unclassifiable novel that breaks all the conventions and succeeds. I won't waste time explaining the plot or storyline, just buy it and read it. Subtle political statement (or understatement) permeates this novel but where it departs and excels is in it's weirdness. It is certainly the most bizarre and entertaining novel I have ever read. The Dinner Ball with Satan is a real highlight."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"The Master and Margarita has wonderfully complex characters and an enthralling storyline that kept me riveted. Very enjoyable. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Russian is one of my native languages and this has been one of my favorite books; I must have read it a few dozen times since adolescence. I had never read an English translation of this book and having bought it for a friend of mine, borrowed it from her out of curiousity.I can't believe how much is lost in this translation! Partly, it may be because the translator did not have a good grasp on the idiomatic English, as I found far too many \\"word for word\\" translations that loose the smooth flow and the humor of the original. In all fairness, though, this book would be a nightmare to translate, precisely because so much of its magic comes from Bulgakov's style and choice of words. In this translation, much of the nuance is sadly and irrevocably lost.... solution: learn Russian and read the original.. :-)-Alain."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Enough of sentimentality! Yes, Russian authors ARE capable of modernist brilliance! Bulgakov combines real feelings (not overblown ones) and odd and histerical situations that make for a completely wonderful 330 pg. novel that draws you further into its world(s) and builds a connection with its characters. Simply amazing."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"The Master and Margarita. For me, the title of this novel conjures up images of ninjas drinking cocktails; the book itself contains images that make that seem banal. Pop culture legend has it that this book was given to Mick Jagger by Marianne Faithfull and is the inspiration for the classic, Sympathy For The Devil.Anyway, a bit about the origins of this book...Mikhail Bulgakov started writing this in 1928 and after becoming disheartened with the future for a writer within the Soviet Union, burning the original manuscript and various redrafts, the third version was finished in 1937. The book was banned in the Soviet Union for 27 years due to its subversive nature and comments on Stalin's bureaucracy. Unfortunately, due to the Communist regime, Bulgakov never got to see this book, widely considered to be one of the greatest novels of the 20th century, published. Bulgakov died blind and in poverty in 1940.The Master and Margarita sees the Devil, in the form of a foreign professor, visiting Moscow of the 1930s, a Communist and atheist city riddled with corruption and fear, accompanied by: a valet, a demonic hitman, a witch, the angel of death and my personal favourite, a 6 foot tall black cat called Behemoth who has a penchant for guns and trouble. This troupe arrive and begin to unleash their own special brand of havoc on Moscow's elite...This particular branch of the story is played out against another, in the form of the trial conducted 2000 years ago of a self-proclaimed prophet and the deliberations of one Pontius Pilate over the man's fate...These two stories are married up with a third narrative, revealing to the reader the titular characters; the Master being a fairly insane young writer (Bulgakov himself?) and Margarita, his adulteress lover who will do anything to restore the Master's lost novel and return them both to their former state of bliss.The novel truly is a blasphemous and cynical political satire that is without doubt one of the craziest rides I've ever been on in book form. Although I have branded it a \\"political satire\\", the novel traverses many themes: the nature of the human condition, the battle between good and evil on many levels and the inherent wrong within the bureaucracy of the Soviet political machine. Similarly, the book has truly funny moments but also quite horrific parts; what else are you to expect when you have the Devil ride into town with a six foot tall black cat and demons in tow?!My major difficulty with this book was its flow. As a translation from the original Russian, I fear that much may have been lost and the English version seems stunted in parts. For me, this is quite common as I have wrestled with other books such as Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment for the same reason.Others have criticised the book for mirroring Goethe's Faust. I would submit to you that this is indeed a valid point in that it explores similar themes of deals with the devil, redemption and trust but I am of the opinion that The Master and Margarita can be read on many levels from the absurd to its observations on the shallowness and vanity of people that seem to be as applicable today as they were in the Soviet Union of the 1930s.There is no question that The Master and Margarita is a highly influential book and it is truly a triumph when you consider that in Stalinist Russia, had Bulgakov been caught with the manuscript for a novel such as The Master and Margarita which satirised the State, he would have undoubtedly been sent to a prison camp in Siberia, without trial."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Fantastic, wickedly funny satire of Russian life in the Soviet Union. I picked this up on impulse and really, really enjoyed it. It's challenging and entertaining and very rewarding. A great read."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I am from Ukraine... But I read the book for the first time while in college in the U.S (at BYU). I was house-sitting for a friend and she had a bunch of russian books. I found Master and Margaritta, a full Russian edition published in W.Germany back in the seventies. Back then, copies in the USSR were quite \\"abridged\\" by the party censors.Anyway, I read the book in about three days. I read it in between work and classes. I'd stay reading it late into the night. I could not put it down. I found the book so purely russian it made me a bit homesick.Woland, the Satan, comes to Soviet Russia and causes havoc. But he does not just do it himself; he toys with people who get tangled themselves. It seems the more people try to oppose Woland, the more they get tangled in Woland's web of tricks. Many of those people end up in an insane asylum. Woland has a couple of \\"assistants\\" a talking cat and another geezer... oh, there is also the naked diva who ricks of grave... The symbols and the imagery used are absolutely amazing, especially during the Satan's annual ball.Woland is not the Master... In fact the Master does not appear till much later in the book... Especially interesting parts of the book are the flashbacks to Jesus Christ and Pontius Pilat. However, anyone will find themes and parts to which he or she can relate. Just keep in mind, This is not just a love story, even though it can be read as such very easily.Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Plot Summary: The devil visits Moscow sometime in the springtime of the 1930s and he wreaks havoc. His traveling companions include a talking black cat named Behemoth, a comely witch who never wears clothes, and a scruffy translator who wears a cracked pince-nez. Most of the citizens who encounter this satanic posse come out considerably worse for wear, but for one historical writer named only the Master, and his lover, Margarita, the devil himself may be heaven-sent.First a little background, of which I was pretty much ignorant until I dived into this book (why do I always do that?). Mikhail Bulgakov was a Russian novelist who worked on The Master and Margarita between 1928 to 1940. He wrote this book with the knowledge that he would likely never see it published, and a censored version of the text was finally published in 1966 - 26-years after his death. Apparently all of the English translations up until this point never captured the nuanced humor that's evident in its native Russian, but the translators of this edition went to great lengths to give English-language readers a fully-realized copy.Is this book scandalous to a modern-day American? Hardly, but when placed within its historical context I could see how it might piss a few people off, namely the Stalinist regime that was in control at the time. To be honest, I feel woefully inadequate to even review this book, because it is brimming over with allegory, Fausitan references, and religious history. A literature professor would be better suited to dissect this book, but you're stuck with me.Parts of this novel were incredibly entertaining and engaging. The story is rife with supernatural stuff - talking cats, naked witches, magic tricks, and Satan himself - and any fan of paranormal stories can't help but be entertained. However, it took me a solid 100 pages to get into the book, and I thought about abandoning it a few times. The main characters, namely the Master and Margarita, don't even show up until well after the 100-page mark, and I found this story making greater demands on my patience than usual. There's no denying that parts of it are very confusing, but it does make sense in hindsight. It took me about three days to wade through it all, and if you follow my blog you know that I usually read 350-page books in one day.So no, it wasn't always easy to read, and part of that stems from the cultural/language barrier. So many of the terms remain completely foreign for modern readers (even after being translated), and I was also confused by the fact that each character had at least three names. I'm not familiar with Russian culture, but in addition to a first and last name, each character had a third name used by intimate friends. Here in the U.S., a person's nickname is often derived from their first name, but not so here. Unfortunately for me, Mr. Bulgakov switched between all three names indiscriminately, and I had a hard time keeping them straight amongst a cast numbering in the dozens.Even with these burdens, I am glad I read this story because some of the scenes could be grafted into a contemporary urban fantasy without a single edit, and that is incredible to me. It speaks to Mr. Bulgakov's imagination, which he used to give a cheeky slap to Russian society during the 1930s. This is the kind of story that probably grows on people with subsequent readings. The first time is a little rough, the second time things become clearer, and by the third time they probably think it's a masterpiece. I'm still on round one.This particular translation has a nice set of notes in the back, but alas no footnotes. When encountering a strange word or a new character, there may or may not be an explanation in the back. The reader must check constantly. There is no foreword, but the afterword provides a respectable amount of information about the author, the context, and an examination of the work itself. I wish I had read it first instead of last."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"By 1928, Mikhail Bulgakov was already an established, though, due to the harsh party censorship, disreputed writer. That year he ended his volatile second marriage to Lyubov Byelozerskaya and started his great love affair with Elena Sergeevna, who served as the inspiration for the character of Margarita in his masterpiece novel &quot;Master and Margarita&quot; (originally, &quot;A Novel About the Devil&quot;). He worked of M&amp;M for twelve long years, until his death in 1940, and poured all of his great literary gift, and some suggest even his entire soul, into the novel.Master and Margarita is, characteristically for Bulgakov, a delightfully funny, highly inventive and almost diabolical masterpiece of modernist prose. It is, also, a tremendously complex novel, into which Bulgakov included a number of literary archetypes and autobiographical sketches. The novel is at once a metaphysical wandering, a modern telling of the Faustian legend, a retelling of an important episode from the Gospel, a carnivalesque social and political satire of totalitarianism, a wonderful romance and a personal confession. It simply would not make any sense for me to attempt the writing of a short synopsys of the novel, because all the mentioned themes are cleverly intertwined and the novel's compexity makes any systematic analisys seem futile.Master and Margarita was not published in Russia until 1967, and then only in a heavily revised text. The full text was finally published in the late 1980's, and the novel quickly became a cult phenomenon in Moscow, where it seems everyone has read it. Phrases from the novel have actually been incorporated into daily speech. I have not read the English translation of the novel, and seriously doubt that it does any justice to the original. Bulgakov's puns are untranslatable. Still, this is novel I am sure everyone will love, and I warmly recommend it for reading and re-reading."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"This masterpiece has gained almost supernatural halo in Russia.Myth surrounds it like the one claiming the books would not burn if put to flame and rumors that attempts to make this book into into a play always end in disaster.Stalin and friends indeed tried to burn them metaphorically along with the Russian soul. They failed because in people like Bulgakov the flame burned too brightly to be extinguished.Master and Margarita puts Bulgakov in the front line of Russian literature (pretty impressive when you think that beside him you have Dostoyevsky, Chekhov and Tolstoy).It's true, you have to be Homo Sovietic (or preferably a Moscow resident) to understand the depth of the satire and wit poured from the Bulgakov's sharp pen. However, even without a Russian translator attached, this masterpiece is guaranteed to be one of the best books you'll ever read.There are actually three stories here - Satan and retinue of extremely funny subordinates (naked witch and talking cat included), are turned loose in Moscow and tear it upside down. In the background we have the true story (from the viewpoint of an atheist), of the meeting between Pontius Pilate and Jesus of Nazareth. Another story is the love between Margarita and her Master (Artist, writer of the Pilate-Jesus story). The stories intertwine, until finally the Master and Margarita win redemption from the hands of...Satan.The subtitle is a satire of how the totalitarian state treads on the soul of the artist.Events unfold at the speed of light, making this book hard to put down. The dialogs are simply too good to be true. Bulgakov has the sharp eye of Dostoyevsky when it comes to pointing human flaws, and boy oh joy, he can sure kick the human soul and bring all the ugliness to the surface.I can keep attaching superlatives, but none will do justice to this masterpiece, so I'll end with a plea.Please people - Read this book, you'll thank me later."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I haven't read the translated versions of Master and Margarita. But this is my favourite book. I read it on Russian when I was in high school due to our school program and since then I have this book everywhere and I always recommend it to all my friends and co-workers. It's about everything: love, hate, jealousy, friendship, fairy-tale, cruelty, faith, madness, honesty and dihonesty etc. The book is like divided into 3 parts and you live in each part separately but at the same time they all connected to each other. You should read it and to feel what the author tells you about Soviet Russia and all people who lived there."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Master and Margarita is a riotous fun spree of a novel. It's also more, Bulgakov's masterpiece is also a statement about the essential goodness of people and the healing of forgiveness. From Yeshua saying &quot;goodman&quot; to everyone and his belief that there are no evil people on earth to Margarita at the ball letting all the ages past killers kiss her knee, the themes of essential goodness of people and forgiveness sound out from Bulgakov's prose. There has been much discussion of translations in the reviews at Amazon. The Glenny is a translation while the Ginsburg, Burgin, and Pervear versions are more like transliterations. True, Glenny mis-translates mineral water as lemonade and makes a few minor mis-steps but his translation flows. The other versions are good word by word accurate efforts. If you can't read the original Russian don't get hung up on finding the perfect translation, there isn't one. Grab a copy and read."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"This is not a novel. This is a special product offering a view over a style of life and political events which distroyed and affected millions of people. To have the power,hallucination, talent and humor to create this story was unparallel. The proof is that even people living in US can appreciate and enjoy this book. For us who lived the hell, this book is like a Bible which helped us to survive."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I feel compelled to add my own meager voice to the chorus of praise Master and Margarita has received. I first read Master and Margarita (the Diana Burgin/Katherine O'Conner translation) as a second year slavic languages and literatures major on the recommendation of my professor. Although skeptical at first (I still had the notion that great literature was supposed to be boring), after I read Master and Margarita that first time I was enraptured by the complexity, depth, phliosophy, wit and sensitivity of this obvious master piece of russian literature. I have since read the book eight more times, carried it with me on trips and given it a permanent place on my night stand. As with every great work of literature, I have never tired of it. It speaks to me in a different way every time. On translations, I must say unequivocally that the Diana Burgin/Katherine O'Conner translation is by far the best. Translation is not about transcribing word for word the literal meaning of the text. It is about capturing the voice of the author, recreating the style and expression of his work. This is done admirably in the Burgin/O'Conner translation. They capture beautifully the nuances of Bulgakov's style, which is so much a part of his charm as a writer. Their translation truly adds to the international prestige of both Bulgakov and Master and Margarita. Having enjoyed it so much, I decided to devote my research paper this semester to a study of his satire and have seriously considered making it my area of specialization. Once again I can only say that this is by far the best book I have ever read and that I hope others who read it will be as inspired by it as I was."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"This has become one of my favorite books. There are a few qualities in particular that I love. First, there is the wonderful, honey-thick Russian language. The translation successfully draws you into the vocabulary and imagery of Russia. Second, it is a funny book. I imagine that it is most amusing to people who have a good knowledge of Goethe's Faust and Russian culture and politics, but there is plenty of humor that is surface level. Third, there are some very moving passages, in particular the scenes with Pontius Pilate.I have recommended this book to many friends and family. I have only read this edition of the book; but in reviewing other copies, I would strongly recommend this one with the notes. Some of the historical, political and literary allusions are too specific for the average reader and the notes very unobtrusively guide you through the book."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"First, let me deliver the highest possible praise. This novel deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as \\"Ulysses,\\" \\"Tristram Shandy,\\" \\"Candide,\\" \\"Gulliver's Travels,\\" \\"The Trial\\" and \\"The Metamorphosis.\\" It is not merely one of the greatest comic/satirical novels ever written; it is also one of the most imaginative BOOKS ever written--and I mean EVER, as in 'since the invention of writing.'OK. Now that I've calmed down, I will continue. \\"The Master and Margarita\\" is the kind of book Lewis Carroll might have written had he been trapped in Stalin's Russia during the Terror. It masterfully (pun intended) treads the line between pointed satire and outrageous imaginative invention without ever descending into whimsy.It is quite possible that this novel was the reason writing was invented... I mean, really, do you think the Sumerians went to all that trouble just so we could read Danielle Steele?"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"My Russian friend claims this is possibly the best book he has ever read, at least from Russian literature. I have a difficult time disagreeing; Bulgakov's tale is a masterly exercise in weaving multiple plots into one story. The three separate plots all contain witty and sardonic critiques of society's problems, from greed to pettiness, and it criticizes the Stalinist society, which led to its suppression. The full text was not published until 1989 because of its contents. The full version is an excellent read and I reccommend it to anyone, especially those with an interest in Russian literature."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I read this book a while ago in the Russian original so don't know about this particular translation/edition. The novel is a very bold and subversive book from both a literary and thematic/philosophical approach considering it was written in the peak of early Stalinism in the Soviet Union. In fact, Bulgakov had a long battle with the censors about this work and his others and many were banned.I don't remember the details well at all, but the novel is a surreal blend of the literary and intellectual world in Moscow in the 1930s and the encounter between Jesus and Pontius Pilate in Jerusalem. The two main settings intertwine and mirror each other as the \\"true\\" story of Jesus is told by Woland - the devil who comes to Moscow with his minions including a talking cat. The notions of good and evil draw much from the brilliant Faust but are carried over to the hypocrisy, despair and seeds of goodness in the Moscow setting.The title describes some of the main characters - the Master who is a writer whose work is rejected leading to his extended melancholy and Margarita, his love. The interplay between them, the rest of the literary world and Woland (Satan) and his minions leads to what I can only describe as a completely topsy-turvy novel that is incredibly rich in ideas many of whom will be missed by those who've never had the misfortune to experience Moscow in the late 20s and early 30s and those who have read this only once (or not at all). Fortunately, the second condition is easily fixed! I guess for me, the necessary cure is a reread of this amazing work."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Bulgakov has written a bizarre and very enjoyable book where he takes digs at the contemporary to him (1930s) Soviet (Russian) literary establishment (including the poet Mayakovsky), the atheism of Communist Russia.Although he doesn't seem to be an atheist he isn't a normal Christian either. Woland (the devil character) actually helps the two lovers of the title get together so presumably he isn't that bad, and he apparently runs errands for God.It has been noted in other reviews that the writing gets more lyrical towards the end. This is true, and one of my favourite passages is near the end - where the demons turn into fairie nights and princes and fly back to wherever they came from.I have also seen this book referred to as an inspiration for the Rolling Stones song 'Sympathy for the Devil'."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"This is my favorite Russian novel. I don't understand why it isn't a part of every senior high school's reading requirements. It is great because it has a very interpretive story. Basically the devil comes to Russia and frees people from the oppression of their lives. This is symbolic of the destruction of totalitarian government. This book is very funny very horrifying, and also, at many times very touching. The heart of the book lies though with the devil. It is just amazing the way he changes everyone's life that is in the story in a profound way. Definitely a good read if you are looking to get into good Russian literature."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I gotta join the chorus and say how much I love this book. It represents a watershed in 20th Russian culture and many of its phrases have become idiomatic expressions in Russian. This edition is great: I love the translation, and the limited annotations allow you to follow on some of the inside jokes and the religious symbolism of the book. The story is engaging and entertaining, but above all I highly respect what this book represents: Bulkagov's rant on his own position as an artist in the USSR. This is a man who was so talented, that Stalin, who was a great fan, allowed his contoversial work to be published and performed (albeit not before the censors had their way).Bulgakov was a fine author who died too young...like many of his predecessors in the great Russian literary tradition. His other works: Heart of a Dog, White Guard (originally a play that even though sympathetic to the anti-Bolsheviks, was allowed by Stalin to run in Moscow), and A Country Doctor's Notebook (based on Bulgakov's personal experience as a doctor in the Russian countryside) are worth checking out. Black Snow, a novel that revolves around his obsession with the theatre, is also interesting."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I really need to learn Russian one of these days. Then I could read this book in the original. It is truly a masterpiece--funny, sad, engaging, and thoroughly well-crafted. Split between the uproarious devil-in-Moscow scenes and the novel- within-a-novel about Pilate, The Master and Margarita isn't like anything else you've ever read. It has a lot to say about the big themes of art, life and humanity but it's never pretentious and always highly readable. Truly unforgettable and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I don't speak or read Russian, so I am unable to tell whether or not this was a true translation of the original. What I can tell is that this translation is amusing, cynical, and smooth. The book is much in the style of Catch-22, the same over-the-top ridiculousness to underscore a similar seriousness and futility. I read this book on a vacation and never felt like I was being pretentious; it was just too much fun!"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"What a great book. If Tom Robbins wasn't inspired by &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;, I'd be shocked. Trippy plot twists, serious satire -- overall, a hilarious read. The book starts a little slow, but quickly picks up, and is difficult to put down once the story gets rolling. One of the most delightful discoveries in recent memory."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"The reason I picked up this book was because I had read an article wherein the writer remarked that for her, the world was divided into those who had read The Master and Margarita, and those who had not. I was intrigued and just had to read the book. Bulgakov is an absolute genius. His brand of magical realism is so much more accesible, despite the era (1930s) difference, than say that of Salman Rushdie, whom I also enjoy. Rushdie's cultural settings are magical but still alien at the end of his novels. Bulgakov's Moscow is real and very dark magic and you are truly with him- Wolland's magic show takes place before you eyes. You may hardly believe it. Or you might glance skywards to catch the raining roubles, preferably in hard currency instead. I have to agree with the writer of the article, the world is divided up into The Master and Margarita readers and non- readers. I have not been able to stop gabbing about since I finished it yesterday and have sent my best friends out to buy a copy. They can't loan mine- I love it too much."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"For anyone that has ever studied Russian history under the Soviet system, will get a real thrill and several laughs from this story. Bulgakov does a great job of blending history, storytelling, humor and the total reality of living under the stupidity of the Soviet system; all done without being directly offensive to Stalin. Obviously, the story was not release until many years later, after they had both passed, yet even the first release was astounding for many in Russia.The English translators Diana Burgin and Katherine Tiernan O&#8217;Conner have done a thorough job of capturing the essence of what Bulgakov intended his readers to understand.I would recommend this book to anyone!Whether you are into dark humor, Russian literature, and 20th century prose or just love a good story --- then you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"IN the arena of 20 th century world literature Bulgakov is certainly an important writer. His masterpiece novel &quot;master and margarita&quot; is a shocking reality. When man becomes irrational in life and thought nobody would believe anything and you could find no solace in anything. Soviet regime under Joseph Stalin had created a nightmarish experience of hell. For imagination and emotion, it was a terrible revelation of what not civilization.When Satan appears with his associates in Mosco theatre, everybody was deceived. The women from all classes in a moment found themselves in costly garments and in another moment allon sudden, they found themselves naked in the middle of streets. Once people forsake faith in goodness and love, they will become victims of beastial instincts, in short, all are devils. Master and Magarita was warning from the totalitarian society.From artistic point of view the novel was an amazing success. Once started reading, you will be carried away on the wings of imagination. It is definitely a must read for all lovers of fiction. suggesting for students also, who study the history of soviet union."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"In 1998, I was witness to a stage production of THE MASTER AND MARGARITA at the Winnipeg, Manitoba Fringe Festival. A troupe from Detroit, I believe, had translated the novel to the stage. I had never heard of the novel, but went simply because it sounded interesting.For two hours, I sat transfixed. Never before or since have I had such a satisfying theatrical experience. It's hard to describe, but the use of the stage itself, the language, the acting, the ideas, all added up to something I suspect I will never have again to such a degree. I went back three more times.I finally decided to sit down and read the novel itself, and true to the play, it is complex, disturbing, at times astonishing, at times confusing. I am reminded of the movie adaptation of THE ENGLISH PATIENT, an unfilmable novel filmed magnificently. This is just such a novel.As in the play, how do you describe such a tale? It follows the exploits of the Devil in Russia, but also centres on a failed novelist and his lover, a giant cat, an insane poet, a mother who killed her child. This story is not content to sit still.Why four stars and not five? Because this novel, like the best ones, demands to be read again, to be further understood and savoured. Perhaps I will change it later on, when I reread it. I will read it again."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Either love it or hate it. This book was enthusiastically recommended to me as a modern masterpiece, but I got bored halfway through and plodded through the rest. Written in 1939 by Russian writer Bulgakov, the notion is that the devil visits communist Moscow in the guise of a strange professor along with two cohorts. Moscow, the center of communist xenophobia towards oursiders, is where state-sanctioned athiesm should preclude the devil's very existence. It's cute, and ultimately touches on themes of the purpose of evil, the duality of good and evil, and political hypocrisy. But it's written in that maddening Russian style, full of little references to obscure 19th-century literary gazettes, minor Soviet functionaries, and Goethe. These reference, of course, are coded by self-censorship. As a result, there are pages and entire chapters where nothing seems to happen - a guy walks around the streets, but the commentary pages in the back of the book patiently explain how the names of the streets and apartment numbers carry important, obscure references. The commentary is good and insightful, but ultimately it really demonstrates how far the book is from its readers. You need the commentary just to understand what's going on. I'm told this is a great book that gets better with subsequent readings. Maybe so. Maybe I'll pick it up again later and give it another try."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"The problem with modern totalitarian regimes - the most disgusting form of government - is that they produce no art: no music, no literature, no poetry, no architecture, no visual arts. The art that does come out of such states comes from those who hate what they are and oppose them (at least passively). One of the most terrifying possibilities of the 21st Century is that the ultra-conservative/religious right wing of American politics will realize its long-held aim of a totalitarian theocracy. (Another case of the need to be careful what you wish for: the NRA's policy of making sure white supremacists have an adequate supply of Uzis may backfire. If the rightwingers establish their tyranny, one of the first things they'll do is repeal the 2nd Amendment.)The tyrannies of the 1930s and \`40s were classics of the form - although reading Orwell's \\"1984\\" shows the terrifying possibility that more far-reaching totalitarianism could occur. In prewar Stalinist Russia, the alleged art of the state was \\"Soviet realism\\". Even the actual (and therefore anti-Soviet) artists of Russia occasionally felt the brunt of Stalin and his thugs - with results such as Shostakovich's intensely Stalinist (and therefore antimusical) \\"Hymn of the Forest\\". The dreary banality of all the arts under such antihuman regimes as Bolshevik Russia and Nazi Germany was almost beyond belief.Even so, flowers bloomed in the virtually sterile artistic soil of Stalin's Russia. Great musical talents such as Prokofiev and Kabalevsky - although no fans of their genocidal dictator - were able produce pretty much what they wanted because their styles tended not to offend Stalin and his cultural goon squad. Literature in the Soviet period suffered even more than music: Russia's greatest writers could publish their works, if at all, abroad. What the government allowed to be published were propagandistic (although not entirely hack) works like Shokolov's \\"Virgin Soil Upturned\\". Although the hack writers of the Stalinist period didn't lack talent, the really great writers of the Bolshevik state were obliged to work mostly sub rosa.From the 1920s to the end of his life, Mikhail Afanasyevich Bulgakov lived and worked within the Stalinist tyranny. Denied permission to emigrate and virtually denied permission to create, he lived unhappily until 1940 when he died prematurely of cancer. Paradoxically, Stalin was actually rather fond of Bulgakov, having seen and enjoyed one of his plays. Bulgakov died early enough to avoid Stalin's usual betrayal of nearly everyone he originally befriended (however marginally). The dictator died before he got around to Lavrentiy Beria and some others, but they were certainly on his list by that time. Even at that late date, more than a decade after his death, Bulgakov remained an obscure figure. His greatest work was not published in any form until 1966.This work is \\"Master and Margarita\\", one of a small handful of immortal novels produced within (and in defiance of) Soviet Russia - and possibly the greatest of them. The greatness of M&M; is advanced by its universality. This is achieved by abstracting it to a large extent from the political reality of 1930s Moscow. While the novel paints a vivid picture of life in the Soviet capital, the Stalinist system is virtually invisible and its founder totally so. M&M; could be taking place in the capital of any strongly centrist European state. It should be noted that many editions of M&M; exist. The only one you will wish to purchase is this one (translated by Burgin and O'Connor). It is far above the others in the accuracy and felicity of its translation, not to mention its wonderful notes and analytical essay (\\"Afterword\\").The \\"Master\\" of the novel's title is in many respects Bulgakov himself: a brilliant writer with little success at being published, whose masterpiece (a novel) seems condemned to nonpublication. The novel in this case is about Pontius Pilatus, the Procurator of Judea until mid-36 CE (the year in which Yeshua bar-Yosif [\\"Jesus son of Joseph\\"] was crucified). Some chapters of this novel appear in M&M;, allowing the author to tie many elements of M&M; together. Bulgakov is well versed in Gospel history, learnedly referring to Yeshua as \\"ha-Notsri\\". This term is frequently mistranslated as \\"the Nazarene\\" or \\"of Nazareth\\" (leading the author of \\"Matthew\\" of quote a probably nonexistent older text). It actually means \\"of the branch\\", from netser or nezer (\\"branch\\") - generally taken to mean a claimed descent from the very early Israeli king David. Bulgakov cleverly gives Pilatus a character that doesn't match what we know of him from Josephus. Similarly he gives us a different Yeshua and Yehudah (\\"Judas\\") than we would expect.The \\"Margarita\\" of the title, the Master's muse, is in some respects Bulgakov's 3rd wife (and also his muse), Elena Sergeyevna Shilovskaya. In terms of text devoted to her, Margarita is a far more important than the Master. The Master's story line in this work is reality mostly hers. Her name is an important clue to the novel as a whole. Marguerite (Margarita) is one of the names given to Faust's inamorata. In her passionate devotion to the Master, in her uncompromising and uncompomisable innocence, Margarita is a dramatic picture of Marguerite - but more real and compelling than the portraits of Goethe and Gounod. In a literary sense, Margarita as a shadow of Marguerite, just as M&M; is a shadow of the Faust legend.It seems equally obvious that the Master must be a shadow of Faust himself. Yet the connection seems improbably remote. The Master appears as anything but Faustian, and rather than immersing himself in the world he has removed himself from it and immured himself in an asylum. Even so, his connection with Faust is palpable and compelling. Faust sought something that was not approved by the mediaeval state: knowledge (particularly of the dark arts). Bulgakov sought something deeply disapproved by the Stalinist state: truth. Indeed, no tyrant or would-be tyrant can tolerate truth. (This, I believe, explains F&uuml;hrer Bush's hatred of the truth and Vice-F&uuml;hrer Cheney's pathological fear of it.)The trinity Faust-Marguerite-Mephisopheles brings us inevitably to the protagonist (dare I say hero?) of M&M;, Woland. His name, founded on the German for \\"where?\\", raises instant questions about where he is actually from and, consequently, who he actually is. That he is the \\"devil\\" of New Testament legend becomes quickly and readily apparent. He begins his visit to Moscow by going after a number of unsavory individuals. That they are of little consequence is a necessary reflection of the fact that going after people of real consequence would have landed Bulgakov in a non-mythical hell thanks to Russia's non-mythical devil (Stalin). That Woland's real mission is salvation - at least of Margarita and the Master - will seem far-fetched to the reader until it actually happens. The question is whether that mission was deliberate - for as Goethe says of his devil, \\"That Power I serve ... wills forever evil yet does forever good.\\" More accurately in M&M;, Woland's mission seems to be insuring that evil begets evil and good begets good.Woland in turn is part of yet another trinity: himself, Behemoth, and Korovyov. Behemoth (\\"the Beast\\", one might say) appears mostly in the form of a 6-foot upright cat. Korovyov is more human in form but just as obviously a demon. This trinity turns parts of Moscow upside-down through the use of particularly bizarre pranks. (It might be observed that the prominent presence in their company of an owl and a mirror suggests \\"[Till] Eulenspiegel\\", another famous prankster.) The merriment begins almost at once with the death of the unpleasant Rimsky, run over by a streetcar. The image of his head, rolling kabumpty-bumpty-bump down the street is hilariously macabre. Much of the novel is full of this trinity's high-jinks.I'd have to reread the novel with a mind to make notes in this regard, but I suspect that other trinities appear with some frequency in M&M.;As the pranks in Moscow wind down, the story shifts gears to focus on the adventures of Margarita with Woland and his entourage. There is a grand ball that takes place in an impossibly large space. This is a reflection of Dante Alighieri's \\"Inferno\\". There is then a witch's Sabbath in a remote location. This Faustian episode is accompanied by another, a wild ride on black horses, that appears again at the end of the novel. Throughout, as earlier, it is Woland who guides and directs the activities.Finally, it is Woland, saying he does so at the request of Yeshua, who arranges the salvation of the Master and Margarita. Bulgakov - who has been standing things on their heads throughout the text - thus ultimately stands Christian mythology on its head. It is one of his greatest achievements that he uses the Master's novel and his own novel's ending to add a deep and refreshing humanity to hoary and less human New Testament myths.M&M; has lent several sayings to popular Russian culture. Most important of them is the non sequitur, \\"manuscripts don't burn\\". In the novel, the Master burns his novel, just as Bulgakov burned the original ms. of M&M.; The phrase comes from Woland, but magically produces the Master's ms. Bulgakov, on the other hand, re-transcribed his work from memory. The problem here is, and Bulgakov certainly knew it, that manuscripts do burn. If that were not so, we should now be able to purchase a CD of Sibelius' 8th Symphony. Still, it's amazing how many musicians and authors have left posthumous instructions that certain mss. should be burned, only to have people with a better grasp of reality refuse to burn them.Bulgakov's incomparable novel ends in a chapter of ravishing prose, of which I would like to quote a small paragraph. \\"'And there too,\\" said Woland, pointing backward. \`What would you do in your little basement?' The fragmented sun dimmed in the glass. \`Why go back?' continued Woland in a firm and gentle voice. \`O Master, thrice a romantic, wouldn't you like to stroll with your beloved under the blossoming cherry trees by day and then listen to Schubert by night? Wouldn't you like to sit over a retort, like Faust, in the hope of creating a new homunculus? Go there! Go there! There where a house and an old servant already await you, where the candles are already burning, but will soon go out because you are about to meet the dawn. Take that road, Master, that one! Farewell! It is time for me to go.'\\""},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"My only wish is that more non-Russian speakers knew about it! :("},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I had some doubts when I first started this book. I thought this was probabaly another surpressed novelist who tried to let out his frustration to the communist regime. Well, turns out I am not completely wrong, however this book is definately in the legue of its own, not just \\"another\\" russian novel. Bulgakov has a talent to lure his readers into his kingdom of vivid imaginations by hypnotizing them with his lively writing style.I especially enjoyed his great depictions about Jesus and Potinus Pilate. In the beginning of the book Woland once mentioned that he was on the balcony with Potinus Pilate when he sentenced Juses to crucification, the way Bulgakov wrote thes chapeters impress me as if he had been there by himself!

Some of main characters include a black cat,Satan and of course the two lovers (Master and Margarita). I would recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Bulgakov's &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; is a Goethean fantasy, but like other twentieth century masterpieces of magical realism such as &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; and &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude,&quot; it presents a considerable challenge to the reviewer obligated to describe the oddness of its content. There is so much madness that a plot summary seems pointless, and so much richness that only a firsthand reading experience can do the text justice. As a novel that channels the phantasmagorical into a critique of the society from which it springs and the government under which it was suppressed, it balances humor with creepiness in a way that renders it closer to &quot;The Man Who was Thursday&quot; than to &quot;Alice in Wonderland.&quot;The stars of the novel are a devilish syndicate intent upon wreaking havoc among Moscow society. The ringleader is a magician who subtly calls himself Woland and has a retinue of strange but useful henchmen, including most curiously a huge talking black cat that walks upright and plays chess. The beginning of the novel, in which Woland approaches two literary men who deny the existence of Christ and refutes them by claiming to have been a witness at the Crucifixion, introduces the novel's subtext, a secondary story about Pontius Pilate, the procurator of Judea, who happens to be the subject of a novel composed by a writer known only as the Master.The role of literature under Stalin's regime is a major theme. A young poet named Ivan the Homeless, who writes antireligious propaganda for an intellectual magazine, is suspected of insanity and institutionalized after his encounter with Woland ends in a shockingly violent scene. In the sanatarium he meets the Master, whose life has been reduced to ruins after having his novel rejected for publication and his character defamed by the Soviet press. The Master's conflict with the literary authorities is echoed in the domestic situation of his unhappily married lover Margarita, who liberates herself after a fateful meeting with one of Woland's associates.My favorite character is easily the cat, who goes by the appropriate name of Behemoth. Like a cartoonist, Bulgakov recognizes that animals are more convincing as agents of human thoughts and actions when they're bipedal and prehensile, and so creates a cat that's too cool for his company, a laconic sort of fellow who, commanded by Woland to leave the room because of his insolence, nonchalantly replies that he hasn't had his coffee yet. Of course, logic suggests that he is not really a cat, but in a work of fantasy, logic must yield its primacy to the caprices of imagination.The scenes are a smooth synergy of the natural and the supernatural: a bombastic magic show at a theater, gratuitous decapitations, a skin cream whose application conjures a witch's ride, a roaring fireplace that serves as a gateway to hell, a Satanic ball, a police shootout with a pistol-packing Behemoth swinging on a chandelier, characters inexplicably named after composers. Probably the most venomous diatribe against the repressive Soviet literary politics of the day, &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; glows like a neon sign in the night in brazen defiance of censorship."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"It has been my favorite book ever since I was 14. What captivated me then was obviously the beautiful love story. Re-reading it as I was growing up opened up many more dimensions to the book and it never stops. All my close friends have at some point received Master and Margarita as a gift from me and also fell in love with it. I can't speak for the quality of the English translation, but one of the reviews provides an excellent recommendation, so I hope you'll choose the version that best represents the magic of Bulgakov's writing."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"\\"The Master and Margarita\\" is my favorite book and has been since I was first introduced to it a few years ago, it has even de-throned (for me) \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" which is no small feat. The story is quick, lively, and dark yet funny. Written a long time ago in Soviet Russia this book was unable to be published at first due to the religious themes and less than favorable mention of the Communist government of Russia interwoven throughout however the book doesn't feel overly-religious, is not preachy, and is not a political treatise.Bulgakov has managed to pen a story about God and the Devil which doesn't feel like a story about God and the Devil.All the characters are amazing, interesting, and quite a lot of fun with special mention of course due to Behemoth, the talking kitty, and you will come to love him as have I.Combining aspects of a love story, religion, and politics while following the life of a lovesick author and that of the woman who loves him, with frequent excursions to biblical Jerusalem and a healthy dose of Demonic mischief, \\"The Master And Margarita\\" is truly a gem. I've read it at least five times now and the first time I picked it up I could not put it down. This version, translated by Katherine Tiernan O'Connor and Diana Burgin, is the best version in print today with the most faithful translation from the original Russian.Do yourself a favor and read this book, it's simply wonderful."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Written in the darkest years of Russia's unfathomably brutal totalitarian dictatorship, long before the idea of \\"postmodernism\\" had arisen, Bulgakov's brilliantly crafted, mischievously conceived masterpiece boldly challenges the tenets of his time and culture, rejecting both traditional religious dogma and modern atheism while having quite a bit of fun with the story of Faust. The Devil is raised up as a kind of anti-hero; Pontius Pilate is portrayed as a conflicted and guilt-ridden bureaucrat; and the Devil's followers and retinue are shown as both more powerful and more free than the common masses.Far from a paean to sociopathy and dropping out, however, and despite its phantasmic form and plot, The Master and Margarita is in fact a work of deep humanistic Romanticism in the Russian literary tradition. Bulgakov's title characters manage to escape the constraints of their lives and exult in true freedom by the only means available to them: by rejecting society around them and living by their emotions, by fleeing society's brutal imposition of mediocrity and meaninglessness, and by trusting their inner integrity, thereby exposing the culture they are fleeing for its degraded venality and materialistic status-seeking.Subversively, it is only those characters who follow the Devil who can be free and be granted absolution. The Devil offers not only darkness but contrasts, and notes that light cannot be appreciated without shadows--a subtle but serious critique of Communism's ideology and aesthetics (both of which caused Bulgakov much suffering in his life). Only the Devil can restore an artist and his lover to what they truly yearn for: the peaceful daily idealism of doing good work and loving one another. Perhaps in a better world, the Devil would not be required for such liberation; in Bulgakov's Moscow, however, he definitely is. In Bulgakov's world, the primary imperative is to restore a sense that the Devil exists, that ethics exist, that integrity exists and that it can be violated.The narrative's fragmented, multi-perspective style reflects the imperatives of the society in which the characters are embedded. Most are painted sketchily, even mechanically, defined by their functions and their status. Don't look for deep Tolstoyesque psychological portraits here: these are mechanical people in a mechanical society in which fear rules. Liberation for Bulgakov's characters comes through resurgent Romanticism, not analysis or intellectuality. As the title characters start to discover their freedom, the language itself becomes more sweeping and heroic, more emotional, and more narrative. The themes of the novel are therefore borne out not only through the story and the characters, but through the way the story is itself told. A staggering achievement of the novelist's craft.I only wish I were able to read it in the original Russian -- I am sure we can only appreciate a fraction of the richness of the text in translated form. However, this translation is a wonderful read. (I read the Vintage edition translated by Diana Burgin and Katherine Tiernan O'Connor; Penguin Classics has another translation.) I recommend reviewing the endnotes and comments for each chapter after reading it, so you can appreciate the references before moving on. The chapters are short.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"The novel which was the inspiration for the Rolling Stone's sympathy for the devil. At one point Woland says ... please allow me to introduce myself ... This is one of my favorite books. I have read all the translations and none has ceased to please. A truly remarkable novel of the Devil coming to Moscow and the hilarious adventures which ensue for him and his retinue, and their affect on the citizens. On a deeper level a scathing commentary on Communism in Soviet Russia. Bulgakov is a masterful writer and this is a masterful work. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Needless to say, those around me weren't too happy with me the day I read the oh-so-genius \\"The Master and Margarita\\". I'm trying to remember the last time a book influenced me this much and made me realize its genius halfway through and laugh hysterically throughout appreciatively. It was probably \\"Don Quixote\\", which we all know is a simply brilliant book. \\"The Master and Margarita\\" surpassed even that in terms of genius.For instance, chapter 13: \\"Enter the Hero\\". 120 pages into the book, Bulgakov introduces readers to the central characters for whom the book is named. The important characters until then remain major, however it becomes clear that the story is not, in fact, about them at all. What other book can start with the whimsically titled \\"Never Talk to Strangers\\" chapter, go on to talk about devils, evil black cats with guns, witches, and dying in order to be happy? Never has a book about evil been quite as enjoyable.\\"The Master and Margarita\\" is a perfect example of where the central characters you grow to love are remarkably evil, if amusing, awkward, and perfectly human (despite not being human by any means). One of my favorite moments is when one of the devil's lackeys complains about being forced to do a task he feels is better suited to another lackey. One can't help but love the panic and chaos left behind by the devil (though he is only officially declared to be the devil late in the book, it is clear throughout, not least by the revealing back of the book...).The back of the book is strangely revealing (as are the reviews), but strangely, it's not the plot that drives the novel (though it certainly makes it more enjoyable). Clever writing, good storytelling, fabulous characters and characterization, and the most brilliant moments in literary history that I've encountered in my life, \\"The Master and Margarita\\" can be summed up in one simple word that I've definitely overused in this review: Genius.This is an enjoyable, brilliant, well-written, genius (there it is again!) must-read. A 100% enthusiastic recommendation."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I found Mikhail Bulgakov's life terribly sad, as I progressed through this novel, realizing how much of it is autobiographical. Here was a brilliant man---the grandson of Priests, who was obviously quite theologically challenged in atheist Russia. His motif surrounding the existence of Jesus and the Devil, told through stories of Faust and Pontius Pilate, was obviously his personal desire to master the concept of good versus evil, in a culture of oppression, brutality, and subjugation, not to mention censorship---the slow death of a creative, freedom-seeking, artist.A good deal of the read may appear to just be magical folly but on careful inspection, it is filled with deep, political satire and symbolism attacking Stalin's Communist Russia and the justifiable paranoia it bred. The ridicule, denouncement and exposure was nothing short of genius, as were the characters that carried out his themes, my favorite being the personification of the big as a pig, Vodka craving, Black Cat.Bulgakov, was clearly before his time and it is sad he died at 48. His history shows a man who was broken by his inability of free expression. His determination to complete his works, in spite of censorship, is a testament to his spirit and perseverance---one of the strongest reasons that this book deserves to be read by all. I consider it a literary gift from the grave, carrying messages we must never forget.Be warned that this is not a quick and easy read---at least it was not for me. I suspect that I've missed, or misinterpreted many scenarios that will read differently with a repeat read. Simply put, it's like trying to watch a ten ring circus---in more ways than one. But, you won't want to miss a single ring of action."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"This is another Russian lit classic! I'm always looking for great Russian authors, and Bulgakov is really a master. I read Heart of a Dog before The Master and Margarita, and I'm glad I did. There is an obvious improvement of the writer's style and finesse, and the story of this book is truly amazing. If you love Russian literature (or just great political satire), this is great story. And I know what I'll be for Halloween this year!"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"What else can I add to the hundreds of 5 star ratings ? I only wish I was a master of the Russian language as to not miss what little rythym, timing, and less so meaning that could have been lost in translation."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"The Master and Margarita is certainly different from the 19th century Russian literature most of us read in school, and provides a unique view into the Soviet culture of the 1930's. This is a big part of what makes the book important, but a more compelling reason, perhaps, is that the book is smart, funny and just plain entertaining. If I ever get a cat, I think I'll have to name it Behemoth. . ."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"this my favourite book of all time -- i must have read it 30 times or more, each time extracting something new i hadn't noticed before. on all levels this is a staggering work. i used it as a great courting test. everytime i became involved with someone new i'd give them the book. anyone who didn't rave on about it was soon shown the door. if i were ever stranded on a desert island with just one book, this would be it."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I found this book in tatters underneath a moldy mattress in a Bornean bordello. Unlike my &quot;date&quot;, this book was only tattered and soiled on the outside. What a surprise this book is (much like the surprise I discovered several weeks after my encounter with a different &quot;Margarita&quot;) and I can highly recommend it to one and all.I should warn you now, this is one of those books that requires an imagination as many of the things that occur are out of the ordinary (more like Garcia Marquez or Murakami than King or Carroll). If that bugs you, stay away. On the other hand, if you like subversive, metaphor-laden lollipops, this could be your sucker. It's a crazy ride, and the commentary included with this translation is most helpful. But nevermind all of that. What makes this worth reading is the darn cat. For once, the cat is not annoying. The black cat in this book (read Ch. XXVIII for example) is very very amusing. My wife's insipid terror-cat is nothing like this boozehound blackie and that's just too bad. I tried to get the philistine (Bessie) to read it, but all she did was complain about how unbelievable certain events were (she was particularly offended by how much vodka the cat drank). No matter, it's a great book and a nekkid redhead even makes an appearance. Better than most!"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita is a fascinating parody of Russia during the 1930's when Stalin ruled. Bulgakov's hidden symbolism, where ridiculous people and occurrences represent the true reality, provides an interesting view into Russian life, and entertains the reader all at once. An example of this would be the Foreigner, who is a prominent character from the beginning. The Foreigner in the novel is actually Satan, who has come to Moscow to wreak havoc on the city, and drive many people insane. In the novel, the Foreigner has an ominous tone from the beginning, due to the fact that during the 1930's, foreigners were viewed as enemies, and the citizens were extremely suspicious of them. The Foreigner is not one to be trusted, and if one takes a deeper look, Bulgakov is stating that Stalin is this Foreigner; Stalin is actually Satan. The Foreigner is responsible for mass disappearances, just as Stalin is responsible for the same-mass arrests of innocent citizens which led to their mysterious disappearance. The symbolism of Satan representing Stalin is just one of the many symbols of people and events that must be figured out. Once the rest of this intricate web of symbolism is deciphered, it is shocking to realize the statement that Bulgakov is making about Russia and its leader, Stalin. Bulgakov describes the Foreigner (Stalin) as a black magician who makes false promises. For example, at the show that the Foreigner, Woland, and his retinue put on, money falls from the sky to the delight of the audience, but once they spend it somewhere, it turns into useless scraps of paper. Also, Woland dresses the women in lavish clothing, but once the show ends, the clothing disappears and they find themselves naked. Woland is a man of deception, who shows the people what they want to see, but does not provide them with results. The commentary that Bulgakov is making about Stalin is that he is a deceptive leader who makes false promises. The Master and Margarita provides many other comments on Russian life during Stalin's reign, and the most interesting part of this novel is figuring out what these comments are, who the characters represent in both Russia and in religion, and so on. Bulgakov's work is wonderful due to this, which makes reading this novel worthwhile-not only is it entertaining to read, it provides a person with much to figure out once it is over."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Being a huge fan of Russian Writers, my opinion is biased. But, my peer who hates russian writers vehemently, took a chance on Mr. Bulgakov and was quite entertained and chose to exempt this writer from his fury. This translation is an easy read, like Chekhov, and absolutely hilarious in it's absurdity. Though religion is a strong theme in this book, it's not overpowering and he explains what some may not know so the reader doesn't get lost."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"There are four translations of \\"The Master and Margarita\\" presently available Two of them, those by Mirra Ginsburg and Michael Glenny, are based upon a 1966 censored Russian version of the novel, while the later, Burgin/O'Connor and Pevear/ Volokhonsky translations are based upon the final uncensored version. Additionally, the latter two translations contain useful endnotes (footnotes would have been preferable) that explain references to people, places and things in the Moscow of the Thirties.Despite these shortcomings, after reading all four translations, I found that I enjoyed the Ginsburg translation the most. Since I do not read Russian, I based that opinion on the facts that (1) for me, it read the most smoothly, and (2) the comic passages were simply funnier in her translation (Russians, justifiably consider the novel to be a comic masterpiece). I attribute these characteristics to the Ms. Ginsburg having been born and raised in the country of Byelorussia and her being a successful writer (in English!) in her own right.Based upon those criteria, I rank the translations as follows:1. Mirra Ginsburg (1967) [ISBN 0802130119]. Simply the most readable. Read also her translation of &quot;Life of a Dog.&quot;2. Diana Burgin and Katherine O'Connor [ISBN: 0679760806]. Conveys a wonderful sense of mood, especially in the Pontius Pilate chapters.3. Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky (1997) [ISBN: 0141180145]. I had the sense that this is the most accurate translation, but it is less literary than the two preceding choices. The comic passages simply do not come across. Pevear and Volokhonsky, a husband and wife team, are prolific translators of Russian literature. I have enjoyed several of their other translations, but this one just does not seem to work.4. Michael Glenny (1967) [ISBN: 0679410465]. No reason to buy this one.Having read all four, would I do it again? Absolutely! I'm convinced that this is one of the great novels of the 20th century, and with each reading I picked up subtleties that I had not noticed before."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I loved this translation of the book. It was extremely helpful in terms of the endnotes and projected the magic, the desperation and the playful havoc of this truly mischievious group that Woland (Satan) heads. This has to be my favourite book of all time."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"As a reader, I loose interest quickly unless a book moves at a decent pace. When this book was recommended to me I had my doubts as I thought the book dealt with a rather dry topic, but boy was I wrong. The characters are great and the story, though contemplative, is quite engaging. The books purpose is to let the author spread his views on communist Russia, though at the heart of the book is a story about two lovers who have been seperated. Do they get back together? Well, you'll have to read to find out.The book is also quite humerous. First there are the characters Satan brings along with him. They're quite the eclectic crew considering one of them is a large talking black cat. The problem is, though they're in league with Satan, they're so quirky, you can't help liking them. Then their antics. You can't help but thinking people are getting what they deserve. At the same time all of this is going on, Bulgakov is getting his point on communism across. One point I particularly liked was the fact that communism extinguishes religion, so the Russians are not able to explain all the strange happenings by linking them to Evil. There are so many other points, enjoyably written that this book just has to be read."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"The book arrived on time and I'm delighted to have bought it . Just started reading it and am enjoying it no end !"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I read The Master and Margarita because I am a big fan of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy and I figured that it might be comparable to the classics of Russian literature. I also had read that it contained a lot of symbolism and allegory to the Stalin Era that it was written in, which I thought would be quite interesting.While the allegory may have existed, I felt like the comparisons were over my head, despite the detailed notes provided by the translators. I also failed to see much of a moral to the story, which is okay in itself - I don't need a good novel to preach me a lesson if the plot and/or the characters are entertaining - but it almost seemed to carry itself as if there were lessons to be taught. Other than the obvious Faustian lesson of not selling your soul to the devil, I failed to see anything else much of worth in it.While I may not have appreciated it on the level the author had (I believe) intended, it was still an enjoyable book. The cast of characters was fun and original - most especially Behemoth, the demonic, anthropomorphic cat. And the entire atmosphere was quite vivid. You really got a clear image of the theater setting, the park, the city streets and dirty tenement buildings around Moscow. The narration had a slight hint of those classic Russian authors, but the action was all 20th-century flair.Overall, for me, it had the feeling of a Tim Burton movie: silly characters, an offbeat story , dark humor throughout and an okay resolution. Not something that will stick with me forever, but a decent piece of entertainment while it lasted."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Length:: 3:35 MinsThe Master And Margarita Music Poem FragmentThe Master And Margarita - Music Poem and Score to Future Film CD+Blu-ray Audio (Limited Collectors Addition)"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Interlacing two stories, that of Christ's crucifixion and a modern-day visit by the Devil to early 20th Century Moscow, the author creates a beautiful (and fantastic - witches and devils and spirits and talking cats galore!) portrayal of life under the then-new communist regime.An excellent choice for anyone interested in the first few decades of communist rule in Russia, or satire, or just a ripping good read."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"The Master and Margarita is truly one of the great novels of the 20th century. Hilarious, lyrical, insightful, and profound; Bulgakov's masterpiece will make you think, make you feel, and make you challenge yourself and your beliefs on good and evil. I'll mention that this review refers to the Burgin/O'Connor translation. I've read this translation twice, and I love it. I can't compare it to other translations though, as I haven't read any. I plan on reading the Pevear/Volokhonsky translation soon; I've read several translations by them, and all have been wonderful. One caveat about the Burgin/O'Connor edition: the endnotes, written by Bulgakov's biographer Ellendea Proffer, offer far too much opinion. She should not be telling us how to think, and how to feel about this novel. But that doesn't spoil this awe-inspiring novel."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"This is a very strange, very fascinating, very novel novel. Bulgakov had a tremendous imagination and it is evident throughout all his work. This one tells two separate yet interrelated story lines. The first is the annual Black Ball hosted by Satin. In this instance, in Russia. The second is the re-created tale of Christ facing P. Pilot in a trial and how the two interrelate. This is and should be read as a comedy. There are many absolutely comical situations, such as the fat cat spinning around on a chandelier while shooting at the police. Hundreds of bullets are shot, yet no one is injured. This is surely one of the best novels of the century and this translation, by the two female scholars, is by far the best of those I have read (three)."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I had to read this book for my upper divison 20th Century Russian History class the story is great although it is fictional, however the author does do a great job on commenting on live in the Soviet era.

It's very multi-level,I saw different things in it every time I've re-read it-and believe me,you'll want to re-read it. Sort of a mix between the real life(as real as Russia after the 1917 revolution may seem to us now),and the mystic world of Voland and Azazaello,and of course-the period just before Jesus was killed in very ancient Jerusalem... Very much recomended!"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"This novel was especially exciting for myself in that in addition to being just a plain old great story, the setting gave an insight to the Moscow of the revolution. After reading Radzinski's biography of Stalin soon after reading Master and Margarita and finding out that Bulgakov was initally commissioned to write a Soviet revolution period biography of Stalin (back in those days, imagine being a person writing the biography of Stalin or Hitler or someone else completely insane like that in those insane times) the insights he gives as to the daily lives of the Soviet citizen of the times in the time of the novel make Master and Margarita all the more intriuging. Will definetly read it again."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"There are no words to describe the genius of this book or its author.

If you're ever in Moscow, visit the apartment near Mayakovskaya metro station where Bulgakov used to live, and you'll see what I mean. It's a place of pilgrimage, and the staircase outside is covered in respectful graffiti - a section of which was used as the front cover for a British edition of the book. What's all the fuss about? Well, it's a book that tries to do many very different things at once and actually succeeds. It brings the reader tantalisingly close to a religious revelation of world-shattering importance. It is a hilarious satire on Soviet life. It is a valiant defence of the intrinsic value of literature. And it is a deeply moving love-story. The cult was also nurtured by rumours that Bulgakov was still trying to finish the book on his death-bed, dictating alterations and additions to his wife. But you don't have to believe Bulgakov was a prophet to fall in love with this book."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Much is made of the symbolism and metaphorical imagery contained in this novel; it's true that it can't be separated from the time in which it was written and where - Soviet Russia in the 1920s. However, trying to deconstruct this masterpiece at its many levels takes the pleasure out of what is otherwise a fantastic and original story. Perhaps the best way to view it is the author's very personal satirical fantasy in which the narrow-minded and vain literary and theatre critics (among others) of his day get their just desserts, and the Master (obviously Bulgakov's alter-ego) finds peace with the woman he loves. In other words, you don't have to know too much about Soviet society during the early Stalinist period or even understand all of the symbolic allusions in \\"The Master and Margarita\\" to thoroughly enjoy this novel. It is a work that easily transcends the bounds of \\"Soviet dissident literature\\" (a category much more suited to someone like Solzhenitsyn) Also, anyone who has ever had a cat can appreciate Bulgakov's characterization of the obnoxious yet likable demon cat Behemoth. Although one could hardly say that \\"The Master and Margarita\\" is a feminist tract, Bulgakov's portrayal of women in the novel is uniquely progressive: Margarita, who boldly goes through the story either naked or partially clothed, largely dictates her own destiny, perhaps the only character in the book to do so. Since much is made of the novel's satirizing and criticism of the Stalinist purges and terror, I think the most poignant reflection of this is in the epilogue, when a large number of innocent black cats are tortured and/or killed in the wake of the devil's visit to Moscow. \\"The Master and Margarita\\" can be thoroughly enjoyed at so many levels, making it without a doubt one of the 20th century's greatest novels."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I am a native speaker, (Russian).I have read this book in the original language countless times throughout my childhood and adolescence. I know virtually every word in it. This was the first time I had read it in a foreign language.I am left speechless with the accuracy and professionalism of the translators. Fantastic job done, folks. You nailed it.Initially, when I saw the front cover of the book on Amazon, I mistook the black figure on it for that of Pontius Pilate, (in a Pope-like pointy hat), looking down at the city of Yershalaim from one of his palace's windows. So, naturally, knowing about the many really, really bad translations of the book, I was a little reserved on the initial expectations of it. However, when the book has arrived, and I got it out of the envelope, I immediately saw that it was Behemoth looking down at Yershalaim/World/The Mankind/History, and at THAT moment, I had realized that they pretty much must had nailed this one.And what do you know? By the middle of the very first chapter, I knew I was right.The world is truly a stage, and we are all actors...Thank You, ladies.Thank You so much.Sincerely,Me"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I have read this book at least 5 times (4 times in Russian and 1 in English) and consider this book to be my favorite. It is hard to find a genre for this book: for me it is one of a kind. It could be hard to read for people not familiar with Soviet Union culture, because in order to understand the irony of that way of life you have to know how it really was there and then. I found translation of this book to be very exact and I was satisfied with the style. Overall, this book is not for everybody to understand, but if you enjoy reading books of international authors, and have read and enjoyed reading at least one Russian writer, I would recommend to read \\"Master and Margarita\\" by Mikhail Bulgakov."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I first got attracted to this book when I knew it was a major influence on Mick Jagger's \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\", a song I liked since long ago. Then I researched a bit on Bulgakov at Wikipedia and downloaded a pdf version of the book. I just could not stop reading from the early beginning. It is the kind of book you wish you have written, for it deals with thoughts and feelings you already experienced but were not able to put in words. The bitter taste of envy, I have to confess, is difficult to wash out. Any wannabe writer would chop his finger to write something close to it. I always liked and felt related to Pilate. He is the Bible's character who seem to think closer to me. He is a skeptic. Nonetheless, he is the only non-follower that sympathizes with Jesus. He likes him without believing in him. It is such a riddle to believers, but unbelievers like me understand this mixed feeling pretty much.

This book will forever impact your life, as long as you like the first few pages. Read the sample. If you don't like the excerpt, don't read it. If you like or love the sample and decide to read the book, you will never look at the world in the same way. The Master and Margarita is the ultimate masterpiece of literature-- not just because of the genius involved that is Mikhail Bulgakov, but because this book contains the following to a great degree: scorching farcical humor; unstoppable empathy, genuine romance, Christian quandaries, insightful allegory, high drama, and The Devil Knows What!!!This translation in particular (Bergin & O'connor) is the best out there. If the Russian Language version is considered the apex like most critics say, than I am left speechless, because I thought the English translation was superlative.Don't buy into the hype. This book is not satanic in anyway (oh, those \\"Satanist\\" always trying to steal the best). It is a story that involves the devil, his most hilarious and scary retinue and all their shenanigans. If you are an articulate spirit who enjoys the dynamic world of human thought and experience, than welcome to The Master & Margarita Satanic Cult--Just kidding. Seriously though, reading this book is like eating atomic hot wings, than trying to go back to eating white bread: nothing will ever read (or taste) quite as good."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"This is like Dante's Inferno meets Monty Python. This is like Hellraiser meets The Marx Brothers. This is like Milton's Paradise Lost meets The Far Side.It is absurd.It is also one of the funniest and best novels I have read in a long time. Every chapter is abounding with clever quips, absurdist action, and poignant observations. There is a great literary observation going on here on what makes an artist suffer for his art. Another: What is art considered by those in leagues with government control? It also makes you think about the value of good and evil, and why we are so bent on considering one thing evil and another good with punitive absolution. It shows situation as being more complicated than anything really is. And to say that the Devil is an evil thing...well, in this book, it seems like both an overstatement & oversimplification.One interesting about this novel is things are written as an account; as they happen. There is no real character development. But you learn much about the people (and demons) within the work as they involve themselves within everyone else--much like real life. Because in real life, we do not have our encounters developed for us with all background information known: we experience it...just as everyone else in this novel does, too. Do not expect easy explanations. Just enjoy it as one would enjoy any wild ride in which everywhere one looks there is something new and fascinating."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I don't want to add to the lengthy reviews below, I just want to add another \\"five stars\\" to this masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Although I respected THE MASTER AND MARGARITA, I found it difficult to read. The main difficulty for me here is the same one I have with virtually all Russian literature. And that is the names. All the characters have at least three names. Sometimes they are called by all three names, sometimes by two of them and sometimes by only one name. At other times they will be referred to by nickname. This often occurs in the same paragraph. I constantly had to keep looking back through the book to figure out who was who. The other difficulty for me is that there are so many characters and the story keeps skipping between them, so that no story line is allowed to gain much momentum, even though the book is action packed. This is a heavily ironic comedy about the devil coming to a society that is not supposed to believe in either devils or deities. Of course, wherever the devil goes, there's going to be trouble. The events of the novel are tumultuous and horrifying, including two beheadings, Christ's crucifixion, massive fires in crowded buildings, earthquakes, etc. And all the horrifying events are spectacular events, performed before an audience.Probably the hardest things to translate in any language are jokes, and this book is full of them. But nonetheless I found this translation to be quite smooth and I very much appreciated the detailed notes and the extremely helpful afterword by Ellendea Proffer. It was here that I learned that Bulgakov was primarily a playwright of the 1920s. His novel was suppressed for thirty years and was not published until after his death. Now I very much want to read his plays.I'm sure that there were elements of the book that I didn't get and will never get simply because I'm not a Russian. And it probably loses a lot in translation. (No language can ever truly capture the subtleties of another.) But the story is animated by a very off-the-wall sensibility that's going to be there in any language. Bulgakov's was an interesting mind. This is a book in which a happy ending is going to hell.I think THE MASTER AND MARGARITA is an important work of 20th Century literature and is certainly worth reading, even if it's work at times."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"..get the right translation of this book.It's my favorite ,and I was lucky enough to read it in two different languages,and in English two different editions, and Diana Burgin's is far superior to the previous ones.Native russian speakers pointed it out to me that Mirra Ginsburg simply didn't do justice to the original,and although I was not able to read it in russian, I think that Ms.Burgin's translation flows better,and it is just more enjoyable.There are many great reviews about the book itself, I just wanted to point out how important it is to find the right edition of such a great classic."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Every so often, in a vast ammount of writers and works of Art out there, one stumbles upon a true gem. He may not yet conceive it as a true gem, but, as the process of reading and diving into the authors world progresses, so does the radiant brilliance of a gem starts to shine, and everything aorund it simply falls into the darkness...into the nothingness.To say that Master and Margarite is gem in its fullest, isn't any kind of bold statement. True, you hear that phrase allmost on a daily schedule basis, whenever someone talks about books, trying to assure you that the book they have in mind will change your world and the way how you think. Well, I will not say anythnig like that regarding the Bulgakov work. Simply because it is not true. This kind of book would never be enlisted on any of the top-sellers, and hits lists out there, it simply isn't that kind of book. It does not offer cheap philosophy worthy of a soap-opera, it does not give simple, yet brilliant sollutions to everyday problems, it does not have powerfull and mind boggling characters (alas, this may be wrong, but in the context I'm talking off isn't), so why should annyone read it.That is the good question. And one of the simplest answer will be given here. Apart of great work of Russian realist, this is the one of the greatest books that mother Russia has given birth to in century that has passed. It's simple brilliance astonishes one on a single glance. Even if you are going to write academic seminar titled Reminiscences of Stallinistic dictatorship in Master and Margarita as one of my friends did, or you just want to sit back and enjoy yourself, you'll find material for everything inside these pages. Without any kind of attempt to hollistic method of any kind.Bulgakov put lot of elegance, and witty remarks in his writing, but here he is displaying his talent at its best. There are many studies of this bok out there on internet, and on dusty shelves in old libraries, graet number of critics dulled their writing pencil writing about this book. And it deserves to be so. By means of writing (and reading) we keep history (and Art) remembered, as we are (in a way obliged to do). This is the book full of wonders, which shouldn't be forgotten. What one has to do is very simple. One oly has to read it...and do so again..."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"The vintage international translation is by far the best. The foot notes alone are a great read and the translation and writing are phenomenol. This is a must read book for the philosophically minded."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"A great piece of literature and not stale at all. Discourses and allegories to Goethe's Faust, many a biblical reference, a lot to provoke the mind... but he doesn't forget about the entertaining aspect of reading, you got Satan running around predicting people's deaths for them even though there's nothing they can do, a giant, evil, vodka-swilling cat, and a demon zombie girl out for blood, everyone going insane and / or selling their souls... This book might just become my favorite which depicts Satan as a main character."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Bulgakov's Master and Margarita is one of the best novels to have come out of Russia in the twentieth century. Written during the repression of the Stalinist '30s Bulgakov literally risked his life to write this. In fact it wasn't published until 26 years after his death, even then in abreviatted form.I won't add to what others have said of the substance of the novel except it operates on a personal, political and theological levels. From each reading you'll take something from this gem.I have read both the Glenny and the Burgin/O'Connor translations(My Russian is only at an intermediate level so I did not attempt it in its native tongue). Glenny's translation is extremely readable and flows like great literature. He does make mistakes in his choice of words but you won't go wrong with it. It was the version that got me hooked on Bulgakov.Burgin/O'Connor come very close to Bulgakov's Russian with the added bonus of notes and an essay at the back of the novel. While less flowing than Glenny it's more accurate and also a wonderful read. Grab a copy of either and you won't be sorry.One of the great books of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"If I was allowed only one sentence to summarize this book, I would frame it thus: Here is a fictional account of what happens when the devil comes to visit a city that does not believe in him! I just finished reading M &amp; M an hour ago, and I must say, there is much philosophical depth strewn throughout its constant morphings and manifestations. It should be read for what it is, a comic masterpiece that defies any genre placement... it is like no other book I've ever encountered, and can only somewhat be likened to the supernatural thrillers of Charles Williams.In M &amp; M, Bulgakov has us marvellously believing in a huge vodka-drinking talking cat; a woman (Margarita) who becomes an invisible, broom-riding aeronaut; a man who turns into a supersonic flying hog... an animated suit with no-one in it... there is no end to the Bulgamorphic inventiveness. It is no wonder that half of his Moscow ends up in an insane asylum at one point or another. I could never give a better synopsis of the book than the official amazon editorial review by Mary Park, (as seen above) so I will refrain from an attempt... but I will say that at no less than 25 different passages I did some cross-referencing with a different translation (the Pevear/Volkhonsky) and always felt that the Burgin/Tiernan-O'Connor was superior in readability.It is such a unique book that there are many plausible/valid interpretations of who the main character really is. In my opinion, it is Ivan Bezdomny, the disillusioned poet who seems to have internalized the best conception of who Woland (the devil) really was. Bezdomny is a sort of &quot;parenthesis&quot; to the story, he's there on the first page and he's there on the last, and though he is not on stage (so to say) as much as the others... when the curtain falls, it seems that he is the one who best understands what has happened to Moscow. The only one who seems to know more is the full moon overhead...Read the book. It's truly ominous."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"This book was beautiful prose, humor, and intelligent reading all wrapped into one. It has so many layers and so many little details that I'm glad I went out and bought it, for I'll definitely be reading it again! I fell in love with it, and the only thing I'm sad about is that I can't read Russian, so I can't read the original. I have no doubt that so much was lost in the translation, which is a shame. A beautiful book, definitely worth the time and money!"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"This masterpiece, has always been a favorite of mine, for its beautiful writing, hilarious characters, Faustian theme with a romantic twist, and satire.This particular edition with its annotations, added to the reading experience. I read the annotations, chapter by chapter, which describes the political background, references that only would make sense in Russian, to people who knew the times.Even if you have read it before, the annotations alone make it worth reading again."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I really had no idea what to expect from this book before I started it. I read the back and was immediately attracted to the Bizarre plot. It became my favourite book after the first chapter. For a week I existed to read this book. School, food and friends were just obstacles in the way of my reading this book. It just became greater and greater as it went on. Bulgukav describes settings and characters so well (and in so few words) you feel as if you are there. This book also carries the widest selection of odd and creepy characters in one novel. most of all this book led me to ask the question, how come all books can't be this good?"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"This is one of the greatest novels of the 20th century. A grandson of Faust and an ancestor to the Tin Drum, the 100 Years of Solitude, the Midnight's Children, the Wind-up Bird Chronicle...And surely Mick Jagger must have read it before coming out with Beggars' Banquet!Bulgakov and Nabokov (in his Sirin period) make me regret that I never learned Russian. (maybe after retirement?)Written and set in Moscow during the Stalin time, but published only in the 60s, posthumously, it ought to have far more attention than it gets. In Germany, it has just been re-published in a series by Der Spiegel, which includes bestsellers from the last 40 years. It was a bestseller when it came out and should stay in print. I noticed in Amazon that a new pocket book edition will come in February. Good.With sympathy for the devil, we watch mayhem spreading in a dictatorial setting which has no place for non-dictatorial goings-on. They need the devil to tell them that Jesus existed. The devil shows up as a professor for black magic. He uses the name Voland, one of his names in Goethe's Faust. He dislocates Moscow's social life endlessly. The resulting extravaganzas are masterfully subversive and anarchic. On a second level, a Jesus story is told, a kind of Voland Gospel. Bulgakov introduces himself as the 'master', residing in a lunatic asylum, very appropriately, the author of the gospel.A highly entertaining masterpiece.There is some importance of music, but I have not quite figured out, what the use of supporting characters called Berlioz and Strawinsky and the cameo appearance by Johann Strauss means."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I just finished reading the Michael Glenny translation of the novel recently, and I must say, despite all the supposed shortcomings of that translation, it was a great read. Like others have said, it combines many elements of fiction into one novel. It is overtly a dark comedy (I loved the Koroviev/Behemoth sequences) and romance novel (not in a sappy sense, but a very real one), but there is definately more to it. Covertly, it is quite philosophical and satirical. Be sure to get an edition with footnotes, it will help you to pick up on the philosophy and satire in the novel.This is not the best book I've ever read, or my favourite, but it is now amoung my favourites for these reasons. It was an entertaining read, although a bit thick at times (perhaps because of the translation).Andrew"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"OK. I can think of only two reasons:1) You still have not read this book2) You have read this book and even written a review and now you wish to see your own review on the Internet (kinda makes you proud ;)).So then, if it is (1), please read some of the 100+ reviews and if you still can not make up your mind, don't worry, some people even punch two holes on the presidential ballotscase (2), (and you all know who you are out there!), I empathize, sympathize, consent, assent and endorse. Spread the Word!And yes, it is much better in Russian, but any translation is kind of forgery, better or worse, don't you think?"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Okay, so it's a classic. Writers had a different idea of delicate plot building in those days. And it's Russian. Being bored in a long cold night might provide the right mindset for detailed descriptions of bewildered citizens running around Moscow. To me it all seemed a bit pointless. If the point is to show Satan is omnipotent, this was clear after a couple of pages of chaos. Omnipotence makes a boring story. Limitations or motives give a story a soul. It starts getting interesting when Margarita and the Master and their love affair are introduced. At first I suspected this was just another intro to a devious humiliating scheme, but no, great, finally a story starts to unfold. From that moment on I was hooked. Beautiful prose and imagery, funny situations, food for thought. Some minor points aside, like, what exactly was the function of Satan's party? And why did he need a Margarita for it? Bulgakov will not immediately be my favorite writer, but the book was well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Though there was a slight hitch in shipping, this was a very smooth purchase and I am pleased. Thanks!"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"This highly acclaimed novel doesn't deserve its reputation. As Russian literature in translation it is vastly inferior to Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, and even Solzhenitsyn. As magic realism, it lacks the imaginative genius of Borges. As satire on the Communist regime, it pales before Orwell. In depiction of life under Communism, Koestler and Solzhenitsyn surpass it in detail and impact. As fantasy, the plot devices are banal and have been utilized to better effect by many other writers. The translation is sluggish and plodding where it tries to be poetic. The characters are annoying and lack depth. Two stars for a fairly intriguing take on Christ's trial and execution (about 60 pages in the 402 page edition I read)."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"The two foundations of the novel are plot and characterisation. \\"The Master and Margarita\\" lacks both. It comprises an over-long series of tenuously connected but essentially discrete incidents of a monotonously bizarre nature, like a not very good joke endlessly repeated with slight variations. Furthermore, the \\"hero\\", i.e. \\"the master\\", doesn't appear until halfway though and reappears only intermittently. It's not surprising that the novel becomes tedious very quickly.Turning to the characters, they are all of a piece: shallow-minded time-servers with a penchant for hysterics. They are as two-dimensional as any cartoon character, and as fundamentally uninteresting.Scene-setting is all but non-existent except, curiously, in the Pontius Pilate sections. This is a great pity since Moscow at the height of Stalin's terror should be a gift for a novelist.This sort of slapstick fantasy with pretensions probably appeals to adolescents and academics, but there's not much in it for the grown-ups.That said and despite its grievous faults, there are things in \\"The Master and Margarita\\" which suggest that Bulgakov had the makings of a real writer. Sadly his talent was smothered by the oppressive conditions under which it struggled to be born. Two stars, then, for what might have been."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"About midway through this book, I decided it could easily be turned into a screenplay for another run-of-the-mill slasher movie. Maybe the best is yet to come, but I resent having read so far waiting for something better."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"There are 245 reviews of this book and 206 are five star and only 5 are one star. But I will say that this book, tho it is written (or translated) so that it is easy to read, yet, tho I tried to penetrate at least one of \\"many tiers\\" of significance which it is said to have, I could not find any significance of interest to me. If one is into fantasy I suppose one could get caught up in the senseless and impossible things which occur all thru the book, but it all seemed dull and stupid to me. I have looked at the impressive web sites dealing with the book and obviously some are quite taken by the book. I was so glad when I reached the last page!"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I understand that this book is considered one of the greatest novels of the 20th century. Ok - but I don't see it. It is wild with imagination, and pretty funny, but there is nothing 'great' about it. There are no principles here to improve the life of the reader. There is nothing here I can take away - not even a better comprehension of human nature. I'm not qualified to talk about the translation, but I don't think my complains are with the actual wording, but with the overall theme."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"The devil and a bunch of his companions land in 1930's Stalinist Moscow and wreck havoc on the officially atheist city. What follows is an, in my opinion, incomprehensible tangle of out-of-the-ordinary events, not made any easier to comprehend due to the impression that one half of the male characters in the book seems to be called Nikolai Ivanovitsch and the other half Ivan Nikolaievitsch. There are probably a lot of very witty references to biblical events, but most of these will have escaped my atheist attention. In short: this was no fun to read."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Pretentious and boring, too clever for its own good, the only good chapters in this book are the ones about Pontius Pilate and Jesus Christ, and there's not enough of that.And this was the Michael Glenny translation."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"On my top ten books list.

People are entitled to different opinions than your own. the first place to look for a good book is the local library's banned books list. any book that somebody doesn't want you to read is probably very worth looking into. If you are a catholic religious freak, shy away your poor sensibilities. the rest of us are going to enjoy this excellent novel.so unless you are a staunch catholic who hates other's oposing opinions, and is vilely intolerant in this supposedly free society, go out and expose yourself to the majesty of this work. it is a masterpiece as worthy as any other, maybe more worthy."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"&quot;The Master and Margarita,&quot; possesses a remarkable quality -- everyone loves it. I refer of course to Russians, who read, read, and re-read this book on a regular basis. I shall not dwell on the book itself -- it has been done by others, but refer specifically to this translation. The translation fails. It is more accurate than the mediocre Ginsburg and the abominable Glenny translations, but it lacks in exactitude, and the English is dry and boring. People do glimpse the wonder of the original through this attempt at re-telling, but it is merely a glimpse. My hope is that the upcoming (fourth!!!) translation, done by the same team that did the wonderful work on the &quot;Brothers Karamazov&quot; will be worthy of the original."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Arrived in great condition. I read this years ago and am now enjoying the escapade again.Highly recommend it!!!"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Well, you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't (pardon the pun!). The translators seem to have done this word by word...and some complain the idiom is lost. But, had they gotten closer to the idiom, purists would've said they messed with Bulgakov's words. Russian and English aren't as easily translated into one another as English and German or English and French. Oh well. Even if you can't read Russian, do buy the English translation. This is a very strange and fascinating book.If, however, you do not have a pretty good attention span, or an interest in the supernatural, don't bother. There are so many characters, and they all have about 3 names which the author uses interchangably. Since all names are Russian, this makes it even harder for the English speaking reader to keep track of. As for supernatural elements, a basic knowledge of the Christian Ressurrection story is required, but at the same time, one might not want to be easily offended by black magic. The two go hand in hand here, which is what makes the book so strange and wonderful. I still can't decide if I liked it, but I surely couldn't leave it unfinished.And it's a bit more cheerful than your usual Russian fare."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"For someone living under the grip of the Stalinist regime, the account in this novel must have been cathartic. I find it all a bit exaggerated and silly. It was recommended by a friend as the best novel ever written.

The story is written in classic Russian style: confusing points of reference, an abundance of minutia and too many characters. I could never get into and wondered at the point of it all. It might have been entertaining in a phantasmagorical sort of way in the mid 20th century, but turns out to be slow and tame by today's standards. Despite numerous attempts, I've never been able to get into Russian literature; something to consider about the reviewer."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I have mentioned before in a distant review of the past that each book has a &quot;moment of truth,&quot; that shimmering macrosecond where the reader either becomes hooked (and therefore can't wait to finish the work), or disappointed (whereby the book is either put aside, or finished grudgingly). For me, alas, Bulgakov's THE MASTER AND MARGARITA evoked the latter, although I finished the book and readily appreciated the author's rather fantastic and satirical story of Satan and his pesky retinue wreaking havoc in 1930s Moscow.That Mikhail Bulgakov is an exceptional writer is a given; if only I was fluid in Russian where I could read his words as written I would no doubt be even more impressed with his prose and style. This Vintage Press edition (translated by Diana Burgin and Katherine Tiernan O'Connor) certainly pays homage to this classic with a meticulous eye for detail, followed by notes on each chapter that I found to be invaluable. So then, what's the problem?Well, I enjoy humor and satire as much as the next guy (I suppose), but a story depicting Satan as some sort of instrument of salvation--an instrument in alliance with Yeshua--for the book's two protagonists was just. . .too much. The Master, a writer who cannot endure the pain of rejection, is one-dimensional and sullen, while Margarita, his love, becomes a willing pawn of the devil. And the story blithely suggests that death through its mortal release is preferable to life (which is understandable, given Bulgakov's failing health as he finished the book). The fantastic notion of the story--of illusion, madness, a huge talking cat, flying through the air, and a Satanic ball--is a clever device, but eventually it wears thin.As a playwright, Bulgakov uses an abundance of theater officers, bureaucrats, and authors as unhappy victims of Satan's antics (no doubt the author was settling countless scores); unfortunately, the names of these characters are in Russian, and many of the names vary by a vowel or a letter, making it very difficult for the reader to keep track of &quot;who's who.&quot; And the parallel story of Pontius Pilate and the crucifixion--told from a political, not spiritual, perspective--was interesting, yet bizarre. In fact, &quot;bizarre&quot; is a good word to describe THE MASTER AND MARGARITA in its entirety; it's an interesting, fantastic, metaphysical tale, yet requires too much suspension of disbelief.--D. Mikels"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"This is a very strange book which is a rather cryptic satire of different aspects of Soviet society. One of the things that I didn't like was the translation. Often times, I have read books in similar Russian and translated them literally: this edition is just that, a literal translation. And some phrases sound quite strange in English, which could have been more loosely translated for better literary effect.I would say that this book is sort of like &quot;The Nose&quot; by Gogol, but more bizarre. So if &quot;hyper fiction&quot; is your thing(I prefer more realistic accounts of fiction myself) then you will enjoy this book. Personally, I don't think he is a better writer than Gorky, but that is just my opinion."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"This quirky story written by Bulgakov is like a mixture of the &#34;The Wizard of Oz&#34; except the wizard is the devil and makes house calls in atheistic Russia and &#34;Alice in Wonderland&#34; except instead of a rabbit, there is a giant talking cat who drinks vodka. Hilarious satire in this great adult fairytale. This translation is also very good."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"So this book is not for those who read fairy tales or girly stories. It is an extraordinary story which I recommend to read. The price is good for this kind of book. I bought one and it was brand new."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I have mixed feelings about this novel. On one hand, I really enjoyed its light irreverence, but on another, I feel that I missed out on much of the meaning behind the context. This is purely due to cultural context, and there is a vast difference between Soviet-era Russia and post-apartheid South Africa.Mikhail Bulgakov never finished editing this work, so we'll never know what the final results would have been like, but from what I read it was also written by a creative who had experienced a lot of hassle at the hands of political leaders who sought to tell artists how and when to create their works.Naturally, much of Bulgakov's frustration with the socio-political systems of his day bleeds through the story, but also the fact that he is a keen judge of human character--and this is what this book is: an exploration of human nature in a sometimes highly surreal and seemingly random setting. Bulgakov's imagination takes playful leaps, embroidering recurring symbols throughout. I also feel how we interpret these fanciful routines and playful satire within the stories is completely up to the reader.That being said, I'll admit freely that most of what occurred went well over my head, but I'll add that I'll probably have much to think about while this story is still fresh in my mind. The scenes between Pilate and Jesus were quite poignant, and seemed more grounded in reality than the goings on in the general narrative. Margarita's mad flight on the broomstick was particularly wild, as were the actions of Behemoth. Bulgakov holds up a mirror to people's hypocrisy, and finds the sense of ridiculousness in everyday occurrence that we accept and take for granted.This is the first time I've read the book and I can see there is definitely *something* there otherwise people wouldn't go on about the book so much. But I also suspect I'll have to read a little more Russian literature so that my cultural references are more up to scratch. Maybe with subsequent rereads I'll \\"get\\" more of what is going on. What I did appreciate was that each chapter was almost a standalone tale in itself, which made it easier for me to work through the story."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Its a classic...what can I possibly say that hasn't already been said before?

But the reader has to know the story behind the story before to open the pages, otherwise he would not understand completely the idea of the author. It is just a interesting story? No, Bulgakov speaks for his own life, tragedy, belief and the time he lives in. The book is a big metaphor represent in a most beautiful deep touching way. The reader can hear Bulgakov's laugh and feel at the same time his tears and pain. The writer was dying when was finishing the last pages and completely blind he dictate to his wife Yelena Shilovskaya. The book has been published years after the author's death and then for the world became clear that together with the Master and Margarita Bulgakov went into the immortality."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"A misdirect followed by a fantastical tour of the diabolical.What does the Devil mean to us? Along with his companions (the jester, the knight, the fool, the witch) he swivels the whole of Moscow on its axis and shakes loose the city's structure. His efforts are more unrelenting than evil. But I mean, really only slightly less evil than what you might expect from typical depictions of Satan.It's cut through with passages of a novel (written by the titular Master) about Pontius Pilate, and describes an alternate but recognizable crucifixion, along with subsequent events and those leading up to it. These were less interesting to me. But I'm sure they mean something.I liked it. Not too long.

His father was a theologian. The combination endowed him with a deep knowledge of both disciplines and it shows in thsi excellent novel.It's almost unfair to call this book a novel. It is a sarchastic and ironic condemnation of Stalinist Russia; indeed, the novel was forbidden until the quiet thaw that occurred for many years. Bulgakov seems to borrow from Faust, the New Testament and Dante's divine comedy as the devil and his entourage of a witch and a cat who loves chess and vodka visit Moscow. Their visit is welcomed by a writer(master) and his helper (Margarita). The 'Master' is writing a novel about Pontius Pilate and Margarita visits the depths of hell on his behalf. In the background of this almost mythological tale, the novel provides an excellent account of Soviet life in the 1930's."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"This is my favorite book in the world, I have read it five times in the original language (Russian). While there are some very good translations into English, they pale in comparison with the original. Bulgakov's genious, extrodinary wit and intelligence, and brilliant imagination has no equal in the world of literature. I don't want to give away any of the plot, I think veryone should have the chance to encounter it for themsleves without any outside versions. All I will say is the book will enthrall you from the first chapter and keep you on your toes until the very end. It rarely happens that a book grabs your mind for the entire ride, including the unbelievable ending. It is an absolute crime not to read this book, and it is very possible that once you start it you won't sleep until you finish it."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I'm currently using this version in my Russian/Soviet satire course. For those who claim it can be appreciated only in the original, please know that my non-Russian speaking, American undergraduates are loving the book. We've read extensive background material on the historical context, as well as studied Gogol (also hard to translate, admittedly). To suggest it's not worth reading in English would be to restrict the most wonderful books of any language to native speakers only. Somehow, I doubt the authors would feel offense that their works are being shared around the world.I won't add to the many excellent reviews here, which have covered the value of this edition. But I will put forward my one serious problem with this publication. I selected it not only for the quality of the translation but for Ellendea Proffer's critical commentary at the back. However, what kind of book doesn't mark endnotes within the text? It's such a lapse in logic, I can't believe it hasn't been rectified. For every chapter, helpful notes explain references or meanings ... but not *one* is indicated (by number or asterisk) within the text itself! How is anyone to know while reading what word or phrase is discussed in the endnotes or not? It's baffling how it was published this way -- and by Vintage, no less. So I've gone through for my students, and for each chapter, I note which words on which pages (and the placement -- \\"lower middle\\") for them to place an asterisk by; and then when they encounter it, they know to flip to the end of the book for reference.I really hope that if they reissue another edition of this book, that they fix this problem -- otherwise, it renders the valuable commentary at the back nearly worthless."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Don't let the misleading Amazon editorial review discourage you -- this novel is far, far more than \\"protest literature\\" directed at a long-gone tyranny. It is a meditation on good and evil, raising theological and epistemological questions of the deepest sort.It is also an intellectually dense and witty work, with an engaging plot and vivid characters. It is enormous fun to read.Commenting specifically on the Burgin/O'Connor translation (without benefit of being able to have read the original Russian): The translation is quite readable, without conveying the illusion that the novel was originally written in English. The translators claim to have tried to stick close to the oddities of the original, which results in an intentionally odd (in a good way) English prose style as well. I only recall one truly awkward passage in the translation, a passage which in the original turns on the usage of the formal versus informal second-person -- the archaic \\"you\\"/\\"thou\\" distinction, which is now almost impossible to translate effectively into modern English.The Burgin/O'Connor edition includes highly useful endnotes elucidating some of the more critical but potentially unfamiliar references to Moscow geography, Soviet politics, Russian poetry, 19th-century French opera, biblical scholarship, ancient wine vintages, etc., and also includes explanations of textual decisions (the work was left incomplete at Bulgakov's death.) The endnotes are succinct and limited to a handful of key references per chapter.Attempts at scholarly analysis of the novel as a whole are, mercifully, left to the very end and kept quite short."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"One fine day, the Devil arrives in Moscow, in the time of Stalin. He starts off by predicting and then causing the horrible death of a writer who had told him neither God nor the Devil existed. Then he causes great misfortunes (although mostly comical ones) all over town, assisted by the motliest of crews: a tall, thin man ridiculously attired, who wears broken pince-nez, called Koroviev; Azazelo, a dwarfish guy with a protruding fang; a redheaded vampiress; and a black cat who talks nonsense and walks straight up, called Behemoth. Many people end up in an asylum for maniacs, including the companion of the dead writer, Ivan Homeless, an aspiring poet who is confined after he tells his story with Wolland (as the Devil calls himself). In the asylum, Ivan meets a guy called simply the Master, who tells him a sad love story with a married woman called Margarita. The Master happens to have written a biography of Pontius Pilate (whose first part is curiously told by Wolland in his first conversation with the writers). After he had finished the book, the Stalinist censors destroyed both the book and the Master's emotional sanity, and so he ended up in the asylum and separated from his lover Margarita.After causing great disasters in Moscow, including a very crazy performance of magic in a theater, the devils set out to fulfill their mission, which is precisely to reunite the Master and Margarita. This they achieve by transforming the peaceful Margarita into a witch, making her fly on a broom to a witches' party and then to the aposents of Wolland up in the sky, or down in Hell, God knows where. There she presides over a great Satanic ball, and after that she gets together with the Master and they are freed from suffering and given over to eternal peace, along with Pilate. Interspersed with the main story is the one about Joshua's (Jesus) trial and crucifixion, in an heterodox version, of course. The overall tone of the story is one of sarcasm, parody and black comedy. Bulgakov is supposed to having made fun of the Soviet regime, based on his own personal disheartening and tragic suffering of Stalinist repression and censorship. Of course, many of these allusions and real-life characters will go over your head, unless you are a very specialized scholar of Soviet history. But the book's main quality is a general parody of human vices, as well as an uncontrolled imagination and talent for wild, crazy sceneries and situations. The Great Satanic Ball is simply out of this world. Many influences are easily detected here: Dante's visit to Hell and, of course, Goethe's \\"Faust\\". I also was very much reminded of Lewis Carroll's crazy dialogues between Alice and the characters she encounters underground. There are many symbolisms, some of them obscure, but if you're only trying to have an entertaining and rewarding read, you don't need to worry about them. This is a literally fantastic romp, crazy, wild and well writtem, a true gem of last century's literature conceived and executed in some of the worst times of human history."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I would never admit in public that I was somewhat disappointed to learn that 'Margarita' was the name of a character in this book, and that the tequila-based beverage we all know and love would not be making an appearance of any kind.It didn't stop the book from SHINING. A set of parallel stories, one of the devil wreaking havoc on Moscow and the other of a migraine-suffering Pontius Pilate and his interactions with Jesus. In Stalinist times it was unlawful and unadvisable to criticize anything about Russia, so the social commentary in the book is displaced to biblical times, whereas many of the biblical elements (a trinity, baptism, resurrection and whatnot) are in turn displaced to Moscow. The book is shockingly brilliant and stunningly well written.It's also bubblingly witty. (\\"That salmon's not spoiled! It's second-grade fresh!\\")And it's well translated, and very well annotated. The translator footnoted all the problem areas in translation (\\"The English 'quiet as a mouse' becomes 'Quiet as a fish on ice' in Russian\\"), and included relevant historical references from European History. It also included running explanations on Goethe's Faust, which are crucial to the text.As soon as I finished 'The Master and Margarita', I filed it away in my 'top five favorite books ever,' along with the other nine or ten books that are already there."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"This is, simply put, the greatest piece of literature of the 20th century, quite possible of any century. The complex interweaving of plot, characters, themes and morals make Master and Margarita a novel that is enjoyable an infinite amount of times in an infinite number of ways. Among the innumerable superlatives I could dedicate to this book are the following: greatest satire of 1930s Russian society, particularly the literary society; greatest critique of the inherent hypocrisy of Socialism as it was practiced, namely, that the more people claim to disdain property, the more they use property as the foundation of their moral and social schemas; the most skillful manipulation of prosaic styles--that is, the narration changes distinctly from one chapter to the next, often because of change of point of view (the omniscient narrator's to the Master's novel's), and other times due to a general change of subject matter and mood; the most outrageous and hilarious plot ever; the most engaging and pointed criticism of the ethics of Christianity as practiced by modern believers.... The list could go on and on. Master and Margarita is a masterpiece in the true sense of the word.As for this translation: I have used several different translations of this book, and this seems to be the best. It is heavily annotated; footnotes, denoted throughout the text, are collected in an appendix that takes up a good portion of the book, and this extra information provides a great deal of clarification to the reader, especially the non-Russian-speaking one. Much of this clarification is necessary to proper comprehension of the novel, while some of it is merely to provide a greater insight into the themes addressed and the environment in which the addressing was done. Textually, the translation also seems to be quite good. Unfortunately, my Russian is not excellent; I have read the original Russian, but I am afraid that my senses of nuance and fine shading of meaning are less than adequate to dissect a work of these proportions. From what I can tell, however, this translation is the most successful at remaining faithful to the actual words of Bulgakov while also staying true to the rhythm and style of his writing in a broader sense.If you haven't read this book, buy it now. You'll want to read it again and again--quite possibly because you didn't understand it the first time, but certainly because there is no end to the rewards that immersion in Bulgakov's world can impart on a reader."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I just reread this after about 7 years since I first discovered it while living in Eastern Europe, and it was as amazing as the first read. This book is required reading in high school in Hungary, and is well known throughout Europe, yet unfortunately it remains little known among my American friends. Truly one of the great novels of all time, a magical, wild ride."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"There are three strands in this amazing book. There is aplausible, 'realistic' picture of 1930s Russia, with its communalapartments, erratic services, eternal drabness, and suppressed terror, its phoney 'official' literary culture, its labyrinthine bureaucracy, but, most of all, a populace ready to dob in their neighbour to save their own skin, inventively greedy, like the bourgeoisie of many classic novels...This book is about many serious things - life under a tyranny where every sense of the individual, moral, cultural and spiritual has been wiped out; the duty of the artist in the face of this; the consequences of moral cowardice; the transformative power of culture. In one way the novel is a Calvino-like detective story, as characteers and readers hunt for the end of the Pilate novel.But what are unforgettable are the set-pieces searing your imagination, the mixture of terror and comedy, despair and romanticism; the sheer iconcoclasitc glee of such a work bursting out of a dour, bleak, rigid culture; the growth of an extraordinary heroine; the cast of varied, marvellous characters. If only all books were like this - it has everything you could ever need."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"The main part of the book is set in Moscow in the 1930's. There is a strong comic element, mocking the inefficiency of the Stalinist system, and the privations and poverty of Russia. Bribery and conniving are needed to obtain such luxuries as fresh food and an apartment of one's own. In the opening scene the only thing a refreshment stand has for sale is apricot juice.At times the author seems to be a Christian apologist, along the lines of CS Lewis in the \\"Screwtape Letters\\" mocking the pseudo-erudition of the time serving atheist Mikhail Alexandrovich Berlioz, but the religion is very heterodox. Dickens and Gogol come to mind in the depictions of pompous and greedy officials.There are three major strands. The framing narrative is about a character called Woland, who is the Devil in disguise, but is mischievous rather than evil and uses magic to expose dishonesty and hypocrisy. A character called the Master appears halfway through. He is initially a patient in the psychiatric hospital where Ivan Nikolayevich Ponyrvov (also called Bezdomny) has been confined as a result of Woland's tricks. He is the former lover of Margarita, who appears much later, when she flies around naked as the companion of Woland... The lovers are later reunited. The Master has written a novel about Pontius Pilate which is the third strand but the Pontius Pilate story begins before the Master is introduced as a character. (Are you still with me?)Just to add confusion a lot of characters have similar names. They have the three names every Russian starts with, and also abbreviated first names and nicknames and pen names (I'm reading the Burgin and O'Connor translation. I think other translators into English have tried to help with the name confusion by anglicizing Russian names). There are some WEB sites with character lists. The commentaries at the end of this edition are helpful."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"This is one of those works of art that everyone has to experience for themselves. My reaction to it will be different from anothers. But you are guaranteed to have a reaction. This is a fantastic novel.I thoroughly enjoyed discussing this novel with a Ukrainian friend and understanding how revolutionary it was in her country. They actually read it as loose typewritten papers passed from person to person, because the State was so incensed at its themes.Brilliant!"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"For anyone who tends to think of Russian literature as dull, depressing, and overly long, I would suggest this novel. It is witty, and a wonderful tale of the devil's visit to Moscow, which also satirizes the Soviet system.The translation accurately captured the nuances and connotations of the original Russian texts, and does well at combining Bulgakov's various versions which he apparently continually revised."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Master and Margarita was written by Russian author Bulghakov. It has been translated into English three times and is esteemed by many. It was filmed by Germans/Poles but I can't located. My mother had seen it and she things it's superior to the Russian epic. I enjoyed it very much. This version follows the original very closely but some parts are not included (so my mother says...she watched it in Poland).There are two strands throughout the story...Pontius Pilate's story and satire on Soviet life. It's hard for me to decide if someone who did not read the book and is not familiar with situation in Russia under Communism,can truly follow the gist of the story, bit I may be wrong. Since I read it in Polish, Russian, and the three English translation, I know the book by heart."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"What a delightfully strange little tale! Comical and yet very serious in bits, and offering intriguing glimpes into bulgakov's subconscience. The bits with Jesus and Pilate are beautifully detailed, but my favorite part was satan's ball. Not much of a plot, but the novel has a story, which matters more to me, anyway."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Mikhail Bulgakov - The Master and Margarita. ISIN-10:0141187792Phantasmagorical - a hilarious and a ripping yarn.A Soviet mockery, tripping through the darkside of life - exploring the influences of evil and good, malice, mischief aforethought.All about hate and love, lies and truth, nihilism and anarchy - misplaced idealology.Wonderfully wicked and demonic, a well organized but chaotic read.Inspirational and inspiring in a boisterous romp.It's just a lot of fun - never boring.Burlesque - it's satire at it's best."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"If there really is a Devil somewhere in the universe, I'm sure he closely resembles Bulgakov's Woland (along with his imfamous band of sidekicks). Overall, a brilliantly funny, inventive, and poignent novel!

Highly entertaining--the story of the Passion is also deeply moving"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Mikhail Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita provides a scathing social commentary on life in Russia during Stalinism. This Gnostic work taking place in the 1930s serves as an excellent new historical look on life under Socialism. Bulgakov's masterpiece, which was censored and unpublished until 1972, tells the story of Satan's visit to Moscow and all the unusual events that take place while he's there. Much of the imagery and pranks Satan pulls are symbolic of serious problems facing the average Muscovite. This book will help you, the reader, to understand some of the problems facing 1930s Russia. Bulgakov is one of the most authoritative authors to write on the topic of Socialism, as he had first-hand experience with several of issues addressed in the work. This novel provides an interesting perspective on the ills of Stalinism and it should be read by anyone looking for a creative way to read about those ills. The story is told by a third person omniscient narrator (presumed to be Bulgakov himself) and is divided into two main sections. The first section focuses on the coming of Satan and introduces the characters on which the story focuses, and the second section focuses on the Master and Margarita's love story and the conclusion of Satan's time in Moscow. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a novel which will challenge them on a personal, intellectual, and spiritual level, as well as to anyone doing research on Socialism/Stalinism."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I haven't tried to read a Russian novel since high school (I had a tough time obviously... so I was a bit scared of it), but I loved this book. It's a very fun story commenting on a not so fun reality of that time.It doesn't start out as a love story, but it definitely ends as one, and the Devil and his entourage are great (the human characters aren't such good people and it's fun to see them get what they deserve). I think I'll start checking out some more Russian novels now..."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I suppose that I can start by saying that &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; has been my favorite book for over 7 years now (that says a lot since I read quite a bit!). I don't think it is necessary to discuss the plot of the book, since you can read what the book is about by looking at the editorial reviews. However, I will comment on the various translations.Without a doubt, the book in the original Russian is incomparable, but if you don't read Russian I would recommend the Burgin/Tiernan O'Connor translation. The first translation I ever read was Mirra Ginsburg's - although it is very charming and enjoyable, certain bits of conversation as well as almost an entire chapter are omitted from this translation. I have also read parts of Michael Glenny's translation, and I don't feel that his translation accurately relays the depth, rhythm and richness of Bulgakov's style. Burgin/Tiernan O'Connor has given the most complete and accurate translation of this work. Another superb feature of this translation is the commentary section at the end of the text, which is very helpful in understanding what influenced Bulgakov, and is especially helpful if the reader is not familiar with certain aspects of Soviet culture while the book was written (during the 1930's).Lastly, I have to comment on the thing that I love most about &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; - it is impossible to classify this book as one certain genre. This book is a philosophical and religious novel, an historical novel, a satire, a love story, an action/adventure, and a fantasy all rolled into one. Simply put, it is timeless - an original, brilliant and beautiful novel."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"This novel belongs in its own category, for there has never been another like it. A really great novel is like a best friend. We love to see them praised and are hurt when they are attacked. I am elated to see that so many Amazon readers share my love for this great work. I have been reticent to write a critique, as I really can't do it justice. Words are too meager a medium to convey my true response to this masterpiece. Suffice it to say that this has long been my first recommendation whenever anyone approached me about books I most enjoyed. Now with the appearance of Diana Burgin's and Katherine O'Connor's superb translation, I can recommend it even more unreservedly. I've read the Ginsburg and Glenny translations, as well, and have to agree with the other reviewers here who take exception to them. I haven't read the Pevear and Volokhonsky translation, but haven't been too excited by their work with Dostoevsky, so will probably skip it. I envy those who can read Bulgakov and other Russian masters in the original language, but I make do with finding the best translation I can and pay heed to what native speakers have to say about the various translations. I haven't heard any negatives about Burgin's and O'Connor's efforts. The volume also contains some useful annotation, particularly helpful if you are unfamiliar with the era and with the layout of Moscow. There are also some great Bulgakov sights on the net that have detailed maps of 30's-era Moscow, for those interested in getting a clearer mental picture of the sites Bulgakov describes (Patriarchs Pond, The Aryat, etc.). As far as placing Bulgakov in the Pantheon of Russian novelists, this novel alone propels him to the front ranks. Some of his other works, most notably Heart of a Dog and White Guard have not been adequately translated yet, so it is difficult to assess them. If you are a Pasternak fan (which I am not) you will probably enjoy White Guard, however. It is not satire, though, which in my estimation is Bulgakov's strong suit. Nor is there much humor there (at which he also excels in M&amp;M). In fact I would be hard-pressed to come up with any other work in any literature that is as scathingly humorous and dead-on-target satirical as M&amp;M. Burgess and Vonnegut are rungs below Bulgakov in either category. Bulgakov skewers every Moscow bureaucrat and literary hack (unfortunately in the Stalinist era most of those who maintained positions of authority in literary circles were obsequious no-talents who mouthed party-line propaganda) that ever did him harm (and these were legion). Yet there is not an ounce of vitriol involved in the skewering, which is remarkable in itself. Bulgakov had to be one of the most good-natured people ever to pick up a pen. That is the overall impression one gleans from the accounts of his contemporaries and it is evident throughout this book. Yes, stupid people behave stupidly and predictably(Annushka is Annushka ! ) but in most cases the divine forces at work here let them off the hook. If you haven't been convinced by all these testimonials to give this novel a try, I am probably wasting space here anyway. This novel is the reason I go on reading. I hope someday to come across another like it. There aren't enough stars in the Amazon galaxy to do it justice."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"This book has got it all -- decapitations, crucifixions, vodka-drinking cats, and naked women flying on broomsticks. What's more, it is a refreshing change of pace from the 19th century works that most people think of when they hear the term &quot;Russian literature.&quot; Bulgakov is no Tolstoi or Dostoevskiy, and I mean that as a compliment. All three are top-notch writers, each in his own way. But where Bulgakov differs from the latter two is in his ability to infuse his work with a light-heartedness, even when the subject matter is serious. While Tolstoi is known for epic tales on the grandest of scales, and Dostoevskiy for his penetrating insights into the darkness of the human soul, Bulgakov breaks from his predecessors by creating fiction with flare, stories that dance off the page, with an undeniable element of humor that is extremely rare in Russian literature.This edition of Master and Margarita is a bit choppy in the translation, but it more than makes up for that minor flaw by providing an excellent set of comments on the text at the back of the book. This is one of those books that is so much easier to appreciate the more you understand the historical references and the social context of the story. Bulgakov, in addition to be a master of the pen, was also a capable historian and keen observer of society and politics. His novels, particularly this one, make this clear. In Master and Margarita, thanks to its novel-within-a-novel structure, you have not one but two socio-historical portraits, both of them exceptionally accurate. Bulgakov showed no fear of the Communist censors, depicting with remarkable honesty the Soviet Union of the 1930s. (No wonder this book didn't see the light of day for several decades.) But perhaps more impressive is his portrayal of a period which he did not witness first-hand. Through the character of the Master, Bulgakov relates a completely unorthodox, though not at all unbelievable, account of Jesus' trial and crucifixion from the perspective of Pontius Pilate, who comes across as most sympathetic and likeable.As one would expect, the two stories are flawlessly woven together. Parallel plot lines and similarities between the characters in each story make the novel that much richer, that much more of a literary achievement. It is no surprise that most Russians consider this to be their finest example of 20th century literature."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"This is truly a remarkable book; buried beneath the rubbleof Soviet censorship for twenty years, then partiallyuncovered, The Master and Margarita is now restored to itsfull passion, power and sly, striking sarcasm.With a cast of characters that includes an enormous walking,talking black cat named Behemoth, several slightly prissySoviet writers (most of whom meet satisfying ends) and theDevil Himself, the book is all at once a comment on awriter's life under Stalin, a reworking of the stories ofPontius Pilate and Faust and at the same time, quite funny.I've only read a few books like this (The Sound and theFury was one), where the prose seems to burn beneath yourfingertips, propelling you to the end of the book. It hasall the bluntness and beauty and sly wit of the bestRussian literature. At one point in the novel, a charactersays, &quot;manuscripts don't burn&quot; -- what a relief that thisone didn't."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"\\"The Master and Margarita,\\" Mikhail Bulgakov's sparkling fantasy of Satan's visit to Moscow under the guise of a magician named Professor Woland, must rank as one of the greatest acts of literary heroism of the past century. Bulgakov wrote the novel in the late 1930s, under what was arguably the most repressive government ever on earth--the Soviet Union at the height of Stalin's power. When even the mildest criticism of the regime led to a death sentence, Bulgakov dared to place all the cruelty, venality and treachery of 1930s Russia under a microscope. The book was of course unpublishable in Bulgakov's lifetime; it only appeared in its original form nearly a half-century after the author's death. We can chuckle at the wicked tricks Woland and his retinue play on various arrogant, incompetent Soviet officials, but knowledge of the power wielded by the real-life counterparts of those officials gives the chuckles a grim undertone indeed. The titular characters don't even appear until the book is nearly half-over: the Master, a despondent writer sent to an asylum after his novel about Pontius Pilate is rejected by the Soviet writers' union, and Margarita, the beautiful woman who loves him and will literally go to Hell for his sake. Through their dealings with Woland, Bulgakov exalts the power of the imagination, the need for the spiritual dimension in life and the courage to live by one's own convictions--virtues that Stalinist Russia strove, mostly successfully, to undermine. Interspersed with the tale of Woland, the Master and Margarita are chapters from the Master's novel, depicting Pontius Pilate's dealings on the day of the Crucifixion with Yeshua Ha-Notsri (Jesus of Nazareth), Levi Matvei (St. Matthew) and Judas of Kerioth (Iscariot). The leading theme of those chapters is the essential nature of humankind: are people good, as Yeshua argues, or bad, as Pilate does? Bulgakov never answers this question, and Christian fundamentalists will be outraged to find Levi Matvei and Woland at the end to be allies, albeit uneasy ones. But in the Stalinist moral vacuum that denied the existence of both Heaven and Hell, how could they avoid working together? Bulgakov insists that people have moral choices, and that the greatest evil comes from abdicating those choices, as Stalin not only encouraged but demanded. The Vintage International edition of \\"The Master and Margarita\\" benefits mightily from the idiomatic, easily flowing English translation by Diana Burgin and Katherine Tiernan O'Connor, and the afterword by Bulgakov biographer Ellendea Proffer provides invaluable information, from the standpoint of both the societal context and Bulgakov's own life history."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I read the Michael Glenny version in the late sixties, and have loved it deeply ever since. Having lent my copy to a friend I bought a new one some years ago - and I thought I would try the Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky version.This couple evidently know the nuances of Russian culture but they simply can't write idiomatic English and their translation therefore loses the spontaneity and fun of the Glenny version.Compare these early paragraphs: by Pevear and Volokhonsky'What the devil does he want?' thought Homeless, frowning.'And you were agreeing with your interlocutor?' inquired the stranger, turning to Homeless on his right.'A hundred per cent!' confirmed the man, who was fond of whimsical and figurativeexpressions.'Amazing!' exclaimed the uninvited interlocutor and, casting a thievish glance around andmuffling his low voice for some reason, he said:'Forgive my importunity, but, as I understand, along with everything else, you also do notbelieve in God?' he made frightened eyes and added: 'I swear I won't tell anyone!''No, we don't believe in God,' Berlioz replied, smiling slightly at the foreign tourist's fright, but we can speak of it quite freely.'The foreigner sat back on the bench and asked, even with a slight shriek of curiosity:'You are - atheists?!'Yes, we're atheists,' Berlioz smilingly replied, and Homeless thought, getting angry: 'Latched on to us, the foreign goose\\"With these by Michael Glenny:'Ah, how interesting!' exclaimed the foreigner.'What the hell does he want?' thought Bezdomny and frowned.'And do you agree with your friend?' enquired the unknown man, turning to Bezdomny on his right.'A hundred per cent!' affirmed the poet, who loved to use pretentious numerical expressions.'Astounding!' cried their unbidden companion. Glancing furtively round and lowering his voice he said : 'Forgive me for being so rude, but am I right in thinking that you do not believe in God either?' He gave a horrified look and said: 'I swear not to tell anyone!''Yes, neither of us believes in God,' answered Berlioz with a faint smile at this foreign tourist's apprehension. ' But we can talk about it with absolute freedom.'The foreigner leaned against the backrest of the bench and asked, in a voice positively squeaking with curiosity :'Are you . . . atheists? ''Yes, we're atheists,' replied Berlioz, smiling, and Bezdomny thought angrily : ' Trying to pick an argument, damn foreigner!

It was completed months before Bulgakov's death. The book was posthumously published in the Soviet Union in the mid 1960s, with some provocative passages censored by the paranoid communist ideological machine. This is one of the most imaginative allegories I have ever encountered. Bulgakov's imagery and satire ran a scathing trace along the fabric of the Soviet society, oppressed by totalitarian institutions and bureaucratic narrow-mindedness. There is here also a story within a story--a retelling of the confrontation between Jesus and Pontius Pilate. Bulgakov's raises the issue of meaning of love, faith, forgiveness, and human decency. This also is a funny novel. And I think that to truly appreciate all of its nuances one should read it in Russian, and I am privileged to be able to do so. However, this book is not beyond the average English-speaking reader, on the contrary, most people will enjoy reading it for its sheer humour and inventiveness, even if they are not familiar with the society which is allegorically depicted here.I prefer this translation to other translations. It feels accurate and natural. The flow of narrative is smooth and enticing. In the real world, Bulgakov seems to show, love does not always conquer all, but it remains unconquered even in the face of oppression and tragedy.Michael Hart"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I first read the 1967 paperback translation by Michael Glenny. It claimed to be the &quot;only complete, unexpurgated edition&quot; of the book and was the only version I was aware of in 1968. I read it once on my own (on the recommendation of a professor) and again in the 1968-69 school year in a Russian literature class. I loved it then for all the reasons given in the many reviews listed below. I read it a third time several years later and still loved it.So now it's been 30 years since I withdrew from the second year of a masters degree program in Russian, and I decided I wanted to read &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; in the original. I'll confess over the years I have had very few occasions to use my Russian and so have forgotten a great deal. I started reviewing my Russian and convinced several friends to read this book in translation so I'd have others with whom to discuss it. I purchased the Burgin/O'Conner translation (which seems to be the favorite among the many reviews given here) and currently await the Pevear/Volokhonsky translation from Amazon.com. My happiest moment came when I found the book in Russian on the Internet. I now am able to read a chapter in English, then in Russian. I am not yet at the point where I can read the Russian only, but I plan to get there soon. I will say that I do find the Burgin/O'Conner translation superior to the Glenny, but it is interesting to compare how the different translators have dealt with the Russian text. When I receive the Pevear/Volokhonsky version I will have a third opinion to compare.The real reason I am writing this is to say that I disagree with those who say if you can't read it in the original, it's not worth it. It is definitely worth it. In 1967 I fell in love with this book using the translation that seems to be regarded as the poorest of them all, and while I am enjoying the new translation much more, I would recommend reading this book in any translation you can get. It is simply a book that is so good it is worth reading no matter what. Get the best translation available, read it, and don't be discouraged by those who say you have to read it in the original.However, if you can read Russian and want to get a copy in the original, it is available from the White Nights Bookstore... The entire site is in Russian, and it offers an impressive array of books from &quot;Internet for Dummies&quot; in Russian to translated Danielle Steele novels (horrors!). I was amazed at the Russian language sources on the net. From siber you can get instructions on Russifying your computer so that with the click of a toggle, you can type in Russian or back to English. Another source of books in Russian is Hermitage... Znanie Bookstore in San Francisco has a site in progress... There are many others, so go searching!Thanks to Amazon.com for providing this forum for all of us to tell the world about this incredible book! Everyone should read it!"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Twenty years ago the sudden appearance of a nervous looking young security guard at the door of my office nearly gave me a heart attack. It was three in the morning, the hospital's ninth floor (the non-patient biophysics department) was otherwise completely dark and empty, and I'd been laughing so hard that I hadn't heard the security guard walk up to my door. When I looked up and saw him, the shock was like a cattle prod to the solar plexus. The guard also looked sort of scared - when he'd gotten off the elevator on what was supposed to be an empty floor, he'd heard hysterical cackling coming down a dark corridor and was torn between duty and just getting back on the elevator and pretending to have heard nothing.The reason for my hysterical laughter was this book. I'd sat down to read it after finishing some necessary tasks and before going out for dinner that evening, completely lost track of the time, and didn't go home until I finished it near sunrise the next morning. I loved this book.Twenty years and several reading later, I still love this book. By now you know it's a satire on Stalin's USSR. You may know that it juxtaposes Stalin's Moscow and Pilate's Jerusalem, that it's built around a book (written by the Master) within the book that takes on a life of its own until Jerusalem (the setting of the Master's book) and Moscow merge into one. The structure of the novel is ingenious and original. It follows the demented journey through Moscow of a bad poet (Ivan); the wild, cruel, and very funny escapades of the devil and his retinue (a giant talking cat, a lovely naked witch, a thug with one fang) as they turn Moscow upside down; the travails of a Soviet bureaucrat as he goes about trying to make a buck and get a better apartment; a dejected institutionalized author (the Master) and his devoted follower (Margarita); and the confrontation between Yeshua ha Nozri (Jesus the Nazarene) and Roman power in Jerusalem (Pilate). It ends for all its characters either in peace or in redemption or, in the case of a soulless Soviet editor, in nothingness.The satire is biting, but it loses something in an age when the average college student has at best a very dim memory of a place called the USSR. I strongly recommend that the reader who wants to fully enjoy the satire buy and read Sheila Fitzpatrick's book, _Everyday Stalinism_. Even the first couple of chapters of that book provide more than enough information to let one understand and enjoy Bulgakov's novel. With satire, context is everything, and context is often absent for post-Soviet readers.Even if one doesn't appreciate or doesn't care about the satire, this book is still a very good read. It's full of ideas that aren't limited to relevance in Stalin's Moscow, and the characters are well developed, not just props in a period piece. You don't need to be a Soviet expert to enjoy this novel. It's still magical and strange even if you know nothing of the time or place. The satire aside, this book is timeless. I don't think it's the best novel ever written, but I think it's the best Soviet novel, one of the best 20th century novels. If you read it, you'll probably never again walk under a full moon without thinking about it."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"This book is worth well more than 5 stars, but unfortunately that is all I am able to give it in this review. This book (the Diana Burgin &amp; Katherine Tiernan O'Conner translation) deals with Moscow in the 1930's and what happens when the devil shows up unexpectedly one day. He doesn't arrive alone, however; he is accompanied by a beautiful (but naked) witch, a sidekick named Bezdomny who dons a broken pince-nez and a talking black cat who has a weakness for chess and vodka. A series of hilarious events events occurs, causing chaos all over Moscow and several people land in a mental institution as a result of these events. This book has frequently been compared to Goethe's &quot;Faust&quot; with its underlying theme of good vs evil and if the reader is familiar with Faust, the similarities between these two books will become immediately obvious. At the back of the book are the footnotes explaining some of the more obscure details that a non-native Russian probably wouldn't understand, such as various departments in the Soviet government, names of prominent Russians at that time, certain untranslatable words, etc. I particularly enjoyed this translation because it was an easy, smooth flowing read and I had no difficulties understanding what was going on. This book should be especially read by anyone who has a passion (or curiosity) for Russian literature or culture because this book was not allowed to be published during the author's lifetime..and the author knew that he would never see his book in print, but he wrote it anyway; and the literary world is all the better because he insisted on writing it."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"My friend recommended this book to me, and what actually made me to buy it was because he considered it his favorite book of all time. I agree with him about that. It is an amazing book. Not only that, I developed an interest in the author's other works. Nevertheless, this is the best book written by Mikhail Bulgakov. It is an absolute masterpiece, a classic accepted in Russia and the rest of the world.\\"MASTER AND MARGARITA\\" is about purges Stalin ordered in the Soviet Union. The curious thing about this book is that the purges are depicted not to have been carried out Stalin's men, but rather by Satan himself, and in the manner of Baron Munchaussen, we get to know of a huge talking cat. Like animal farm, the greater meaning of the book is revealed through the intelligent though bizarre, compelling and humorous story. One is constantly left anticipating what the next page holds. There are so many layers and so many little details that one wonders how the author managed to put them together.Bulgakov is the Soviet version of Imperial Russia's Dostoevsky, but unlike Dostoyevsky who had a mastery of the mind/soul Bulgakov mastery is in the literature of oppression. I have recommended this book to many friends and family and recommend it to any reader interested in the enigma that is Russia, especially Stalinist Russia. Other interesting stories set in Russia are THE UNION MOUJIK,TARAS BULBA, PUTIN'S RUSSIA, THE LIFE AND DEATH OF LENIN, WAR AND PEACE. Also note that you are sure to find the widest selection of odd and creepy characters in this book ."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Two parts, 32 chapters and an epilogue, many memorable characters, at least three different stories masterly interweaved... All that is needed for making a cotemporary classic novel is there.While reading it you will laugh and you'll be moved. A very useful site on this particular novel can be found in: http://cweb.middlebury.edu/bulgakov"},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"One hot spring evening two men sit on a bench at Patriarchs Ponds: Berlioz, editor of a literary magazine and Ivan Nikolayevich, a poet. The editor is lecturing his poet friend on the err of his ways in portraying the fictional Jesus in his recent poetic endeavour as a man, albeit a flawed man, but nonetheless a man who did in fact exist in the most mortal sense of the word. During their heated conversation, a tall foreign stranger, who goes by the name Woland and professes to be a professor and an expert in black magic, approaches them as he is very interested in their debate on the existence of Jesus and claims to have been on the balcony the day Pontius Pilate condemned the prophet to death. After a lengthy discussion, Woland prophesizes Berlioz' eminent demise, and then all hell breaks loose.I have wanted to read this book for many years, and it just kept slipping out of my head until a few months ago when I stumbled upon it while browsing at a small Indie book store. I am a huge fan of Russian Literature, so I am a little embarrassed to admit that I kept forgetting about it all these years, but there was no time like the present to read it. Banned Book week was upon us, and Bulgakov's masterwork was banned in Russia and not released in English until the 1960's in a censored version. We don't have to worry about this anymore and can now read one of many wonderful translations. I do suggest that if you are hunting down a copy, make sure you get a decent translation. The one I purchased, this edition, had a lengthy commentary section that goes over some of the finer points of Russian Politics during the 1930's, and so it made the read more enjoyable.The story is a complex allegory: part social satire, part contemporary historical, part romance, part farce, part political irony, part theological pontification, yes, this book, written in the theatrical style of a playwright, is magical realism at its finest. The book moves back and forth between three converging storylines: Woland, or rather Satan, and his retinue's descent upon the unsuspecting citizens of Moscow; the heartbreaking unconventional love story between the Master and Margarita; and The Master's own novel, which explores Pontius Pilate's great guilt. However, Woland is not your conventional Satan, often appearing very sympathetic and thoughtful; Yeshua is not the Jesus we are accustomed to; and Pilate manages to redeem himself. I won't say how, because that will ruin it. Now Woland doesn't come to Moscow to reek havoc, nor does he come to whisper in the collective Muscovite ear in order to bring out the worst in people, he merely allows Moscow's disingenuous to come face to face with their own hypocrisy. Where Yeshua teaches, Woland provokes, but in the end, their goal is the same, and that's the religious rub of the story: the two are equal and share the same hope for humanity in the end. There is a lot of allusion to the New Testament as well as folklore representations of Pilate and other Biblical characters as Heresy in all its many forms is the main theme running throughout all three plotlines. Each Moscow miscreant, much like in Dante's Inferno, receives the punishment fitting for their crime. Even The Master's punishment fits his crime. In this Faustian part of the tale, the Master is condemned to an insane asylum because of his cowardice. Cowardice, Yeshua says, is the greatest of all sins. The Master, having received negative commentary in a review of his unpublished novel, broke under the weight of the criticism and lost faith, in himself and his work, and only through Margarita's sacrifice, would he finish the novel and achieve peace, which Yeshua, as requested by Woland, grants him in the end: Peace not Light, or rather not salvation.This story explores a lot of odd and awkward existential angles and does it with finesse and a black humour blacker than the fur on the pickle-eating, vodka-drinking, gun-toting Behemoth, Satan's Black Cat. The story has a full on narrator who interjects with a vengeance, and the narrative style is operatic and slapstick all at the same time. Besides the main characters: Woland, The Master, and Margarita, there is a litany of other minor characters within the main narrative and also within the Master's inner novel, and all the characters reflect nicely the main themes of the story: Good and Evil, Heresy, Cowardice, Faith, Death, Freedom, Guilt, and Sacrifice or devotional love among others. And so the characters are deliberately grotesque and superficial, ordinary and archetypal. Satan's retinue is particularly diverse: the grotesquely dressed valet Koroviev (Fagotto); a fast-talking black cat who walks on his hind legs and is big as a hog, Behemoth; the fanged little wall-eyed hitman Azazello; the demon Abaddon; and the naked red-headed witch Hella. There is a lot of anti-religious propaganda of the day weaved into the narrative, and so there is a lot of parody: Margarita's stations of the cross as she welcomes the guests at Satan's spring ball, and The Massolit writers' last supper of a sort as they argue over who will go to the summer retreat being two of them. To write a proper review of this book is an exercise in futility because there is just so much going on thematically, philosophically, and theologically, it would take extensive study of the text and essays of great length to capture all its nuances. But you don't have to do all that to just plain old enjoy the story. It's heartbreaking, horrific, action packed, confusing, hilarious, and if you didn't have faith in the cosmos before you read it, you just might afterwards. You don't even need to know much about Russian politics of the time to enjoy the satire, and the language is sublime:\\"Gods, my Gods! How sad the earth is at eventide! How mysterious are the mists over the swamps. Anyone who has wandered in these mists, who has suffered a great deal before death, or flown above the earth, bearing a burden beyond his strength knows this. Someone who is exhausted knows this. And without regret he forsakes the mists of the earth, its swamps and rivers, and sinks into the arms of death with a light heart ...\\"I highly recommend that all writers read this book: the lessons in structure, language, characterization, and theme are well beyond what one will get in a style guide. Bulgakov's articulation of his thesis is flawless, even if the original manuscript has been butchered over the years by clumsy editors and translators."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I've been a fan of 19th and 20th century Russian novels for years, having read all of Dostoevsky's major novels, Gogol short stories, Gogol's Dead Souls, and now this. Up until now, I have had no cause to doubt Pevear and Volokhonsky's translations-having read Dostoevsky's The Idiot and Demons by them, and all the Gogol works done by them as well. However, before buying a translation of The Master and Margarita in a bookstore, I took about an hour and a half comparing three different translations--theirs, Ginsburg's, and another one that was relatively new. I ended up buying the Ginsburg, even as I knew what painstaking work Pevear and Volokhonsky do. In this case though, I quickly dismissed the third translation (whose name escapes me) and eventually decided on the Ginsburg. It was more fun to read, and the author's delight in oddity, satire, and feelings for his characters came through much more. This is, as some of you probably know, quite a bit in the style of Gogol's Dead Souls, and the similarity came through the most in the Ginsburg translation.The husband and wife team of Pevear and Volokhonsky has done great work so far, but that's no reason to read any more of their translations without comparing others (I've also read a lot of critical reviews about their Tolstoy translations). Ginsburg is a great translator, she's also done a good rendering of Notes from Underground, which I recommend as well."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Reading the other reviews, I feel as if I'm going to be sent to the Devil for not bowing down before it-But let's not suspend all our (God-given?) critical faculties before what is, I agree, a magical, unique book.---This sort of literary sycophancy is just the sort of thing Bulgakov skewers herein.To begin, the book has a deft, light rapier wit one does not associate with other dark, gloomy Russian writers of the Gogol and Dostoeyevsky School. It is jolly fun to read. And the satire on totalitarian states and the writing establishment-PEN members take note!-is quite beyond compare. But no work exists in a vacuum. One of the other reviewers mentions that this is the sort of book Lewis Carroll might have written had he lived under Stalin's totalitarian regime-Quite-Through the Looking Glass is this book's clearest literary predecessor, only, as novelist Malcolm Lowry might have put it, in Bulgakov \\"there are depths.\\"To quote Bulgakov himself:\\"Gods, my Gods! How sad the earth is at eventide! How mysterious the mists over the swamps. Anyone who has wandered in these mists, who has suffered a great deal before death, or flown above the earth, bearing a burden beyond his strength knows this.\\" P.321, in my edition.This passage, I think, gets to the heart of what Bulgakov is about here. But still, how mysterious the mists hang over this book! And who has the power to dispel them? And why am I only giving this book four stars instead of wailing at Amazon to provide me six? The Devil only knows."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Bulgakov died in 1940, this book was rediscovered in 1966. There are so many things to be said about this work and there are lots of different levels to explore. It's a fantastic bizarre story where nothing is impossible, for example a cat smokes cigar and knows how to use a gun. The restrictive cultural climate in USSR by this time is also something Bulagov critizes. It's a fascinating piece of work, with a great sense of humour that is absurd. The fictional land Bulgakov has painted is incredibly colorful. The book begins with a mystical stranger who enters Moskow and soon dreadful things starts to happen, still that doesn't stop the story from being very funny. This is a timeless novel that I think will survive through the years."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"There are not enough stars to rate this book.This is a book I wish I had read when I was younger, but I am glad I read it when I was older because I am able to appreciate the depth and how the stories weave into and through one another. Other reviews will speak about that better than I can, so I would like to focus on the translation.I do not speak Russian and my knowledge of Russian culture and history is somewhat limited. The story is filled with references to Russian history and culture, so to address this problem, the translators took the time to insert numerous footnotes. These footnotes, while sometimes breaking up the flow of the story, were much appreciated, and helped give insight into much of what was occurring on the pages and, sometimes, in Bulgakov's head.If you're stuck deciding between which version to buy, make it this one. You will not be disappointed.Note: This review was written for the Burgin/O'Connor translation."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Lavish descriptions, interesting characters, and a very imaginative plot make this novel from the early days of the USSR a fascinating read. Whether you will like it better than Heart of a Dog, by the same author, probably depends on your tastes, but The Master and Margarita is generally considered the better of the two. This translation is so good that one would not guess that the original was written in Russian. One hopes that the Russian edition is as well written as this translation."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"THE MASTER AND MARGARITA kept yearning for my attention because one of my favorite characters, the devil, is a big player in the book. Once I started reading this master piece, with its clever satire and elaborate allusions, I couldn't stop until I got to the end!\\"She looked at me with surprise, and I suddenly and completely unexpectedly realized that this was the woman I had loved my whole life! Amazing, isn't it? Naturally, you'll say I'm a madman, right?\\"What an amazing, passionate quote that encapsulates so much of what this novel is about coming from the Master, while locked up in an insane asylum, professing his love at first sight with Margarita. Love, passion, pain, and many other motifs run through this seminal classic that defies and remains impervious to any one type of genre classification. In many ways this novel is an autobiography where Bulgakov vicariously uses the Master to express his anguish of rejection from the literary circle he once flourished in.Bulgakov wrote the novel, on and off, subsequent to critics destroying his career because they viewed him as an anti-Soviet, between the years 1928 and 1940. The incredible thing was he wrote the work with full awareness it would not be published in his lifetime. Not only was this period marked by Stalin's repressive regime, it also marked an era in the former Soviet Union where atheism was in and religion was out.One of the many things that make this book great is Burgin/O'Connor's enlightening, dense, and in depth commentary. It distinguishes, for example, when Bulgakov's allusions to Faust are inspired by Gounod's opera or Goethe's poem. We also learn the numerous sources the author used in creating his disturbing Pontius Pilate scene.With religion being attacked in the Soviet Union on all fronts, it is only satirically fitting that the novel begins with the devil, posing as professor Woland, meeting two literary elites and advocating the existence of Jesus Christ. Shortly thereafter, the devil's retinue including, among others, a chess loving, talking cat and a beautiful, naked woman wreak havoc in a faithless Moscow.Before this, though, the devil reminisces with his new acquaintances the day Pontius Pilate authorized the crucifixion of Jesus. The imagination and intricate detail the author provides in this historical event makes the reader feel like he's there, like this is how it actually went down. The novel alternates scenes between the Master and Margarita's Moscow and the Jerusalem of Pontius Pilate.There's a dramatic mood shift, some hope, when in part 2 of the novel the narrator claims, \\"Who ever told you there is no such thing in the world as real, true, everlasting love? May the despicable liar have his despicable tongue cut out!\\" Margarita wakes up in the morning with a premonition that something is going happen, no matter what, that day. She is right and soon flies off naked on a broom to meet the devil at his midnight ball. Eventually, the devil obliges to Margarita's wish to be reunited with the Master, the latter is freed after he frees Pontius Pilate, and the two lovers walk off in the dawn to their eternal home. The rebellious nature, unorthodox style, and unique circumstances Bulgakov was under while writing this work, makes this novel a one of a kind, must read love story."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"Spare the time for yourself and do read it.

I am sure most people who read this are intelligentsia beyond my own experiences, but I definitely needed to read it twice.

The first half of the book, about Satan's reign of terror, is impressive in it's detail and fantasy. I didn't enjoy the second half quite as much, about the saving of the Master and Margarita. While there were some wonderfully rich scenes in the second half as well, I didn't feel close enough to the characters. Overall though, a fascinating book with layers."},{"Title":"The Master & Margarita","review":"I attended a private school in New England, I spent a month in an Advanced European Literature class studying this marvel of literature. I was fortunate to have a professor with a doctorate in literature from the University of Moscow.

I will not provide a full review, but share this tidbit. I have always loved the Rolling Stones song 'Sympathy for the Devil'; a masterpiece in depicting the paradoxes and faces of good and evil. I recently learned that Marianne Faithful, a 'groupie-confidante' of Mick Jagger gave him this novel which was the inspiration for this incredible song. I was pleased to learn of this literary-music connection.

The story of the life of a young girl, Chris Guthrie, in turn-of-the-century Scotland to the end of WWI, it is a page-turner, filled with vivid characterizations; disturbing in some parts, filled with tenderness in others. A truly compelling, beautiful novel that memorializes another place and time, vividly. Cannot recommend this novel highly enough.My understanding is that this the first novel in a trilogy called \\"Scots Quair\\" but I have never read the other two novels.

Our postal service is OK! The book was as described - old and a bit sun damaged with a couple of loose pages in the front. No problem."},{"Title":"Usury, destroyer of nations","review":"I found the arguments presented extremely persuasive with only a couple of minor weaknesses. But then, I am only a victim of usury and do not make a living from it.There are three major portions of the book. The definition and history of usury, the Biblical exegesis, and common excuses to defend usury (by calling it business loans.) He ends with a call to repentance.He outlines the weak argument against usury by Aristotle \\"interest is unnatural because money is barren\\" a play on words because the Greek word for interest, tokos, means give birth. He reviews ancient history of usury, how Augustine condemned it and numerous church conferences condemned it. Thomas Aquinus opened the door by incorporating Roman law and it's division of usury as applied only to mutuum - or \\"consumed\\" items. He shows how John Calvin opened the door further to accept usury where usury against the poor was wrong but against the rich it's OK and many others. By Calvin's logic, when the Bible commands in justice to not be partial to the poor or defer to the great, then it would be OK to be partial to the great and defer to the poor. Or when it says not to trouble the widow or orphan, Calvin's logic would imply it's OK to trouble a married woman or a child with parents. Clearly, the Bible is highlighting those it would be the harshest on.The Biblical arguments are quite concise. The only defense of usury in the Old Testament is when Israel was allowed to lend at usury. Once the proper distinction between words translated foreigner - Ger and Nokhri - is made, it is clear that Nokhri is an enemy to their way of life and Ger is a friendly - not the idea of temporary and permanent. The Nokhri to take usury from were the enemies to be defeated. The rejection of the popular Presbyterian take on these words was sound but the frequent use of Ger as \\"sojourner\\" (applied to Israel herself in Egypt) make it worth researching some more.The New Testament defense of usury often cites the parable at Matt 21:33-41, Mark 12:1-9 and Luke 20:9-16. This is where the master punishes the lazy servant for not at least taking usury on the money he gave to him. But upon close inspection this does nothing to defend usury. The servant claimed the master was harsh and reaped where he did not sow. The master says if he was really that evil, then the servant should know he would want an evil usury to be exacted. Either way - if the servant was telling the truth or if the master was telling the truth, it is only an acknowledgment that exacting interest was a harsh thing to do.S.C. Mooney proceeds to handle the evolution of arguments used to defend usury. From durable vs perishable to business vs. charitable to: it's not usury - it's an exchange where future value is less than present value. This last argument is perhaps where pro-usury fans such as Gary North are hanging their hats. Mooney points out the absurdity and illogic. If a borrow's purchase is worth less in the future, why shouldn't the lender's money be worth less in the future as well. You should be able to pay back a $100 loan with $80 or $90 in the future!While Mooney was extremely respectful in dealing with the pseudo-intellectual arguments of usury defenders, I have trouble doing that. Why would otherwise intelligent and well intentioned people like North and Calvin believe their own weak arguments? Some even defend usury because it has always existed as part of man's history. Duh, so has prostitution but that still doesn't make it right. But seriously, I think the answer must lie in the fact that people who are committed or dependent on some evil for their existence, will always twist words to justify their behavior as non-evil. Even a sledge hammer probably would not wake North from his stupor. While this book may not be a sledge hammer, it is certainly more than a 16 oz hammer. If you want your eyes opened, the book is worth the price. If not, you won't accept the arguments - not because the arguments are weak, but because turning your world upside down is too much for most people. This review barely scratches the surface of what is covered in the book."},{"Title":"Usury, destroyer of nations","review":"This is one of the most thought-provoking books any Christian who takes the Bible seriously as a guide to all of life can read on the subject of interest-taking or usury. Gary North has interacted with this book somewhat and rejects the author's thesis, which I think can be summarized as \\"interest-taking (i.e., usury) is only to be used as a means of subjugating the borrower, and thus must be rejected by Christians in their dealings with other Christians.\\" I put that in quotation marks but it is NOT a direct quote from the book, which I don't have in my possession at the moment, and my apologies to the author if I have not summarized his thinking fairly, but in any case that's at least close to what his position is. Many Bible-believing Christians take the position that the biblical prohibition is actually only against the taking of interest on CHARITABLE loans, but the taking of interest on business loans is legitimate, even if both parties are Christians. Mooney looks at the Bible and concludes that the Bible in fact denies the legitimacy of charging interest to fellow believers under any circumstances.(And furthermore he seems to apply this concept to rent, as well, although that aspect is not dealt with extensively in this book.)In modern society, these are very hard words to hear, and I have really struggled with (or perhaps against) the book's thesis. However, the more I keep coming back to this in my mind, the harder I am finding it to continue rejecting the author's conclusions. A great deal of the argument on both sides comes down to how Jesus' parable of the talents is to be understood. Is that parable affirming the legitimacy of taking interest, or denying it? For a long time I thought that the parable was affirming the legitimacy of taking interest, but after considering the author's arguments, I am inclined to think he is right -- the parable is rejecting the legitimacy of interest-taking. Of course, if one assumes that it all came from one Author, the parable cannot be considered in isolation and needs to be considered together with everything else in the Bible.(Although it is more or less outside the scope of this book, I am LESS convinced that the same prohibition applies by logical extension to rent. However, at least concerning the charging of interest on money-lending, the author's arguments deserve a serious hearing among all Bible-believing Christians.)Part of the reason I came around to being more sympathetic to the author's views is my gradual development of appreciation for the fact that in the modern world, MONEY IS DEBT. (Do a Google search on the phrase \\"Money as Debt\\" to find a short film by Paul Grignon that explains this in an easy-to-understand manner. That film's proposals for a solution are in error, but its explanation of what is wrong with the modern monetary system is very good.) The world is a closed system, and as all money is created by bankers from debt -- meaning it accrues interest -- the only way to pay off the principal and the interest in entirely is to create more money. But the creation of more money necessarily means the creation of more interest-bearing debt, and the vicious cycle never ends. As time goes by, the insane \\"logic\\" of this approach moves inexorably toward the totally absurd conclusion that eventually, ownership of the entire world must be transferred to the bankers. Now the world is a closed system but it is also a very large system -- large and still immature. So it takes a long time (many generations) for these implications to be fully worked out. But worked out they shall be, eventually. So when we see the absurdity and the evil of the ultimate conclusion -- that everyone in the world should be reduced to serfs working on the bankers' plantations, it makes it a lot easier to go back to the biblical text and see why God prohibits usury.I am still not 100% certain as to whether I want to embrace Mooney's essential thesis, but I am strongly inclined to think he is probably correct. The question then arises, \\"Is it workable?\\" I think the answer to that is yes, it can be done. However, if this is what God is commanding at this point, obeying God in this matter would completely transform modern culture into something very different from what it is now. And perhaps that is exactly the point! This is \\"just one commandment\\" but it is one that would radically transform the modern world if it was obeyed (assuming, of course, that Mooney is correct). Christians must not shy away from careful consideration of this subject. It would NOT be adequate to obey God on everything else (not that we do so, of course) but then to fail to obey God on this one point. After all, as the Scripture tells us, the law of God is a unified whole and it is not possible to abrogate it at one point without abrogating the whole.I'm very grateful to the author for this extremely thought-provoking work and I recommend it, and indeed all of his writings relevant to this topic, to Bible-believing Christians and to anyone else who wants to study what the Bible teaches on this subject. At the time of this writing, the book is no longer in print; however, unused copies may still be available and one way to find them may be to go to the various blogs where C.S. Mooney's writings are discussed and inquire with the blog author as to whether he knows where Mooney's books can be obtained.For what it's worth, I work in the real estate securitization department of one of Japan's largest securities companies. (Believe me, I feel the irony every day.)"},{"Title":"Stay With Me","review":"Stay With Me is a highly complex and rewarding young adult novel. It tells of a year in the life of sixteen-year-old Leila Abranel, a New York City high school student with a rather unconventional family. Leila begins her story indirectly, recounting her occasional meetings with her sisters' mother. Leila has two much older half-sisters, from her father's doomed first marriage. Leila admires her vibrant and quirky sister Rebecca, and turns to her for advice, while respecting her more formal sister Clare's preference to remain distant. The family has a balance, if an unusual one, right up until Rebecca commits suicide.After Rebecca's clearly premediatated suicide, everything changes for Leila. Her parents take a one-year job helping to create a new teaching hospital in Poland. Leila moves in with her sister Clare, and has Raphael, a distant cousin (and former boyfriend of Clare's), as a secondary guardian. Leila goes on with her life - school, a part-time job, finally getting to know Clare - but struggles to understand Rebecca's suicide. She latches on to her last sighting of Rebecca, and tries to find the person that Rebecca was with at the time, thinking that he might have some insight for her.This book is about so many different things. Stay With Me is about what it means to be a family. (Raphael, despite his relatively distant family connection, helps Leila with her homework, gives her advice, and takes on a near-parental role.) Stay With Me is about trusting your own body (and yourself), and knowing what you are and are not ready for sexually. Stay With Me is about why someone with most of her life ahead of her would commit suicide, and the devastating impact of a suicide on the people left behind. Stay With Me is about what it's like to be dyslexic (Leila is dyslexic), and how it can affect a person's entire way of thinking.And yes, as you are sure to read in other reviews, Stay With Me is about teen-aged Leila's friendship with and sexual interest in a 31-year-old man, Eamon. What I found remarkable about this entire storyline was how normal Freymann-Weyr made it seem, and how NOT creepy the plot-line was. I want to be sure to get this across to you, because I was initially hesitant to read the book, knowing about this Lolita-esque theme. Leila's relationship with Eamon is an important part of the book, but it's only a part of a much more fully realized story, and it's handled exceedingly well.I found Stay With Me to be very well-written. The characters, especially Leila, are complex and realistic. Leila's voice is particularly engaging. Her dyslexia shapes her perceptions of herself, her ability to make decisions, and her day-to-day life, with a pervasiveness that I hadn't anticipated or understood before reading this book. Somehow Freymann-Weyr conveys this without ever making Leila someone to be pitied or ridiculed over her learning disability. It's a remarkable achievement.I think that high school readers will enjoy this book, especially those with learning disabilities or unconventional families (and what family seems normal, when you're in high school?). And I think that teens who are (horrifyingly) curious about suicide will find in this book a subtle, but strong, anti-suicide message. I believe in general that parents should read as many of the books that their kids read as possible. But I especially believe that parents should read Stay With Me with their kids. There are many great discussion points in the book.As you can tell, I liked this book a lot. The plot is multi-layered without being confusing, with a nice blend of poignancy, humor, tension. I read it in a single day, not so much because I needed to know what happened, as because I wanted to spend more time with Leila, and make sure that she was alright. But I won't tell you the answer to that. You'll have to read Stay With Me yourself.This book review was originally published on my blog, Jen Robinson's Book Page, on May 6th, 2006."},{"Title":"Stay With Me","review":"Much like this author's last novel My Heartbeat - this new effort deals with relationships and how complicated, confusing and messy they can be. The protagonist Leila navigates her way through her complicated family, an \\"impossible\\" and \\"all wrong\\" relationship with a much older man and coping with her sister's suicide. Indeed it as Leila moves away from needing a reason for her sister Rebecca's death towards accepting the loss, that she matures and grows. I think one of Garret Freymann-Weyr's strengths as an author is her ability to create characters who demand the reader's, attention, concern and attachment. Leila in this novel and Ellen in My Heartbeat live on in a little corner of my heart. I would still say My Heartbeat outshines Stay With Me - but that's based on how tender and unsure Ellen was.Now I am going to address an issue which I am sure is going to come up: Leila's relationship with a thirty-one year old man. Freymann-Weyr is very brave for not compromising Leila's story by turning her relationship with Eamon into a morality lesson. In describing people's reactions to their relationship Eamon states \\"the men all think I've done something brilliant and...the women think I should be shot.\\" In real life - I would probably fall into the latter category and in real life I can't fathom their relationship working due to their differences in life experiences. But this is a work of fiction - and people sometimes forget that. I wish readers would remember: that by including a controversial/edgy topic in a book - an author is not advocating it in real life. Unfortunately this is what I think holds YA fiction back - but fortunately we have authors like Freymann-Weyr who are brave enough to tell their characters' stories without compromise.Stay With Me is a heartbeaking and intense experience. I cannot wait to see what Freymann-Weyr has in store for us next!"},{"Title":"Stay With Me","review":"\\"Stay with me,\\" I say, wishing I'd said it to my sister but also wanting to hear it from him.\\"Stay with you?\\" he asks.\\"No,\\" I say. \\"You've messed up the pronoun.\\"Leila is the product of her father's second marriage. Her parents are still happily married, and she is their only child. She has two half-sisters from her father's first marriage, but she is not as close to them as she would like to be. Rebecca and Clare were in their twenties with Leila was born, so even though she is now approaching the age of seventeen, Leila still feels like a kid in their presence.Even more remarkable than her parents' loving marriage is Leila's other source of adult support: Janie, her father's first wife. The book begins with Leila's memories of Janie, and the loss she felt when Janie passed away. It continues with the revelation that Rebecca has committed suicide, causing those familiar feelings of loss and regret to rise to the surface but in a new way. As Leila attempts to figure out what would cause Rebecca to do such a thing, she makes startling discoveries about her family members - and herself. What she thought she knew may not be true at all.\\"There's such a gap between the images I carry in my mind and what can actually be found in the world.\\"Among many other things, Leila learns that nothing valuable is easy. Her life is as complex as that of any real person, and the book seamlessly weaves together various plotlines that touch Leila's life, with each given appropriate weight and attention. In Freymann-Weyr's best novel to date, the author has created characters who are intelligent, each in his or her own way, and realistically flawed. The first-person narrative is poignant and poetic, offering many memorable scenes and exchanges of dialogue.\\"For me, they are one more thing that belongs in someone else's story.\\"This book is something to savor and share. Leila's story with stay with readers long after they finish the last page. Highly recommended to adults and older teens."},{"Title":"Stay With Me","review":"About two thirds of the way through this novel it began to be a bit tiresome. I felt the presence of the author looming over the story and I began to dislike the characters--the female ones particularly. Maybe my own background is too working class for the dialogue and the structure of the interpersonal relationships to come off as real or convincing to me, I don't know. The various men in the lives of the three sisters moon over these young women, put the lovely Abranels up on pedestals, and seem to have little to no lives of their own outside their worship of them. Hmmm, it just didn't ring true with me. Leila seemed far more sophisticated and fey than a dyslexic 16 year old would be--even one from such a remarkable family. I thought the writing was lovely, but the characters were somewhat distasteful. Ultimately they weren't people I could care about."},{"Title":"Stay With Me","review":"A girl's dyslexia, relationships with a father and stepmother, and determination to investigate romance, cheating and death makes for a vivid multi-faceted story in Stay With Me, which follows her evolving sense of self in the face of disability and changes. Stay With Me is a recommended pick for mature teens who will find plenty of interest in a story of love which keeps on changing."},{"Title":"Stay With Me","review":"I really loved this book. The protagonist, Leila, is just so likeable, and the family is just bizarre enough. Good enough to re-read."},{"Title":"Stay With Me","review":"Once I started reading, I couldn't put this book down. It is a beautiful and compelling portrayal of a teenager trying to navigate her way through the \\"new now\\" after one of her much-older sisters commits suicide. Protagonist Leila is interesting and likable, and there's a good cast of well-fleshed-out supporting characters. It's a wonderful story of love and loss and family and learning to trust yourself.There is sex, but it's not graphic, and the focus is on the emotional aspects rather than the physical. There is also a romantic relationship between a 17-year-old and a 31-year-old, but it was so well done that I didn't actually disapprove (this is definitely something that I would almost certainly disapprove of in real life!). But perhaps it's not the best book to recommend to younger teens. Then again, Leila's process for making decisions, whether sexual or otherwise, is so wonderfully healthy that perhaps this is the perfect book for younger teens! She has some wonderful adults in her life, she goes to them for advice when she isn't sure what to do or how to do something, and they help her figure out her own mind.(Note: I received a free copy of this book from the publisher at an American Library Association conference. I was not required to write a positive review. Thank you, Houghton Mifflin!)"},{"Title":"Stay With Me","review":"Have you ever closed a book and just smiled because you were really happy that you read it? That is what this book was like for me. I thought it was a great coming of age story with a character that was very likeable. I though Lelia was great, she was a very caring young women who wanted to please others, but also looked out for herself. She worked hard at everything she did and was one of those YA characters that I could see myself being friend with.I loved her relationship with Eamon. Yes, he was significantly older, but he waited until she was 17, insisted that he met her guardians, and made sure that he took things slowly so she knew he was not just after one thing. While her ex-boyfriend thought Lelia was stupid, she really was very mature for her age. I saw a lot of reviews saying the relationship was \\"icky\\" or \\"pedophile\\". For one, she is 17. That is the age of consent and pedophilia is being attracted to undeveloped bodies, not 17 year olds. And it was not portrayed as being \\"icky\\" at all. He really cared about her and the author portrayed it that way.It was by no means a perfect book, after the 15th mention of her dyslexia I wanted to yell out that I got it already and while the writing was mostly very good, there were awkwardly worded passages that could have been better."},{"Title":"Stay With Me","review":"The book Stay With Me is a wonderful story about love and loss and how one can lead straight to the other. Leila Abranel feels that she has been left behind when her much older sister, Rebecca, decides to take her own life. Rebecca was 20 years older than Leila and they had just truly begun to get to know one another. Leila was beginning to feel like she could talk to Rebecca about things that she couldn't talk to her parents about and then she overdosed on pills and ended any chance of a relationship Leila thought they might be able to have.In the midst of the mourning and grief, Leila's parents decide that it might be best if they went ahead as planned and moved to Poland for a year, only with a slight change. Since Leila is only 16 she was going to be staying with Rebecca while they were gone but now they must ask her other sister, Clare, if she could take care of her while they are gone.Leila never really felt like she fit in with her other sisters but she felt like she fit more with Rebecca because Clare was more the smart, workaholic type. Leila is dyslexic and so has always had trouble fitting in and feeling like she belongs but once she moves in with Clare, they start to learn new things about the other and form a close, sisterly bond.Raphael also helps take care of Leila while her parents are in Poland. His mother was married to their uncle before she met his father and so he is their semi-cousin. Raphael and Clare once had a relationship but it didn't work for reasons that weren't really mentioned. Shortly after Leila moves in with Clare, Clare breaks up with her boyfriend and then once again starts a relationship with Raphael, forming a type of family for Leila to rely on.While, Leila has tried to move on from her sister's death, she still feels like she is missing something and decides that she should try and find the reason Rebecca killed herself. In her quest for answers she gets a job at Cafe Acca, the last place she saw Rebecca. In a way Rebecca led Leila right to Eamon. Eamon is a 31 year old writer for TV shows and he immediately takes an interest in Leila, not knowing that she is only 16. Throughout the book Leila and Eamon go through many different phases and finally settle on dating even if other people think it is wrong of them.In the end, Leila realizes that maybe Rebecca didn't really have a reason for killing herself, maybe she just gave up. She knows that what Rebecca did was selfish and inexcusable. Rebecca was only thinking of herself, not the people she would be leaving behind. Leila finally learns that she doesn't really need to know everything about her sister but that in her own way Rebecca led Leila right to her love, if not her great love then her great love for now.Stay With Me is a story about coping with the sudden death of someone you love and how maybe you don't get over that, maybe you just find new ways to shape your life around it."},{"Title":"Stay With Me","review":"When Leila's much older sister, Rebecca, kills herself, it changes the lives of everyone who knew her, and many people who didn't. But did anyone really know Rebecca, or just the face she showed them? This is just one of the questions that Leila can't help but ask herself in the months after her sister's death. Did she know Rebecca? Or did she only know Rebecca through her interactions with other people? Leila knows her father. She knew her father's first wife, Janie, who died before Rebecca. But if she had really known Rebecca, if anyone had known Rebecca fully, wouldn't they have been able to figure out Rebecca's reasons for doing what she did?It's for that reason that Leila is searching when she meets Eamon. At first he's only a customer in the caf&eacute; where she once saw Rebecca with the mysterious T., a man she thinks might know something of the reason Rebecca had for committing suicide. Later, though, he becomes something much more.Clare is Leila's surviving older half-sister. Clare has her own life: a boyfriend, a career, and an apartment--suddenly one occupant short. Rebecca lived there, and now that Leila's parents are moving to Poland for the year, she will move in with Clare. During this year, Clare and Raphael, their unrelated \\"cousin,\\" will become much, much more important in Leila's life. She will get to know them, maybe in the way she never got to know Rebecca--the way she is still trying to get to know Rebecca, even after her death.STAY WITH ME is a very powerful, moving story about love, loss, and life. It's about the way life keeps going on, even after a tragedy. Since it takes place in New York and since Rebecca dies right after the attacks on the city on 9/11, the characters are healing from their own personal tragedy, but also, along with everyone else in the city, from the attack on them all. That's not the focus of the novel, but it's definitely a part of it.Garrett Freymann-Weyr is brilliant at creating wonderful, three-dimensional characters. I've read two of her previous novels (My HeartbeatandWhen I Was Older), and that's something that can be seen in all of her work. It's a talent, and I was glad to see it shows just as much in STAY WITH ME as in the other two novels. We learn plenty, even about the characters only glimpsed in the novel. The character I felt I knew the least was Leila's mother, but she was not really a part of this story. She hardly knew Rebecca, whose death is what sets off the whole story (though Leila chooses to start the telling of it with her visits to Janie, her father's first wife). There are so many parts to this story, but Rebecca, her life and death, is what ties it all together so marvelously.Reviewed by: Jocelyn Pearce"},{"Title":"The New Glucose Revolution Pocket Guide to Childhood Diabetes","review":"gave to friends who's son has dieabets and they said it helped them alot thank you very much they like it."},{"Title":"The Way: The Living Bible (Illustrated)","review":"This was THE Bible during the Jesus Revolution of the 1970's.

I used this book for the first time in the current semester because it is virtually standard where I teach.I was puzzled by the many obscure selections in this anthology such as Thorstein the Staff-Struck and Marguerite de Navarre. I was frustrated by the selection of relatively unreadable translations like the Jowett &quot;Socrates' Apology&quot; and the apparently untranslated &quot;Morte Darthur.&quot; This book is intended for contemporary college students who have had little experience reading classical experience and these choices were simply inappropriate to them.Shakespeare is represented only by &quot;Othello.&quot; Why not also one of the comedies or histories? Why not any other example of Elizabethan drama?The editors left out important works such as More's &quot;Utopia,&quot; anything by Aquinas, any of Aristotle except for a brief excerpt from &quot;The Poetics,&quot; and anything by Martin Luther. The selections from the New Testament were also deficient.They chose, correctly I believe, to include some Jewish and Muslim literature but did not choose well. Aside from the Old Testament the Jewish literature was limited to a few Medieval verses and not the best of them. Aside from a few selections from the Koran, they saw fit to include a tiny selection of verse and a little of &quot;The Thousand and One Nights.&quot; The lack of possible choices that either affected or were affected by Western literature (Philo, Maimonides, Al-Gazzali, Ibn-Khaldoun) are an indication of timidity or ignorance on the part of the editors.I detect an attempt at the kind of political correctness that wants to include authors aside from &quot;dead, white, European males.&quot; That is not an unworthy aim, but they did it badly.Finally the introductions, which were in almost unreadably small print, were filled with inaccurate information. These were not carefully written.It's a shame that this anthology dominates the search engines at Amazon and at other online services. The reason would seem to be a matter of economics rather than quality.

I was also disappointed in the Bible excerpts - particularly Genesis, where there is no indication that the redactor of the selections picked and chose between J, E and P texts, with no indication of the lacunae, making it seem as if there were only one version, for instance, of the Creation or the Flood, while any biblical scholar knows that there are at least two. My overall impression, however, is that this offers a fair introduction to Western world literature to the mid-seventeenth century."},{"Title":"Norton Anthology of World Masterpieces: The Western Tradition, Vol. 1: Literature of Western Culture Through the Renaissance","review":"Wide collection of works and translations.

I always want to know more about the characters, about what happens after the killer has been caught. Agatha Christie, in fewer pages, provides just as much detail about the characters but still manages to tie up all the story threads.The ending of Ashworth Hall, however, has an even more serious flaw (no spoiler here): it is not at all clear who the murderer(s) is/are.

It's like meeting old friends that you haven't seen in a while. Getting the latest update on Thomas and Charlotte Pitt and the other recurring characters is as much a part of the enjoyment as is whatever case is on tap. Moreover, Ms. Perry, if a little preachy, generally writes an entertaining story. On that basis, I typically rate these four star reads.ASHWORTH HALL gives you all the usual. You get the latest in the lives of the Pitt family members and friends and you get a decent whodunit. The problem here, for me, was in the situation and backdrop. The story finds Thomas trying to provide security for secret negotiations involving some leading Irish catholic and protestant leaders. Murder ensues, of course, but by the time it was over I was just glad to get rid of the people on both sides. They all came across to me as self-righteous, bigoted, and selfishly motivated. I didn't like any of them much and I didn't care what happened to any of them. Also, beyond that, the situation seemed overly contrived, as did the \\"romance\\" involving Gracie (I know, fiction is all contrived, but it's a matter of degree). It seemed too unlikely in the circumstances and too convenient in the context of the plot. Given my reaction to these elements, I didn't find the story particularly engaging.If you're a Pitt fan, you'll want to read ASHWORTH HALL, but it isn't, in my opinion, one of the better tales in this series. Further, and from a personal standpoint, though I enjoy the series, I'd like to see Ms. Perry put aside the Victorian social and political issues sometime and just give us a top-notch whodunit that's not doubling as a \\"morality play\\"."},{"Title":"Ashworth Hall (Charlotte & Thomas Pitt Novels)","review":"After reading this book, I am hungry to go back and read all about the Irish Problem in the scholarly literature. In addition to her usual satisfying mysteries wrapped around the sights, sounds, and--yes--the smells of Victorian England, Anne Perry gets us to care about people on both sides of the political dispute at the heart of the conference at Charlotte's sister Emily's lordly estate. The characters who are here from earlier volumes in the Pitt series continue to grow, surprise, and delight--none more so than Gracie, the Pitts' &quot;maid of all work.&quot; Her worse-than-impoverished childhood has left her unafraid in the face of danger, but here we see her first journey into affairs of the heart.

Though thelocation seems to be more of a place for a tea party, the participants do not give any pretense of being friends. Religious and National differences leaveboth sides loathing the other side. However, as bad as things seem,they only get worse when Greville is murdered.While Thomas, his wife Charlotte, and his assistant Tellmaninvestigate the case, the meetings continue, but in an even morehostile environment. Even the servants of the gathering of leaders arebickering. If Thomas and cohorts do not solve the murder soon, the impassioned emotions may lead to more killings and perhaps even civil war.The Victorian Era is incredibly described by that master of Englishhistorical who-done-it, Anne Perry. The over fifteen tales starringthe Pitts are clearly some of the juiciest fruits on the sub-genretree. ASHWORTH HALL may be the best of a superior lot because a political thriller adds even more dimension to an already multi-faceted tale. Ms. Perrysucceeds in reminding readers that unbridled anger (regardless ofwhether it is historical or the nineties) is not the way to resolve conflict.

They are all well crafted, intelligent cozy mysteries, along with an interesting portrayal of the culture and politics of Victorian England. This particular book revolves around a peace conference for Ireland which is being held at Ashworth Hall, hence the title. Ashworth Hall happens to be the home of the sister-in-law of Inspector (now Superintendent) Pitt, who is the hero of this series of Perry's novels. Moreover, the politician presiding over the conference has been the subject of death threats in the recent past. So Pitt is asked to attend the conference, without revealing his identity, as a security measure to prevent foul play.Unfortunately, Pitt fails. Two murders are committed despite his efforts, terrifying both the guests and the sizable contingent of servants. We then have the usual collection of suspects and motives, and Pitt eventually sorts through all of the information to solve the mystery - with considerable help from his wife Charlotte and their maid Gracie.It's a tightly written mystery, along with a convincing portrayal of Victorian mores and the unending hatreds in Ireland. It doesn't quite rise to the level of true literature, as Elizabeth George's and P. D.

That wouldfit every part of our lives."},{"Title":"Ashworth Hall (Charlotte & Thomas Pitt Novels)","review":"As the author gets farther and farther into this popular series of police procedural murder mysteries set in late Victorian England, she seems to be struggling for original plots, and for something new to say regarding the sordidness of much of high society and the need for drastic reform. But this 17th book starring Superintendent Pitt, a self-made man, and his wife, Charlotte, who \\"married down,\\" is one of the best yet. All the previous stories have been set in and around London, but this one is Perry's take on the \\"country house mystery.\\" It's 1890 and the British government is trying hard to find some solution to the Irish problem, but centuries of mutual hatred between the native Irish Catholics and the Protestants imposed upon Ireland by earlier monarchs have made that nearly impossible. (And still have, for that matter, in the Northern Counties.) Charlotte's sister, Emily, who married up, to a peer, still manages her late husband's fortune (in trust for her small son, his heir), including a sizable country estate. Now that her second husband, Jack Radley, is in Parliament, Emily is asked to make her place available for a summit meeting between representatives of both sides in the Irish mess, with a report of recommendations later to be made to Parliament. Pitt is detailed to handle security, though he's passing himself off at first as merely Emily's guest. And he takes Sergeant Tellman along, disguised as his valet -- which is hilarious, since Tellman loathes the very notion of anyone being a personal servant to anyone else. Hardly has the conference begun when Ainsley Greville, a skilled diplomat and negotiator and moderator for the weekend, is murdered in his bath. A political assassination, obviously, perpetrated by those who despise the idea of compromise over Ireland. Or maybe not. Jack is asked to try to take Greville's place in continuing the negotiations -- until a dynamite bomb destroys his study and one of the Irish attendees is killed in the explosion. Pitt has his hands full, naturally, and so does Charlotte. The cast of characters is better developed than usual, and the background about Ireland is far more skillfully presented than Perry's previous, rather melodramatic, diatribes on slums and women's rights. For many reasons, I'm rather an Anglophile, and I have no use whatever for the authoritarianism of the Roman Catholic (or any other) Church -- but when it comes to Ireland, I'm on the side of my own ancestors from Kerry, who were thrown off their land in the 1830s and fled the Olde Sod for the American midwest. Yet Perry does an excellent job showing how the Irish have themselves to blame for their troubles, at least as much as the English. The sub-plots, about Charlotte's maid, Gracie, and her first romantic experience, and the Montague-Capulet affair between a Protestant conference attendee and the wife of a Catholic, are also well done and fit right into the story. (Perry's parallel plots often stick out like sore-thumb afterthoughts.) My only complaint, in fact, is that we never find out about the true identity of the man with the light-colored eyes."},{"Title":"Ashworth Hall (Charlotte & Thomas Pitt Novels)","review":"_Ashworth Hall_ is another of Anne Perry's long-running series of mysteries featuring Charlotte and Thomas Pitt. In this one, Perry deals with the &quot;Irish Problem&quot;. The novel deals with a conference between two leading Catholics and two leading Protestants, in England at the title Hall, Charlotte's sister Emily's country home. A death threat aimed at the English diplomat heading the conference leads the government to send Pitt to the weekend meeting, incognito, with the excuse that Emily has simply invited her sister. Pitt fails utterly, as the diplomat is murdered, and in the course of the investigation, another man is also murdered. Pitt, Charlotte, and their longtime servant Gracie unravel the strings of the various murders, uncovering long-festering strands of the Irish Problem (especially as Gracie has a brief romance with an Irish Catholic), as well as typically sordid family details. This all plays out with the famous Parnell/O'Shea divorce case in the background, which case in fact lead to Parnell's discrediting as a serious factor, and thus possibly put off any &quot;solution&quot; to the &quot;problem&quot; for at least decades, if not, dare I say, sadly, for much longer stillI found this pretty unsatisfying. Much was very predictable. Perry's habit of telling, at endless length, what is motivating her characters, and what her characters are feeling, rather than showing, is really getting on my nerves. Also her constant repetition of the same themes of rich men committing callous adultery, their wives taking it more or less stoically, until something precipitates violence, realistic as it may be, is getting very stale. I guessed two of the villains pretty much right off: granted that Perry did pull one additional twist which surprised me. But all in all, this is one of the weakest of Perry's Charlotte and Thomas Pitt books. (Note that many of the earlier books are very enjoyable.)"},{"Title":"Ashworth Hall (Charlotte & Thomas Pitt Novels)","review":"I love Anne Perry's books. For the most part, her writing keeps getting better and better, particularly the William Monk series. That being said, this novel left me feeling disgruntled and unsatisfied.

I suspect looming deadline-itis on this one."},{"Title":"Ashworth Hall (Charlotte & Thomas Pitt Novels)","review":"Love the series & can't wait to finish one so I can start another!

But his superiors have another job for him: protecting Ainsley Greville, the politician who will be leading a peace conference of sorts, to be held at Ashworth Hall. That is the country home of Pitt's sister-in-law, Emily Radley, whose second husband now holds a seat in Parliament. The participants? Irish Catholics and Protestants, coming together to try to resolve their differences. Pitt can attend the weekend house party that's the conference's cover story without, hopefully, seeming out of place; he accompanies his wife, Emily's sister Charlotte. Actually the police superintendent both looks and feels utterly out of place, though, because Charlotte married as far below her station in life as Emily married above it. Accompanied by his sergeant, who bitterly resents being forced (as his cover story) to act as Pitt's valet, the Victorian detective soon finds a bad situation growing infinitely worse when someone kills Ainsley Greville. Which casts suspicion on everyone else present, and places Emily's husband next in the line of danger as Jack Radley takes over the conference moderator's job.As usual, author Perry gets the details as well as the spirit of Victorian society exactly right. This book is as much character study as mystery, and it does well in both areas. I did find the conclusion a bit rushed this time, and somehow a bit of a letdown, too. A bit of a, \\"Huh?

It is Thomas's job, as a police superintendent, to find out who did it and why. Charlotte is also a house guest and gets involved in the investigation. As always, the ending has a twist. Anne Perry really makes her books more realistic by not using the same old \\"the butler did it\\" type of ending. I would highly recommend all of her books. She has obviously done a lot of research into the Victorian period. She really shows what life was like. I did a little checking of some of her facts after I read my first book by her.

Unfortunately, Emilio refuses to become involved with employees or with clients, and Stevie is both when she brings him surveillance photos she received anonymously.Rogelio Braga's face in the background of Stevie's photos instantly indicates that she is in more danger than she realizes, and Emilio feels compelled to step in. Before opening January Investigations, Emilio worked for the Justice Department. A case involving Braga resulted in the death of an informant and blew his cover and three years of work. Now Emilio attaches himself to Stevie 24/7 until he can solve the potentially deadly connection between Braga and Stevie. Meanwhile, Emilio quickly catches on that Stevie has been sending him the black lace notes and they become the springboard for their fantasies to come true.Author Mia Zachary has quickly proven herself to be one of Harlequin's rising stars penning provocative and passionate romance.

Indeed, Stevie's relentless enthusiasm whether she's hotwiring a car or making love creates marvelous tension as she struggles with her internal demons. Emilio's own demons result in a haunted hero who has a chance at redemption if he can end this case and keep Stevie safe, despite her willful determination to remain actively involved in the investigation.

Emilio Sanchez, for months. But with all the women around him, she doesn't want to be one of the crowd, so she writes him anonymous, sexually explicit notes, signed \\"yours in black lace.\\"Then she gets surveillance photos of herself, and asks Emilio for help investigating. He recognizes someone in the background of one of the photos and realizes she's in danger, and decides to stick to her like glue to protect her. While he's doing that, he discovers she's the anonymous letter writer.The romantic suspense part of the story was... well, romantic and suspenseful. Stevie and Emilio had both been attracted to each other for a while, so the fast-paced romance made sense, and alternately running from and chasing the bad guys kept the tension high. I enjoyed that part very much.But there were two things that kept me from really loving this book--one was the anonymous letters. Even though we know he enjoyed them, and they worked, anonymous letters in general squick me. It's stalkery. And the letters themselves were embarrassingly cheesy, though I wouldn't be surprised if that's just me and everyone else thinks they're hot. I have a low tolerance for that sort of thing.The other thing was Emilio's secret. I'm not going to give it away, or even say what kind of secret it was, but it needed to be either expanded on or left out entirely. As it is, it's interesting, but there was really no point to it, as far as the plot goes. If it had connected to the suspense plot in some way, or if it had been something Stevie wondered about, it would have made more sense, and would have made the book feel more layered.At any rate, I have one or two more of Mia Zachary's books in my TBR pile, and if they're as entertaining as this, I'll be happy."},{"Title":"Mini Flyers (Mini Kits)","review":"For six dollars i am sure there are many books on paper aeroplanes better than this.

In the 1930s, there was another challenge for would-be revolutionary artists : the obstacle of the mass&quot;Communist&quot; parties which betrayed them and workers and farmers around the world in the interests of the &quot;Soviet&quot; bureaucrats headed by Stalin, which same bureaucracy stifled and suffocated all art and creativity inside the USSR.The struggle of those artists, led by Andre Breton and Diego Rivera, and their direct collaboration with the Russian revolutionary leader in exile Leon Trotsky, has rich lessons for those artists of all kinds who are already beginning to reject and revolt against the &quot;globalized&quot; capitalism of today. As well as those who will do so tommorow."},{"Title":"What Is Surrealism?: Selected Writings","review":"Today most artists seem to be on a short leash. I have friends who paint and sculpt and they don't even think about the fact that their art rarely reaches even middle class people let alone the working and farming majority. When something stirs them and they want to take action, they get afraid about their grants, their patrons, that artist in resident spot at a university, or that artist on a cruise, or on a rich person's art club trip to France or Egypt. They get scared to make a phone call or even write a letter because art in the US in particular is on strings to the rich.......................................................Once it was different. Read this. I don't say follow surrealism, because it was just one school, born of another time, trying to surmount problems that only a socialist revolution and retransformation of society can solve. As a revolutionist as well as an artist--I have a MFA in Creative Writing and write fictional and poetry--what is remarkable about Breton is not his narrow precepts or methods, but about the militancy to which he tried to find truth and resonance and joy without surrendering to acceptance of bourgeois society..................................The remarkable writings of Andre Breton, as gifted as a writer, as he was a painter, and more gifted as a thinker than he was either. After World War II US imperialism went to work to try to stifle the courage and outrageousness of people like Breton to channel art into the lack of statement of abstract expressionism. Surrealism is no more revolutionary than any other form of art. The most famous surrealist to most people today is Dali, who didn't mind Franco at all and tried to turn himself into an NY advertizing money maker. What is important about Breton, besides what he says about surrealism and art--and on those things I am no big judge--he was trying to find a way to fight for a free, fighting, critical, irreverant art, faced with the nauseating conservatism of formalism and the smothering idiocy of socialist realism? What was important about Breton is that in these writings and in the manifestos here signed by non surrealists like Leon Trotsky and Diego Rivera, Breton was fighting for more than his art? The quest to upturn (boulverser is better but not English) speak out of turn, penetrate, and speak openly that he developed in his art, in the 1930s and 1940s when most of this work was done, was connected with the struggle of artists to link up with the revolutionary struggle against imperialism, and at the same time, with the fight within the workers movement to free it self of the syphilis of Stalinism.Buy this book.

The duel between the suavely witty Bencolin and Sir John Landervorne; the superb use of the London fog and what Dr. Pilgrim saw; and the lost street, \\"the prettiest fancy in the whole realm of nightmare,\\" form a logical whole. Carr's style has greatly improved since It Walks by Night; even though lurid in parts, the prose is generally excellent, and gives the impression of moving through a nightmare, at once theatrical and melodramatic, but thoroughly entertaining.

They are known in every ... college as the most insufferable, cocksure know-it-alls. If you want to talk to them about poetry, they are likely to reply that the \\"emotive response\\" to poetry is only a conditioned reflex .... If they go on to be professional scientists, their sharp corners are rubbed down, but they undergo no fundamental change. They most decidedly are not set apart from the others by their intellectual integrity and faith, and their patient humility in front of the facts of nature.... They are uneducated, in the fullest sense of the word, and they certainly are no advertisement for the claims of science teachers.23-24: Mr. Hillaire Belloc has pointed out that science has changed greatly, and for the worse, since it became popular. Some hundred years ago, or more, only very unusual, highly original spirits were attracted to science at all; scientific work was therefore carried out by men of exceptional intelligence. Now, scientists are turned out by mass production in our universities, and ... they are very ordinary professional men, and all they know is their trade.26: As advertising always convinces the sponsor even more than the public, the scientists have become sold, and remain sold, on the idea that they have the key to the Absolute, and that nothing will do for Mr. Average Citizen but to stuff himself full of electrons.31: They will define these [terms] in tight phrases which convey a meaning only to those who already understand it.31: The dreadful cocksureness that is characteristic of scientists in bulk is not only quite foreign to the spirit of true science, it is not even justified by a superficial view.35: There is more truth in an old wisecrack of Oliver Wendell Holmes: \\"Science is a good piece of furniture for a man to have in an upper chamber provided he has common sense on the ground floor.\\"43: Education, like everything else, goes in fads, and has the normal human tendency to put up with something bad for just so long, and then rush to the other extreme.60-62: The first thing to realize about physics ... is its extraordinary indirectness.... For physics is not about the real world, it is about \\"abstractions\\" from the real world, and this is what makes it so scientific.... Theoretical physics runs merrily along with these unreal abstractions, but its conclusions are checked, at every possible point, by experiments.69-70; 85: Lord Kelvin was so satisfied with this triumph of science that he declared himself to be as certain of the existence of the ether as a man can be about anything.... \\"When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it....\\" Thus did Lord Kelvin lay down the law. And though quite wrong, this time he has the support of official modern Science. It is NOT true that when you can measure what you are speaking about, you know something about it. The fact that you can measure something doesn't even prove that that something exists.... Take the ether, for example: didn't they measure the ratio of its elasticity to its density?68, 88, 179: Physics is NOT a body of indisputable and immutable Truth; it is a body of well-supported probable opinion only .... Physics can never prove things the way things are proved in mathematics, by eliminating ALL of the alternative possibilities. It is not possible to say what the alternative possibilities are.... Write down a number of 20 figures; if you multiply this by a number of, say, 30 figures, you would arrive at some enormous number (of either 49 or 50 figures). If you were to multiply the 30-figure number by the 20-figure number you would arrive at the same enormous 49- or 50-figure number, and you know this to be true without having to do the multiplying. This is the step you can never take in physics.90-91: It is true that physics gives a wonderful training in precise, logical thinking-about physics. It really does depend upon accurate reproducible experiments, and upon framing hypotheses with the greatest possible freedom from dogmatic prejudice. And if these were the really important things in life, physics would be an essential study for everybody.191: If this \\"critical openminded attitude\\" ... is wanted, the question at once arises, Is it science that should be studied in order to achieve it? Why not study law? A judge has to do everything that a scientist is exhorted to do in the way of withholding judgment until all the facts are in, and then judging impartially on the merits of the case as well as he can.... Why not a course in Sherlock Holmes? The detectives, or at least the detective-story writers, join with the scientists in excoriating \\"dogmatic prejudice, lying, falsification of facts, and data, and willful fallacious reasoning.\\"98-100: Analogy is a wonderful, useful and most important form of thinking, and biology is saturated with it. Nothing is worse than a horrible mass of undigested facts, and facts are indigestible unless there is some rhyme or reason to them. The physicist, with his facts, seeks reason; the biologist seeks something very much like rhyme, and rhyme is a kind of analogy.... This analogizing, this fine sweeping ability to see likenesses in the midst of differences is the great glory of biology, but biologists don't know it.... They have always been so fascinated and overawed by the superior prestige of exact physical science that they feel they have to imitate it.... In its central content, biology is not accurate thinking, but accurate observation and imaginative thinking, with great sweeping generalizations.108-10: But regular biology, as an \\"ology,\\" has to be \\"scientific,\\" and this means in practice that it has to be made dull.... Everything has to be expressed in utterly impersonal terms.... The explicit purpose of this is to be \\"scientific,\\" as science is understood by biologists, but there is also an implicit purpose, which ... consists of inculcating a particular \\"ism,\\" which may be called \\"materialism,\\" or \\"mechanism,\\" or \\"determinism.\\"101 & 103: Evolution ... is really two theories, the vague theory and the precise theory. The vague theory has been abundantly proved.... The precise theory has never been proved at all. However, like relativity, it is accepted on faith.... On getting down to actual details, difficulties begin.107: \\"Survival of the fittest\\" led to \\"nature red in tooth and claw\\" and this is not sufficiently wishy-washy for modern scientists.112: Since biologists deal constantly in analogies, they are easily misled by them.118: Psychologists, like other scientists, pride themselves on being extremely modern, and therefore much better than any group of people that ever were before....127: Psychologists pay lip service to the scientific method, and use it whenever it is convenient; but when it isn't they make wild leaps of their uncontrolled fancy....120: It is perfectly possible to be objective about an angry man, but it is inadvisable, for it will only make him angrier.128 & 130-31: If you want to understand human beings, there are plenty of people to go to besides psychologists.... Most of these people are incapable of communicating their knowledge, but those who can communicate it are novelists. They are good novelists precisely because they are good psychologists.... If one wishes to learn about psychology in a genuine, rather than a scientific, way, by far the best thing to do is to read masterpieces of literature.... Not that literature is taught as if it had anything to do with psychology.... The professional literature men ... are if anything even worse than the scientists.... Really great psychological insights cannot be simply expressed, as so many propositions.... It is unlikely that they will ever be \\"scientifically known\\" ....123: Insight is not the same as scientific deduction, but even at that it may be more reliable than statistics.137: The really important questions in human life are hardly touched upon by psychologists. Do liars come to believe their own lies? Is pleasure the same as happiness? Is it better to have loved and lost than never to have loved, or not to be able to love?140: \\"There's many a true word spoken in jest\\"; scientists are abominably solemn; therefore scientists miss many a true word.141: Science ... must be absorbed in order to inculcate that wonderful humility before the facts of nature that comes from close attention to a textbook, and that unwillingness to learn from Authority that comes from making almost verbatim lecture notes and handing them back to the professor.149-50: The theory that gravitational attraction is inversely proportional to the square of the distance leads by remorseless logic to the conclusion that the path of a planet should be an ellipse .... It is this logical thinking that is the real meat of the physical sciences. The social scientist keeps the skin and throws away the meat.... His theorems no more follow from his postulates than the hunches of a horse player follow logically from the latest racing news. The result is guesswork clad in long flowing robes of gobbledygook.151: A biologist, if he wishes to know how many toes a cat has, does not \\"frame the hypothesis that the number of feline digital extremities is 4, or 5, or 6,\\" he simply looks at a cat and counts. A social scientist prefers the more long-winded expression every time, because it gives an entirely spurious impression of scientificness to what he is doing.156: Such instances of the almost infinite unpredictability of man are known to social scientists, but they are no more affected by them than the asylum inmate is by being told that he is not Napoleon.168-69: Physical scientists probably deserve the reputation they enjoy for incorruptibility and unswerving devotion to pure truth. The reason for this is that it is not worth while to bribe them.169: The \\"truths,\\" if they are truths, of social science are nebulous and inconsistent. Who really knows what he wants at any given moment?173: The problem of war is something more subtle than any social scientist can understand.176-77: But although in theory physicists realize that their conclusions are ... not certainly true, this ... does not really sink into their consciousness. Nearly all the time ... they ... act as if Science were indisputably True, and what's more, as if only science were true.... Any information obtained otherwise than by the scientific method, although it may be true, the scientists will call \\"unscientific,\\" using this word as a smear word, by bringing in the connotation from its original [Greek] meaning, to imply that the information is false, or at any rate slightly phony.177-78: Our advanced and fashionable thinkers are, naturally, out on a wide swing of the pendulum, away from the previous swing of the pendulum.... They seem to have an un-argue-out-able position, as is the manner of sophists, but this is no guarantee that they are right.181: The memory, a child once said, is \\"the thing we forget with.\\"189: There are science teachers who actually claim that they teach \\"a healthy skepticism.\\" They do not. They teach a profound gullibility, and their dupes, trained not to think for themselves, will swallow any egregious rot, provided it is dressed up with long words and an affectation of objectivity to make it sound scientific.195-96: Even the professional scientists themselves take their objectivity the easy way, for they practice their objectivity on objects .... The thing not to do is to look through a microscope at an amoeba and kid yourself that it is going to improve your judgment of social problems. It isn't.... Worse still, it may fool you into thinking you have achieved something when you haven't. In this way, science is not the best thing to study, but the very worst.205-06: And yet, what if the average itself were wrong?... Is it not plausible, and even likely, that most of us have the wrong kind of brain wave?217: Social scientists see things differently from Mr. Huxley, and are not much concerned about freedom or servitude. In \\"Survey of Social Science\\" ... \\"Freedom\\" does not appear in the index. Neither does \\"Liberty,\\" although \\"Libraries\\" is there. However a short discussion of liberty and freedom can be found in the text, under the heading, \\"Regulations.\\""},{"Title":"Science Is a Sacred Cow","review":"I have very mixed feelings about this book. My father grew up in the time period this book was written and from what he has told me, there were scientists at that time who treated science like some kind of infallible religion. For that time period, this book likely was a relevant and important critique.Times have changed though and we have learned much more in the 60 years since this book was written. I went through college and graduate school about ten years ago in a scientific field and the criticisms the author makes no longer apply. From my experience, there are no longer claims of absolute truth made by scientists. All theories are understood to be provisionally accepted. Contemporary scientists welcome challenges to hypotheses, theories, and even the scientific method itself. In fact, it is this challenge, which is open to anyone, that leads to changes making science even more reliable and valid as time goes on.A sacred cow is something beyond criticism. That is the antithesis of what modern science is and asserts to be. From a contemporary standpoint, this book is essentially one big logically fallacious strawman argument, peppered with other logical fallacies. It's interesting reading from a historical point of view, but as a relevant critique of modern science, it is just an anachronism."},{"Title":"Ishi, last of his tribe (California State series)","review":"this story is basicly about how Ishi's tribeis killed, then a lady comes and finds an indian mumbling about, (Ishi), and she takes him back and teaches him English.

IT was the reader's avoidance of using white man's words that proved to be the catalyst. especially in the forth section when ishi is in San Francisco, Kroeber uses the descriptions of the people in ishi's life as ishi would have seen them, avoiding given names. i ultimately had to write a summary on this book so you can imagine how difficult such brevity made that. it wasn't until i had the good fortune of stumbling across a program on ishi featured on a&amp;e that all the missing pieces started to come together. ishi's story was explained to me in a factual way that was both interesting and clear, including the fact that the curator of the museum is none other than kroeber's husband. after watching this i re-read the book, found it to be quite stimulating and then realized how easy it was now that i had the real life information, something i'm sure the average reader will not. that is why i say that it appeals to the inside track, people with a distinct curiosity and knowledge in the subject. for the average reader this book should still be good, despite the lack of fact, but the knowledge isn't that hard to find; i found it on a&amp;e."},{"Title":"Ishi, last of his tribe (California State series)","review":"I purchased this book when it first came out but left it behind when moving.Couldn't be without this wonderful book.

One day an army of white men came and wiped out almost everyone in the Yahi tribe. Only a few Yahi escaped into the forest where they hid themselves. One Native American named Ishi was among them. After days the survivors of the Yahi started dying and at last Ishi was left alone to survive by himself. He grew up. A white lady found him and she took him back to her town to teach him how to speak English. Ishi told lots of facts about his people.I choose this book because I had to read a non-fiction book for my class. I look Ed in my study guide to find a non-fiction book and I saw this title. I went to the library to find this book and I looked at the cover. It was interesting so I picked it.My favorite part was when the white army fought the Yahi tribe.

It showed how Ishi and some other Yahi escaping from their village."},{"Title":"Ishi, last of his tribe (California State series)","review":"I've read this historical novel aloud to both &quot;regular&quot; fifth graders and to Special Education children. All of them have become entranced with Kroeber's wonderful descriptions of day-to-day Yahi life, and with Ishi's tragic story. The fact that Ishi was a real person made it even more tangible to them. This story is undoubtedly romanticized, but it describes life as it probably really was for a small surviving group of California Indians during the encroachment of the &quot;Saldu&quot; (foreigners). They try valiantly to retain the vestiges of their very complex culture, but tragedy inevitibly ensues. The majority of the book describes Ishi's life before he personally came in contact with the White people he has feared and from whom he has hidden during most of his life. It's difficult to find books that accurately describe Native American life pre-contact, in a way that is understandable to young children. I highly recommend this book, especially if you can tie in some of the recent controversy about Ishi's brain, which was removed from his body for study after his death (against his explicit wishes) and was only recently repatriated to Native California people. It's a great lead-in for a discussion about Native People's rights in modern America.Karen Garcia"},{"Title":"Ishi, last of his tribe (California State series)","review":"I first decided to read this book because I was named after Ishi, and I wanted to find out why. When I finally read Kroeber's novel, I was struck with a mixed sense of pride at being able to identify with such an honest, spiritual, and kind-hearted man; disgust at how ignorantly and inexcusably the white man in power treated Ishi's people, and hence has continued to treat Native Americans throughout this country; and awe at the beauty and grace with which Kroeber writes. I am also a high school English teacher in a rural New England town. I teach this novel, and am continually struck by its ability to speak to teenagers who, for the most part, are not aware of this component of American history. Though the novel is partly fictional, as we cannot truly know, for instance, the conversations that Ishi had in the &quot;watgurwa&quot; with his elders as a teenage boy, Kroeber reveals to us a story based on very real, and very human, events. We read about the unwavering respect for the natural world that is so inherent in Yahi culture, and so lacking in modern American culture. We see Ishi's growth from a boy to a man as he takes on the important reponsibilities of feeding and protecting his family. We also watch as innocent Yahi are killed with the white man's &quot;firesticks&quot; so that their scalps can be cut off and exchanged for money. Every American citizen should know what happened to Ishi and his people; for it is American history at its best, and, unfortunately, at its worst."},{"Title":"Ishi, last of his tribe (California State series)","review":"Over the years, I have developed a fascination for history, and Author Theodora Kroeber's story of ISHI, LAST OF HIS TRIBE certainly did not disappointment me.Although this story may be subject to a certain amount of romanticism on the part of the Author, I found this version of Ishi's life easy to read and very enlightening. Kroeber's story of Ishi is written with warmth and sympathy, which gives us adeeper understanding of the harsh treatment of the peaceful Yahi Indians. It provides a glimpse of how Ishi must have thought and felt; about himself, about others, and about the world around him. The Author weaves Ishi's story in a way that makes you feel as though you are there; experiencing what he experienced, struggling as he struggled. Ishi's highly peaceful nature is apparent in his extraordinary capacity towards forgiveness, despite their harsh treatment by the Saldu (white man).I have often wondered how the Indians, especially Indians in the Northern regions, managed to survive the winter. This story provides a great deal of information about their daily life, giving us insight into their extensive knowledge for survival.Smoking and drying of fish and meat, and storing of the y'una (acorn) barely provided them with the sustenance they needed for the winter, yet they managed to survive.The myth that California Indians were a simple and childlike race, living only on what they could dig up from the ground, was certainly discounted with this book. Conversely, the Indians showed great wisdom and deep respect for the land, as well asthe creatures who inhabited it, being careful to preserve the land while effectively living off it. Their knowledge was then handed down from generation to generation, ensuring their success for the future - at least, until the Saldu arrived.In truth, the treatment of the Indians by the Saldu was appalling. Early settlers had little respect for the Indians, forcing them to change their way of life, otherwise die. Sadly, Ishi spent most of his life hiding from the white man - staying downwind, living discreetly and quietly, staying off main trails and covering his tracks - living in fear of discovery. When the rest of his tribe was gone, Ishi's loneliness must have been unbearable. But Ishi was a wise man and a survivor, and he had learned that not all men were evil. His time at the Museum became acceptable - a time of plentiful food, of making friends - but more importantly a time to ensure that the history of his people would not die with him.After reading this book, it was disturbing to discover that Ishi's brain was retained by Berkeley and the Smithsonian Institute for study after his death. Although one might understand the scientific fascination with this last member of the Yahi, this action clearly violated Ishi's own cultural belief about keeping the body whole for cremation, and his personal beliefs should have been respected. It is not surprising that a debate over scientific rights and human rights resulted, and it was nearly 100 years before Ishi's brain was returned to the Indian people, affording him the final peace and dignity that he rightfully deserved.I have been enriched by the story of Ishi. It is a story I hopefuture generations will utilize for studying the life of the California Indian. Ishi's story provides not only his language and culture, but his insight, feelings and experiences. This unique chance to share such a special part of California's past might otherwise have been lost, and I am grateful to those who had the insight to preserve this important piece of history.\`aiku tsub - \\" it is good \\""},{"Title":"Ishi, last of his tribe (California State series)","review":"The book, Ishi: Last of His Tribe, by Theodora Kroebar is a well written book, which deeply describes the life of a Yana Indian. The Yana are one of the last Native America Indian Tribes left in America. She uses great adjectives and indian words to help the readers understand. People who are intrigued by Native Americans, wars, teenage lives, and the true cruelty of human beings will be interested in reading Ishi. Ishi is a young Yana indian boy, on the verge of manhood, getting ready for the responsibilities of having to feed and fend for his family who have supported Ishi his whole life, and have a family of his own. A group of white poeple come to the lands of the Yana and try to capture the land that has belonged to Yana tribes for centuries. The white poeple slaughter the Yana tribes unmercifully, and take the land for themselves. Ishi has to watch the people he has grown up with his whole existance and the ways of his people be demolished, and he is left alone in the world. Ishi teaches people who read it a part of American history which is normally not talked about or read about. The book uses the non-fiction happenings of the Yana and adds fictional situations and turns Ishi into a beautiful story of hate and overcoming obstacles. As I read the book, I felt mixed emotions. I felt proud at being able to identify with Ishi. Ishi was the last of his people, he really did not have much to life for, and no one was left that he could relate to. Everyone feels alone and outcast at some point in their lives, and this book helps people understand and relate to Ishi and how he feels. He was a truthful, deep, spititual person and he was plucked from his life and tossed into a world which was strange and new to him. If any of the readers have ever had to move from one town to another, they know what Ishi is feeling. I also felt hatered towards how the white men ignorantly destroyed this peaceful tribe's way of life without even feeling remorse for their actions. It is horrible how the just slaughtered the tribe, with 'fire sticks' and scalped the Yana for money. It is repulsing how the white men treated the Yana and all the Native Americans, who were on this continent before us and had been living respectably and peacefully, and had such a deep understanding of the land and how to treat it and use it wisely. Ishi was easy to comprehend, with the wordings of Theodora Kroeber. Everyone in America should know about what happened to the innocent Yana tribes and the innocent Yana people, such as Ishi, and see American history for what it really is, and what it really was and what the invading, torturous, white man and his government did to begin the longest war in history (500 years) against the peaceful, loving, spiritual NATIVE AMERICAN INDIAN."},{"Title":"Ishi, last of his tribe (California State series)","review":"This is a great short classic on the fate of a native american in the early 20th century.By 1911,Ishi was the sole survivor of the California gens tribe called 'Yahi'.And now,Ishi was slowly starving to death.His tribe's indian hemp and indian tobacco(nicotiana bigelovii) were renowned among the confederate tribes,on the West coast from SoCal to Oregan.Yet,they were gatherers and hunters,and not masters at farming crops.He was captured by a rancher and a sheriff while trying to eat and hide among some penned cattle.Ishi was jailed and interviewed by a college professor,who specialized in Indian languages and cultures.Ishi was then transferred to a NorCal museum where his stories were recorded.Ishi's people could not accept the kerygmatic beliefs of the European settlers and were bound by the calling of the Great Spirits of Nature.And warned of the natural destruction of the concrete cities that trapped the soul and spirit of the white people.Western christians believe that they are the masters of the ways of Nature and therefore masters of their fate.Yes,the large wood planks protect us from the outside weather elements.Yet,all people must leave this earthly life and return outside to be with Dame Nature.If one does not accept communion with the cycles of Nature,then one is already walking dead. Ishi spent his remaining years at the museum,chipping arrowheads for the public.Was he like a captive 'Elephant-Man' or was he a willing teacher helping people learn about his ethnic shaman traditions.No one knows.This book is short in length,yet immense on Indianism knowledge.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ishi, last of his tribe (California State series)","review":"I liked this book, because firstly this book is a true story, and I was very suprised that a true story would be so good. This book has a lot of details, and the author tries to tell you the sounds that animals and nature makes. He also uses the Yahi tribe words telling you the names of things. The author also drew some pictures when the part of the book was very complicated. The author also uses a lot of words describing the environment so clearly that it seems as if you were there yourself walking beside Ishi and his tribe."},{"Title":"Ishi, last of his tribe (California State series)","review":"I was disappointed to find that I had bought the wrong book. \\"Ishi: Last of His Tribe\\" is not a variant title for \\"Ishi: Between Two Worlds\\". This is a novelisation of Ishi's story aimed at younger readers, and one where Yahi culture is rather heavily idealised. I was looking for some solid anthropology, which, I suppose, is to be found in the other book."},{"Title":"Ishi, last of his tribe (California State series)","review":"I was required to read this book when I took a freshman Anthropology Class many years ago. It is an eye-opening story about human struggle and love of life. Any student planning to attend college should read this book and understand what real difficulty has already been faced."},{"Title":"Ishi, last of his tribe (California State series)","review":"I am ten years old. I had to do a book report on a book about California history. This was the perfect book. I like how every once in a while the author would put in a Yahi word and translate it in the back. I recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Ishi, last of his tribe (California State series)","review":"Ishi came out of the foothills out of loneliness and desperation. He expected certain death, but to his surprise, was embraced by those who knew him. He worked at a meager janitorial job at the University of Berkeley, but he didn't mind. He liked his friends, and enjoyed their company. In exchange of finding him a new 'home', Ishi shared with the museum staff and professors the secrets of his people - he showed them how to knap projectile points, and how his people survived - and best of all, a tantalizing glimpse into his language. He only lived for 5 years after coming out of the wilderness, but we can be thankful he did. He is a lasting symbol of how non-native humans changed the landscape, and drove others to extinction. It's a sad story, but one that needs to be read and cherished."},{"Title":"Berserk, Vol. 6","review":"Hmm... Let's see, where should I start. In volume 5 the drama and story begin to come together a lot more than in the previous volumes, so the tales unfolds at a much faster rate. The key moment in volume 5 is the confrontation with Nosferatu Zodd, who is a key character in the story. Pay close attention to the warning he gives Guts.Okay now on to volume 6... Many things take place that cannot be missed out on if you wish to get into the ever-expanding world of Berserk. For one Guts is given an assassination attempt by Griffith to kill General Julius, the brother of the king, and Guts learns of the Band of the Hawks past from Casca while they are lost behind enemy lines, but I won't explain how they got there or anything. Also, the MOST important moment in this book occurs when Griffith is having a normal conversation with Princess Charlotte, which our protagonist Guts overhears. This conversation sets the wheels of causality/fate in motion which sends Guts on a path other than the one he is currently seeking. He decides to do this to please Griffith. But in the end, it only leads to death, and the climax of the Band of the Hawk story Arc, beginning in Volume 12 and ending in 13/14."},{"Title":"Berserk, Vol. 6","review":"For those who have seen the Berserk television series, very little of the manga so far released has been much of a surprise. This, by no means, is a slight against the original author's work, just a testament to how closely the anime's producers followed the rich story.Volume #6's events may already familiar to fans of the series, but just because they know what is going to happen, doesn't mean it loses its thrill. On the contrary, as I saw events beginning to converge on the climax I knew from the series, I began to get even more interested. The best episodes were those of the last half. The attempted assasination on Griffith, Guts' own assasination assignment, Griffith's courting of the Princess, and Casca's growing connection to Guts are all pivotal to the story.There's a particular scene in the final chapters of the book when Guts is forced to take some liberties in order to save Casca's life that awakens him to her vulnerabilities. In turn, Casca finds her own piece of mind by confiding in him why she joined the Band of the Hawk.Most of Guts' growth as a character is seen through action. The man isn't much of a thinker and understanding his quest for purpose (and, then, vengence) is dependent mainly on the reader's observations of the actions of Guts and those he cares for. To finally get some introspective thought from the man adds much to the overall picture of his life.All in all, a great book... a great series, but be prepared. In the next few volumes, things will come to a head. Men will die, characters you've grown to love may pay the ultimate price, and before one man can ascend to heights unimagined, great tragedy must befall him and those around him."},{"Title":"Berserk, Vol. 6","review":"The tv show destroyed my heart and these novels take the experience even deeper and of course theyve once again ripped out my heart chewed it up and spit it out..YES ITS THAT INDEPTH OF A STORY...I wouldnt recommend these novels to kids and it does have a mature theme to it."},{"Title":"Berserk, Vol. 6","review":"This is a volume that differs considerably from what the series has presented so far. The level of violence and gore drops drastically, and the action is limited to a mission in which Guts acts as a secret assassin and one short battle. This will probably disappoint some people, but on the other hand, those that want to know more about the characters and understand them better, will be greatly rewarded. This is definitely the volume with the highest contribution to the backbone of the story.The majority of the events have to do with court politics and the conspiracies that arise when Griffith is named knight. General Julius hates the leader of the Hawks, and is willing to do whatever is necessary to stop him. This character is straightforward and open in his emotions, but we also find Minister Foss, a Machiavellian character that shows his proficient handling of politics and covert aggressiveness.Other interesting elements of the story have to do with the relationship between Guts and Griffith and also some revelations about Casca's past. More specifically, there is a conversation between Griffith and Princess Charlotte, overheard by Gust and Casca, which provides the reader and the characters with crucial insights into the psyche of Griffith. This in turn serves as a catalyst for Guts to start thinking about his purpose in life.This volume definitely has a slower pace and I would say that it introduces an element of philosophy that was only marginally present until now. Nevertheless, I believe that it serves an important purpose in the overall story, and therefore, will be appreciated by hardcore fans."},{"Title":"Berserk, Vol. 6","review":"In many ways, this manga is killing itself. Don't get me wrong, I love both the Berserk anime and the manga, but in both of them there was a point when everything seemed to slow so much that it was difficult to continue. And it hit this wall at the same time in the manga as the anime. That is during all of the political intrigue and assassinations. Though yes, it adds somewhat to the characters of Guts and Griffith, it's still a severe change of pace from what it had been, and that was a series of tense, bloody battles with both man and beast with Guts or the Band of the Hawk always escaping victorious. Where at one time the volumes of this manga were filled with page after page of sparse dialogue, now the characters actually carry real conversations. Some may say this is good, and so I had thought it would be, but you can still feel the sudden change of pace while reading these moments.Despite all of that, however, this is actually a brief moment that ends during this very volume, though very late into it to be sure. Guts and company get back to doing what they do best, and that is war. Luckily, I knew from seeing the anime that things heat up quickly after the political stuff passes. The promise of the future of this manga is brought back and, despite the setbacks I had (see my reviews of previous Berserk volumes) I know that this is still one of the best manga has to offer. I can't wait to buy the next volumes."},{"Title":"Directing and Producing for Television: A Format Approach","review":"First and perhaps most important, this book is easy to read. It doesn't talk about technical things, but instead goes right to the heart of the matter: what you have to know if you're going to direct or produce a program. It also covers a broad range of shows--almost every format except sports and game shows. For the most part it describes multiple camera television directing, but that's used as a basis for understanding single camera TV. And there are chapters in which single camera television plays a significant role, most notably when Cury goes into documentary and PSA directing. I particularly liked the &quot;who's who&quot; at the facility, which covers the functions of those who work in television--from the executive producer to talent."},{"Title":"Directing and Producing for Television: A Format Approach","review":"As a first time TV show co-producer, I wanted a simple approach on learning the basics of TV directing and producing.

The book not only features a condensation of his best advice but also a series of mind excercises one must bring to the craft in order to keep up. All of this is in addition to the typical textbook description of the directing environment, complete with extensive descriptions of who's who in the studio and in the control room.Although the book concentrates mostly on the multi-camera environment, Cury applies the right mix of film style production instruction as well.Ivan Cury's sections about budgeting and dealing with crews are invaluable and the step by step guides leave no questions unanswered.Cury lays out the ropes and the laws of the land in easy to digest and logical bites, and instead of centering chiefly on the tools, his course concentrates on the creative palette and the canvas in the mind of the director, although this latest edition brings even the seasoned journeyman an update on the latest trends in digital video.Cury makes sure that the inexperienced beginner knows what to expect in the production setting.Outside of attending one of Cury's courses in person I give this book my highest recommendation.Jeffery HaasMansfield TX"},{"Title":"Directing and Producing for Television: A Format Approach","review":"After reading this book, I have become a better producer and a better person.

On reading her work, I now understand why. Her writing is simply excellent. And her scholarship is outstanding. Herein, Mrs. Webster has left us with a beautiful and compelling account of the revolutionary movement from the French Revolution to the Bolshevik, the Chinese, the Indochinese, and the African. According to her excellent account, there is a guiding thread throughout all of this revolutionary activity, illuminated freemasonry. And the author certainly makes a solid case for this, skillfully tying together the writings of Weishaupt with the pronouncements of the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion and the actions of the Soviet state.However, the work has two flaws, which may in fact be related. Mrs. Webster inveighs against Continental freemasonry, but honors Anglo Saxon freemasonry. She also portrays communism as a monstrous evil, but leaves the evil of zionism totally unaddressed. As it seems that Continental freemasonry is most closely affiliated with the communism movement and Anglo Saxon freemasonry with zionism, it may be that these errors are both intentional and related. In any case, this is an outstanding book, which this reviewer highly recommends."},{"Title":"Computer simulations of drinking water quality","review":"Without a doubt, Ms. Webster, an accomplished woman in times when not many did it, is of an excellent breed, the old type, the one that we, at these times, don't meet anymore, not in high frequency, anyway. Erudite, eloquent and wise, not just intelligent, she makes her point pointedly and in an elaborate manner, supported amply by a broad bibliography. I certainly recommend it.One point which I am set to emphasize, is the Jewish question as to their participation and initialization of the World Revolution, an issue that continues to be a thorn in their side stuck there by their vilifiers, those of all kinds, but especially the antisemites and the extreme right, in short their haters, the ones that will use any kind of argument, even the worst or, worse yet, the false, to do that.I would like to bring here a note about this book, written by the American Opinion Bookstore, which is carrying conservative, constitutional and libertarian materials, so no stoogery here. The note is attached to each copy of the book purchased.quote\\"OBITER DICTUMBefore her death in 1960, Nesta Webster corrected errors she had made in earliereditions - mostly due to the limited information then available.

I devoted some pages to the Protocols. Today, however, both the German and Jewish questions have undergone changes which necessitate a different viewpoint.\\" Again, on page 300, \\"...

Don't buy this Bible or any other using this version.If you like the NASB or if you want to try one of the better \\"modern\\" translations then this is an excellent investment. The quality of construction is outstanding. Oxford has done a great job in this regard.For those looking for a comprehensive \\"Study Bible\\" let me advise you to try another. For me, the Scofield is a \\"reference\\" Bible. The notes have more to do with CI Scofield advancing his ideas about dispensationalism. There are many notes related to prophecy because of this and you will find them pretty much in keeping with the current views among evangelicals of the pre-trib camp. Still the notes can be sparse. If verse explanations and background is what you are looking for this is not the Bible for you.If you want a more thorough Study Bible in this particular translation I would recommend the NASB Study Bible by Zondervan (using the same notes from the NIV Study Bible).The advantage to the Scofield in general is the way that the text is layed out. The outlining with the headings (and subheadings) within the text is unparalleled. The topical and cross reference system is also top notch. The indexes to notes and subjects in the back are very helpful.The Scofield has been a mainstay in evangelical Christianity for 100 years because of the insight of CI Scofield that has helped many to understand God's plan through the ages and the overall excellence of Oxford in producing these Bibles. It takes its place right alongside the Thompson Chain as one of the great Bibles of the last century."},{"Title":"The Scofield Study Bible III, NASB: New American Standard Bible","review":"I purchased The Scofield Study Bible III: New American Standard Bible, in Burgundy Genuine Leather. After having used the New Scofield for 32 years, in many ways, this Bible is an improvement. Below are outlined the improvements that I have found in this edition:1. The major weakness of the Scofields of the past has been their reliance upon the King James Version, which is now 400 years old. With this NASB edition, the translation itself is no longer an issue.2. Another problem with previous editions of the Scofields was their binding-which invariably broke under time. This one appears to have a much stronger binding than those previously-issued. The burgundy pigskin cover is stunning in its appearance.3. The layout and overall appearance of the pages themselves is much cleaner and much more appealing-especially with the use of boxes around the summary footnotes for each major doctrine.4. Cross-references are easier to locate in the margins. I'm thankful that the Lockman Foundation allowed Oxford to use their own Scofield cross-referencing system without the clutter that the addition of the NASB references would have caused.5. The Concordance is in a 3-column-per-page format and is a healthy 132 pages long.6. Book introductions and outlines have been expanded and are more detailed.7. And, the Index Of Proper Names from the Old Scofield has been retained. This index gives the meaning, pronunciation, and location for all proper names found in Scripture.I have two criticisms of this Bible:1. While the New Scofield was jam-packed with footnotes, this edition has had some of those footnotes edited out, so they are fewer in number than those found in the New Scofield.2. For the life of me, I do not understand why Oxford issued this as a \\"Red-Letter\\" edition, with the words of Christ in red. I find it hard to take any study Bible with red letters seriously. It was a needless and most-unwanted addition.At $34.64, this Bible is a best-buy-the best of the Scofield Bibles of the past based upon a much better translation, a much-more appealing page format, and in a stronger binding."},{"Title":"The Scofield Study Bible III, NASB: New American Standard Bible","review":"In a world flooded with cheap, poorly constructed Bibles from Thomas Nelson and Zondervan - this Oxford Scofield III NASB is a wonderful example of what Bible Printing should be.1) The Pages are actually folded in sections and sewn into the binding. This process is often referred to as \\"smyth-sewn\\" and ensures that this Bible will stand up to years of use and study. (Thomas Nelson and Zondervan cheaply glue single pages onto a flimsy cardboard backing. This ensures that your Bible pages will fall out after even moderate use of your scriptures.)2) The quality of paper is also excellent and will stand up to prolonged use. The paper is a pleasing white and is supple and flexible to the touch. (The inferior paper used by most American Bible publishers is prone to tearing and discoloration).3) The quality of the Leather cover is also good and is sturdy while still being flexible (Genuine Leather). It should break in nicely over the years. The information that came with my Bible said they use either pigskin or cow hide.4) The Scofield study notes consist of book outlines, chapter headings, in-text maps, verse explanations, and verse chain references. The balance between text and commentary is about 60/40. Those of you used to the Macarthur Study Bible may be a bit disappointed.I also recommend: Scofield III ESV (English Standard Version)Scofield III NKJVScofield III KJVI do not recommend the Scofield III HCSB (Holman Christian Standard Bible) The translation is too watered down like the NIV.

The pages are not too thin and the cover is a nice imitation leather with a zipper. There is a ribbon to mark your page and the text is readable. It is well worth the money."},{"Title":"The Scofield Study Bible III, NASB: New American Standard Bible","review":"-At the outset, recognize that different readers want different Bibles. E.g., a reader may want a coffee-table Bible, a devotional Bible, or a study Bible. The reader may want a Bible that gives the interpretation of a passage (regardless of the passage's literal language); or, the reader may want the Bible to translate the language from Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic accurately, and to make up his or her own mind about the passage's meaning. One reader may be distressed if language favors the male gender; another reader may be distressed if the publisher changes the Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic canon text to make language more gender-neutral.This review assumes the reader wants an Updated NASB Bible. The Updated NASB Bible: (i) translates the language from Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic literally; and (ii) follows the canon text with respect to gender. If the reader wants a Bible that gives a passage's interpretation, rather than the passage's literal translation, that reader may be happier with a Message Bible (or similar Bible), which gives a modern paraphrase of the literal translation. If the reader wants gender-neutral language, the reader may be happier with a New Revised Standard Version, which uses inclusive pronouns.First, the pluses of the Scofield Updated NASB Study Bible.This Bible is beautiful. The leather is of excellent quality. The gold leaf is flawless. The pages are neatly-arranged, and the arrangement renders the Bible very user-friendly. The print is somewhat larger than the print of competing study Bibles, making the Scofield Bible more convenient for those with poor eyesight.Second, the minuses.Where New Testament language quotes a passage from the Old Testament, the NASB translation emphasizes the reference by using a different typeface: small capitalized letters. This is an excellent feature. However, inexplicably, Scofield rarely identifies the Old Testament passage that is being quoted. The reader is left frustrated, knowing that the small-caps language quotes an Old Testament passage, but with no convenient way to locate the passage being quoted (forcing the reader to do what I am doing: have both a Scofield Study Bible and a Zondervan Study Bible in front of him or her, and read the two together-a time-consuming, bulky, and expensive method that calls into question the rationale for buying the Scofield Bible in the first place).Also, the quality of Scofield's footnotes varies wildly. I bought the Scofield Bible because I compared its notes on one particular topic with the notes of competing Bibles, and found Scofield's notes to be more helpful than the others. I assumed that Scofield's superiority on that one topic would carry through the rest of the Scofield Bible.That assumption was incorrect.Some text that desperately needs extensive footnoting has little or none (which is probably how Scofield could produce a study Bible about the same size as a comparable Zondervan Study Bible but with larger print). As one example, Scofield has four notes in Mark explaining the Olivet Discourse; Zondervan has 29.Some notes are poorly-written. As one example, the note describing Judas Iscariot in connection with Matthew 26:14 says Judas was \\"One of the twelve disciples of Jesus who betrayed Him.\\" The note implies that there were more than 12 disciples, 12 disciples betrayed Jesus, and Judas was one of the 12 who betrayed Him. The note should read (simply to be grammatically correct, and without regard to the additional information the note would need in order to be more nearly accurate and complete), \\"One of the 12 disciples of Jesus; the disciple who betrayed Him.\\"Some footnotes contain interpretations that are simply incorrect. As one example, recall the Parable of the Landowner. In that parable, a landowner walls off his property, installs a grape press, and leases the property to vine-growers. The landowner sends a slave to collect the rents; the vine-growers beat him and send him on his way, empty-handed. The same scene is repeated multiple times; the vine-growers beat some of the slaves, and kill others. Finally, the landowner sends his son. The vine-growers kill the son. Plainly, the landowner in the parable is God. The slaves are the Old Testament prophets and John the Baptist. The landowner's son is Jesus. The vine-growers are the Pharisees (and presumably the Sadducees and Herodians). But, the note to Mark 12:1 maintains that \\"the vine-growers . . . are the O.T. prophets and John the Baptist.\\" I.e., according to the note, the Old Testament prophets and John the Baptist-not the Pharisees (and Sadducees and Herodians)-persecuted Jesus and caused him to be crucified.Scofield's sloppiness and errors, such as those described in the examples above, render its notes on less-clear parables, discourses, and other material highly suspect.In short, while the Scofield Updated NASB Study Bible may have some usefulness in one's library, and is certainly beautiful, the serious student would be better off buying a Bible with better references, more notes, and better note scholarship._______________"},{"Title":"The Scofield Study Bible III, NASB: New American Standard Bible","review":"-At the outset, recognize that different readers want different Bibles. E.g., a reader may want a coffee-table Bible, a devotional Bible, or a study Bible. The reader may want a Bible that gives the interpretation of a passage (regardless of the passage's literal language); or, the reader may want the Bible to translate the language from Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic accurately, and to make up his or her own mind about the passage's meaning. One reader may be distressed if language favors the male gender; another reader may be distressed if the publisher changes the Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic canon text to make language more gender-neutral.This review assumes the reader wants an Updated NASB Bible. The Updated NASB Bible: (i) translates the language from Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic literally; and (ii) follows the canon text with respect to gender. If the reader wants a Bible that gives a passage's interpretation, rather than the passage's literal translation, that reader may be happier with a Message Bible (or similar Bible), which gives a modern paraphrase of the literal translation. If the reader wants gender-neutral language, the reader may be happier with a New Revised Standard Version, which uses inclusive pronouns.First, the pluses of the Scofield Updated NASB Study Bible.This Bible is beautiful. The leather is of excellent quality. The gold leaf is flawless. The pages are neatly-arranged, and the arrangement renders the Bible very user-friendly. The print is somewhat larger than the print of competing study Bibles, making the Scofield Bible more convenient for those with poor eyesight.Second, the minuses.Where New Testament language quotes a passage from the Old Testament, the NASB translation emphasizes the reference by using a different typeface: small capitalized letters. This is an excellent feature. However, inexplicably, Scofield rarely identifies the Old Testament passage that is being quoted. The reader is left frustrated, knowing that the small-caps language quotes an Old Testament passage, but with no convenient way to locate the passage being quoted (forcing the reader to do what I am doing: have both a Scofield Study Bible and a Zondervan Study Bible in front of him or her, and read the two together-a time-consuming, bulky, and expensive method that calls into question the rationale for buying the Scofield Bible in the first place).Also, the quality of Scofield's footnotes varies wildly. I bought the Scofield Bible because I compared its notes on one particular topic with the notes of competing Bibles, and found Scofield's notes to be more helpful than the others. I assumed that Scofield's superiority on that one topic would carry through the rest of the Scofield Bible.That assumption was incorrect.Some text that desperately needs extensive footnoting has little or none (which is probably how Scofield could produce a study Bible about the same size as a comparable Zondervan Study Bible but with larger print). As one example, Scofield has four notes in Mark explaining the Olivet Discourse; Zondervan has 29.Some notes are poorly-written. As one example, the note describing Judas Iscariot in connection with Matthew 26:14 says Judas was \\"One of the twelve disciples of Jesus who betrayed Him.\\" The note implies that there were more than 12 disciples, 12 disciples betrayed Jesus, and Judas was one of the 12 who betrayed Him. The note should read (simply to be grammatically correct, and without regard to the additional information the note would need in order to be more nearly accurate and complete), \\"One of the 12 disciples of Jesus; the disciple who betrayed Him.\\"Some footnotes contain interpretations that are simply incorrect. As one example, recall the Parable of the Landowner. In that parable, a landowner walls off his property, installs a grape press, and leases the property to vine-growers. The landowner sends a slave to collect the rents; the vine-growers beat him and send him on his way, empty-handed. The same scene is repeated multiple times; the vine-growers beat some of the slaves, and kill others. Finally, the landowner sends his son. The vine-growers kill the son. Plainly, the landowner in the parable is God. The slaves are the Old Testament prophets and John the Baptist. The landowner's son is Jesus. The vine-growers are the Pharisees (and presumably the Sadducees and Herodians). But, the note to Mark 12:1 maintains that \\"the vine-growers . . . are the O.T. prophets and John the Baptist.\\" I.e., according to the note, the Old Testament prophets and John the Baptist-not the Pharisees (and Sadducees and Herodians)-persecuted Jesus and caused him to be crucified.Scofield's sloppiness and errors, such as those described in the examples above, render its notes on less-clear parables, discourses, and other material highly suspect.In short, while the Scofield Updated NASB Study Bible may have some usefulness in one's library, and is certainly beautiful, the serious student would be better off buying a Bible with better references, more notes, and better note scholarship._______________"},{"Title":"Fuhrerhauptquartier Wolfschanze 1940-1945 (Hitler's Headquarters Wolf's Lair) (German Edition)","review":"I had already reviewed Hitler's Berghof from Arndt Verlag with a great evaluation. This one deserves possibly more attention from the III Reich student. It is an impressive collection of pictures taken at the Fuhrer Hauptquartier in Eastern Prussia during the WWII, during the Nazi attack to URSS in particular (Operation Barbarossa). The photographer was Walter Frentz a Leni Riefenstahl camera operator which had the rare opportunity to take pictures of Hitler and dignitaries in various occasions. The first part of the book is dedicated to dignitaries portraits and this is, as it happens with Hitler's Berghof the less interesting part of the book. But this book contains some marvels. From the half of the book on it begins an incredible sequence of Hitler's pictures never before seen of incredible colour quality. I mean, you simply have to see them with your eyes to believe. Pictures are gatefold sometimes or of big dimensions anyway. When you'll finish to consider the pictures and you'll close the book you'll find yourself begging for more. A really satisying book. If you are interested in the III Reich history as I am, it is simply a must have !!!"},{"Title":"Fuhrerhauptquartier Wolfschanze 1940-1945 (Hitler's Headquarters Wolf's Lair) (German Edition)","review":"This book is a real treasure for the student of World War II and the Third Reich in particular. It contains hundreds of color photographs throughout (many in big size) and some of them are so fantastic that you can imagine you are standing next to Hitler and his staff! World War II was not a black and white era after all! The readers who are looking for a completely fresh photographic look at Nazi Germany, will appreciate also the book \\"Die Deutche Militarelite 1939 - 1945\\", also in the same format and with the same quality of excellent color photos."},{"Title":"Fuhrerhauptquartier Wolfschanze 1940-1945 (Hitler's Headquarters Wolf's Lair) (German Edition)","review":"As a history enthusiast as well as one who appreciates good photography i was very impressed with this. The first third or so of the book is text (albeit in German) along with some smaller black and white photos. The last two thirds is all color and absolutely incredible; history as we're not used to seeing. There are portraits of Knight's Cross recipients which are fairly interesting in their own way however the more fascinating photos, in my opinion are the more mundane ones; the normal activities that took place at this highly secret location in East Prussia. The use of color film was certainly an expensive luxury at this time and very rare indeed. It lends a more intimate view of the individuals and somehow makes it all the more real.If you have an intrest in the subject matter i highly recommend this book. A tad expensive but worth it in my view. Very professionally done. Also, even though the text is in German, there is a sheet included with English descriptions of all the large photos included."},{"Title":"Fuhrerhauptquartier Wolfschanze 1940-1945 (Hitler's Headquarters Wolf's Lair) (German Edition)","review":"in every aspect. Lots of pictures I had not seen before, in color (unusual for the period) and a great deal of information for the interested person in this time of 20th century history.Why am I not giving it 5 stars?Well, the book is a German one and is written in German. With it comes a handy translation to English for the picture's notes and captions but and this is my point, almost a third of the book is text, in German, explaining relevant stuff regarding life in the Rastenburg bunker and HQ. For this text THERE IS NO translation.

It is also the first novel about the Humanx Commonwealth and Church founded by the Amalgamation of humans and the insectoid thranx. And it introduces their adversaries, the reptilian AAnn.In this novel, Philip Lynx is an orphan in Drallar on Moth. He was fairly normal as a poor street kid, but he was also highly intelligent and avidly curious about many things. Flinx has developed some unusual powers as he grows older. He seems to be aware of things that he shouldn't know and he can often sense the emotions of most people.Pip is an Alaspin minidragon, a flying reptile with a deadly toxic venom. A much younger Flinx found her scavenging for food in the garbage and they have been inseparable ever since. Although she is carnivorous, Pip also eats plant foods such as bread, raisins and pretzels.Pip has a highly developed telempathic sense and generally knows whether a person is friendly or hostile. If anyone acts out his hostility, she is likely to spit in their eyes. They usually die within a minute.Mother Mastiff is very old and definitely not getting any younger. She had bought Flinx from the slave coops and raised him to be independent. She had hired various performers to teach him a trade, but they were understandably nervous around Pip and tended to spend little time with him. Fortunately, he has grown into his own unusual trade.In this story, Flinx is performing outside Mother Mastiff's shop, answering questions asked by his audience. After correctly answering the question of how much change is within the pocket of somebody in the crowd, two tough looking characters ask the location of a red-headed man with a treasure map. As Flinx is searching for an answer, a red-headed man suddenly leaves the crowd and the two toughs chase after him.After the performance, Flinx heads toward Small Symm's bar for liquid refreshment and food for Pip and himself. On the way, they hear sounds of a fight in an alley. Flinx is ready to ignore the clash, but Pip flies off to investigate.When Flinx enters the alley, he finds the two toughs hovering over the red-headed man. The toughs are swatting at Pip and then attack Flinx. Defending themselves, Pip and Flinx kill the toughs, but they discover that the red-headed man is already dead. Still, the red-headed dead man is clutching a treasure map in his hand.Sticking the map in his pouch, Flinx continues on to Small Symm's bar. There he takes a job as a guide for Bran Tse-Mallory and Truzenzuzex. He shows the human and thranx around the city and then they enter the inburb where the very rich live. To his surprise, Eint Truzenzuzex shows the guard a card and they are readily admitted. Then they are admitted within the House of Malaika by identifying themselves as highly ranked scholars.Flinx has performed in the tower, but never in the private section where they meet with Maxim Malaika. Bran and Tru speak to Malaika about an excursion that might be very profitable to him. After a while, Malaika encourages Flinx to retire to the pantry and have some refreshments.While eating and feeding Pip, Flinx discovers a partially open door into a bar area and an eavesdropper listening to the conversation in the next room. He kicks the eavesdropper through a vent into that next room. Atha is very angry at Flinx and tries to damage him, but he successfully avoids her blows until Malaika stops the fight.Malaika reminds Atha that she has been told many times before not to eavesdrop on his conversations. Then he sends her to prep his shuttle. When Malaika continues his conversation with Bran and Tru, Flinx is now included. The human and thranx mention a contact who hasn't shown up with data on the target planet and Flinx produces the star map.This tale takes Flinx and the others into the Blight looking for a Tar-Aiym relic. The device is either a musical instrument or a weapon. They don't even know how big it is. Nonetheless, they are on their way, but somebody else is following them.This book is the initial offering by the author. He has gone on to write many other books in other series, but he still comes back to the Humanx Commonwealth (seeQuofum). And he still writes novels about Pip and Flinx, the latest beingPatrimony.Highly recommended for Foster fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of psionic talents, alien technology and high adventure.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"The Tar-Aiym Krang","review":"Meet Phillip Linx known to his friends as Flix,an orphan sold at the Drallar slave markets, taken in by a kind local Mother Mastive.

He stumbles across a map leading to a strange alien artifact on an abandoned world and is swept up in a grand adventure. Foster's Humanx Commonwealth and Flinx and all his companions are fascinating creations. If you like this one, try and find all Flinx's adventures, as well as the Icerigger Series.

It is a must have, if you plan on reading Mid-Flinx and Reunion, A Pip and Flinx Novel. I might add that Alan Dean Foster's Midworld should also be enjoyed prior to reading Mid-Flinx. In all four books, Alan paints a tapestry full of vivid characters, larger than life environments and surprise endings. I highly recommend them!"},{"Title":"The Tar-Aiym Krang","review":"Tar-Aiym Krang was his first novel, and pretty much the reason I've continued reading his stuff.

The main character, Flinx, is one of the best, well rounded, deep characters I have ever read about. The author writes in a manner which is engaging, and incorporates a lot of research, so that the book is believable. Bad things happen to Flinx, and he is not perfect. An excellent series. Equal to Ender's Game, and the Drizz't books, easily."},{"Title":"The Tar-Aiym Krang","review":"The Tar-Aiym Krang was, I believe, the first proper speculative fiction book that I ever read. I bought it used at a sale held by the local library. It set me on the path of a life-long love affair with the character of Flinx and the Commonwealth-- books that I still enjoy to this very day.Although chronologically The Tar-Aiym Krang is the second in the series, it was actually the first novel that Foster ever had published. It is the real introduction to the character of Flinx and his pet snake Pip. The book does an excellent job of introducing us to both, as well as setting up the Commonwealth and its respective species for further exploration.Unlike the Spellsinger series, which I enjoyed at the time but now experience as a kind of guilty pleasure, the Commonwealth novels have aged very well. The races and their roles are well-constructed and the character very well-rounded inhabitants in them.Potential new readers to the series can either start here or For the Love of Mother-Not-- either will do as an introduction."},{"Title":"The Tar-Aiym Krang","review":"I got this book because I got another in the series for free on my Kindle quite a while ago, so I wanted to start from the beginning. It was a very interesting fantasy/science fiction mix with a touch of futuristic allure. Pip and Flinx are very interesting characters. I think most people who like either fantasy or science fiction or both would enjoy this book. I have one warning for people who read this series. The book order for this series is in the wrong order if you want to read the books in the order in which they were published. The correct order can be found at, and I hope this is ok to put in the review, the Fantastic Fiction website at [..] I have alerted Amazon to the series order problem twice, but I haven't gotten a response as of yet as I write this.

It really set in motion one of the greatest series of SF stories ever written. I enjoyed it thoroughly!"},{"Title":"The Tar-Aiym Krang","review":"I'm afraid that I was not as enthusiastic about this book as the other reviewers. I liked For Love of Mother-Not. There was lots of action and some mystery that wasn't fully resolved at the end. For the most part, this book is not a continuation of the issues in Mother-Not. Mother Mastiff plays a small role at the beginning of the book and is then left behind. I don't know if this means that she's bowing out of the series because I'm reading it in order. I thought she was a good character, however, so I hope she makes her way back in. There was also very little new information on the backgrounds of Pip or Flinx. Maybe it won't be possible to do more with Pip's background, but it seems like there could be more there. The culmination of this book gave a hint of a possible future book on Flinx's background, but not much more. I like action, and there was surprisingly little of it here. It was almost like a transition building up to a later book, but the transition itself was kind of disappointing."},{"Title":"The Tar-Aiym Krang","review":"The Tar-Aiym KrangThis is the second book in the Pip and Flinx series and, in it we find Flinx starting his career as a star traveler.

Depending on what review site you visit, this is either the 2nd or 3rd book in the Flinx and Pip series. The book takes place in the Humanx universe.We are first introduced to Flinx, the ethical boy thief, and his mini-dragon Pip in the city of Drallar on the planet Moth. Flinx is under the care of Mother Mastiff, and he spends his days scavenging around the city and putting on shows displaying his ability to \\"read minds\\". While visiting a bar, Flinx is introduced to two visiting scholars, Bran Tse-Mallory (a human)and Truzenzuzex (a thranx). They ask him for a tour of the city, which he does. He winds up in a wealthy area of the city, where they meet the merchant Malaika at his house. Bran, Truz, and Malaika talk about a long dead alien race, Tar-Aiym, and a planet that was in their control. Supposedly, their is a device of immense power that is there for the taking. Along with Malaika's associates, they all leave the planet Moth for the distant Tar-Aiym world. On the way, they encounter the reptilian race, the AAnn, who try to capture them. Once they get to the planet, they have more adventures and action as they try to discover what the Krang is.Alan's writing is very descriptive, and brings the characters to life.

I don't think the Flinx books are actually an ordered series, rather they are just stories of Flinx and his minidrag Pip (a minidrag is a kind of lethal flying snake). In The Tar-Aiym Krang we are introduced to Flinx, a mind-reading orphan who lives off of his street act (and a little crime). Through some believable coincidences, Flinx ends up helping two scientists and a trader as they search for an ancient artifact, the Tar-Aiym Krang. Although the fact of the Krang is a little bit of an anti-climax, this book is a fine story and is also notable as the introduction of the entire Humanx Commonweath that Foster has returned to over and over."},{"Title":"The Tar-Aiym Krang","review":"Judging by the other reviews here I'm clearly missing something.I came to this book expecting an easy to read Sci-Fi pulp story, hopefully entertaining, at best uplifting. I almost got what I was expecting, but not quite.To it's credit, it held my interest enough to actually finish it, and the internal logic and scientific concept was consistant and well-thought out enough to be believable. That's about the most positive thing I can find to say about it.As I began to read I was so stricken with the clumsiness of the dialogue and the two dimensional gimmickry of the characterisation that I assumed this must be a very brave (and lucky to be published) first novel. Not sure if that's the case, but my hopes that there might be a powerful or clever twist that had contributed to it's acceptance by the Publishing House were sadly not to be realised.There is a sense throughout that it might all be worth it, but the ending is so weak as to leave me resenting the time spent ploughing through the final chapters, misprints and all. I was amazed to find on completion that the author has gone on to pen a whole series based on the characters found in this book, each of which can be reduced to one 'interesting' personality trait.It is littered with the sort of literary rule-breaking that requires an artist of much greater stature than this for justification. For instance, I accept that his use of dialogue so clumsy as to be (literally) sometimes in fictional alien tongues was an attempt to give his conceptual hybrid human/alien language an exotic feel... unfortunately it succeeded, in my case, only to irritate.Probably the most interesting character is introduced in detail early in the story, only to play no further role. The Sci-Fi cliches come thick and fast.A strong ending could, perhaps, have excused the weakness of the prose, but this, unfortunately, was simply not forthcoming.I don't normally find it useful to contribute such negative reviews, but amidst the shining praise found here, I really felt there needed to be at least one dissenting voice to warn to potential first time reader."},{"Title":"Eyes of the Jaguar","review":"I found myself buying this book to gain a separate insight on a pilgrimage through the sacred sights of Peru... as I have done this process twice myself.I was severely disappointed when three chapters into the book the only impression I had was that this author was more interested in going on about her guide in this journey than in the journey itself.I tried to keep reading, but couldn't, so I flipped to the end to see if maybe it had gotten better and there was an insight there that I would find worth reading the book for, but no, the final sentence had her looking back to the guide, instead of to herself or the mountains or the earth any of which I would have found the book worth reading for."},{"Title":"Eyes of the Jaguar","review":"I found myself buying this book to gain a separate insight on a pilgrimage through the sacred sights of Peru... as I have done this process twice myself.I was severely disappointed when three chapters into the book the only impression I had was that this author was more interested in going on about her guide in this journey than in the journey itself.I tried to keep reading, but couldn't, so I flipped to the end to see if maybe it had gotten better and there was an insight there that I would find worth reading the book for, but no, the final sentence had her looking back to the guide, instead of to herself or the mountains or the earth any of which I would have found the book worth reading for."},{"Title":"Eyes of the Jaguar","review":"This is one person's personal story about her journey to Peru with Alberto Villoldo, a well known teacher of Peruvian shamanism.

Fascinating to learn how the nobilty actually became entrapped by their own separation from the peasantry and in essence bacame slaves themselves to the Court by the pensions they accepted from the Crown that itself was bankrupt even though it levied ever heavier taxes on the workers.Can there be parallels to today's social economic systems that pay out to government workers?

It indeed is a short history of France from medieval times to late 1800's.

Juliana had her own opinion of the infamous laird and it wasn't favorable. Her mother lay dying, and with her labored breath begged Juliana to see it done - repay the debt and carry a missive to the laird that would hopefully right a wrong committed so many years ago.About the same time Robbie MacKenzie, the sole heir to the Black Stag clan, after a ten-year absence of sowing his wild oats, was on his way home to dutifully marry his betrothed from a rival clan. Along the way, he happened upon and was struck dumb by the vision that was Juliana MacKay. As it happened, Juliana had been struck herself - in the head - while trying to save a drowning ewe. Unfortunately, the blow to her head had knocked her senseless and removed most of her memory as to where she was going, and why.With an intense sensual attraction between the two, no memories not even of her name, and with the obligations of honoring a betrothal deemed to guarantee peace between clans - these two star-crossed lovers would have to choose between honor or passion and love.--- This was such a sensually ROMANTIC read and not because of the physical act, but the foreplay of the romance and Robbie's (God Bless um!) honorable intentions - he embodies all the absolute stuff a dream lover is made of! Handsome, kind, oodles of personality and patience beyond measure are just a few adjectives one can use to describe Robbie. One simply had to admire Robbie as he discovered his betrothed's duplicity and dealt with her and her rather hedonistic idiosyncrasies so well. Juliana was also a refreshing heroine in that, even though her memory was lost, and with her passions so engaged, she would still hold on to her ideals and not succumb to passion with a betrothed man. Along with an abundance of secondary characters, as well as the visually enticing imagery of the geography, mood, feelings and magic of the Highlands the author is brilliant at invoking, the reader is sure to become a devoted fan of Welfonder with this latest entry!

Her tales are vivid; her plots poignant. In ONLY FOR A KNIGHT, Robbie and Juliana come together, sharing a powerful love, undaunted by what they must overcome to marry. Once again, the reader is treated to characters from past books, all coming together to round off a wonderful romance. I am a devoted fan!"},{"Title":"Only for a Knight (Warner Forever)","review":"I have read all of her other books except Master of the Highlands and found this one to be my least favorite. There just wasn't ever a moment when the main characters weren't going to get together. Robbie's bride-to-be, the main problem just disappears! Her character did not seem like the type to just run off with her lover after ranting through out the rest of the book on how she is going to destroy Robbie. Love Welfonder's other books, this one just didn't live up to my expectations."},{"Title":"Only for a Knight (Warner Forever)","review":"It is not just the heart beating inside a man that can define love, but the moment destiny touches the heart. They speak to each other and forge the lifeline of our future. This is a continuation of the MacKenzie Clan Saga. Now it is the Black Stag's son, Robbie, who is stepping into manhood and marriage.After ten years away from home, Robbie has grown into a man of honor, chivalry and a sexual creation by the course of nature. It is time for Robbie MacKenzie to return home to Eilean Creag and his waiting betrothal to a rival clan. A chance encounter a long the way throws Robbie and JulianaMacKay together. Juliana has lost some of her memories caused by a kick to the head by an ewe. Robbie will take charge and take home this virtual stranger. This sexual charged and chance meeting will complicate and forever alter the destiny of their lives. For when two halves of a whole connect, neither can traverse its spell.ONLY FOR A KNIGHT is by Sue-Ellen Welfonder. Ms. Welfonder has created a tale that speaks to our hearts of a time-honored past and simpler ways of mankind. A time when a man's word was his bond, and honor was dying for one's clan. Ms. Welfonder's poignantly artist pen has drawn a majestically riveting story. With evoking clarity to which the angels in heaven might weep forth. The premise is fresh and thought provoking. Ms. Welfonder never ceases to amaze this reader with her exceptional writing forte, which is bestowed on this tale!The characters are rich in detail and depth. You will be drawn ceremoniously into their strong personalities and folklore. Robbie is torn between duty and honor. Sometimes what seems wrong at first glimpse can be the rightful calling through the eyes of another. He will have to dig deeply to find the true answers to why his heart aches. There is something important that Juliana must accomplish, if only she could remember. Juliana will have to deal with partial memories to piece her life back together before she can feel complete.ONLY FOR A NIGHT is the sequel to Devil In A kilt, along with Knight In My Bed and Bride Of The Beast, with Wedding For A Knight rounding out this Scottish tales series. Ms. Welfonder has again writing a wonderfully entertaining story, that you can return to just by opening the book!Reviewed by Janalee Ruschhaupt, 2005Courtesy of Love Romances www.loveromances.com"},{"Title":"Only for a Knight (Warner Forever)","review":"In 1344 after staying away from home for ten years to avoid marriage to Lady Ephemia Macleod, Robbie MacKenzie heads home to Kintal because honor demands he weds the woman. At the same time, the mother of Juliana MacKay is dying, but she insists that her daughter pay back the debt they owe Duncan \\"Black Stag\\" MacKenzie. Although Juliana does not believe Duncan deserves a cent, she gives a death bed vow to do so.Robbie rescues Julian from drowning in a loch. She does not remember who she is and why she is traveling. He assumes she is a peasant due to her rough hands, but a thief too because she carries a cache of coins. As they journey together, they fall in love. However, at Kintal, as Juliana regains her memory, besides honor, Robbie learns that even if Duncan willingly risked the wrath of the Macleods, he explains to his son he cannot marry his beloved because they are first cousins.Sue-Ellen Welfonder's latest medieval romance is a terrific tale starring a star-crossed couple whose love for one another seems helpless because of alliances and blood. The story line is filled with a feel for the era, but is driven by the cast including the return of the Mackenzie clan. Although the rival fianc&eacute;e is too nasty to matter even if the affronts by her future spouse and her future mother-in-law are blatant, fans will take delight with this fine tale that clears up many of the threads from previous novels.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Only for a Knight (Warner Forever)","review":"If I could give this book a 10 I would....Sue-Ellen just getsbetter with every book she writes. Oh My God!...I was in Scotland in every page of the book. Her love of Scotland comesout in every written word. It is so AWESOME how she can make youfeel the wind on your face and smell the gorse and heather, smell the peat fires. As I predicted with her very first book, she is a writer to watch and read. I shall not miss a single book of hers as I get goose bumps just reading them as I have a love of Scotland myself.I don't think any one would be disappointed in reading this book and I so look forward to her next one. I was really awaiting Robbie's story and was extremely pleased with her results. Fell in love with Robbie and Julianna, and Kenneth too. Would like to see his story also."},{"Title":"Only for a Knight (Warner Forever)","review":"Juliana Mackay reluctantly makes a deathbed promise to her mother...she will travel to Eilean Creag Castle and repay the Black Stag laird, Duncan MacKenzie even though she doesn't think he deserves their hard earned siller and she doubts that anything she does will change her opinion of the man she loathes. This promise is going to change Juliana's life in ways she never imagined.Robbie MacKenzie is returning home after an extended absence. It is time that he marry his betrothed who comes from a rival clan. When he comes upon a lass in danger of drowning...he jumps in and rescues her. He's not expecting to find her attractive or desire her as he has no other. Will he do the honorable thing and marry his betrothed or will he let passion sweep him away?Now this is a romance! Robbie is without a doubt one of my all time favorite hero's and the attraction that burns between him and Juliana is scorching. As a result this is a very sensual read...not because of the sexual content...but because of the passion Ms. Welfonder has managed to pour into these two characters. Juliana is a perfect complement to her knight. Ms. Welfonder will draw you into her make believe word from page one...and entertain you for the balance of the read. If you are looking for a strong romance look no further!"},{"Title":"Only for a Knight (Warner Forever)","review":"I love Ms. W...this is only the third book (the last of this Trilogy) that I've read...but I'm realllly lovin' her style. Ahkay, so I loved how this story began - - it captures and reels your attention in from the first page. And what a magnificent plot!! This Author sets a slooow pace and takes the reader on a glorious journey in technicolor Scotland. Each character(s) personality traits are ingrained into the readers' mind so lovingly and thoroughly, one cannot help but to connect to them. Before the reader is even aware what has happened, the Author has you enthralled with the story as it deepens and thickens.The crux of this story unfolds finding Duncan MacKenzie's son and heir, (Robbie), on his way home after being gone for 10 years earning his Knighthood. Robbie is on his way home to marry his betrothed, Euphenia MacLeod (a real psychobutt shrew)...except on his journey home he rescues and saves his true Bride...Juliana MacKay, a red headed firebrand peasant girl.This story is full of no-holds-barred, intimate (and secretive) moments. The intimate scenes are steamy and unfold with explicit adjectives. This is basically Robbies' story of finding his Bride (although a small \\"visit\\" with Duncan, Linnet, Sir Marmeduke and his wife, Caterine as well)... I only wish there were more details of Juliana MacKay during the story instead of waiting until the end....but I guess that would spoil the plot!Sometimes predictable, but not blatantly or painfully so as to ruin the enjoyment of the plot.The downside to this story is Euphenia MacLeod's weak agenda for Robbie and all MacKenzies. And her exit out of the story is unfinished. It just leaves the reader hanging.Other than that, I highly recommend this third installment of Ms. \\"W's\\" Scottish Trilogy."},{"Title":"Only for a Knight (Warner Forever)","review":"I recommended to anyone who hasn't read Sue-Ellen Welfonder work. She is a great author and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Only for a Knight (Warner Forever)","review":"I was so disappointed. I love Welfonder's books and was eagerly waiting for this one. I found the story simplistic and not engaging. In addition, some parts of the storyline which could prove to be entertaining are just ended with no drama. What can I say? Very boring."},{"Title":"Only for a Knight (Warner Forever)","review":"This book is so boring and hard to follow the story. I don't recommend this one at all. My first time reading this author and I don't think I will try her other books. No dialogs at all..."},{"Title":"Only for a Knight (Warner Forever)","review":"What a wonderful treat! My first exposure to Sue-Ellen W, but definitely not my last. How I love that the hero is good natured through and through. The dialogue felt a little forced at times, but the scenes of the hero wooing the heroine were truely arousing and touching. I also liked that she gave us a peek at the villain's love life as well - what fun! And anyone who can insert a character as charming as Mungo has my vote! Write on!!"},{"Title":"Only for a Knight (Warner Forever)","review":"I just read this book after reading another Welfonder \\"Knight\\" book and even though I gave this book a shot thinking the other book was maybe not her best(new author to me). These books do too much talking of lore,demons,dragons and atmosphere and not nearly enough about the main characters. I would read another Welfonder book, but there would be nothing else available and I'd be prepared to turn past the overdone descriptions. Read with caution."},{"Title":"Only for a Knight (Warner Forever)","review":"Sir Robbie was first introduced as a small child in Devil in a Kilt. In fact, his existence and Duncan Mackenzie's desire to prove that he was indeed his child is how he became wed to Linnet. Moving on...No longer a small child, Robbie has been gone from home for 10 years now. He is expected to return to marry Euphemia Macleod whom he has been promised to since childhood. Though he does not know her, he has no desire to marry her. When he lays eyes on the beautiful lass about to drown, he knows then that it will be hard to honor his word... Though her gift has not been strong these past years, Linnet (who is miles away!) senses that this bonny fiery hair maid is to be Robbie's wife.Juliane Mackay suddenly awakens in the arms of a charming stranger, none other than Sir Robbie MacKenzie. Something is wrong, why she can't even remember her own name! She does not know of her destination or the circumstances of how she came to meet this handsome stranger. Although she is unable to recall her past, she has a feeling that her journey was of great importance, but what could it be? Slowly she starts to piece her memory back together only to find that perhaps it would have been best to forget...Lady Euphemia is fighting mad that Robbie has ruined her life. Plain in looks with no womanly curves her anger in increased by her soon to be husbands late arrival. Already she hates Eilean Creag castle, why she can barely breath with all of the smells swarming around the castle. Hence the reason she was put into Robbie's old chamber (from book 1 which we learn is tiny). She hates Robbie, but why? She has never met the poor man. She constantly complains and has more a wild side that I believe is best read by you :-)Robbie has but to do one thing, find a reason not to marry Euphemia. He is willing to do what it takes. He has taken his concerns to his father who won't hear of it. Now, he must take matters into his own hands. There MUST be a way to convince her not to wed him. Little does he know, luck is on his side.With love strong in the air there shouldn't be anything to keep them apart. Sigh, There is one other threat. Perhaps Juliana's journey held important information that could make or break her relationship with Robbie. Oh, only if she could remember!This was a good story but not better than the prior novels. More romance than anything. There was not much danger. Not the type of danger/betrayal that are usually hr subplots. At first, the lack of action bothered me. Then I really started to adore Robbie and Juliana. I do wish that Robbie would have had more of a battle reputation. A nice read!"},{"Title":"Only for a Knight (Warner Forever)","review":"As I read throught the story I kept expecting something to happen. Well it didn't. It wasn't all that I expected it to be. Don't get me wrong, the story was very well written and the characters well liked but there wasn't that spark that draws you in. At least there wasn't for me. Others might find it more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Only for a Knight (Warner Forever)","review":"Robbie MacKenzie is the only son and heir of Duncan MacKenzie, the Black Stag of Kintail. After a ten-year absence, he's on his way home to Eilean Crag Castle where he's expected to marry his betrothed, Euphemia MacLeod. His betrothal is not a love match. She's the daughter of the Laird of a neighboring clan. His marriage is meant to form an alliance so that the two clans can live in peace.Juliana MacKay has made a deathbed promise to her mother. She is supposed to repay Duncan MacKenzie for all the support he's given her mother. While Juliana is not happy with this edict, she obeys her mother and leaves her side to deliver the funds and a missive to Duncan.Robbie MacKenzie finds Juliana MacKay standing waist deep in a black-watered lochan from where she'd rescued a sheep. In the rescue, she received a blow to the head by the ewe's flailing hooves and was now in need of help herself. Robbie rescued her unconscious body from the water and in the process loses his heart to the flame-haired lass. He vows that he will have her for his very own. But there is still the matter of his betrothed. Will he be able to extricate himself from his father's promises? Juliana's suffering a memory loss due to the blow to her head, but she knows she's no light-skirt, that she was on a mission to repay somebody for her mother, and a name, Kenneth. She has no idea who she is, but she's not about to trust this knight with lust in his eyes. She's definitely not thrilled with him forcing her to accompany him on his journey to his home. She doesn't remember why she doesn't wish to visit Eilean Creag Castle or even why the MacKenzie name disturbs her, but Robbie isn't giving her much of a choice.ONLY FOR A KNIGHT gives Sue-Ellen Welfonder's readers an opportunity to revisit well-loved characters from earlier books. Robbie is the hero's little boy from DEVIL IN A KILT. The various conflicts kept me glued to the pages through the entire book and then none of them turned out the way I would have expected. All of the characters are larger than life and just as wonderful to read about this time around, as they were in previous books. I was fascinated with Juliana's brother, Kenneth. He wasn't actually in the book until the end but he was talked about a lot. His story can be found in UNTIL THE KNIGHT COMES.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)"},{"Title":"Only for a Knight (Warner Forever)","review":"Toward the end two major dilemmas were resolved too quickly and easily. I felt the author was in a hurry to finish the book and didn't want to take the time to show interactions with others, twists and turns, etc . In one case a 3rd party comes up and asks for something which solves a problem. In another case, someone touches a jar and has a vision which solves a problem. Other than that, it was an ok book, some interesting ideas, but not great."},{"Title":"Only for a Knight (Warner Forever)","review":"Perhaps Scottish romances are just not my thing - although I love Kinley McGregor books - so maybe it is just the style of writing of Welfonder. But, I just found this book very hard to get into. There was just too much mystic talk, talk of lore and potions and fantasy for my taste. There was also too much discriptions of thoughts and feelings and not enough dialog and real action between the characters in the book. And the betrothed of Robbie was truly a strange one and I just never got into why she had such real hate for him or what her whole deal was hiding away in the tower plotting her revenge on him and then she goes with her Big Red. Very odd plot I felt. And Robbie and Juliana did seem to have a romantic connection but it was not delved into enough to my taste. The sizzle in this book was luke warm at best. I just did not see what others that rated this book so highly did. I am not sure I I will read other books by this author!"},{"Title":"Only for a Knight (Warner Forever)","review":"I also was somewhat disappointed with this book. It was too simplistic. Although every girl ever born wants her man to stand up for her and their relationship, I thought that it happened too fast and too soon in this book. I'm not really a believer in love at first sight, but I enjoy books about it. However, it usually takes the man a while to find out WHY he loves the maid, so the fact that Robbie never wavers from wanting Juliana (until questions concerning bloodlines interfere), it was just too simple.Another thing I noticed that led to my disappointment with the book, was the DISAPPEARANCE of Euphemia, Robbie's perverted bethroted. After expounding on Euphemia's perversion and her hatred for Robbie, the author drops that storyline too simply. Her lover, and accomplice in crime, walks up to her betrothed, Robbie, and tells the man that he's willing to take her off his hands. For a reference from Robbie, he will remove the wicked chit from the area and Robbie is released from having to marry her, having to claim... etc. (don't want to give away everything). She's even given us Euphemia's thoughts about Red - He may be big, a LOT bigger than her, and is equally perverted, but she believes him to be BENEATH her status. I looked for more of the hints the author gave that Euphemia had some kind plot to do away with Red once she achieved her revenge on Robbie. But we don't get to find out about that. The two disappear and never show up again. The character of the villianess is drawn out for the reader, only to peter out in a blink of the eye.Weak plot, too-good-to-be-anywhere-near-true softy of a male lead, but a quick somewhat pleasant read."},{"Title":"Only for a Knight (Warner Forever)","review":"I'm mystified that this book got published. It isn't even a novel! There's no story, no plot, no characters, and no dialogue. I wish that were an exaggeration, but it's not. The only possible \\"plot\\" -- a rival affianced bride already awaiting the hero's homecoming -- is \\"resolved\\" (with a third of the book left to go) in an offhand, third-party conversation of a single page.The heroine is the usual virgin who, bizarrely, manages to find herself naked in front of the hero at every meeting and who behaves like a sexual professional. Medieval times were graphic and bawdy, and the heroine would have been more believable if she'd talked a good show, yet acted a bit unsure of herself. Instead, she \\"thinks\\" like a coy Victorian virgin: her arousal is perpetually referred to as \\"tingles\\". \\"He was causing such delicious tingles in *that part of her.*\\" (The italics are the author's, whose only way of referring to the genital area is as \\"*that part of her*\\".)[...] she labors under the mistaken idea that if she uses a wrong word (a malapropism), she's somehow being medieval. Ex: \\"she wanted an entirety of such moments.\\" Eternity, perhaps? But no, \\"entirety\\" sounds more medieval!All in all, this book deserves mention only for two reasons: 1) it is a useful compendium of every cliche of the genre, and 2) if you're teaching a course in how *not* to tell a story, this is your textbook. Oh yes, there's a third: There's a bare-chested *man* on the cover -- after all the descriptions of the heroine's mammary endowments, that, at least, is refreshing."},{"Title":"Narratology: An Introduction (Longman Critical Readers)","review":"The introduction to this useful collection gives an overview of the history of narratology (nearly forty pages and very readable and informative). After that, the editors have collected important texts, split into five sections: Narrative Structure: Fabula, Story, Text; Narratology and Film; Post-Structuralist Narratology.Of course you won't find everything you ever wanted to know about narratology in this book. It is, however, a very good introduction, because you get to read texts by nearly twenty people who wrote on narratology (and they include nearly everyone who is anyone in narratology), and if you find what they have to say interesting, you can read up on that. You also get a very good summary of the ideas and the history of narratology which helps you see and understand similarities to and differences from other literary theories you may know.If you are interested in a more linguistic approach to narrative, you might want to read Michael J.

Of course knitting and crochet stitches are taught in the first half, and I give the book 2 stars for treating crochet equally, and also for showing continental or left-hand held kntting as the default style since this is very rare (and how I now think some people are better off learning).There are other inconguencies. In a chart on page ix, there is a \\"what you will and won't find in the book\\" list and first under the \\"will\\" is \\"XL patterns because big is beautiful dammit\\". There are a lot of things wrong with this; XL is hardly plus sized for one thing, but more importantly, *no XL patterns actually appear in the book*. All garments are sized S (M,L). Period. On the other side of the cahrt, is what you will not find and that includes, \\"a D-cup bikini because its beyond the bounds of sanity and decency.\\" Excuse me? In the crochet bikini pattern featured later in the book, this is again reiterated. How much \\"pattern liberation\\" is that? I would call that just plain offensive and ignorant. The author should check out Knitty, the free online knitting magazine as well as White Lies Designs who sell many patterns for women with D-cup and above, and all are sexy, sane and decent. In the techniques area we are introduced to a technique called \\"Intarisa\\" which is actually *stranded* knitting. Sigh. Keep in mind these are only the errors I found upon the first day of owning this book.As far as the patterns go, most are accesssories and terribly underwhelming such as the same (inadvertantly) nipple-shaped hat over and over but called something else each time. Ponchos, bags, scarves etc. and crocheting around clogs. Nothing terribly new here. Many of the designs shown will inevitably end up on the blog, \\"You Knit What?\\"The book gets kudos only for treating crochet as compatible with knitting, which it is and I would like to see more books and patterns which combine the two. It might be a book to learn to knit and crochet with since the stitches are shown in photographs which are quite clear. There is nothing here for the advanced knitter or crocheter, and maybe little if anything for the intermediate."},{"Title":"Knitter's Lib: Learn to Knit, Crochet, and Free Yourself from Pattern Dependency","review":"This book has instructions and patterns for both knitting and crochet, but it is much more crochet oriented. That's not exactly what I expected from a book called Knitter's Lib. It may be just the thing for people who are interested in both, but just be aware that the author seems much more into crochet.The style of the patterns is very narrow, they're mostly for people who have a trendy, urban fashion sense. Some of the most memorable patterns are the knitted skater pants, a mesh skirt, and yet another bikini top pattern.There is a short introduction to knitting and crochet and a technique chapter. Though a lot of techniques were given, I didn't find much that would really help me use them together and create my own patterns. That was a disappointment, because the book description sounds like it would have more design help.I also dislike the very wordy way that the patterns are written out. It makes them hard to skim and all the extra text would be distracting when trying to work from them. The book says that they're written out that way to explain why certain things in the pattern are done, but it just seemed like a lot of unnecessary text to me. I'd think that all that extra stuff would confuse a new knitter or crocheter and frustrate a more advanced one.I would not recommend this book for beginners. Some of the shortcuts and tips that the author gives are pretty bad advice, they encourage knitters and crocheters to cut corners and do some things in a quick, easy, and sloppy way. One thing that I really disliked was the suggestion to crochet seams instead of sewing them. Yes it's faster, and yes most of us hate finishing. But crocheted seams are much less flexible than knitted ones and they just don't look as nice. If you spend a lot of time knitting a beautiful project, wouldn't you want to put as much care into finishing and make it look as nice as possible?If you're looking for a knitting book with instructions and hip patterns, check out Stitch 'N Bitch. I'm not a very good crocheter, so unfortunately I don't have a crochet book recommendation."},{"Title":"Knitter's Lib: Learn to Knit, Crochet, and Free Yourself from Pattern Dependency","review":"The author says that she avoids body hugging shapes because they're just not urban. OK. Fine. We'll ignore, for a moment, that more fitted pieces LOOK better (even on plus sized folks!) and boxy shapes make you look BOXY.She also writes that she prefers to start with ALL the stitches and decrease down because increasing (in knitting) is just too darn hard. What?She calls fair isle or stranded knitting \\"intarsia,\\" which it's not.For a \\"knitter's\\" book, there is a TON of crochet. And not just as accents or edging, but whole projects made with only crochet.Skip this one.

Upon picking up this book, I was expecting to learn the magic of knitting garments without the servitude of following a pattern. Instead, I was given a lesson on how to crochet (as well as how to knit) and advised to make everything big and oversized. I detest big and bulky. I find it to be the most unflattering, even when \\"worn in the city,\\" whatever that means. The \\"humorous\\" parts seemed more demented to me, invoking more \\"ehs?\\" and \\"ewwwws\\" than \\"ha, has.\\" At times, I find the tone to be admonishing, almost impatient with the reader if one has not followed her instructions verbatim earlier in a recipe (which is in direct conflict with the book's title again, and I can see why she's not a math teacher anymore....) The math parts that don't make any sense that are carelessly thrown in are hard to understand and slow things down with confusion and many rereadings.There are a few cute things to crochet in here, however this book is in desperate need of a new title and an edit job to get rid of the too many \\"I's.\\" I certainly didn't feel very liberated after reading this book."},{"Title":"Knitter's Lib: Learn to Knit, Crochet, and Free Yourself from Pattern Dependency","review":"It's too bad about the knitting title on this book, because I think a lot of knitters will be unsatisfied with it and a lot of crocheters will miss it.

She explains the theory of how things are formed in crochet (stitch size, proportions, shaping things like that), which I found very helpful. She also explains how to get different effects, in a general way so that they can be applied to anything. And she goes through a few patterns and explains WHY things are done a certain way. I found this very informative. I don't have the attention span to actually make something from a pattern, so being able to apply the concepts in this book to wing it when I make my own stuff is extremely valuable to me.

Most are pretty, happy and colorful (not garish), and simple enough to tackle especially for a knitter like me who is just learning to crochet and would like to learn how to incorporate crochet and knitting together. The author teaches you--through doing her patterns--how, why, and where to add crochet when it is part of knitting. Second, the author walks you through each pattern and explains why and what you are doing. She writes well and gives you clear step-by-step directions.Her patterns are in the spirit of Stitch 'n Bitch though her patterns and color choices are prettier. Her designs remind me also of Joelle Hoverson's Last Minute Knitted Gifts. Yes, the patterns are simple and happy, mostly accessories, which I love! For a beginner crocheter, this is exactly what I need to start on--something small yet beautiful enough to inspire me. Some of my favorite patterns are: the Beach Bandanna, 1920's Cloche Hat (pretty), Kremlin Beret (original), Fargo-with-a-Kiss-Hat (fun), Bow-Wow Cowl, Hippie Bikini Top, Lara's Muff, All-Organic Tote Bag, and His and Her Clogs.

Kelly, Liturgical Press, Collegeville, Minnesota, 2004.This book covers exactly what the title says, \\"The Origins of Christmas\\". Professor Kelly presents the establishment of Christmas as an important feast day in the Christian Church, with both eastern and western roots. Drawing heavily on the scriptural nativity stories, found in the Gospels of St Mark and St. Luke, the author shows the roots of story of the Three Kings, then Star over Bethlehem, the Flight into Egypt and many more commonly held aspects of Christmas as the present age knows it. Using historical analysis, Dr. Kelly makes it clear that Christ was probably born between 6 B.C,. to 4 B.C., (based upon the records for the death of Herod) and that the ancient Church chose December 25th as the date for celebrating the Birth of Christ as a holy remedy to Roman extravaganzas in that month of the year. Kelly shows how Christmas and Epiphany developed as competing feast days for the Nativity of Christ in Orthodox Catholic and Roman Catholic branches of Christendom. He also devotes some little time to St. Nicholas and how that saint's feast day metamorphosed into a gift giving day in certain countries (e.g. The Netherlands).This is not, however, a book that deals with the tinsel: the origins of Christmas trees, or Christmas decorations or Christmas lights. Christmas carols are hardly mentioned, and the more modern aspects of Christmas, such Prince Albert's introduction of Christmas trees to England, are not emphasized in Kelly's book. If you want a bible-based analysis of the origins of Christmas, and how the biblical story grew into today's modern story of Christmas, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Origins of Christmas","review":"In The Origins Of Christmas, Joseph F. Kelly (Professor of Religious Studies at John Carroll University) deftly traces the evolution of Christmas in Christian life and western culture. Readers will learn when Christmas was first celebrated as the birth of the Christ; how December 25th became the official date for Christmas; how the three \\"magi from the East\\" became the three kings known as Melchior, Caspar, and Balthasar riding on camels and coming from three different continents to worship the newborn in a manger; why medieval and Renaissance artists tended to portray Joseph as an old man; when Christmas music first made its appearance; the real St. Nicholas and how he became the most well known of all the Christian saints. The diverse origins of Christmas will come as a fascinating surprise to most who know only the Sunday School version of the Christmas story from their childhoods. The Origins Of Christmas, is very highly recommended and informative reading in which Professor Kelly begins when Christmas did not yet exist, and concludes when Christmas had become an integral part of the world culture in general, and Christian communities in particular."},{"Title":"The Origins of Christmas","review":"I bought this book in search of a text that would illuminate the history of Christmas as a sacred holiday in the church -- versus as a secular holiday (there are other good books on that topic). Kelly's book was a perfect fit for what I was seeking.Kelly recounts the history of the feast of the Nativity (Christmas) in the early church, examining the years from the end of the B.C. era through about the 6th century. He draws on scripture (the gospel accounts) as well as apocryphal literature to identify the sources of details for the modern day nativity story that we know. His discussion of identifying the date of Christ's birth is interesting and, frankly, really helpful for other Bible study efforts, as he explains the reckoning of time in ancient cultures. Really interesting stuff.I appreciated that the author drew not only on the canon, but on other sources, as well as taking a look at the culture of the day to explain how Christmas came to be celebrated. He illuminates the connection between Christmas and pagan winter celebrations without diminishing the significance of the Nativity.If you are interested in early Church history, particularly as it relates to Epiphany and the feast of the Nativity, you will find rich information in this text. If you are searching for the \\"meaning of Christmas\\" in the context of your Christian faith, this book may make you pause and reflect, and might possibly move you toward a richer and deeper experience of the holiday season."},{"Title":"The Origins of Christmas","review":"I had to read this book for a Western Civ 101 class and read it in a weekend before the class. I thought the book was very well written. If your searching for the explanation as to why Santa is so popular at Christmas or why we sing the carols we sing, don't look for those answers in this book, but still read it. The book gives great historical insight into the religious tradition and historical precedence that manifests itself into today's Christmas holiday. It is very heavy in the church history and documents behind Christmas as an event (not simply the birth of Christ), as well as examining the legitamacy of having a Christmas in the first place. Overall, not bad.

He has also written books such asThe Birth of Jesus according to the Gospels,The World of the Early Christians (Message of the Fathers of the Church),An Introduction to the New Testament for Catholics (Michael Glazier Books), etc.He writes in the Preface to this 2004 book, \\"This book began as the opening chapters of a larger history of Christmas, but, after reading them over, I thought that they might make a good, brief history of how Christmas began... I plan to write the rest of the history of Christmas and hope this book will get the project off to a good start.\\"Here are some quotations from the book:\\"The author (of the Protoevangelium) abandons the no-room-at-the-inn account because Mary gave birth in a cave before they even got to Bethlehem. This is the first mention of a cave, which would become a regular feature of Medieval Christmas stories.\\" (Pg. 40)\\"By the end of the second century, the Nativity had become part of Christian tradition... Yet nowhere in these two centuries do we find any mention of a feast in honor of Christ's birth, that is, no Christmas. Formidable objections existed to celebrating Christ's birth... But such an objection did not carry as much weight in the third century as it might have in the first. By then the majority of Christians were Gentiles who considered themselves loyal Romans for whom birthday celebrations were merely part of the culture.\\" (Pg. 53)\\"The attempt to ascertain the exact date of Christ's birth was just one way the ancient Christians tried to determine the date of Christmas. The other was to adopt some symbols and images common to many religions. This may sound a bit shocking to modern believers, but in fact there are many basic traits that different religions share... The ancient Christians would use such images in they did not contradict the Faith and could help others understand it.\\" (Pg. 61)\\"In 274 Aurelian instituted the cult of Sol Invictus, the Unconquered Sun... Yet Aurelian may still have had an important impact on Christianity, especially since the cult of the Sun did not die with him. The first Christian emperor, Constantine (306-337), was a devotee of the Sun before his conversion.\\" (Pg. 63)\\"Historians find it impossible to believe that this portrayal was just coincidentally produced in the city of Rome at the very time when the pagans were promoting the cult of their sun. The Christians must have created this as part of their struggle to turn back the emperor and his Unconquered Sun. This combination of evidence makes the connection between the birthday of the Sun and the birthday of the Son very likely.\\" (Pg. 66)\\"When this was combined with the proximity of Saturnalia, the Roman Christians chose a date (of Christ's birth of December 25th) which had already achieved some acceptance and which could counter two major pagan feasts.\\" (Pg. 68)\\"It is unlikely that the historical St. Nicholas would be able to recognize himself today.\\" (Pg. 109)"},{"Title":"The Origins of Christmas","review":"This a very exceptional and well-written book about Christmas.

If this author has written a similar book about Easter, I will certainly buy it."},{"Title":"Dominion","review":"This author is a curator in the Dept. of Invertebrates at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Together with Stephen Jay Gould, he formulated the evolutionary theory of Punctuated Equlibrium. In this excellent book Mr. Eldredge explores our evolutionary history, showing that although we think and act as though we live outside of nature, in reality, we have simply modified our position within the ecosystem through our agriculture and now global reach. He shows us how our notion of &quot;dominion&quot; over nature is largely an illusion and looks frankly at the consequences of this illusion, now and in the future, without resorting to darkness and gloom.Mr. Eldredge is a very good writer for the layman and has a flair for transmitting a sense of wonder to his readers. His writing style reminds me of the late Carl Sagan. I especially enjoyed his thoughts on the biblical story of Genesis; how God's words regarding our dominion over the world have affected man and how we need a new story of who we are and our place in nature.Don't worry as you read this book about forgetting anything important along the way, because Eldredge provides a brief and complete review of his salient points at the end. You won't need that highlighter.I most sincerely recommend this easy-to-read yet scholarly book to anyone interested in ecology, evolution, and the future."},{"Title":"Dominion","review":"Eldredge brings his experience as an anthropologist to assess the present world. It's overcrowded, he notes, and seriously so. That's causing stress on the entire planet, stresses the Earth can no longer sustain. The reason for the pressure is that at some point, human evolution brought us to the point where we became detached from Nature. We abandoned the environment to create a new one. With the rise of agriculture and fixed settlements, we were on the path to becoming an ecological disaster. As the first species to accomplish full control over our own food supply, we broke the pattern of nearly four billion years of evolution. Without a precedent to consider, we simply forged ahead with little consideration of what we were doing. It's a formula for disaster.Agriculture, so fundamental to our existence today, was an innovation of immense consequences. It brought humans out of their previous wandering habits and settled us in permanent habitats. Instead of hunting animals, we corralled them in paddocks, to be utilised at our whim. From stone tools shaped on the fly for a limited number of tasks, we now created a range of implements to increase yields and produce items for personal use or trade. These elements led us to become \\"inner-directed\\". With this change in focus, learning the ways of the land, we simply made the land over to suit our needs. This is a momentous step in evolution, and while Eldredge is excellent at explaining what happened, there's nothing of the why. Coming from a palaeontologist, this should be surprising. In Eldredge's case, the reason is blatantly clear.In this brief summary of our history, Eldredge's passion has many faces. He's clearly concerned about the future of our species and the biosphere. He's eloquent in his descriptive passages. He's informative in giving his account of how science has addressed our evolutionary track. Various positions are stoutly defended [his], while others are scathingly treated. Since it's Eldredge, we are subjected to repetitive treatments of the theory of punctuated evolution [evolution by jerks] developed in conjunction with the late Stephen J. Gould. Gould and his selected colleagues have long stressed \\"culture\\" has swamped biology. We have abandoned our biological roots, they argue, and replaced them with cultural mores. Tools and society are prime examples, and agriculture employs them both to grant us our enormous power over nature.In his chapter, \\"Fashioning the Future\\", it would seem we might find solutions for the problems due to our innovative prowess leading to our break with evolution. Sadly, this is but partly true. Since no previous patterns of existence offer means of breaking our cycle of habitat overload, we must innovate further. The new methods, Eldredge contends, must overcome the natural pace of evolution - this after flogging \\"punk eek\\"! We have been \\"genetically engineering\\" domestic species for millennia. Now, we can fine-tune the process to accommodate our needs and reduce planetary impact. We can even apply such methods to ourselves. Beyond these biological questions, lie issues of \\"cultural homogeneity\\". Communication forms: radio, TV and the Internet, are already making inroads into cultural diversity. This \\"smearing\\" process will only increase, leading to broader applications of solutions to problems. \\"Band-aid\\" fixes are already being applied. These will likely be expanded from local through regional to global applications. It will, he concludes, likely require Draconian measures to implement them. One can only wonder which leaders will undertake the task.

He is a paleontologist and curator of invertebrate paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. He is co-author, with Stepen Jay Gould, of the theory of \\"punctuated equilibrium,\\" which explains evolution's non-linear genetics. So when we see phrases such as \\"agriculture declares war on our local ecosystems,\\" we need to take note. The central theme is that, with the development of agriculture, ten thousand years ago, man's population has expanded beyond a sustainable level. Our destruction of non-renewable resources, and our careless attitude toward biodiversity are likely to be the proximate causes of our own extinction. As for what can be done about this threat, he proposes to edit the book of Genesis: \\"The People decided to curb their population numbers. They determined to curtail evnironmental damage and the loss of other species. They decided to conserve the world's remaining ecosystems. And they embraced sustainable development, matching economic growth to the carrying capacities of their surroundings. The People lived.

The author even makes use of the Bible as support for his position that we developed a mythology of our proper place in the world (thus becoming &quot;homo magister&quot;, rulers of all the world).I certainly don't believe that the author intended his work to be so similar to the &quot;Ishmael&quot; books, but the similarities are striking. Given that this book was published 5 or more years after &quot;Ishmael&quot;, it seems reasonable that the author was influenced in some way by it.While much of the material covered is the same as &quot;Ishmael&quot;, this book is more straightforward (and perhaps, some might think, a bit drier - posh to that!), and complements that book nicely, dealing far more in the nitty-gritty ecological and genetic significance of mankind.In short, this book will not replace &quot;Ishmael&quot;, but neither is it eclipsed by it. The two books complement each other wonderfully, and Mr. Eldridge does a far more exhaustive job of explaining exactly how we are impacting the environment.

Much of the book reviews the science of paleantology, which the field of his discipline. But I saw little convincing connection between that material and the extinction of animals which existed in prehistoric times. He speculates that the cave man artists who lived at least 30,000 years before the writing of Genesis, painted animals as a symbolic means of gaining dominance over them. In the Afterward, he proposes &quot;A New Story&quot;, in which he ignores real history of human understanding of our place in the world. He offers no clear evidence of a connection between his exegesis of Genesis and the massive extinctions of species in our times. Perhaps he should read more widely and become aquainted with St Francis of Assisi."},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"There was a time, before iPods, Walkmans, TV, radio, record players, in which workers (usually women) that were assigned to long hours of menial labor would assign one amongst them to read a book to the rest. The Return of the Native, Thomas Hardy's sixth novel, would be a terrific choice for such a reading group. Few in the 21st century have the leisure, or the inclination, to delve into a tale in which many pages might be given to the description of a natural scene, or to the intricate development of the personalities of the main characters of this book. But if there were a modern reader that either had, or made, time to read this book at the deliberate and careful pace that is required to experience its depth and richness, that reader would be richly rewarded. As was I.Thomas Hardy, better known for Tess of the D'Urbervilles, was one of the most influential of the English authors of the 1800's. Both D.H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf pay him homage and cite him as a source of their inspiration. His stories can be explored on two levels, both levels very accessible to the moderately experienced reader, neither level involving a journey into the deep complexities of books such as Pinchon's Gravity's Rainbow or James Joyce's Ulysses.The first level of The Return of the Native: it's simply a wonderful tale. For the price of a tiny bit of patience, as Hardy's narrative begins to unfold the reader receives a rich story involving integrity, duplicity, humor, passion, selfishness and selflessness, nobility and narcissism, as well as the consequences of impetuous action and the rewards of patient persistence. As a well told story it stands on its own and stands proudly, with or without the embellishment of scholarly opinion or critical review.The second level: Hardy infuses the story with his philosophy of the relationship between nature and mankind, his criticisms of the tragic consequences of societally ordained values (Victorian values colliding with human desires and capabilities), and beautiful symbolism. For those who feel that plots are not the core of a novel but merely scaffoldings upon which to hang literary/philosophical schools of thought and layers of symbolism, The Return of the Native serves well as a cerebral playground.Taken at the first level, Return of the Native is an absorbing tale complete with unpredictable twists of plot, human souls whose fates are determined by letters that arrive moments too late, and bouts of comic relief.At the second level, Return of the Native is rich in philosophy, anthropology, even theology.Take both levels together, and you have what is deservedly called a classic. The word classic makes many cringe. No need for the reader to recoil from The Return of the Native: this story is fascinating and rewarding for any who are patient enough to let its rich flavors and constructions emerge at a pace reflective of an era gone by."},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"I am not particularly well versed in English literature, but this CD is read by Alan Rickman and his voice is mesmerizing.

The novel begins with a detailed yet beautiful description of the Egdon Heath, which to a Hardy beginner would appear too descriptive to go on reading. However, once the characters are introduced and the plot of the story begins, it is an unstoppable read. I have read a Hardy's poem titled &quot;The convergence of the Twain&quot; that reveals Hardy's faith in &quot;Immanent Will&quot; that drives the events of this universe. This novel reinforces that faith of his. Though a reader can clearly see a solution to the problem that the characters are in, the characters themselves are helpless pawns in the hands of the Immanent will that drives the show. A not so unusual story, more or less predictable in the plot, gains its advantage from the beauty of Hardy's language.

However it does tend to drag on, which creates a drab, rather melancholy, tone. Hardy seems to explore the twists and turns of human passion, and creates a quite childish picture of love with the character of Eustacia, who 'decides' to love Clym, but keeps her true attachment to Wildeve.

The first chapter is slow due to detailed writing of scenic attributes but once the plot unfolds it is riveting.

I have listened to book narrations before that have failed miserably at that important aspect and subsequently ruined the experience. Rickman is a master at it.

But that might well be the only time i laughed during the book; this is not a humorous book but rather, like &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; ~ though less explicitly developed ~ the story of people tossed about by fate, chance, the gods, events, and the results are not pretty. Hardy writes beautifully, to be sure; not a phrase is misplaced in driving towards the effect of horror as good people are driven to extremity by events out of their control. It is hard to say that there is a hero in the book, unless perhaps the heath in Wessex on which all the action takes place. Certainly none of the main characters are completely admirable ~ though none is despicable either ~ in their actions and interactions. I have had a history of struggling with Hardy: Though i have read him before it has always felt like a chore (James is another whose novels give me that feeling); here i had no such difficulty, rather i raced (insofar as is possible) through it, hurrying toward the end, caring about each of the characters, and curious about the plot. Now my feeling is one of envy for a master of the language, one who is quoted in the OED as the authority for certain words' usage; envy, and admiration for the wonderful way he was able to put words together to make a place he obviously loved come so alive for another. I'd love to go to &quot;Egdon Heath&quot; sometime, to see it as it &quot;embrowned itself moment by moment....&quot; It might even raise a smile and shiver of horror both in me."},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"Hardy's talent soars in this novel, as he creates an atmosphere of love, death and life on Egdon Heath.

My favorite character, Eustacia Vye is an romantic, evil, and twisted woman who is out to get only what she thinks she deserves. She'll ruin everything in her path to get the man and the wealth that she wants. My least favorite character, Thomasin Yeobright, is a meek and &quot;perfect&quot; character who is so naive that she finds herself in irreversible situations. Other characters that intermingle in the story include Diggory Venn, Clym Yeobright, and my favorite male character, Damon Wileve. All five aforementioned people change and mold eachother into adults as they love, help, hurt and harm eachother. A trail of destined events leads to the explosive ending, and allows the novel to come to an incredible close, where no character is left untouched. Return of the Native is now one of my favorite books! If you like romance, drama, and fantasy, then this book could be perfect for you.

Eustacia isn't easy to love but she is far more determined and interesting than other characters in the classic lit canon. Clym is compelling in a different way.

Don't miss this one!"},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"As a lover of descriptive, old English this book is a delight. Hardy writes such beautiful prose in describing the wilds of Egdon Heath and its occupants. I have loved Hardy's writing since first reading, 'Far From the Madding Crowd', as he rung my heart for Shepard Oak. How much more would I have enjoyed it if it was read, I can not tell but 'Return of the Native' is so much the richer for being read and heard. It's the difference between enjoying the story and being in the story; walking with the characters across the heath, willing them to take a different path or hoping they tread their way to a beloved or to avoid another. I laughed out loud at poor Christian and cried and the fates of some. Alan Rickman, (I am very biased on anything to do with him and his voice) does a fantastic job in developing these characters into distinct personalities with their own sound and feeling, a truly skilled actor."},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"\\"The Return Of The Native\\" starts out slowly, but progresses nicely. What really brings this story to life is the narration on audio CD by acclaimed actor Alan Rickman. His talents are well used in this instance, and the old adage that, \\"If velvet could speak, it would sound like Alan Rickman\\" is proven to be true. It almost feels like you are listening to a play being acted out, as each character is given his own \\"voice\\", be it a man or a woman, and the different accents and dialects add to this feeling. The reading is given much feeling and emotion. Mr. Rickman even gets the chance to sing a little, in both English and French, what a treat to the Alan Rickman fan! I can't tell you what a treat is has been to settle in after a long hard day, slipping on the headphones, and laying down before sleep in the darkness with Alan Rickman speaking softly and close in my ears.... Ahhh... such SWEET dreams!"},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"Reading Schopenhauer alongside Hardy's &quot;Return of the Native&quot;, one cannot help but notice the philosphical similarities. The unhapiest people in Hardy's novel are those who rebel against their natural (and social) environments, while those who take each day at a time and want for nothing are vindicated at the end. Schopenhauer's pessisimism - and Eastern influences - shine strongly through Hardy's deeply moving parable of nature's revenge against those who would rise up against it."},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"In the book &quot;Return of the Native&quot;, Thomas Hardy created a good premise and characters one can grow quite attached to. It seems, however, that it takes a long time for the book to get into the plot and once it's there it moves very quickly. Once the book reaches the plot, some reader might get lost. The plot seemed to revolve around the love web between Clym, Eustacia, Wildeve, and Thomasin. Seeing the way they treated each other, many readers would probably question the existance of true love between any of those four. Many may feel that the only character who showed true love was Diggory Venn, a reddleman considered scum by the general society around him. He didn't try to have Thomasin when he knew she would not be happy with him. He even helped her try to have a good relationship with Wildeve. Though you may find yourself attached to the characters, the kindest heart beats within the lowly reddleman, who probably was part of the best love affair Hardy created in his book."},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"Hardy is very good at descriptions. The language he uses makes the people and scenery come alive. While this is true I personally feel that I would have preferred to read other books over this one. A good book but nothing special."},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"Although the 19th Century prose requires a bit more effort from the reader than most 20th Century novels, the brilliant characterizations of people like Clym Yeobright and Eustacia Vye plus the lovingly detailed descriptions of the unique (and fictional) location, Egdon Heath, make this work a pleasure to read for anyone who is willing to work at it a bit. Hardy describes his characters so solidly that, although they cause one another's misfortunes for the most part, we can understand and, to at least some degree, sympathize with all of them. Their flaws and mistakes seem real and understandable - not forced by the needs of the plot.This is not a \\"message novel.\\" As far as I can tell, Hardy has nothing to say about social or moral problems of 1830s England in this book. But the place he takes you is unforgettable and the people you meet there make it worth the trip."},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"I absolutely devoured this novel! I love depressing books, so this one was definitely for me. Eustacia reminded me of myself sometimes. I loved this novel so much that I even bought the made-for-tv movie! I cried. And if you really liked this book, then you should try Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert. Eustacia reminded me so much of Emma Bovary!"},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"When a long time Native of the heath comes back to 'visit' (Clym) he changes the lives of people that he doesn't realize he's had an affect on. Eustacia for instance is a character who reminds me of many teenage girls my age. Most of the time they don't know what they want and when they finally get it they don't want it anymore. To Eustacia life always has to be a challenge. Eustacia thinks that Clym is the only person who is 'worthy' enough for her but she is soon comes to reality when she finds that out that she won't be leaving the heath. Thomasin and Eustacia don't associate much in this book but Eustacia ends up giving her away to her ex-boyfriend Damon Wildeve! What's up with that? All I have to say is read this book. Eustacia's attitude and indifferent behavior makes it all worth while!"},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"What struck me on reading this book was his modern understanding of the motivations that determine the relations between men and women. Of course, the setting is crucial in any Hardy novel. Mankind's trivial concerns in this unchanging and unforgiving landscape. What is interesting is the dialogue between Wildeve (great name for a lover of nightlife) and Eustacia. The weakness and inconstancy in his character rather than evil and the troubled beauty and vanity of Eustacia's combined for predictable longing, rejection, and ultimately tragedy. He's the only game in town for this bored beauty, and when Clym pops up with his Parisian past, Wildeve was history for the moment. When Eustacia no longer showed interest, he was dying for her. Loved the reddleman who was always Johhny on the spot. The whole gambling sequence and the interplay with Wildeve and the hapless fool that lost Mom's money and then Reddleman's great comeback was wonderful. Hardy claimed that Clym was the center of the novel, but obviously the dullest thing in it. Only the Reddleman shines and in the end comes clean."},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"The Return of a Native, a fabolously written novel by the late Thomas Hardy, is a tale of forbidden love between Eustacia and Wildeve. Although the rather long descriptions of the heath tended to drag, the story in itself is tragic. In the beginning Eustacia and Wildeve were secretly seeing each other, until Wildeve marries Thomasin. Eustacia, desperately seeking a better life, marries Clym. This is the true beginning of the story. Hardy was ahead of his time writing this novel with the traditional twists of a modern soap opera. A tale of forbidden love, constant longing for better things, and mere gossip makes this story quite a read!!!!"},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"I read Thomas Hardy, because he is a wonderful writer. However, his characters, while completely accurate to the nuanced coquettish interaction of the period, do not allign with the logic of a more modern sensibility. As a result, the book seems slow and dated - unless you're into high school love triangles.I can't give it less than 4 stars because in reality, the book is excellently crafted with elegant language, fully developed characters, beautiful interweaving tales, and all the bells and whistles that make this a literary great. It's just that the story does not jibe with today's sensibilities. I mean, really, why can't you just tell the guy you like him and marry him, instead of letting your mother get involved, making him think you're going to marry someone else, so that he goes and gets hitched to your best friend."},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"The Return of the Native is not as famous as Tess of the D'Urbervilles or Jude the Obscure but is, in this long-time Hardy fan's view, superior - second only to The Mayor of Casterbridge for the vaunted status of Thomas Hardy's best novel. It lacks the better-known works' great sociopolitical relevance but more than atones with superb characterization, a deftly executed story, unparalleled setting description, dramatization of contemporary and universal issues, and spellbinding tragic vision. It is essential not only for fans but for anyone even remotely alive to artistic greatness.The novel has a unique fusion of three seemingly disparate elements: classical tragedy, a rural English focus that only Hardy could write, and substantial contemporary relevance. Ancient Greek drama was the model for all major Hardy novels, especially the tragic ones, but The Return differs in strictly adhering to the Aristotelian time, place, and action unities. This has historically been done almost entirely in drama; novels very rarely have unity of place, much less all three. The technical accomplishment alone would be highly notable, and Hardy pulls it off brilliantly, but what is truly impressive is how well he makes it serve the story; it seems fully natural rather than obligatory or tacked on. There are many other classical tragedy elements also, such as Clym's many similarities to Oedipus (blindness, mother obsession, etc.) and the rustic chorus; Hardy clearly went all out. Above all, of course, is the overwhelming sense of tragedy; outside of Hardy's own The Mayor and Oedipus Rex itself, nothing - artistic or otherwise - has given me such an overwhelming sense of life's essential tragedy, much less so powerfully and affectingly. The ending in particular is so shot through with tragedy as to be almost unbearable - so finely drawn and precisely phrased that I will never forget its wording, so indelible an impression did it make. The story is moving in the extreme - one of the most emotional and pathos-drenched books in existence. Our hearts are stirred time and time again as Hardy moves us through a gamut of thoughts and feelings.A large part of this is due to the characters, who are drawn so vividly and sympathetically that we cannot help feeling with and for them, sucking us in to the engrossing story with profound power. Characterization was always a Hardy strong point, but this has some of his most unforgettable personages: the intelligent, capable, but in some ways parochial Clymn; the alluringly mysterious but haunted Eustacia; the innocent and nave Thomasin; the hedonistic and impulsive Wildeve; and the fascinatingly strange, almost surreal Diggory Venn, who is probably Hardy's most intriguing character. Hardy was never one to put characters on a pedestal, and all these have faults, some of them fatal, and a few characters are at least partly despicable. However, they are all fully and thus frailly human; we see ourselves in both their strengths and weaknesses - mostly in the latter, which gets to the heart of Hardy's unflinching look at the human condition's vast dark side. Whatever the characters' faults, very few - perhaps none - would say they deserve what they get; their sufferings are great, and several end bleakly. We feel for them, as they are far more sinned against than sinning - not by each other but by a harshly indifferent universe.This gets to a perennial Hardy theme and another classical connection - fatalism, which pervades every aspect of the book. One of Hardy's earliest journal entries, made before he wrote fiction, was \\"The world does not despise us; it only neglects us,\\" and his work illustrates this over and over again. He was profoundly aware of humanity's microscopic cosmic significance and had long ceased to believe that things are directed or overseen by any kind of force benevolent or sympathetic to people. His work also dramatizes a phenomenon that he seems to have believed or at least thought plausible - the Imminent Will, a blind force governing human affairs. He did not describe it in detail until his epic poem The Dynasts, but The Return is in many ways imbued with it; as in Greek tragedy, the characters seem unable to escape black situations that they somehow got caught up in despite - or perhaps even because of - contrary will. Many find Hardy simply too pessimistic, and he certainly focuses on life and love's dark areas, but this to him was simply realism, and it is very hard to deny his compelling vision's force and plausibility, whatever we think of it otherwise. The Return is a consummate example, seeming to show that the chances for requited love are almost nil and depicting very little faith in human interaction generally; people seem stuck in unwanted lives in a meaningless universe. Hardy is rightly thought of as belonging mostly to the naturalist school, but this shows that he also anticipated much of existentialism, which is a large part of the reason he is so much more popular and acclaimed than nearly all his contemporaries. His work is by no means dated - is in many ways at least as relevant as ever. This is of course in part because he writes of elemental thoughts and emotions but also because he was so far ahead of his time in many ways.Yet the novel is also highly notable for being distinctly of its time, at least in regard to veiled sociopolitical relevance. Later works took this up far more overtly, but it is here in a subtler form, primarily in another classic Hardy theme - women's issues. Hardy had very advanced views on the subject, which all his novels variously feature. As usual, it is essentially done via the female lead; Hardy is well-known for heroines, and Eustacia largely resembles many, symbolizing similar issues, but also has unique features and significations. She is most immediately notable as a generally strong female character; intelligent, well-educated, ambitious, and strong-willed, she is anything but a Victorian stereotype. This would be remarkable in itself, but she is further important for showing the negative - nay, often fatal - effects of an unapologetically sexist culture. She is repressed to the point that it not only makes life a bore and a chore but ends up taking it altogether; women had few options other than marriage - and anyone at all familiar with Hardy knows what he thought of that. Her particular tragedy is ostensibly because she lives in an extremely rural and otherwise parochial place, but the discerning will see that society at large was detrimental enough. These issues are also explored to a lesser extent through Thomasin; she initially seems like an archetypal Victorian Angel in the House, but a closer look shows that Hardy meant her to stand for more. She is basically Eustacia's opposite; society has preyed on her at least as much but succeeded so thoroughly that she is not even aware. Though innocent in the conventionally admirable sense, she is also ignorant and nave, and the novel does much to show just how dangerous this combination could be in a world full of lustful men, cynically mercenary matchmakers, and others all too ready to take advantage.Implied criticisms of religion, marriage, and overall Victorian optimism aside, The Return also powerfully explores the damaging effects of xenophobia, prejudice, and related issues. Egdon Heath, the setting, is a small, close-knit community and, like most such places, has extremely strict morals and other beliefs plus consequent rigid enforcement, gossip, etc. Thomasin is an example of someone perfectly adapted to such an environment and ostensibly thriving, but her sad fate shows how such an atmosphere can drag one down unawares. Clym is a more interesting case, seemingly able to fit perfectly while also capable of moving in the larger world, but his wretched end shows that fatal consequences can result when the two conflict. Eustacia is an extreme example of such areas' oppressiveness; she refuses to conform and is not only ostracized but positively loathed and treated with scornful unfairness verbally and even physically. There is much to admire in how she stays true to herself so long amid such intense pressure, but even she is unable to cope in the end. However, as elsewhere, Venn is perhaps the most interesting example; though not openly non-conformist, he is far from fully accepted. A true outcast, he skates society's edge but is not part of it or anything else - a mysterious, haunting, and in many ways dark figure though highly compelling and capable of eliciting sympathy. He is valuable aside from all else in showing that such cultures often have more variety than is almost ever acknowledged.It is tempting to say that Hardy mocks the self-satisfied insularity that leads to all this, and it seems near-impossible to deny a satirical element to his depictions of nineteenth century English people ignorantly clinging to belief in witchcraft and other elements distinctly out of place in the modern world. However, the portrait is far subtler. First, Hardy had a great love for the Southwest England area here depicted and its culture; he was born and raised there and lived there most of his long life, soaking up every aspect to the extent that it is impossible to exaggerate its importance to his life and work. Elements he seems to bash are thus there in part because he knew their unusualness and associated dramatic vitality but also because he was simply realistic. We must after all remember that what is conventionally considered modern thought and technology had been slowly entering the area for only a few decades. Hardy's work is of great historical and sociological value for showing how such changes drastically, if slowly, changed a culture that had essentially been the same for a thousand years and for vibrantly and memorably portraying how people lived and thought in this time and place generally. Other novels focus more on technology and economic aspects, but this shows better than any other how it affected society and culture. The area's mores had been in place for a very long time and were not easily or quickly changed regardless of empiricism and enlightenment.The setting makes the book stand out among Hardy's work in several other ways. Most of his novels and much of his poems are set in what he called Wessex, a part-real, part-dream location based on his native area, which he made world famous. Egdon Heath appears in several works and is many fans' favorite setting, including mine, but this is unique in being entirely set there. It is a mysteriously foreboding location looked on with fascination and often dread, replete with dark rumors and swelling with pre-Christian traditions and practices taken for granted by inhabitants but seen with great distrust by others. The real area on which Hardy based it is indeed swarming with heathen history and sensibilities; it had been inhabited by druids, Celts, Romans, and other pre-Saxon peoples, all of whom left physical - and, far more importantly, cultural - artifacts. Not least importantly, as Hardy's Preface points out, it was the likely location of the legendary King Lear himself. All of this comes across in various ways. Thus, though strongly fitting the realist/naturalist genre like other Hardy novels, this differs in having substantial supernatural overtones. Hardy had a lifelong fascination with such things that thorough skepticism and great science admiration did nothing to dim, and this is a prime example. As in his short story \\"The Withered Arm,\\" which has similar elements and is partly set in Egdon, they are presented neutrally; the novel's essentially realist character makes us come close to dismissing them as ignorant superstitions, but we can never be quite sure. For example, it is easy to overlook the fact that Eustacia dies the same night that her neighbor, who believes the heroine is a witch, curses her with death via pagan means. It is almost certainly a coincidence - coincidences after all intentionally abounds in Hardy -, but we cannot dismiss the other possibility. Finally, again as ever, Venn is important here. Though in many ways the most truly good and sympathetic character, he is often described in Satanic terms, and everything from his appearance to his strange streak of near-superhuman luck to his seeming ubiquity and preternatural powers strongly suggest otherworldliness, if not evil. He is a character of immense power, dramatically affecting nearly everything that goes on, usually without anyone knowing; it is mesmerizing to watch him simply to see what he will do next. We never really learn his motives, and though he presumably acts for the good of all - even apparently with truly noble selflessness -, some have questioned his meddlesomeness and other aspects of his character. He is at any rate supremely entertaining and even gives some - admittedly very unconventional - humor, which is near non-existent in Hardy's fiction.No discussion of the book is complete without mentioning the astonishing descriptions of the heath itself. Hardy's sense of place is perhaps unequalled; he writes of landscapes and other settings with such detail and verisimilitude that they become an integral part of the story. Setting is never mere backdrop with him, but this is his most outstanding example, which truly says much. Egdon is often called the novel's main character, and it certainly gets great attention; Hardy describes it not only painstakingly but anthropomorphically. Almost alive, even active, it is present in most scenes - it is worth noting that most of the book takes place outdoors, including nearly all the important parts - and seems to affect them. The heath is the physical embodiment of the area's ancient existence and a symbol of all that has passed and all that remains. Out of the hundreds or thousands of books I have read, this has the most important and memorable sense of place; it is indeed so strong that the book is worth reading for it alone. Anyone who thinks such things can never be truly important should read this. Hardy brings the setting to life in a way I have seen no other author do, and many fans treasure this aspect of the book above all others.Many early reviewers predictably thought this overdone and also took issue with what were then explicit invocations of sexual issues plus some of the veiled social criticism. Time has of course proven all this foolish, but the fact calls into play another topic the novel cannot be discussed without - the epilogue, which considerably lightens the tone and softens the circumstances. Publishers insisted on a happier end, and Hardy, dependent on writing for bread, reluctantly agreed. He does a good job of not making it seem tacked on, but anyone even remotely familiar with his thought and work will see that his vision is compromised. The epilogue does not really do much to alleviate the deeply tragic underpinnings, and some of the events seem near-inevitable, e.g., Vinn finally marrying Thomasin. Clym also remains haunted, though he has achieved tolerable equilibrium and a meaning of sorts not hinted at in the proper close. However, it is a true shame to see the tragic end undermined at all, since it was so perfectly executed as to seem unavoidable and served as a great illustration of Hardy's vision. Other elements, notably Vinn's conformity, also disappoint. Hardy let the epilogue stand in later editions, but it is very important to remember that it was not his original intent. Though it has critical defenders, dedicated fans universally loathe it, often simply ignoring it but sometimes pushing for it to be removed. I also despise it, but a more moderate ideal would be to somehow make clear where the book was first supposed to end even to first-time readers who do not read Introductions or notes. Reading the epilogue without knowing this severely dilutes the book's quality and Hardy's general canvas. This paragraph aside, I wrote my review as if the epilogue did not exist, but it is important to be aware of it, and all must weigh it on their own scale as in the case of Charles Dickens' Great Expectations, which has a similar issue.I simply cannot praise The Return highly enough; it was the first Hardy novel I read, drawing me into a world of artistic greatness that shows every sign of being a lifelong standby, and it will always have special significance for me. However, I unhesitatingly give it my highest recommendation to all. It is quite simply one of the greatest novels ever - more than that, one of art's foremost masterpieces - and will continue speaking powerfully as long as the deeply human chords it strikes so strongly remain even remotely alive.As for this edition, it has significant supplemental material, making it ideal for many: Hardy's Prefaces to the novel and a collected edition of his works, extensive notes, a chronology, and a Wessex map. It also has an introduction that, while interesting in how it combats D. H. Lawrence and others, makes me want to combat it; I disagree with virtually everything it says. However, this is admittedly subjective, and some may even find it absorbing. All told, while there are excellent later versions, anyone who finds this will get a quality edition."},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"This book has been taught in lit classes for years excellent but sad book.Michael B Vye"},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"This is perhaps the most atmospheric novel in the English language, but it is about so much more than dark nights and windswept meadows.

Heaven knows I've tried, especially after watching the several film renditions of Hardy novels featuring the very wonderful Alan Bates, who I love. The dialect, the man-nature thing, the colorful characters, the poor woman who can't cope, all of it gets on my nerves after a very short while. In case you're wondering, I do love other 19th century British writers (especially Anthony Trollope), but Hardy is hardy. The plot of TROTN tells the story of Eustacia Vye, but all I could think of is a Monty Python version with John Cleese in a corset playing Eustacia's sister Fallopia and Michael Palin painted red from head to toe as the Reddleman.Having said that, it took several months of listening to other Rickman fans to get me interested in these tapes. I succumbed after pondering Debbye's glowing description.When you listen to Mr. Rickman you will find a master reader at his best. Every character has a consistent personality and voice, the women are good by his changing tempo and intonation, the descriptions are paced wonderfully in accordance to the mood of the chapter. As a volunteer reader for a non-profit organization that tapes textbooks, I especially enjoy a good reader. Mr. Rickman speaks, and all is perfect. Fifteen hours forty-five minutes of his reading is just the thing to nearly make me change my mind about Hardy. It certainly kept me listening to every word.Rickmaniacs and non-rickmaniacs alike will love the sensuous reading of the dance on the heath (tape #8).

There were also, the obligatory words that we no longer use (but only a bare handful...). This (for me) all added an extra richness to the story that Hardy tells.Alan Rickman's reading was delightful, with him displaying consistency throughout in portraying all the characters.

Like all Hardy's characters and settings, Egdon Heath and its quirky inhabitants became so familiar to me I felt as though I, too, had been to Bloom's-End or Mistover and had admired the bewitching Eustacia Vye and devious Damon Wildeve.Hardy's books are frequently those of people tossed about by the cruel whims of fate, and though the reader can clearly see a &quot;way out,&quot; the characters almost never can. Such is the case with wild Eustacia, deceptive but smitten Wildeve, calm and sweet Clym, and innocent Thomasin. As the reader plods across Egdon Heath and enters their lives, it is both frustrating and exciting to witness their missteps and the consequences they all pay, and to realize that there must indeed be casualties by the novel's end.

Fantastic story and ending once you get past the lengthy description of Egdon Heath. Breathtakingly powerful novel. A must read."},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"Okay, okay, I know what you're thinking. &quot;19th century British Literature? If I wanted to punish myself I'd go rearrange my sock drawer.&quot; But this isn't just another of those &quot;classics&quot; you read in high-school English class -- &quot;The Return of the Native&quot; truly deserves the designation &quot;literature&quot; without the negative connotations. It's a love story, without the mushiness of a romance novel. Eustacia Vye, a young Englishwoman living in the countryside, dreams of leaving her village and going to Paris. She is dazzled by Clym, returning home from a &quot;glamorous&quot; life in the city, and hopes he will return there with her. Though enamoured of her in return, Clym has different ideas for the future. Complicating things, his mother's death drives a wedge between the couple. Feeling as though she has lost everything -- her love and her dreams -- Eustacia faces tragic circumstances in the book's dramatic end. &quot;The Return of the Native&quot; is a story as enjoyable now as when it was first written -- and anything but dull. It could as easily been written yesterday as a hundred years ago. Even if you don't usually like to read &quot;classics,&quot; this modern love story is one you will surely find fantastic."},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"&quot;The Return of the native&quot; is the first novel that I have read of Thomas Hardy's. The novel begins with a detailed yet beautiful description of the Egdon Heath, which to a Hardy beginner would appear too descriptive to go on reading. However, once the characters are introduced and the plot of the story begins, it is an unstoppable read. I have read a Hardy's poem titled &quot;The convergence of the Twain&quot; that reveals Hardy's faith in &quot;Immanent Will&quot; that drives the events of this universe. This novel reinforces that faith of his. Though a reader can clearly see a solution to the problem that the characters are in, the characters themselves are helpless pawns in the hands of the Immanent will that drives the show. A not so unusual story, more or less predictable in the plot, gains its advantage from the beauty of Hardy's language. I have not come across a better author who can so exactly transform what he visualizes/sees into words. The book is definitely a treasure to be kept and re-read."},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"Granted, the story-line isn't exactly one of those &quot;happily ever after&quot; tales, but as a general fan of Hardy, I find it interesting literature. Alan Rickman, (being absolutely one of my favorite actors under the sun,) reads very well, (hey, you've got to love that accent, right?) The discriptions of the Heath and the somehow forlorn characters are well thought-out, and give a nice affect.

The lyrical prose of Hardy, combines with the incomparable voice and performance of Alan Rickman, to make this a genuine treasure.Rickman, in his limited interviews, has repeatedly referred to himself as an instrument. In this product, the only part of that instrument he could utilize was his voice. It is more than enough: the pictures and action spring vividly to life. Listening to his performance is sheer joy, and it rapidly makes you realize how little his capability has been tapped by film - where the whole \\"instrument\\" is utilized.I would give this product the highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"This is the third time I've listened to this audio book, something I have never done before. I must admit, it gets better ever time. The description of the characters is incredible - when have you read a whole chapter describing an individual? Or the landscape? Certainly way more verbose than modern style, but the observations stand the test of time, and paint pictures that linger. None of the characters is flawless, and the errors of omission in their acts toward each other results in no end of misery. But the view of life in another time, with all its physical differences and all its emotional similarities to ours is intrigueing. And Rickman is fabulous, capturing accents and personalities that reading myself in my cozy chair in Phoenix Arizona would never have known."},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"The Return of the Native by Thomas Hardy. Recommended.In Egdon Heath, Thomas Hardy creates an otherworld consisting of the elements earth, wind, fire, and water, populated by a witch condemned by a pious woman's spell, a Christian ruled by pagan beliefs, an assortment of other odd characters, and the native of the title whose return precipitates a series of tragic events.The Return of the Native is centered around Eustacia Vye, a beautiful outsider wrenched from the society she craves by orphanhood and exiled to live on Egdon Heath with her maternal grandfather. Spoiled, vain, fickle, and selfish, Eustacia is not a sympathetic heroine. Although she claims to belong to Damon Wildeve (\\"body and soul\\" in one uncensored version), she really belongs to whomever can grant her what she desires and, in her mind, deserves. While Wildeve is a step above the local rabble, Eustacia can never fully commit herself to him. Each time she considers it, she is held back by the thought that even he lacks something and that surely she can do better. \\"He's not great enough for me to give myself to-he does not suffice for my desire! . . . If he had been a Saul or a Bonaparte-ah! But to break my marriage vow for him-it is too poor a luxury!\\"In another place, like the Paris Eustacia longs for, she would have become a mistress or a courtesan-the consort of a powerful man or men. On Egdon Heath, however, there are neither powerful men nor courtesans. There is only Damon, an equally fickle young man who hotly desires that which he cannot have-sometimes Eustacia, sometimes the nave Thomasin Yeobright. To complicate matters, Thomasin's cousin Clym returns from Paris, where he has a financially rewarding and spiritually stifling career. In Eustacia's eyes (blinded to what she doesn't want to see, just as Clym's sight becomes literally blurred to that which he does want to see), Clym appears to be the ideal replacement for Wildeve.In his introduction to the \\"standard edition,\\" John Paterson, talks about the censorship of The Return of the Native and its anti-Christianity elements. The novel, at least in this form, appears to be more anti-Christian than anti-Christianity. Eustacia, with her beauty; aloof and lonely snobbishness; hold over men such as Wildeve and Clym and boys such as \\"the little slave\\" Johnny Nunsuch and the adolescent Charley; and habit of haunting Rainbarrow at all hours of the night, can easily appear to fit the role of the Egdon Heath witch. Yet it is the churchgoing Susan Nunsuch who falls prey to superstition, believing that Eustacia has afflicted her son with illness. She stabs Eustacia with a needle during one of the young lady's rare church appearances. Ironically, in the end Susan is the witch, fashioning a likeness of Eustacia and practicing a homegrown form of obeah upon it.Susan's male counterpart, the ironically named Christian, is no better. Simple-minded, nave, and condemned to perpetual bachelorhood, Christian is pious not for love of God but for fear of life. He is ruled by superstition, and it requires little effort for Wildeve to convince him he is lucky and that he should gamble (as it turns out, with money that isn't his, adding theft to his sins).Like Egdon Heath itself (\\"oozing lumps of fleshy fungi . . . like the rotten liver and lungs of some colossal animal\\"), the remainder of its inhabitants-the ones from whom Eustacia wishes to escape-are unflinchingly, unchangingly pagan, with Christian's own reprobate father, Granfer Cantle, setting the example. They avoid inconveniences like church; they gleefully celebrate Guy Fawkes Day with fire and dance; they gossip without undue concern for good or bad. These are the folks from whom Mrs. Yeobright and the stoic pagan Diggory Venn (the reddleman) wish to save Thomasin's reputation-as though it matters to them.These are also the people among whom Eustacia is a queen. When she says, \\"How I have tried and tried to be a splendid woman and how destiny has been against me!\\" the reader is hard pressed to find Eustacia's efforts to better herself, other than trying to determine which man will best launch her into society. With his Paris connections, Clym is the obvious choice, yet it is Wildeve who turns out to have better prospects-and the will to take advantage of them.Queen among the heathens of the heath, Eustacia is blissfully unaware of the probability that, in the Parisian society she aspires to, she would be one among many and might find herself unable to compete with the elite courtesans, mistresses, and wives of Paris. \\"I was capable of much,\\" she claims. Hardy, however, never makes clear what this \\"much\\" might be exactly, as Eustacia's intelligence, learning, and wit are incompletely and imperfectly portrayed, and one does not make a splash in society based on looks and pride alone. Eustacia hasn't \\"tried and tried\\"; and her youthful, ambitious impatience has led her to miss the clues that Clym is not going to \\"try and try,\\" either. Perhaps she, like Sue in Jude the Obscure, represents the dilemma of the intelligent woman in the 1800s, who can shape her own destiny only through attachment to the right man in a socially acceptable way. When that fails (Eustacia), or if an alternative means is attempted (Sue), tragedy is inevitable.While not Hardy's best, The Return of the Native is a must read for his readers, incorporating a grim yet objective setting, memorable characters, and a tragic plot driven by human failings more so than the destiny at which Eustacia rails. Ignore the awkward, unconvincing happy ending, as Hardy's censors forced him to tack it on.Diane L.

The man could read the local phone book and I'd gladly pay to hear it. Thusly, when I found he had done an unabridged set of audio tapes of one of my favorite books -- \\"The Return of the Native&quot; -- I was thrilled.&quot;The Return of the Native&quot; is a compelling and beautifully written story. I especially like the way Hardy makes Egdon Heath itself as much a character in the story as the human denizens of the area, breathing life into it through his wonderful word pictures and his special talent for creating moods. Hardy's vivid descriptions and excellent character development make this an enchanting adventure.Add to this the velvet-smooth voice of Rickman, and you have a treat for the imagination and the ears.Rickman gives each of the characters his (or her) own separate voice, and manages to do so without forgetting how each should sound. How he kept it straight, I'll never know (I, myself, record books on tape for an educational company and know how complicated that can be!)...what with the many inhabitants of Egdon Heath he had to work with...but, he did. Rickman also actually sang the songs from the book (and not badly, either), adding another dimension.\\"The Return of the Native\\" (unabridged) is a must for anyone who loves good literature on tape, and for anyone who is a fan of Alan Rickman. This is a stunning production and well worth the investment!"},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"As a keen fan of Thomas Hardy, I have found this reading wonderful. Alan Rickman's rendition is beautifully paced and the characters were really brought to life by the variety of tone within his voice. Certainly, this is one of Hardy's gloomier works--but all the more fascinating for the picture given of characters in a truly remarkable landscape. I've always regarded Egdon Heath as the true hero of this work anyway. At a time when I have needed distraction from my own circumstances, this marvellous version has proved invaluable and I look forward to acquiring others to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"I don't know how many times I've given up on Hardy novels - I pick them up with the best of intentions, but his language is just too ponderous for my taste. His works are undeniably masterpieces, but one must work agonizingly hard to pry the story out of the book. However, under Mr. Rickman's masterful interpretation, Egdon heath and its tragic inhabitants leapt from the book (or, as it were, the car speakers) and into my imagination, and I found myself eagerly anticipating my next road trip. I'll leave it to the other reviewers to describe the book itself, and say only that Mr. Rickman's rich voice makes Hardy's words not only tolerable but a mesmerizing (no pun intended, Rickmaniacs) sensual feast. If you're a Hardy fan or a Rickmaniac, this collection of tapes is not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"This is one of the great ones. Give yourself time and space to enjoy sentences of poetic beauty, read by one of the greatest voices of our time. Other reviewers have covered the plot, which is engaging enough, but my chief enjoyment was in the style of writing. Hardy's words paint landscapes of the soul as well as the countryside, and intertwine them within unforgetable characters of depth and spirit. The book is long, yet there is great economy of style. Hardy arranges his phrases with the care of a classical composer, and evokes richer feelings with more grace and fewer words than most of our glib and pithy authors today. I find myself wanting to buy a thesaurus for most modern authors to help them expand their vocabularies, and wishing that Alan Rickman would record another Thomas Hardy novel!"},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"Warning: This audio book is highly addictive!!!Maybe you have to like Thomas Hardy before making your mind up to settling down to listen your way through all the 12 tapes. But you will learn to yearn for just another chapter of this, after the first tape. Another word to the yet undecided: the Return is not half as dismal as Jude the Obscure or Tess of the Durberville.On top of the drama between six persons and the heath, which figures as another dramatis personae, there comes Mr. Rickman's superb reading. He gives every person not only his or her own characteristic voice. But his descriptions of the landscape make you see the scenery (apart from the introduction, the description of Mrs. Yeobright's garden on the day of her fatal excursion is compelling. He makes you feel the sweltering heat of that day). Just two highlights certainly are the dicing-game on the midnight heath (tape 6) as well as Clyms and Eustacias final dispute (tape 10). But the whole recording in itself is a highlight.Just one technical afterthought: It would be sensible to edit it on CD.

It's a reading, pure and simple. Not a dramatization by any means, or a single sound effect.

Alan Rickman's name isn't even on the jacket."},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"Here we have a book which one best works up to, at least for those who wish to garner the most benefit and enjoyment from it. I'm now 56 years old and I'm glad that I didn't read this fine work when I was 26 - my reading since that early age and general life experience definitely benefited my appreciation of Hardy's clever technique. This work represents a pinnacle of great English literature. If it were not for the clever writing, the great depth of the story, and the superb character development then this very intimate tale could simply be viewed as 1800s pulp fiction. This is sweet dessert following an entree of life-long reading pleasure.THE STORY: (The setting is southern England's brown and culturally backward heath country where sheep farming and furze- [gorse-] cutting prevails as a fundamental means of rural bread-winner subsistence. It's a dreary and lackluster environment, hot in the summer and cold in the winter, with little to offer folks of ambition.)There are five leading figures who nourish this melodramatic tale, three men and two women, all roughly of marriageable age. Two of the men marry the women. The third man much longed for one of these two lovely gals but his trade as a reddleman (a producer and seller of red dye for marking sheep) precluded his attractiveness to the fairer sex: the red dye had defiled his skin and clothing from head to foot so that village children who encountered him typically fled from fear of his satanic aspect.The four who wed persist with their agendas, in many ways as if they were still individually single. And they all experience difficulty in extricating actual need from a reservoir of desire and thus these tenuous partners generate volatile intensities of sorrow and torment for their respective mates. Before the tale concludes great despondency is experienced on all fronts - there really are no winners. But the finale will still gratify most readers.The author also pleasantly bombards us with worthwhile scenes of pagan holiday midnight bonfires, ghostly pipe dreams of ancient Celts, tranquil pastoral lifestyles, and some very rudimentary pseudo-voodoo.Hardy saw publication of this particular work in multiple formats, including serial publication, and subsequently as a book in 1878. The Penguin Classics edition (1978, reprinted in 1985) replicates Hardy's 1912 version which the author personally viewed as the finalized product.The Penguin Classics version includes an introduction by George Woodcock who artfully assesses the book's ranking: \\"The Return of the Native... is generally agreed - even by those who do not accept it as [Hardy's] greatest - to be his most representative work.\\" For what it's worth, I wholly agree.Creating a shallow, superficial fictional character of significance is delicate work and requires enormous literary skill. Hardy was well up to the job. Similarly, one distinct and noteworthy element of first-rate writing can be conveyed by embellishing upon flawed ethical or moral conduct by steering these principals along paths of iniquity, which leads to inevitable misfortune: irony. Hardy clearly did not fail to recognize such key literary opportunities.Even the most casual reader will readily detect the numerous fundamental moral lessons yielded throughout this somewhat lengthy account - those rings are the easiest to grasp. However the focused reader who maintains a judicious eye toward the book's more philosophical aspects will unearth larger truths as well. Several of these more sprawling actualities proliferate the text, (albeit sometimes faintly), but the notion which leapt at me most formidably was, \`It's near impossible to permanently modify the personal behavior of another given only the force of external human influence.' Conversely, (and practically in the same breath), we can observe the temporary conduct of individuals provoked to astounding intensities of emotion subsequent to little more than a few strategically placed words. Again, Hardy strengthens his tale and stimulates its intricacy by employing these shrewd devices.George Woodcock's thirty-five page Introduction should be read subsequent to Hardy's account and not before. The reason is simply that one can gain little idea from Woodcock's commentary of what the story is all about; thus, his meticulous descriptions of the landscape and of the characters are pretty much rendered meaningless.This work is straightforwardly a novel, a story about people and their interactions within a specific environment. It boasts no larger implications beyond the moral ones, thereby diverging from more wide-ranging literature like Dostoyevsky'sCrime and Punishment (Penguin Classics)(societal implications), or Faulkner'sThe Hamlet(cultural connotations.) So many great works of literature facilitate multiple purposes but this one doesn't. It's just a markedly good yarn, chiefly about five incongruous souls.In summary, rarely have I enjoyed a work of English literature as I have this one. It's a bit highbrow but not in the least boring. In spite of the fact that it was initially published over a century ago I found it refreshing.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"The novel deals with modern day issues and concerns in a 19th century european-heath setting.

I'm a junior in high school and was assigned to read Return of the Native for english class. Maybe I would enjoy it more if I had picked it up on my own, but I'm not so sure. So, I'll try to be as objective as possible. My single biggest problem with Return of the Native is its damned wordiness. Hardy is somehow able to say so much without saying anything at all. This is understandable, if you know the history of the book. It was a Victorian novel - meaning it was published as a serial. As such, Hardy was paid by the word. Therefore, he uses A LOT of words. Hey, everyone has to make a buck. Quick example - One entire chapter is devoted to a physical description of one character. Please... The writing is not bad. At times, Hardy's descriptions are quite beautiful. The problem is, when you turn the page you're still reading the same beautiful description. Then a few paragraphs later that beautiful description persists in its beautiful descriptiveness. Eventually it gets to the point where you want to take that beautiful description and pound it over the head with its own bloated leg. Hardy also loves those allusions -- I can't tell if he's trying to write a novel or impress me with his trivial knowledge of Greek mythology. The plot could use some work as well... it's really just a convoluted boy meets girl story, with no deep meaning hidden underneath. Hardy's supposedly a realist when it comes to human nature, but in the end, the &quot;good&quot; characters find happiness and the &quot;bad&quot; characters get what's coming to them. Not quite as realistic as I might like... Most of the characters annoyed me... except Diggory Venn, he's the man. If you want a good boy-meets girl story that reveals something about human nature skip Return of the Native and read the Great Gatsby. It has one third the length but three times the impact.

Thomas Hardy creates Eustacia to bring a heroine into the story, also to bring excitement and to create confusion for many characters. Clym is the native that returns to the heath. Clym meets Eustacia and there is an immediate attraction between the two. Hardy also creates the character Wildeve, to confuse Eustacia. The book displays great examples of conflicts, for example Mrs.Yeobright and Eustacia, Eustacia and Susan, and Eustacia against herself. The reoccurring theme that Hardy shows in the book seems to happen to be somehow related to Eustacia.

Wildeve pretends to marry a girl named Thomasin, but it didn't happen. And he takes off on a tryst with Eustacia. However, even though they're fond of each other, neither of them are willing to get really serious about each other.

He even manages to project Hardy's subtle shadings of tone with the rhythm and tempo of his narration, throwing in a song here and there because, in spite of his gloom, there is a festive strain to Hardy, as well. If you have a hard time reading this classic English writer, this is how to do it. \\"P.E.F. (c) AudioFile, Portland, Maine.Yes and he can even do the womens voices without doing falsetto ! Rickman won the Best Talking Book or Talkie thing for this and deservedly so.I enjoy talking books and often use them as I drive long distances and this is the best one I have heard so far. I hope Alan Rickman , or another English actor, reads some more Thomas Hardy books for us in future."},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"Readers of Thomas Hardy's novels call him the literary prophet of gloom and doom, and there is some justification for that tag. But while that may be so, it is an oversimplification that obscures, rather than clarifies, man's relation to nature. In the first chapter of THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE, Hardy suggests a primal relation that harkens back to antiquity: \\"It was at present a place perfectly accordant with man's nature--neither ghastly, hateful, nor ugly; neither commonplace, unmeaning, nor tame; but like man, slighted and enduring.\\" The key word here is \\"enduring.\\" Throughout this novel, as well as the others in the Wessex saga, Hardy depicts a nature that at one time, very long ago, was in harmony with man. In man's ability to regenerate himself, each succeeding generation retained that harmony. But as man began to wean himself from the fructifying earth with machines and technology, he began to impose an artificial set of rules, laws, and institutions that not only separated man from his harmony with nature but conspired to separate man from himself, with each man warring against the other. Nature, in THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE is symbolized by Egdon Heath, and is populated by two kinds of people: those who remain, or try to remain, in harmony with nature, and those who do not. The former includes the \\"native\\" of the title, Clym Yeobright, his cousin Thomasin, and Diggory Venn, the reddleman who loves Thomasin. The latter is collectively symbolized by Eustachia Vye, an unhappy girl who hates what she sees as the dullness of life that Egdon Heath provides.Egdon Heath is a colossal, forbidden stretch of land that requires its inhabitants to both understand and respect its power to kill or to maim. Only the wise and the strong may survive. Those who are neither will fall victim to its unremitting ferocity, as Mrs. Yeobright does to a serpent, or Eustachia and Wildeve do to drowning. The Heath is brutal, but not explicitly so. It is rather a testing ground that reflects the inner capacity of human beings to grasp that they are being tested in a way that has a definite passing or failing grade. Life then on the Heath is a forced pass-fail exam that is rigged from the start. In her unhappy marriage to Clym, Eustachia becomes a victim not only because of the fierceness of life on the Heath, but mostly because of her personality, which sets up a conflict with that heath. Her desire to rise above her station cut her off from both the Heath and its residents. Clym suffers tragedy too, but in his case, it is not so much the mindless nature of Egdon Heath that renders his life miserable, but the unfortunate tendency of Hardy himself to make a bad situation worse with his insistent insertion of coincidence as the driving force in much of the heath's tragic power. When Hardy delays the delivery of a letter that might have avoided tragedy, he refrains from doing so. When he does this, he cheapens the power of the Heath to act on its own, by substituting his own authorial intent. Still, what emerges from a reading of THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE is a peek into the complexity of an unfriendly universe that dares its inhabitants to offer respect or pay some pretty severe consequences."},{"Title":"The Return of the Native (Penguin Classics)","review":"When I began reading the book, I could not see the point of long descriptions of everyone and everything but as I kept on reading, I understood its' significance. The vivid description unconsciously painted the picture of the heath and the people living there. It took me some time to understand the character of Eustacia but her thoughts, passions and feelings seemed real and felt as if such a person actually existed. The edition of the book I read, after the tragic ending, had another chapter which Thomas Hardy added later, on the readers' demand (because when this book was originally published, some people considered it too tragic). But I think that howsoever tragic, the ending was a suitable one and left an impression for the reader to always remember the story. The later addition of another chapter was unnecessary and side tracked from the original essence of the story. Still, its a great work and worth reading."},{"Title":"Atonement and Forgiveness: A New Model for Black Reparations (George Gund Foundation Book in African American Studies)","review":"Yes, it does provide a new model for black reparations. However, the book thinks it is smarter than it is. The author makes an extremely weak case for even having black reparations in the first place. The case is essentially that Germany did it, so we should too. It ignores several key points, such as who will actually be hurt by the reparations (non-blacks) and the issue of fighting injustice with injustice. He wants repartions for slavery, but the victims and perpitrators are long dead. If you are looking to be convinced that there should be reparations, this certainly is not the book. If you are ready to jump to the conclusion that we need them (I certainly am not) then I guess this could be a possible way to go at it. Check out the Penn and Teller season 4 episode on reparations."},{"Title":"Atonement and Forgiveness: A New Model for Black Reparations (George Gund Foundation Book in African American Studies)","review":"Many people who oppose the idea of reparations and redress in America today are confusing the redress movement with the tort-based reparations idea inspired by General Sherman's Field Order 15 granting freed slaves the mythical \\"40 Acres and a Mule.\\" Since Andrew Johnson undid much of the work that Lincoln invested himself in to insure that Reconstruction would level the playing field, black Americans have been seeking a form of redress that would account for the 400 years of capital stolen from slaves by the American government. Professor Brooks presents an alternative to the Tort Model that focuses on not the financial ramifications of redress, but more importantly on the Progression of Truth towards a self realization by the perpetrator - the US government. While many confuse the word reparations with \\"money\\", Professor Brooks' Atonement Model deals with the idea of redress and an official apology from the perpetrator to the victims. This is a must read for all Americans. Given the proper exposure, this model should seek roots in the black community and redifine what reparations proponents are seeking."},{"Title":"Atonement and Forgiveness: A New Model for Black Reparations (George Gund Foundation Book in African American Studies)","review":"Excellent read for serious minded reparations scholars. Reparations are truly about redressing the past for a better future. The author presents a strong argument that atonement, forgiveness, and racial reconciliation can only be achieved through the act of reparations. His model is one that is feasible, reasonable, and promising."},{"Title":"The psycho-analysis of children (International psycho-analytical library)","review":"This book is a classic in its subject and one which revolutionized child analysis. Melanie Klein had already proved, by the special technique she devised, that she was a pioneer in that branch of analysis. She made possible the extension of psychoanalysis to the field of early childhood, and in this way not only made the treatment of young children possible but also threw new light on psychological development in childhood and on the roots of adult neuroses and psychoses.This volume describes both the theory and practice of her methods, and includes a preface, written for the third edition, in which she outlines the development of her thinking in relation to certain essential hypotheses.This new edition, which contains a revised translation and a new index, has an explanatory note by the Editorial Board of the Melanie Klein Trust placing 'The Psycho-Analysis of Children' in the general compass of her work."},{"Title":"Only at Night We See the Stars: Finding Light in the Face of Darkness","review":"I cannot believe this book is not available.

Egypt as the home of al-Azhar as Islam's most prestigious instution of traditional Islamic learning and the [now disupted] leader of the Arab-World is a an excellent location for the study to take place. The author effectively places the rise of the Dar al-Ifta in the context of Egyptian Islam, International Islamic bodies, and the modern crisis of religious authority facing Islam today. In addition to this, his examination of the careers and fatwas of Egypts most famous Muftis, Gad al-Haqq and Sayyid al-Tantawi, is excellent and quite useful. Recommended for those interested in Islam in Egypt in particular, but this work would also be useful for a general study of Islamic authority in practice [as co-opted by a modern nation-state in this particular case]."},{"Title":"Defining Islam for the Egyptian State: Muftis and Fatwas of the Dar Al-Ifta (Social, Economic and Political Studies of the Middle East)","review":"Should Islam ban insurance (as a form of gambling) or permit it (because its purpose is the reduce risk)? What about the telegraph, the hat, and reasonable interest on certificates of deposit? The answer to these and other questions comes in a fatwa, an advisory opinion on Islamic law issued by a religious authority known as a mufti. More than any other mechanism, fatwas provide a way for Islam to adopt to new places and times; as such, they constitute a basic building block of Muslim life, though one only recently receiving the attention they deserve. Skovgaard-Petersen, a Danish scholar, moves the process greatly forward through his excellent study of their &quot;gradual institutionalization&quot; in twentieth-century Egypt, the country perhaps most crucial to their development. As his title suggests, he argues that the mufti was the key intermediary between events on the ground and the government's interpretation of them. Even more: the mufti became &quot;a central figure&quot; in developing the political meaning of Egypt's Islamic identity. Skovgaard-Petersen pays particular attention to a ground-breaking fatwa by the renowned scholar, Muhammad 'Abduh (1849-1905), in which he permitted Muslims in South Africa to eat the meat of animals slaughtered by Christians. Not only was the distance involved startling, but so was the permission. With this, 'Abduh introduced a &quot;new kind of public fatwa: the daring well-researched statement, where the State Mufti is reconsidering the Islamic tradition taking into account the needs of the time.&quot; He has had many successors, and cumulatively they have done much to adapt Islam to modernity.Middle East Quarterly, June 1999"},{"Title":"The Well-Filled Tortilla Cookbook","review":"This is a great little cookbook.

I'm not an adventurous eater. These recipes are - this is just my opinion, I hasten to add - much more eclectic and creative than my narrow preferences can appreciate. Nonetheless my expectation for a cookbook based on fillings for tortillas was long on meat and cheese and short on fruit and vegetables. As another reviewer said, it does seem very \\"Californian\\" and while I have lived in California, I am a Texan through and through, and these are not fillings you find in Texas.

I was in the bookstore in Colonial Williamsburg and inquired of one of the staff if they had a biography of Jefferson that was not full of the current popular revisionist drivel. \\"Yes we do,\\" he responded enthusiastically and pointed me to this volume by Albert Nock. Enough said."},{"Title":"Mr. Jefferson","review":"Albert J. Nock has long been known by those familiar with his work as a shrewd commentator who is always eager to &quot;tell it as it is.&quot; When his premises are correct, this can be refreshing, to say the least. However, when he misses the mark, the results can be embarassing. This work, much like his infamous &quot;Our Enemy the State,&quot; is a great testament to this.However, to begin with, there is much of great worth and interest in this volume. Nock, as one scholar has observed, was a supremely literate man, and his great learning and intelligence is clearly evident throughout this work. Unlike many other authors, Nock reflects a deep, thorough knowledge of Jefferson's life and writings. Furthermore, few modern authors can equal Nock's beautiful prose style. Thus, when one reads of Jefferson's opinion on architechure, art, philosophy, or agriculture, we have some of the most delightful passages in all of the Jefferson literature.Unfortunately, a large portion of the work is consumed by Nock's grossly inaccurate analysis of the political environment of the early republic. Economic determinism in the tradition of Charles A. Beard and Henry George is the gist of what you find, and all of their fallacies and flaws are given full exercise. Indeed, as one Jefferson scholar has remarked, this work reveals a &quot;uncritical&quot; use of the Beard thesis. Thus, Jefferson is portrayed, not as an advocate of natural rights or anything of the sort, but as the supporter of the interests of the producing class against those of the exploiting class. As one would expect, the Constitution is portrayed simply as a tool for economic exploitation, and much ink is spilled documenting the evils of Hamilton, the Federalists, as well as &quot;speculators.&quot; While all of this is not without a semblance of truth, his simplistic and often misleading exegesis is very dissapointing.Nevertheless, as I have said, the work still has great value, largely as a brilliant account of Jefferson's interests and character. Nock is fundamentally correct when he focuses on the fact that Jefferson's real views are very far from those of his comtemporaries, and even farther from those who claim his name for support in later days. Ultimately, I would only recommend this work to individuals who have already done a good deal of study in Jefferson's life and ideas, for only these individuals will be able to see the true worth of this study despite its many flaws."},{"Title":"Mr. Jefferson","review":"Nock sums up Jefferson's character: \\"A dominant sense of form and order, a commanding instinct for measure, harmony and balance, unfailingly maintained for fourscore years toward the primary facts of human life--towards discipline and training, towards love, parenthood, domesticity, art, science, religion, friendship, business, social and communal relations.\\"\\"No harm is done if we read his Jefferson as a biography and his Rabelais studies as travel books and compare them with other biographies and studies. But it is harm done to ourselves not to discover in those works an ideal of the complete man and of the moral life. Must we always be moved only by unreadable books in treatise form, which profess to \\"tell all\\" with the aid of quotations and references -- that is, others' thoughts pickled in disinfectant scholarship?\\"Jacques BarzunWho can add to Dr Barzun?

He was continually shocked by the coarseness and vulgarity, let alone the scandalousness, of the custom which permitted women in search of favors not only to visit public officials, but to visit them alone, without the present of a third person to guard the proprieties.\\" (Pg. 55) He adds, \\"their persistent love of adornment bore him eloquent testimony to the better way that things were managed in Virginia, where women did their duty in that station of life unto which it had pleased God to call them. He remarks this with a detachment so profound as to give his observations a patronizing air---one may charitably hope that they never fell under the eye of contemporary feminism...\\" (Pg. 100-101)Nock asserts, \\"He was for control of government by the producing class: that is to say, by the immense majority which in every society actually applies labor and capital to natural resources for the production of wealth. His instincts reacted ... against anything that menaced that interest.\\" (Pg. 116) He observes, \\"Economy furnished Mr. Jefferson a good pretext for indulging his inveterate dislike of ceremonial formalities.\\" (Pg. 155) John Randolph said of him, \\"He, sir, was the only man I knew or ever heard of, who really, truly, and honestly, not only said 'Nolo episcopari,' but actually refused the mitre.\\" (Pg. 157)Nock also records, \\"When he left the Presidency, Mr. Jefferson was about twenty thousand dollars in debt... Mr. Jefferson died in the belief that his debts were taken care of, and his family assured of a permanent home at Monticello... But within six months [of his death] most of his personal property was sold for debt, and all of it within a year... His daughter and her family were turned out of their home... and Monticello was alienated for a century, to serve as an object of idle sentiment and yet more idle curiosity to generations which its builder knew not, and which knew not him.\\" (Pg. 196, 200)Not the most \\"scholarly\\" or comprehensive biography of Jefferson, this will be of most interest to those who are sympathetic to Nock's views."},{"Title":"Mother Teresa of Calcutta","review":"This commemorative volume is the authorised work by Sunita Kumar that the Missionaries of Charity sanctioned. In memory of the going home of Mother to God, one year after, this is a fitting tribute to the greatest lady of our time and truly a living Saint. Sunita Kumar, as a Co-Worker, knew Mother for many years and fittingly put this knowledge and familiarity to use here. She writes of the work that Mother has done, fills us in on important dates in Mother's life and also features pictures that have rarely been seen. The black and white photographs serve to depict the intensity in Mother's visage yet still beaming with love and affection when tending to the poor. The coloured photographs provide a vivid and graphic look at the work which is overflowing with love and faith. Clear and concise captions take us through the photographs and show us just what the work was about. From photographs of Mother back in Albania as a child to her work among the poor to her receiving the Nobel Peace Prize to the pomp and circumstance of the state funeral accorded to her, all these are mere representations of the person that was Mother.

It tricks you into thinking that there are Irish wedding traditions, and I could not even find one. I am from Australia marrying into an Irish family and I wanted to surprise them with some Irish traditions in the wedding, but now I am unable to do that. I do not recomend this book to anybody. If it is Irish traditions that you want, you are not going to get them in this book."},{"Title":"The Irish Wedding Book","review":"As a wedding consultant here in California I am often asked to help plan traditional weddings for couples whose families come from other lands. Ireland is a favorite of mine because of the depth of tradition the people of Ireland share. Ms McGuires' book has become my &quot;Special&quot; resource. Her little book for planning an Irish wedding is a wonderful guide, peppered with traditional as well as contemporary ideas for Irish weddings. I only hope that she will write an expanded version soon."},{"Title":"The Irish Wedding Book","review":"I went looking for a book that would help me incorporate Irish traditions into my wedding and came across this on Amazon. I was very pleased because the book not only explained the traditions, but also how to incorporate them into the modern wedding. It just made the whole day a little different ... from the Claddagh design we put on the invitations to the Mead that we served at the reception.I also like the fact that the book wasn't too volumnous. It is a manageable size that you can stick in your handbag for reference when you're on the way to meet your caterers or florist. The author writes in a very straightforward style and offers guidelines that are easy and realistic to follow.So I recommend it highly to anyone who wants to add an Irish touch to their special day."},{"Title":"The Irish Wedding Book","review":"I came upon Kim's book while desperately searching for information on Irish wedding traditions. I was delighted to discover that her book contains not only Irish wedding traditions, but also interesting wedding traditions from many cultures. I was in the unusual position of planning two ceremonies, one in Ireland and one in the States,with little background on how to accomplish either task. Kim's book has been a lifesaver! It is fun and interesting to read, and offers excellent advice, guides, and money-saving tips. If you are getting married ANYWHERE...buy the book, it'll be one of your best investments!"},{"Title":"The Irish Wedding Book","review":"Although Ms. McGuire provides excellent general wedding advice and helpful hints, I purchased the book in hopes of learning more about Irish wedding traditions. As an American planning a wedding in County Clare, Ireland, I found the book all too similar to the typical American wedding planner - with &quot;$&quot; replaced with &quot;&quot;. If you are looking for specifics on Irish traditions and fokelore, look elsewhere. If you need a very well put together general wedding planner, this is terrific."},{"Title":"The Irish Wedding Book","review":"I purchased The Irish Wedding Book last year while organizing my wedding. Not only was Ms. McGuire's book interesting, but it also got me to the church on time with a few dollars in my pocket! I found the money saving ideas to be useful, as I was on a tight budget. I also found chapter 10 &quot;A Great Reception&quot;, to be helpful in walking through the day's events. I recommend any bride-to-be to purchase this book. Ms. McGuire covers every aspect of planning a wedding."},{"Title":"The Irish Wedding Book","review":"Fully expecting a book rich with Irish customs, lore, and enchantment about weddings, I was unexpectedly disappointed.

How very, very, sub-par."},{"Title":"The Irish Wedding Book","review":"I found this book great. It gave us great confidence in planning our wedding as it covered just about everything. In the months leading up to our big day both my fiance and parents read it. It was a great help to us all and took the \`hassle' out of the event. My copy has been passed from friend to friend and all have been delighted with it. I would recommend it to anyone, regardless of what type of wedding they wish to have. This is a great book from someone who obviously understands how memorable we all want our wedding day to be."},{"Title":"Silhouette Christmas Stories 1991","review":"From the back cover:A MEMORABLE NOEL by Phyllis HalldorsonIt was just before Christmas when San Francisco police Captain Gregor Remington discovered a woman who'd been dazed from a blow to the head that had stolen her memory. \\"Noel\\" had the face of an angel, and in her distress she needed him--and he needed her. But then another man laid claim to her...I HEARD THE RABBITS SINGING by Peggy WebbLawyer John Davis had little time for the holidays, until an emergency call from Uncle Roscoe sent him rushing home. But instead of finding Roscoe on his deathbed, his aged uncle was out decking the halls with pretty schoolteacher Ruth Mobely! Suddenly, John suspected Roscoe was engaged...in some matchmaking mayhem!DREAMING OF ANGELS by Naomi HortonWhen Kathleen Langford Ramsey was informed that her husband was in the hospital in critical condition, she rushed over--even though she'd left him six months earlier. He'd married her only to save their failing ranches, but she'd made the mistake of falling in love. Now would any of her Christmas dreams come true?THE CHRISTMAS BRIDE by Heather Graham PozzessereWhen Jason McCready and Cary Adams were thrown together on a Yuletide skiing trip meant to please their children, they struck sparks off each other immediately. Then they realized that the fire burning between them was more than mere chemistry. It was the harbinger of a love that would warm them through the holidays...and beyond.And my review:A MEMORABLE NOEL wasn't actually all that memorable, or engrossing. I've read lots of amnesia plot books, and this one was just another dime-a-dozen story. I felt that the romance was very rushed, and the heroine a bit weak. She just got a bit irritating after a while. It was like she couldn't decide between being an independant woman or a weak, clingy one, so instead she flip-flopped between the two. I was never able to get through this novella. Two stars.I HEARD THE RABBITS SINGING was a typical \\"matchmaking relative\\" romance. It was cute, but nothing special. While it had some parts I liked, for example, the kid in the Christmas play saying that \\"Mary plundered the words in her heart\\" (instead of pondered), it also had parts that came across as downright silly. For example, the hero comes in with straw in his hair and clothes (from being in the barn). When the heroine points it out to him, he leers at her and says, \\"I'd like to roll in the hay with you.\\" And she of course melts for him. Uh...yeah. If that was supposed to be sexy, it failed utterly, because it came across as lame and cheesy. If some guy had ever used such a ridiculously lame innuendo with me, I'd either have slapped his face or laughed in it. Still, I did manage to finish this novella, so I'll give it three stars.DREAMING OF ANGELS was the stand-out story in this anthology. It was a lovely story of estranged spouses reconciling, and was very well done. I liked how the author gave the back-story woven in with the present situation using the character's memories. I really connected with the characters, and was rooting for them to get together. This book reminded me a lot of John Johnston's \\"Bitter Creek\\" series (and I mean that as a high form of praise!). I actually had tears in my eyes by the time I finished this book, and for an author to be able to accomplish that kind of an emotional response from a reader in less than 100 pages is an amazing feat. Very few authors have been able to do that with me, but this one did. It was this story that made the book worth the money I spent on it. Well done, Ms Horton. Five stars!THE CHRISTMAS BRIDE was a big let-down, especially after such an enjoyable novella. I've tried books by Heather Graham Pozzessere (later published as Heather Graham and Shannon Drake) and have yet to be able to finish one. I can never connect with the characters she writes, not even the children, who often seem like flat plot devices instead of real people. I find that this is an author who uses lust to draw her characters together, rather than love. And that just won't satisfy me. I need real, deep feelings, not just flying hormones if I'm going to cheer a couple on. I'm afraid that this novella was no exception, and I wasn't able to make myself finish it. Two stars.While there's only one story that's well worth the read, I think it's good enough to recommend this novella because of it. Read Naomi Horton's DREAMING OF ANGELS and skip the rest."},{"Title":"Longman Photo Dictionary of American English, New Edition (Monolingual Student Book with 2 Audio CDs)","review":"The picture book and CD are great, it teach everyday thing to people who wants to learn english.

Going through the pull-downs was difficult in my case so I would have liked to see a summary of commands. I also wish there was a list of hot keys like they have for the tools.

They are not perfect though.Before I read this book, I really didn't know much about Illustrator but I am a Photoshop professional. I had no problem getting into the software but this book helped out a great deal.The tutorials in this book are simple and easy to follow. The only problem I have with the tutorials is that in fact they are too simple and do not go into more advance techniques that can be done with Illustrator. For example, the chapter on the uses of using the Gradient Mesh tool could of went into more about that tool. I found when using it, I can create detailed illustrations like a face for example. Also, I found myself skipping chapters because I was already familar with the tool since I knew how to use it in Photoshop. Some chapters I just skimmed and worked at a faster pace. Some of these tutorials read very slow and if your the kind of person that just likes to see what the tool is used for and then you use it the way you need to, you'll be skimming chapters as well.This book also has a whole chapter on using Illustrator to create websites, buttons, rollovers, and links via using Illustrator. The sample website the book goes over is what anyone will need if you're interested in using vector art on the web. What is sad is this book never covered using Illustrator and Macromedia Flash together, which is very possible.The CD included comes packed with very nice vector art which is used in all the chapters. Nicely organized too and shows off what you can do with Illustrator.Overall, this book definally helped me out since I never used Illustrator before I purchased the book. If you're an advanced Illustrator user, you don't need this book at all. If you're a beginner, I definally recommend this book. It helped me become for familar with drawing vector graphics, the difference between raster and vector art, and printing issues using CMYK and RGB palettes."},{"Title":"Adobe(R) Illustrator(R) 8.0 Classroom in a Book","review":"I've been using Illustrator lightly for years and always wanted to learn more about it but was studying other stuff.

I dearly wish that more volumes were available. As it is, I want dearly to buy a second copy of this one as well as Volume 1 (to replace my now somewhat dog-eared and damaged from years of being poured overe for hours at a time), if I can find another copy of Vol. 1.I unhesitantly, heartily recommend this work for the library of any Star Trek (emphasis on the Kirk, Spock & company-era movies) enthusiast, especially if you (or they) are interested in the type & quality of information that allow you to absorb what's offered in the books and, at your heart's desire, extrapolate from what's already there into your own overview of what would be happening in the Star Trek: The Movies universe including such things as \\"how would I employ these assets in how I choose to intrepret the social, political and military environment in this era?\\"What else can I say?

Ms. Milner is to be commended for her ability to draw attention to issues in the school system that children face on a daily basis. This book should be read not only by parents and children but educators, ministers and mentors for children.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Children of Plains Estates","review":"Claudette Milner's novel, Children of Plains Estates is the perfect definition for the melting pot called \\"America.\\"The story unfolds among the children and parents of Plains Estates subdivision. There are two schools that these middle aged children attend, Radcliffe the prestigious private school and Glendale public elementary. The author reveals the differences, fears, and challenges of these families through the eyes of the children. In spite of their diversities, the children develop close friendships, which cause them to share the family secrets with one another. The parents concern for their own children cause them to bond and seek solutions for these problems, for the sake of the children.During several community and school activities, it is discovered that Debbie's mom is an alcoholic, Rita has sickle cell, Tammy is adopted, and Stacey, a Radcliffe student has aids. Also one of Radcliffe's top athlete's is dealing drugs! To add insult to injury, the school board has allowed the enrollment of an African-American student as well.The camaraderie of Plains Estates awakened past memories for this reviewer. As a child growing up in a metropolitan city, we had block units. These block units were established and comprised by parents in the community who organized committees, supervised protection, and planned activities for the youth. We, as neighbors, knew each other well and watched out for one another. Presently I have lived in my house for over six years and only know the first names of those that live on either side of me. Whereas in the past one not only knew his neighbors first and last name, but also people were less fearful and more trusting of one another with higher moral values.In comparison, today people are overly cautiously related to high crime, increase use of drugs and decrease of moral values.The author brilliantly uses simplistic views and emotions of children to expose \\"our\\" prejudices, bigotries, and unfounded apprehensions based on lack of knowledge and understanding of cultural, racial, physical, and psychological differences.I applaud you Ms. Milner, this novel; \\"Children of Plains Estates\\" could easily be viewed as the poster child for diversity training. It causes one to reflect on what individual adjustments can be made to ensure peaceful harmony in the face of diversity.Reviewed by Juanita Reynolds"},{"Title":"Children of Plains Estates","review":"Children of Plains Estates is a multicultural book that focuses on issues concerning juvenile readers.

Hardly a day passes that I don't think of it because my kids are often saying, &quot;I can't...&quot; and my response is always, &quot;I can't, said the ant...try, said the fly...&quot; My mother also read this book with me, and as both my parents have passed away the story will be more meaningful. Now if I can just keep it in decent condition!"},{"Title":"I Can't Said the Ant","review":"My grown daughters were broken-hearted at finding I Can't Said the Ant was out of print. We tried to recall the most memorable rhyming pairs-&quot;How bleak&quot; said the leek; &quot;She'll die&quot; said the fly; &quot;I can't bear it&quot; said the carrot; &quot;You must&quot; said the crust...incredibly, they were able to remember, with much laughter, many of the phrases they would use in other contexts for 30 years. Now they want to share with their own children the tale of Miss Ant who, as the story begins is a powerless creature witness to an accident involving the teapot, and emerges, thanks to the support, both verbal and physical, of the kitchen residents, as the savior of the teapot. &quot;Polly, put the kettle on; we'll all have tea!&quot;Let's get this book back in the hands of the deprived children of this generation!"},{"Title":"I Can't Said the Ant","review":"You know I was sitting here going though a book order form from my daughters school and I remembered when I used to get them when I was in kinergarten. Which got me to thinking of my favorite book, I always checked out when my mom would take me to the public library, &quot;I Can't Said The Ant&quot;. I would sit there for hours reading the story and enjoying the rhyming all the way through... :) I wish I had boughten a copy of it when I was younger, and I am also sad to hear it is out of print, such a wonderful book for kids should be brought back to print.

My sister and I LOVED this book as children and I inherited the copy for my now 3 year old. He loves it!!! It is so battered though, I need to (hopefully) find a better one. I have read that rhymes are one of the greatest ways to teach reading and word structure, (etc, etc!) and I think this proves it. I start each phrase and my son will finish it. That's the ticket said the.....cricket!!"},{"Title":"I Can't Said the Ant","review":"When I was quite young I read this book over &amp; over again!

Over time, the book became tattered (from excessive reading) and then lost. The last time I remember seeing my book was when I was 5 years old, (I will be 35 soon). Periodically, over 30 years I have searched for this book as it was my favorite. Both my mom and I, like many of the other reviewers, have used phrases from the book from time to time. For example: When she asked me to do something, I would jokingly say &quot;I can't said the ant&quot;, to which she would reply &quot;Please try said the pie&quot;.

My 7th grade class in the Philippines (yes! this book went that far) performed this story in front of the entire school and we just absolutely loved doing it.

I can still feel the buzz as we approached &quot;rehearsal time&quot;. We have been having reunions for many years now (we're in our mid-40s now) and we still have a blast &quot;reading&quot; the book from memory.

The pictures are very well done.. maybe a little more \\"adultlike\\" as they have such great detail, but lack color. I appreciated the art much better as an adult.

The book was in excellent condition. It looked brand new. I am really pleased with this purchase."},{"Title":"I Can't Said the Ant","review":"A little story about how the whole kitchen helps out to help a teapot that fell and broke. Each line is a rhyme and there are many lines. Simple illustrations teach what each kitchen item is."},{"Title":"I Can't Said the Ant","review":"ISBN 0590020498 - I can't seem to go used book shopping without tripping over copies of this book, so I'm quite surprised to read so many Amazon reviewers having difficulty finding it (not to mention that it's available ON Amazon, for a penny!).A teapot falls to the floor of the kitchen and must be hoisted back onto the counter. All of the kitchen's inhabitants - from foods to pots and pans, even the trash - chime in, in rhyme, with advice and encouragement as, with assistance from other ants and some spiders, the storyteller saves the day.Author and illustrator Polly Cameron's book continues, decades after it was written, to delight children and their parents. The rhyme is perfect and lodges in your mind for a long, long time ' \\"That's the ticket,' said the cricket. \\"What a show!\\" said the dough...' very hard to forget - and who would want to? This is a fun book, an easy read and an excellent way to introduce new words and the concept of rhyme to your young reader. The illustrations are a bit boring by today's standards; all red, much like those wood-block cutouts of old, or more modern stamps, but this is one book where the illustrations aren't even remotely important.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"I Can't Said the Ant","review":"Not only is this book super clever, but a great way to teach your kid's about rhyming. It also is a good tool for character study as most of the characters are caring, concerned, and encouraging, and work together to fix their broken teapot friend. We got this book when my daughter was three. She loved it then, and now at 4 1/2 still likes it, and I suspect it will be a favorite for quite awhile."},{"Title":"America's coming-of-age","review":"I was very disappointed upon receiving this item to realize it was a facsimile of a marked-up library copy. i knew something was up with the weird cover (not a US image).

The organization is intuitive. Each species treatment is thorough and the photography is top notch. This user highly recomends this book."},{"Title":"Florida Wildflowers in Their Natural Communities","review":"This reference guide is nicely divided into 8 terrestrial communities: Pine Flatwoods, Sandhills and Clayhills, Scrubs, Temperate Hardwood Forests, Coastal Uplands, Rockland Pinelands, Rockland Hardwood Hammocks, and Ruderal Sites. Each community is described and further subdivided. The descriptions and pictures of the typical plants in each community are are good and nicely organized."},{"Title":"Florida Wildflowers in Their Natural Communities","review":"This guide gives a good overview of the plant communities and the wildflowers found in them, as opposed to being a field guide whose only purpose is plant identification. The arrangement by community is very handy, and there are many fine photos. While you will get a nice education on habitat from this book, the lack of a key may be off-putting to some people.The missing key does force one to know what community he or she is in (which is the point of the book) and then requires flipping through the pictures, which makes the book a bit unwieldy for me to use in the field. Since I can finally use a key fairly well, I will likely use Taylor's guide as a supplement to my favorite keyed guide."},{"Title":"Florida Wildflowers in Their Natural Communities","review":"I like to take this book in the field. The organization allows me to quickly scan what flowering plants I can expect to see in the habitat I'm in. This is especially useful for a lay person who doesn't yet know how to identify family or genus by sight."},{"Title":"Florida Wildflowers in Their Natural Communities","review":"This book is very limited. You have to look at each page to ID the flower. Some pictures are not very clear, and some do not show the leaves. If the plant you look at is not excatly like the book's pix you can't be 100% sure of the plant's ID."},{"Title":"Florida Wildflowers in Their Natural Communities","review":"I live on the Treasure Coast of Florida (between Sebastian and Hobe Sound) and up till now I relied on various websites to help me ID plants. Because this method of searching is very time consuming I thought it was time to invest in a field guide.Armed with 20+ plants already identified I used these as my starting point. My search through the index of this book concluded with 3 listings out of 20+ plants. Such low results are a tremendous disappointment!While time consuming, I will return to the internet for more current and accurate plant identifications."},{"Title":"Florida Wildflowers in Their Natural Communities","review":"Very good reference and wonderful photos!

Well written easy reading. A great array of period pictures, blueprints, and sketches. Concisely organized and well presented. What I enjoyed most about this book was that it not only covers the chronology and naval actions of the period, it also discusses life at sea and how the fleets and ships operated. Particularly interesting are the essays on The ship of the line, 36 and 28 gun frigates and smaller craft with line drawings and pictures of the class of vessel. An excellent book for Naval Historians, ship modellers, and Naval war gamers."},{"Title":"Fleet Battle and Blockade: The French Revolutionary War 1793-1797 (Chatham Pictorial Histories)","review":"Excellent book, with a good blend of art and history. Each picture is explained in text with associated historical and artistic caveats. For the price I guess you couldn't expect color pictures though I think a few would add to the quality of the book and perhaps add to the cost. With color it would have been 5 stars and a bargan. Mr. Gardiner's books have never disappointed me, and I have a few."},{"Title":"Fleet Battle and Blockade: The French Revolutionary War 1793-1797 (Chatham Pictorial Histories)","review":"Ive been a buff for this period of naval history for years. This book fills in many of the gaps left by other, also good books. I would recomend this book for anyone interested in the British habit of winning battles and why they could. Wonderful artwork blended with fascinating facts and detail. I learned much about the period and even felt sometimes what it was like to be there.A must have for your collection !"},{"Title":"I Can't Tell You","review":"The majority of books I have read in my life, have all been based upon the front cover. I can't tell you, that this book is different then the other ones (did you like that play on words), I was attracted to the slick cover, and but of course its bright neon green color. What would stop me from putting this book in my hands, absolutely nothing. Although it took me about half the book to understand the format of it, before I started to appreciate it. I can't tell you written by Hillary Frank takes to new levels. A story between best friends is told through letters, napkin writings, white board notes, anything that the author could think of. I recommend reading this book to experience something new, something creative, and fresh.In all, I enjoyed this book, I continued reading until I could find out what would happen between best friends Xandra and Jake. I was engaged with the same problem, a problem of having to be 'just friends' but I am sure everyone has had the same problem. Whether they be the ones making sure to stay as just friends or wanting to be more the just friends.The problem with this book, is that it just ends. I understand why authors do this, but it is just so frustrating. I wanted more, I wanted to know what was going to happen between Jake and Xandra, will they be more then just friends, if so, it gives hope for me. I know a lot of teens deal with this problem of having to be just friends. I can't tell you, is almost like advice, maybe even a scenario of what could happen between two friends. If you have ever had this problem you would enjoy this book. If you want to learn a simple 'love story' then you would enjoy this book. Most of all, read this book to experience a new way of reading."},{"Title":"I Can't Tell You","review":"I CAN'T TELL YOU! I think this book was the best book ever.This book writen by Hillary Franks is about teenagers.This is mostly about Jake, Xandra and Jake's best friend Sean.Jake is a big talker so then he deisides to write leters to his friens and to Xandra.Jake is trying to win Xandras love by sending leteres and useing up-side down calculaters.Jake uses any type of paper or anything he finds just to write to his friens,he uses note books,composite notebook,board on Jakes door and on Xandras,paper note with orange cover , and many other things.This is probably the best book you will ever read I totaly recomend it if you are a person who like to right notes.Tise all takes place in there college in a very cold seasone (winter).Jake gets in a fight with Sean and that is because Jake and his big mouth kills it then latter Jake tells Sean all this stuff then the y latter are friends agin."},{"Title":"I Can't Tell You","review":"I Can't Tell You, a very captivating book, written by Hillary Frank, pulls the reader into the story. This book is great but can get very confusing. It is written in a very new and interesting way. The new way of writing can make the reader think in new and improved ways.I Can't Tell You is about a boy who gets in a fight with his best friend and ends up hooking up with his female friend. The story is told by notes the character and his friends write back and forth. It is really neat. This book may be great for some teenagers. Teenagers can really relate to this book in a good fashion. It puts the reader in the story."},{"Title":"I Can't Tell You","review":"This is a novel unlike any I have ever seen, but having said that (and yes, it's creative and I am sure the author is smart and witty and interesting), it is also almost inscrutable. Only a teenager who cares about very minor soap-opera, self-absorbed sorts of little things will be able to tolerate this book. It's all little notes written on greasy paper bags and stuff like that. I think teens will enjoy the fact that it's about COLLEGE kids, but what an annoying group of people-who-think-they're-so cool. It's hard to take. I can't tell you how hard to read it is..."},{"Title":"I Can't Tell You","review":"I CAN'T TELL YOU by Hillary Frank may be one of the best young adult books I've read in quite some time. It's funny, heartbreaking, and easy to relate to...and it doesn't try to glorify being a young adult or falling in love.After a huge fight with his best friend Sean, Jake decides that he can't ever get into any trouble if he just stops talking altogether. As his friendship with Sean is dying, he becomes closer to his friends Paul, Roger, and Xandra. But when Jake realizes that he doesn't just want to be friends with Xandra, things start getting a bit messy. He doesn't know how to explain himself and he doesn't know what do about it, so...he decides to do nothing.Told entirely through notes passed back and forth, I CAN'T TELL YOU is an interesting and original story. The friendships between Jake and Paul, Roger, and Xandra are all incredibly realistic, and the course of a friendship turning into unrequieted love is scarily accurate.Highly recommended.Overall grade: A+"},{"Title":"I Can't Tell You","review":"Inventive, touching, witty and just plain REAL! I work with teenagers everyday and this book does a remarkably good job of capturing their honest emotions and \\"speech\\" patterns... Usually YA lit falls short when trying to be \\"hip\\" to the current teenage culture but this one hits it right on the money. Terribly original yet a story that everyone will relate to. Keep it up, Hillary!"},{"Title":"I Can't Tell You","review":"I am writing this the morning after reading I Can't Tell You, the entire thing, front to back, etc. etc. Once I got used to the clever all-journal style of writing it was easy to just breeze by and get 190-something pages done in three hours.I liked it, as a boy who considers himself *very* masculine I find it hard to admit but, \\"I liked the love story\\" I was sweet, and largely original.But it's more than that, as a Senior in High School who keeps a journal (like the narrator), has a seething disdain for my peers (the narrator gets there around page 30) I really saw an authentic portrayal of my situation. Crazy that a woman author could do that huh?Why did I give it four stars? Because I never trust five star reviews, and you shouldn't either.Oh and the English Proffessor in the book 'speaks' exactly like mine, so while being cool, thats creepy to have Mr. S talking to me through a book I'm reading in bed.END RAMBLING"},{"Title":"I Can't Tell You","review":"\\"i can't tell you\\" by Hillary Frank is a wonderfully delicious story that will draw the reader in from the very first page. Jake is just a normal college student who after opening his big mouth in a fight with his best friend, decides that talking altogether is dangerous and a waste of time. From then all of the communication between him and his friends is through notes and messages. We then follow Jake on his hilarious journey to win the heart of Xandra and discovers the true meaning of \\"just friends\\". Highly recomended!"},{"Title":"I Can't Tell You","review":"I bought this book and read it all that day. it was really very good. I didnt even look at the cover. I just got and read it immediatly. It grabbed my attention and it was hard to put down. One of my now favorite books."},{"Title":"I Can't Tell You","review":"\\"I Can't Tell You\\" by Hillary Frank is an interesting approach to a great story. The novel does a great job creating the atmosphere of actually reading the main character's notes without getting too cheesy. Notes remain realistic and the story flows nicely. A great light read."},{"Title":"I Can't Tell You","review":"I absolutely devoured this unique book. \\"I Can't Tell You\\" is an excellent read. It is filled with humor and emotion and I felt an incredibly strong connection to the main character, Jake, and his \\"relationship\\" with his friend, Xandra. I felt and related to Jake's desperation to tell Xandra he's in love with her, and his struggle to hold her at arm's length as not to ruin their close friendship. Jake's despair over watching Xandra be with someone else and losing his best friend, Sean, is entirely realistic.Frank uses realistic teenage language, and does not try too hard to sound like a college student - in my opinion, she is right on target. The format of this novel is a little difficult to adjust to at first, but I had no problem with it later on. At times, however, I wished this book could have been written as a \\"regular\\" novel, as I strived for some details that could not be explained through Jake and Xandra writing on napkins, dry erase boards, etc. The ending of this book was also a disappointment, which is why I only give this four stars. I desperately wanted Xandra and Jake to end up together - when they didn't, I felt as if all the hope I had for them diminished, even if it seems both characters are going to be all right without each other.All in all, this was a great read and I highly suggest it."},{"Title":"I Can't Tell You","review":"I first read this book when I was 14, I am now 19, and read it about 15 times since, and it has been in the hands of about 10 of my friends. I love this book. It is interesting how it is all threw passed notes. I love the game, I used to play it all the time with friends, I just do it by myself now. I truly love this book and recommend it, and I wish Hillary Frank wrote more books."},{"Title":"I Can't Tell You","review":"Jake makes the decision to stop talking after he has fight with his best friend. During the fight he said some awful things that he can't take back. Jake thinks if he starts communicating in writing instead of talking, he will have more control of his words.I couldn't put this book down. I wondered what it would be like to communicate with written words only. Would Jake be able to survive in college with only written communication?This was a very interesting premise for a story and I enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"I Can't Tell You","review":"\\"Talking + me = trouble.\\" Though it's simple and to the point, the statement of main character, Jake Jacobson, describes most of the events in I Can't Tell You, by Hillary Frank. The novel, however short, is full of realistic occurrences, like the loss of close friends, relationships gone wrong, and learning how to cope with your mistakes. The story's ability to relate to high school and college students makes it a spectacular page turner for teens of all ages that are just looking to escape the fantasy world and unravel a realistic, relatively simple, yet enjoyable read.The plot, though basic and easy to follow is very likable and readable. Jake Jacobson, a college student, and his best friend, Sean have a falling out over a few things Jake said about Sean's previous relationship. To protect himself from losing anymore friends or making any other mistakes through speaking, Jake decides to write notes instead. Through his note writing he gets closer to his friend, Xandra, and soon he begins to think of her as more than a friend to wrestle and joke with, but as a girl he might actually love.Interesting and unique writing techniques are used by Hillary Frank in I Can't Tell You. Written entirely through notes to his friends, and to his unborn sister, it's easy to get an insight on how Jake might be feeling at any given time and therefore it's easy to become attached and to keep reading to find out if Jake will ever open his mouth again.I Can't Tell You is a quick and interesting read that I suggest all young adults pick up from their local bookstore or library, curl up in a comfortable chair and read to the end. Through romance, college life, and \\"the funny\\" I've come to find that this novel is one I've wanted to read on more than one occasion, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"In terms of pure detection-ism, this is one of the author's best books featuring Lord Peter Wimsey, debonair aristocrat and talented amateur sleuth, in partnership with Harriet Vane, successful writer of mystery novels, whom Wimsey has been pursuing doggedly since saving her from the gallows. Harriet is taking a break from work by way of a walking tour along the southwest coast and by purest accident she discovers the body of a bearded young man with a profusely bleeding cut throat atop a large stone slab on the beach below the road. Being her, she whips out her camera and documents the scene, knowing the tide is coming in and that the body will be gone before she can summon help. She gathers up the razor that appears to be the instrument of destruction and then off she goes. She soon discovers the man was a professional dancer (ballroom-type) and gigolo at a nearby resort hotel, and that the police assume the victim must be a suicide. But he doesn't seem to have had any reason to do away with himself; in fact, he was about to marry a much older woman with lots of money. Then Wimsey turns up to lend a hand, whether she wants the assistance or not, and the two decide it must be a murder -- if only because that would suit them better.Some authors seem to concentrate on one or another of the three main ingredients of a good murder mystery -- plot, characters, and narrative style -- but Sayers is one of the few who was consistently top-drawer at all three. The plot this time quickly becomes highly complex with a relatively large number of key characters and numerous red herrings -- so much so that even our two detectives have to make up lists and charts to keep everything straight. It's a useful device for the reader, too, and there's also a delightful sequence involving the solving of a playfair cipher. At the same time, the characters are fully formed and fascinating -- and not only Peter and Harriet but Antoine, Inspector Umpelty, Mrs. Weldon, and the gold-digging Miss Leila Garland. But on top of all that, there's the author's quotation-laden dialogue, her use of subtle implication instead of bald description (it makes you pause and think again about what you've just read), and her gently sardonic jabs at British types and cultural assumptions. And the solution to the whole thing was not one I expected, even though it has (eighty years later) become something of a clich&eacute;. Sayers didn't write nearly enough books about Lord Peter Wimsey to satisfy me."},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"My first encounter with Dorothy L. Sayers was the Mobile Mystery Theater series showing on PBS. I now have all three DVD's of the series (\\"Strong Poison\\", \\"Gaudy Night\\" and \\"Have His Carcase\\".) They never produced \\"Busman's Honeymoon\\" Dorothy sold the rights to Hollywood and BBC could not get them back. The Resulting movie is \\"Haunted Honeymoon\\"(1940)Naturally the TV media cannot fill in all the details that you would pick up from reading the book.So I read the book. This added more depth to the story, now I appreciate Dorothy L. Sayers more than Agatha Christie. Dorothy not only fleshes her characters out better but her side trips into philosophy and psychology make the story that much more interesting. And just when you say what is the relevance to this conversation it is wrapped up in the final solution.This is the second of the book series. The story is complete and can be used as a stand-alone story. The notorious Harriet Vane is out for a walk and takes a nap. She wakes up and finds (you guest it) a body. If not for her trusty camera, no one would believe her. As it is the authorities think it was suicide. Wimsey thinks it is murder. Naturally everyone, especially the main suspect has an airtight alibi. The real interest is the interaction between Lord Peter and Harriet.Strong Poison"},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"Carcase is a variant spelling of carcass. To be tried for murder is good publicity for a crime writer. Harriet Vane was busy.In June Harriet went on a walking tour. On a beach she discovered a corpse. The tide was coming in. She was eight miles from Wilvercombe. Harriet took pictures of the discovery, of particular interest since the body was liable to be carried away on the tide. After walking six miles she called the police and the newspapers to report the existence of the dead body.Lord Peter arrived to meet Harriet at her hotel, much to her surprise. A journalist had rung him up, it seems. The dead man had been a professional dancing partner, a police inspector told Harriet and Peter. A Mrs. Weldon, friend of the deceased man, sought Harriet's company. She claimed she and the decedent were to be married.The murder weapon was an Endicott razor with an ivory handle. Wimsey learned from a Mr. Endicott that ivory-handled ones were in short supply. The notion that a bearded man had in his possession an old-fashioned razor of good quality presented a problem.When the body came to shore there was an inquest, and the investigation of shifting identities began. As in real life, the story thread meanders.The most interesting aspect of this book is the relationship of Hariet Vane and Lord Peter Wimsey and the author's philosophy of female independence in which their relationship is cast."},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"This is a long, complex classic story which turns a lot on times and alibis all of which, of course, are completely misleading. As another reviewer has noticed, it has a marvellous cipher-breaking chapter as well as plenty more misunderstandings between poor Peter and his Harriet, who won't have him. Great twist at the end which is probably guessable if you keep your brain going while reading."},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"This is a long book compared to other cozy mysteries. The many theories that were considered, rejected, reconsidered, rejected again, etc., made for some tedious reading at times as it seemed no progress at all was being made. I skipped through much of the \\"rehashing\\" of the theories and also through the long description of the attempts to decipher the letter as I was unable to follow the reasoning, maybe because I'm not that good at puzzles. Once the solution was arrived at, the murder was proved to be well thought out and executed, but getting there seemed to take forever. I see that the next book in the series is even longer, so I hope I can follow it along a bit more easily."},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"Have His Carcase by Dorothey Sayers. This a series I love. Dorothy Sayers is always good but this is one of her best."},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"Peter Whimsey and Harriet Vane are great characters whose struggle to create and avoid respectively a relationship is very interesting to watch. Sayers seems to be able to think like a man as well as a woman.Remember that Sayers wrote in a different time and so her settings are really authentic. Perhaps the characters seem stylized by today's standards of acceptable behaviour, but it's interesting to see how much hold the British class system has over the thinking and attitudes of the upper and lower classes."},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"The second of the Harriet Vane-Lord Peter mysteries. Harriet finds herself involved in an unusual death. Is it suicide or murder? Lord Peter, gentleman detective, helps solve the case in his classic style while patiently wooing the recalcitrant Miss Vane. More than just good mystery; Dorothy L Sayers works never fail to enlighten and entertain the reader. If you love a good British detective story the Lord Peter series is must read."},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"This is one of my favorite Dorothy Sayers books -- really anything with Harriet Vane is at the top of the list -- but the Kindle edition has some significant typos. Not a ton... but at least one or two pointedly change the meaning of a sentence. If I hadn't read this book several times (dozens of times!) already, it would have been confusing."},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"the stories are vignettes of the time and place, as well as cracking good mysteries. best to read 'Strong Poison' first, then'Gaudy Night' and 'Busman's Honeymoon' after for the entire Lord Peter/Harriet Vane story. enjoy!"},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"Wonderful engaging story telling by a master story teller and master of the English language and grammar - very rare qualities when compared to what passes for literature today. Requires attention (and therefore effort) on the part of the reader but rewards richly."},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"The low star value is for the Kindle version; the book itself is one of my favorites!But this Kindle version has an unconscionable number of typographical errors, considering the price."},{"Title":"HAVE HIS CARCASE.","review":"I am in the process of reading this book for the third time, and find it absolutely delightful. Like all of Dorothy L Sayers' books, it is highly intelligent and very well written. Sayers has an uncanny insight into human psychology and also has a wonderful way of characterizing her characters -- even minor characters come across as intriguing and realistic. Sayers clearly did a lot of research for all her novels, and the amount of detail she packs into the descriptions makes the places and persons all the more engaging and the reader's experience all the more rewarding.What sets this book apart from the rest, however, is that it is here that we see the relationship between Sayers' indomitable sleuth, Lord Peter Wimsey, and the young woman he saved from the gallows in Strong Poison, the amusing contrary Harriet Vane, develop and blossom into the first stages of a real love story. Although the focus is on the mystery, the Wimsey-Vane storyline is much more than a subplot. It runs through the novel and ultimately becomes just as important as the case they are working on. In Gaudy Night, one of Sayers' masterpieces in my opinion, the love story takes center stage and it is the mystery that becomes the backdrop for its unfolding.For those who prefer mysteries to romances, however, there is nothing overly sentimental or \\"romancy\\" in the unfolding of Wimsey's and Vane's relationship. What the relationship gives Sayers is an opportunity to really gaze deeper into aspects of human psychology, and her writing is spot on. Lord Peter especially becomes a much more human character as he struggles to build a fragile relationship with Harriet, whose bruised past makes her especially prickly and sensitive to his advances.I heartily recommend this book to all. If you get a chance to see the PBS/WGBH televised series, it is also a treat!"}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:A,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},P=["disabled"],D={key:0},q={key:1};function H(s,a,n,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[a[1]||(a[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",x,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",q,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",D,"See more"))],8,P)):p("",!0)])}const B=d(C,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-68f73382"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/16.md","filePath":"quotesmag/16.md"}'),E={name:"quotesmag/16.md"},R=Object.assign(E,{setup(s){return(a,n)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(B)]))}});export{j as __pageData,R as default};
